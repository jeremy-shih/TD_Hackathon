As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Vice President, Chris Van Ens. Thank you, Mr. Van Ens, you may begin.","Chris Van Ens","Welcome to UDR's Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I'd like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to UDR's President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to UDR's Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","First, macroeconomic drivers and overall apartment fundamentals remain conducive for the continuation of strong growth for UDR in our industry. Stable job growth, combined with improving wage growth and consumer sentiment, bode well for future demand. While it is true that some new apartment supplies scheduled for delivery in 2017 have slipped into next year, current demand remains resilient and we have seen no recent signs of widespread irrational concessionary activity. Like everyone, we continue to monitor the developments in Washington, D.C. and at the Federal Reserve while being mindful that we will provide a basic necessity and demographics tailwinds are at our back.","Next, our team again produced solid results in the third quarter, driven by 4 areas of strategic focus: one, the dedicated work of our site level and corporate teams; two, our diversified portfolio along market mix and price points; three, the continued success of our long-lived, high-margin operating initiatives; and four, incremental investments in our high risk-adjusted-return Developer Capital Program.","In summary, 2017 has gone well, leading us to raise full year 2017 same-store and earning guidance ranges. Jerry and Joe will provide additional commentary on these topics in their prepared remarks. ","Next, I'd like to thank all of my UDR associates for their contribution to another great quarter and especially to those associated in our Texas and Florida markets for their dedication and commitment to helping our residents get back on track after the recent hurricanes and the focus they have shown to finish out a strong 2017.","Last, looking into 2018 and beyond, our strategic focus continues to revolve around how to best drive our business forward, getting better at what we do and continuing to grow long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing our 2018 and '19 expectations with you on our fourth quarter conference call with a release as well as the two year outlook.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jerry to address his operations.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. Year-over-year, third quarter same-store revenue and NOI growth were 3.3% and 3% respectively. After including pro rata same-store JV communities, which are heavily weighted towards urban, A+ product, revenue and NOI growth were 3% and 2.8% respectively. Year-to-date, 2017 same-store revenue and NOI growth results of 3.9% and 4% remain slightly ahead of original expectations due to our proactive operating strategy and more rational pricing on lease-ups and assorted markets.","Strategically, we remain focused on: first, retaining a larger percentage of our residents by higher growth rate renewals; second, maintaining portfolio occupancy in the high-96% range; and third, continuing to drive our long-lived, broad-based operating initiatives. Our quarterly results speak to our successful execution of these strategies.","First, third quarter renewal rate growth remained strong at near 5%, with new rate growth just above 1%, while annualized turnover declined by 140 basis points year-over-year. Our teams in the field as well as our corporate level renewal and reputation management teams deserve all the credit for generating these high-level results.","Second, same-store occupancy of 96.7% in the quarter was flat year-over-year. I'll remind everybody, the easier occupancy comps we saw in the first half of 2017 remain more difficult in the second half of the year.","And third, our revenue-generating and cost-constraining operating initiatives continue to produce fantastic results.","Other income, which makes up nearly 10% of our total revenue, grew by 12.5% in the quarter, fueled by a variety of long-lived, sustainable initiatives such as parking, short-term furnished rentals and package lockers. We anticipate a continuation of outsized future growth in our other income basket for the foreseeable future.","On the flip side, expense growth has not been as kind of late. Similar to past quarters, real estate tax and personnel costs remain our two primary pressure points. For full year 2017, we still expect real estate taxes will grow by high single digits versus 2016. On the personnel front, wage pressures continue to intensify as does demand for our people. Similar to past quarters, we are actively combating these forces through additional technological and corporate level solutions that yield greater productivity at our sites. Wage pressures do have a silver lining though, which is better potential for future rate growth.","Moving on. We see minimal pressure for move-outs to home purchase or rent increase, which totaled 12% and 5% of responses during the third quarter. Likewise, net bad debt remains low, all our levels consistent with previous quarters.","Onto a brief market update. First, Seattle, San Francisco and the Monterey Peninsula continue to outperform versus initial 2017 expectations. Demand remains resilient as wage growth has ramped up over the past year and lease-up concessions have rationalized somewhat versus 2016. Second, Washington, D.C. continues to slightly underperform but is a market that should continue to produce solid results in the years ahead. Third, after a lackluster start to 2017, Orange County is feeling slightly better. We continue to feel good about the long-term prospects of our portfolio, which is primarily located west of the 405 freeway.","Our remaining markets are generally in line with expectations. Next, our development pipeline, in aggregate, are generating lease rates and leasing velocities at or above original expectations.","With regard to Pacific City, our 516-home development in Huntington Beach, we are experiencing construction delays averaging 3 months, which have increased construction cost by 2%. These delays have also negatively impacted our ability to lease as effectively as we would like given uncertainties around firm delivery timing of amenities and apartment homes as well as the high-end nature of the targeted Pacific City resident. Positively, our achieved rental rates remain on plan.","At 345 Harrison as well as our JV developments, we remain largely on budget and on schedule. Community-specific quarter-end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 of our supplement.","Moving on. We incurred minimal damage from the third quarter hurricanes that impacted Texas and Florida. A special thanks goes out to our teams in Austin, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach. You all went above and beyond to get our properties back in working order and ensure that our residents were taken care of. We appreciate your hard work and sacrifice leading up to, during and following those storms.","Last, summing it up. The third quarter was another solid quarter as our operating platform and diversified portfolio continued to drive good results. We remain highly confident in our ability to execute through the remainder of 2017.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results and forward guidance, a transactions update, a balance sheet and capital markets update. Our third quarter results came in at the mid- to high end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO per share was $0.46, FFO as adjusted was $0.47 and AFFO was $0.43. On a year-over-year basis, AFFO was up $0.02 or 5%, driven by solid NOI growth and capital deployment opportunities.","I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 of our supplement, which details our latest guidance expectations. Full year 2017 FFO per share guidance was reduced to $1.83 to $1.85 as a result of hurricane damages incurred during the third quarter, while FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were increased by $0.02 at the low end to $1.86 to $1.88 and $1.71 to $1.73 respectively. The primary drivers of the raises were increased investment in our Developer Capital Program, fewer planned asset dispositions and stable consistent operating results.","Our full year same-store revenue growth guidance was raised to 3.5% to 3.9%, expense growth was increased to 3.1% to 3.6%, and NOI growth was increased to 3.6% to 4.2%. Average 2017 forecasted occupancy was reaffirmed at 96.7%. For the fourth quarter, our guidance ranges are $0.46 to $0.48 for FFO per share, $0.47 to $0.49 for FFO as adjusted per share and $0.42 to $0.44 for AFFO per share.","Next, transactions. Regarding our Developer Capital Program, the third quarter was a busy one with numerous transactions completed or going under contract during the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end. After accounting for subsequent acquisition activity and disposition activity, our invested balance in the DCP program is approximately $140 million at a yield of approximately 7.5%, with $79 million remaining to be funded. This program has continued to create value for shareholders as we harvest capital and stabilized investments and look for new deployment opportunities.","During the quarter, the West Coast development joint venture sold 8th & Republican, a 211-home community located in Seattle for approximately $101 million. While we liked the product and the location, the property made more economic sense as a well-priced source of capital to fund other recent DCP investments.","Second, we added 1200 Broadway in Nashville, a large mixed-use asset that will have 313 apartment homes, 65,000 square feet of office space and be anchored by a Whole Foods when complete. Our initial capital outlay was approximately $13 million, with a total funding commitment of approximately $56 million. We will earn 8% on our outstanding investment, with a share of upside upon sale of the community.","Third, subsequent to quarter-end, we purchased Steele Creek, a 218-home community located in the highly desirable Cherry Creek submarket of Denver for $141.5 million at a 4.5% nominal cap rate. We originally provided $93.5 million of financing to the developer and were entitled to 50% of the upside versus all-in construction cost upon sale of the community. Our upside participation totaled $14.9 million, resulting in an effective basis and yield of $126.5 million and 5%. Steele Creek is an A+ asset with high walkability, expansive high-end amenity areas, including a rooftop pool and 17,000 square feet of extremely well-located ground floor retail.","And last, the West Coast development joint venture placed Katella Grand, a 399-home community located in the Platinum Triangle submarket of Orange County, under contract for sale subsequent to quarter-end. The sales price is approximately $148 million and is expected to close later in the fourth quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.","Moving forward, you can expect that our capital deployment focus will remain on high risk-adjusted-return DCP investments and sourcing new land parcels to support our development pipeline. Please see attachments 12B and 13 of our supplement for further details on this quarter's transaction activity. Next, balance sheet and capital markets activity. At quarter-end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity net of the commercial paper balance was $851 million. Our financial leverage was 33.5% on an un-depreciated book value, 24.6% on an enterprise value and 29.2%, inclusive of joint ventures.","Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.4x and inclusive of joint ventures, was 6.4x. Timing will drive some variability in our quarterly credit metrics and commercial paper balance, but in total, they are tracking in line with our strategic plan. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.31 in the third quarter or $1.24 when annualized, representing a yield of approximately 3.3% as of quarter-end.","With that, I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Maybe just starting with supply, if you can talk about your expectations for '18 versus '17. And any markets that you expect to see a meaningful increase or decrease relative to this year?","Jerry Davis","Hey, Nick, this is Jerry. I'll take that one. I just want to mention a couple of things. First, as we look at supply, we rely on outside sources, predominantly Axiometrics, and then we run permit regressions for a forward supply forecast. Axio's current forecast for our submarkets in '17 is about 42,000 units. And when you look out to 2018, it goes down about 12% to 37,000 units, so a decline. That being said, as we've seen throughout '17, there have been -- there has been some slippage that could still happen in the fourth quarter of this year as well as at points next year.","When you look at specific markets where we see increases in deliveries in 2018, really, 3 stand out, the first one's New York City, the second is Los Angeles, and third is Seattle. And then we've got about 5 markets where we see declines of more than a couple of thousand homes, and that would be Nashville as the largest decline, the San Francisco-San Jose area, Dallas is also going to decline modestly, Austin is looking to decline, and then lastly, Orlando. All of the rest of them are pretty much flat.","Nick Joseph","I appreciate that. And then just in terms of turnover, you've seen it continue to trend down, but is there an opportunity to push that further down? Are we close to kind of the -- a frictional level where essentially people are going to move out because they're going to move out?","Jerry Davis","We continue to work on that. As I had in my prepared remarks, we've got an inside renewals team that has worked hard this year to really try to save as many notices to vacate or slow responders to our renewal request. We've had good traction with that. I think that team can continue to drive results. It's something that as we listen to Yelp reviews and respond to what our residents are telling us they're not happy about at our properties, we think we can continue to drive that.","What you're seeing is fewer and fewer people, at least now, moving out the home purchase. That's at about 12%, so it's still at historically fairly low levels, so you don't have that competing against you. But I'm hopeful that we can continue to drive it down even further in the next couple of years if there's some of these initiatives we've turned on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Juan Sanabria","I was just hoping you guys could give an update on how you see the urban, suburban coast over Sun Belt markets playing out into '18. Does that gap shrink, and if you could just give us a sense of how those are performing today?","Jerry Davis","Yes, I'll take that initially, Juan. This is Jerry. Right now, when we look at the past quarter on at least an A versus B ratio -- comparison, A is underperforming B at probably 50 to 100 basis points on revenue. When I look at new lease rate growth and renewals, more recently, on an urban and suburban, I think it would track fairly similarly. Right now, most of our A product is urban and the B is suburban, so I don't think there's a significant differentiation. But the suburban is continuing to outperform. I think when you look at where supply is going in the future, it is going to be a little bit less in some of our urban markets in the future, so I think it's going to tighten up a bit. I don't know, Harry, would you add anything?","Harry Alcock","No.","Juan Sanabria","And then just a question on seasonality, you guys noted maybe it came a little bit earlier this year than typical. What do you think drove that? And does that change kind of how you're trying to target lease expiration timings at all? Or how are you guys thinking about that?","Jerry Davis","No. It was just a month. I think we stated last quarter that -- and we saw the deceleration in new lease rate growth that usually starts, I think, in August, and it started in July. So it was only 1 month, but it's not going to really make us rethink lease expirations. We think we've got our LEM schedule pretty set years ago. Today, we have about 20% for leases expiring in the first and fourth quarter, and then you're right around 30 give or take, in the second, third. That feels right to us. And it can defer market-by-market, but on a national basis, I think that's the right spread to optimize revenue growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just curious, you've talked in the past about casting a wider net in terms of development opportunities across your markets, and most of the investment we've seen, I guess, in more of the Sun Belt markets has been through the Developer Capital Program. Is that just a function of the investment opportunity set that's available today? Or would you consider ground-up development in those more Sun Belt markets?","Harry Alcock","Austin, this is Harry. We consider investing, whether it's in DCP through acquisitions or through development in any of the markets in which you've just seen us investing recently, that includes the large coastal markets, then also Denver, Portland and Nashville, where, as you mentioned, we've invested in DCP recently.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then what are you seeing, I guess, across -- and maybe this is for Jerry. In D.C., blended lease rates moderated a bit there. Could you just give us a little bit of an overview of the submarket performance this quarter and what you're seeing into the fourth quarter?","Jerry Davis","Yes. When you really look at the submarkets, the B product did better, sometimes Bs and As will flip flop in D.C. A couple of quarters ago, I think we saw As which were inside the Beltway, get as strong as Bs this quarter. Our Bs were about 160 basis points higher as far as revenue growth in D.C. We're seeing quite a bit of new supply coming in the Southwest Waterfront ballpark area, where it's driving concession levels anywhere from 4 to 8 weeks. We're feeling the effects of that. And a lot of the submarkets within the district, even over at our U Street area on 14th, we had revenue growth there. It was really our worst submarket in D.C. It was at negative [2%]. And then over in the Columbia Pike area is our strongest submarket at 5.4%. So both were inside the Beltway, but that higher-end A product on 14th definitely has felt more of the effect of that new supply over by the ballpark.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","A couple of questions on development. First, as you think about new supply, competitive supply, perhaps easing in some markets next year, are you looking to increase the amount of development that you would be doing? And then how should we think about how you would get -- your dollars get weighted towards development opportunities on balance sheet versus JVs versus the Developer Capital Program?","Harry Alcock","Nick, this is Harry. I'll start then hand it over to Joe. So our goal strategically, as we've mentioned, over the past several years is to maintain the development pipeline between $900 million and $1.4 billion. However, we'll do so while maintaining a disciplined underwriting approach. It's likely that by year-end, our pipeline will be down to $800 million to $850 million. And while we're looking to backfill, we would not be surprised if our pipeline stays below the bottom end of that $900 million to $1.4 billion target through 2018, and it's really just a function of the opportunity set that we see while maintaining that disciplined underwriting.","Again, strategically, we intend to continue to backfill, but tactically, that's going to be driven by the opportunity set. Again, we're looking to invest or develop in the same markets where we've been investing recently. We look at urban, we look at suburban, and again, it's driven by the opportunity set.","Joseph Fisher","Hey, Nick, it's Joe. The only thing I'd add there, just as it relates to your DCP and joint venture question, within DCP, as mentioned, we're down to right around $140 million of exposure after the suburban activity. It's going to ramp back up to about $80 million for the additional funding for commitments we have. So we're really sitting around $120 million, which gives us a decent amount of capacity, still up to with our self-imposed limit of $300 million. So still, that's why we're looking for activity there and expecting to really do what we've been doing in terms of evaluating each deal in a disciplined manner as it comes up and consider recycling or buying that asset.","And then on the MetLife side, the most recent wave of development that's come through there has really cleaned out a lot of that land pipeline. You're really down to just the Vitruvian land in Dallas. So any future development is really probably going to be on balance sheet and not necessarily from MetLife outside of that Vitruvian deal.","Nick Yulico","And then you talked about San Francisco, San Jose, seeing supply come down next year. Is that for the entire market there? Or is it only specific submarkets that you think -- I'm trying to get a feel for where the supply is -- you think is coming down. The impact is coming down across all of San Francisco and San Jose, or if it's only specific pockets that would be, I guess, less impacted by supply.","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Nick. Hey, it's Joe just following up again on -- on San Francisco, overall, Jerry's comments related to San Francisco and San Jose combined. When we break that down into that same level, that's [going to break down] pretty similar, about 1,000 units, at least in San Francisco and San Jose. And then when we look at it within our submarket exposures, the submarket exposure for us in San Fran is down a little bit. It was down quite a bit more in San Jose. And we really don't have much exposure over in [indiscernible] just so through submarket [indiscernible]","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","I wanted to ask about the competitive asset swaps. I would assume, with B cap rates having trended down and submarkets probably still trending down and maybe some pickup in kind of the urban CBD A product, are there any markets where you might see some types of asset swap opportunities to maybe trade into more urban locations to take advantage of supply maybe waning a bit in those locations into position for the next cycle?","Harry Alcock","Drew, it's Harry. I mean, I think you'll see that we did sort of a little bit of that through DCP this year, where we bought really an irreplaceable asset in Denver, in perhaps the top location in the state, sold assets at this Platinum Triangle in Anaheim. I think we continue to look at those types of opportunities. You are right that the spreads between, call it, the B assets in suburban locations have compressed relative to the A assets in the urban locations, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities as they arise.","Drew Babin","That's helpful. And then looking at the expense outlook that was in the strategic outlook, calling for the 3% to 3% -- or 3% to 5% expense growth next year, and obviously, you're not providing an update to that right now, it would sound like real estate taxes are maybe something that's putting negative pressure on that or negative in the sense that there's going to be continued pressure. Are there any expense line items that you can talk about that have maybe improved in the asset management programs or things that we can expect expense growth to be much more benign next year?","Jerry Davis","Drew, this is Jerry. I guess I would start with when you look at controllable expenses in total this year, and I'll get to '18 in a second, for the quarter, they're only up 0.5%. So you had real estate taxes up 10% and everything else in, probably 0.5%. On a year-to-date basis, most of the other categories are up 1.2% of the total real estate taxes. So we continue to work on, I think whether it's in repairs and maintenance as well as in personnel cost to drive down growth rates there. The other thing we're consistently looking at is ways to invest ROI dollars in expense-reducing utility initiatives, such as LED lights as well as xeriscaping properties, things like that. I mean, I think, on the marketing side, we've done a good job this year of driving down marketing cost. It doesn't always look like it because there are some offsets to our short-term furnished rental program, predominantly renting the furnishings, that's driven up that after-marketing capital freeze. But I can say we're consistently working to keep non-controllable or controllable rental expenses in check because we are very aware that the real estate tax will provide the mixture that you've talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Just a follow-up on the short-term furnished rental program, I think, Jerry, you mentioned other income is 10% of revenue in the fast-growing segment, but can you break out the different buckets between the rental program versus parking and package lockers?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I can probably do it offline a little bit better on components, but you're right, it is a total NAV percent. I will tell you, of the parking for the quarter, it was up $700,000 year-over-year, so that was a significant increase. I think it was about 20 -- over 20% up. Short-term rentals, which we didn't even have in place last year, for the quarter, revenue -- the revenue component was up $1 million year-over-year, and the NOI was up about $700,000. As I stated earlier, there are some expenses that are related to this, predominantly furniture rental. So on a combined basis on the revenue side for the quarter, those 2 were making about $1.7 million of the increase.","John Kim","And how big do you want that to be -- or how big can it be? Is it an Airbnb-driven business, and is it sprinkled throughout your portfolio or just certain assets?","Jerry Davis","First, it's not Airbnb. It's over 31-day rentals, so it's not short-term. The average term actually is 79 days. It's not even just 31 days. It is spread throughout the portfolio, although I'll tell you that the major concentrations are in some of our urban markets. About 35% of the programs in San Francisco, 24% is in Boston, and then 11% is in Orange County. So those 3 markets make up almost 2\/3 of the program. I won't say we'll hold strong for this, but we do try to keep the exposure in any individual property to no more than about 1% or 2% of the product there. If it was a property that was in lease-up, where we have plenty of availability we'll go ahead, knowing that when those units do turn, we can put them back into 12-month rentals.","John Kim","Okay. And then on the sale of 8th & Republican, it seems like a great location. It sounds like the union -- the joint venture didn't really sell it for much of a profit. So why not exercise the purchase option rather than sell the asset?","Joseph Fisher","Yes, hey, John, it's Joe. I guess I'd go back to what we're trying to imply in my opening remarks, which is it's just a well-priced source of capital. So as you know, as we look at the overall first wave of these investments, stepping back, we've had 4 come up this year, it means CityLine, Steele Creek, 8R and Katella, of those 4, we're going to end up selling 2 and buying 2. So the program's doing about what we expected from that respect. Overall, you end up with a couple of home runs in Steele Creek and CityLine and a couple of singles in the other 2. But blending that, you're going to get into the right IRR of plus or minus 10%. So when you look at why sell 8R, you're correct, we like the submarket, like the asset, but we happen to like Steele Creek better.","So when we look at the ability to source capital in the mid-4s coming out of Katella and 8R and going into a blended 5% on Steele Creek and a 4.5% on the $141.5 million price, you end up with a better IRR over time. And if we had a better cost of capital or more opportunities to sell assets, 8R could have been a purchase. But that's the way it played out when we played the capital against each other and the IRRs against each other.","John Kim","And can you just remind us of the mechanics of the preferred return on that? So you get the 6.5% during the construction phase, and then you share 49% of the profits on sale?","Joseph Fisher","Correct. So you have a 6.5% press up until we reach 80% stabilized for 3 consecutive months. At that point in time, you're going to go to a cash flow split based off the ownership interest. And then upon sale, you're correct, we're going to receive our ownership percentage if we sell it. And if we exercise our option price, we'll be pricing it at that option price.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Continuing on the, just the line of questioning on the Developer Capital Program, we obviously heard about some banks pulling back on construction lending, which provides a pretty meaningful opportunity for you, guys, which I think is resonating in your results. But I'm curious, how do you think about underwriting these construction loans? Is it really all about the property and location of the property? Or are you thinking about the -- effectively your borrower as well? I'd love to just get a little bit more detail on how you're thinking about underwriting them.","Joseph Fisher","Look, as we said all along, the asset ultimately has to be an asset that we want to own in a submarket and a market that we want to own. So it comes down to a real estate underwriting position because we do have backside participation in a number of these deals. We have an option price on the West Coast development joint venture deal, so you have to underwrite it from a real estate equity perspective, not necessarily a lender's perspective. At the same time, you do want to think about it from a lender's eye in terms of what your rights are if the deal goes south. So you're kind of looking at it from that perspective as well. So you're kind of looking at it from both ways, but ultimately, you got to think about it as a deal that we want to own and therefore, a real estate underwriting.","Harry Alcock","And I think I just -- I'd just add that if you think about the investment the REIT holds between an acquisition and a development on risk-return continuum, where you have some development exposure in terms of the lease results, but we get paid the 6.5% through the development lease-up periods, with no schedule or cost risk. And in the case of Wolff, we have a fixed-price option in the future. So it really is kind of a hybrid.","Rich Hill","And at the risk of asking a 2018 guidance question, is sort of your activity in 2017 reflective of how we should be thinking about it going forward? Or do you think that's -- this is a program that you'll see more opportunity in, in the future as other lenders start to pull back a little bit more?","Joseph Fisher","Yes, Rich, I think the activity you saw this year is what we would like to do and accomplish with the program. But at the end of the day, it's going to be very opportunity-specific. As long as we keep constraints on ourselves in terms of making sure it's an asset that we want to own, that's going to limit the pool of investors to some degree. In addition, as you've seen, new starts and new supply are expected to start coming off in '18 and '19, so that's going to limit the pool of opportunities as well. So we're going to remain active in trying to find deals and source deals that meet the underwriting standards, but not a guarantee that we're going to develop through this volume of activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","I was looking at your development summary and I noticed, with the exception of Dallas, you really turned off the development spigot pretty aggressively a couple of years ago. So my first question is why. And then when I look at your land position, it looks like, excluding Dallas, you really only have 200 or 300 units, Boston and Dublin, California, of entitled land ready to go. And so I'm sort of wondering, I understand the land focus, but I also know that hard costs are going up greater than rental rates, yield on development is coming down, land prices haven't yet adjusted down. Are you optimistic that you can refill the land bucket and start up your development anytime soon?","Harry Alcock","John, this is Harry. I think as I mentioned earlier, our goal strategically is maintaining our development pipeline between $900 million and $1.4 billion. However, we'll do so while maintaining a disciplined underwriting approach. We're going to maintain our target 150 to 200 basis points spread to market cap rates. And so what you see is that our development pipeline has come down a bit. I think we'll end the year a little over $800 million. We're actively looking to backfill for 2018 and 2019 starts, but my expectation is that given the opportunities, that our pipeline will fall below the low end of that $900 million to $1.4 billion for at least the next several quarters.","John Guinee","Do you think maybe 150 to 200 basis points spread is too aggressive?","Joseph Fisher","You mean, in terms of you think we're being too conservative, which I don't think we'd agree necessarily that we need to adjust our underwriting standards just to maintain a strategic view of development pipeline. The pipeline is going to be an output of wanting to accept our cost of capital. So if returns impress we can always walk away and it's only what we have to do, and development is not something that we absolutely have to do. We can pull back on dispositions and not move forward at the bottom line. So I think maintaining on this on underwriting is probably the appropriate path forward, not necessarily driving the main development pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pete Peikidis with Zelman & Associates.","Pete Peikidis","Jerry, I appreciate the market-level detail on leasing trends in the supplement. Could you just share or speak to new lease and renewal growth trends for October in New York and what you're seeing heading into November?","Jerry Davis","Yes. In New York, new lease rates currently are, for October, are right around negative 2%. So it's dropped off from the quarter, just following typical seasonal trending that we've seen over the past couple of years where you see a downward threat from third quarter into fourth quarter, so it's not overly surprising.","Pete Peikidis","And just given the relative strength in Orlando and Tampa? And understanding that you expect supply to moderate in Orlando next year, are you expecting the pricing to keep pace through the end of the year? And are there any risks that rising rents to your assets start becoming more competitive with the overall market in newer product? Or is there still a sufficient buffer there?","Joseph Fisher","Hey, Pete, could you just step back a second? You kind of broke up there at the beginning of your question and we missed that. Could you just repeat the first half?","Pete Peikidis","Just given the relative strength in Orlando and Tampa, I guess I was just looking for some further color on pricing expectations here through the end of the year and sort of if there's a risk that pricing of your asset start become more competitive with the overall market. Or is there still sufficient buffer there in Tampa and Orlando?","Jerry Davis","I would say this, as you look at where October is in Orlando, we've actually seen new lease rates go north of 6%. So Orlando has improved. I think some of that is potentially due to the influx of people affected by the hurricanes. Tampa, however, it's seen more normal seasonal trends. New lease rate growth in Tampa, so far this quarter, is a little bit under 2%. So as far as rates, if your question is are they competing with new supply, I think they're still an adequate spread between our B assets, which is what we typical, for the most part, have in our Florida properties, to the A assets there. Job growth has slowed a bit or wage growth has in Orlando, job growth is still strong. But I think those properties will continue to do well, especially when you factor in what I said earlier about some of those Florida markets are showing less deliveries next year than we have this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","First question is on the Developer Capital Program, how do you guys incorporate or mitigate the growing delays in construction so as to not impact the returns that you guys hope to achieve?","Harry Alcock","Alex, its Harry. We have no schedule or cost for it still. Any overruns are borne solely by developer. That includes schedule or a cost. And to the extent there are delays, the net impact really is that that we continue to collect our coupon, our 6.5% for longer.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Okay. Then that's helpful. And then the second question is, Denver, I don't think I heard you guys talk about it before, but clearly, it's a new favorite market for the apartment REITs. You guys obviously took down Steele Creek. Can you just talk a little bit about your home market and your expectation for investment? Do you see the same opportunity there or across others of your market? Do you see better opportunity elsewhere?","Harry Alcock","Alex, it's Harry. I'll start to talk about investment. Maybe Jerry can talk about the sort of operating environment. As I mentioned before, with -- our goal is to continue to focus our investment activity, whether its development, DCP or acquisitions in the markets where we've been investing in the recent past, the large coastal markets, but also Denver, Portland, Nashville and then Dallas with Vitruvian Park. So we view Denver as an attractive investment market. Again, we invested in Steele Creek back in late 2013 and now in 2017, have completed the acquisition. So it continues to be a market that we like, along with the other markets that I mentioned.","Jerry Davis","Yes, I would just add, Alex, now Steele Creek, for the people who are not familiar, is in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, which is probably the top neighborhood in the whole city, really irreplaceable location directly across right the Cherry Creek Mall. As Joe stated in his prepared remarks, exceptional first floor retail there. I'd point out it's got a walk score of 95, so it is definitely the place to live. You're looking at rents that are pretty high for the Denver market, at about $330 a foot. They're large floor plans.","Average square foot is about 955 to 960 square feet, so average rents are north of $3,000. But right now, whether it's downtown Denver or over in Cherry Creek, you're going against a pretty significant new supply. I think that's because they're building in areas where most of the people in Denver would prefer long-term to live. And I think when we get through this supply. This deal is going to be even better than it is today. But again, exceptional location, quality product and it's a product that we've been running for the last 2 years, so there's probably little surprises that we're going to find out about.","Alexander Goldfarb","So Jerry, does that mean once the supply comes down in Denver, you guys may ramp up? Or are you looking to increase investment even while there is the new supply wave going on?","Harry Alcock","Again, the -- our investment activity within our target markets is heavily influenced by the opportunity set. So we clearly would invest in Denver, either in development DCP or acquisitions, to the extent the opportunities presented themselves. As we mentioned, Steele Creek, in an irreplaceable location, Jerry just went through some detail. And again, I think from a pricing standpoint, Steele Creek compares favorably to sort of the cap rates that you're seeing on the suburban product that's trading in Denver, just as we talked about earlier, partially a function of these high-end core products being relatively out-of-favor with the capital that's chasing the assets compared to the flat fee product.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will resume momentarily. Please stand by. [Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Jerry, the pace of deceleration in renewal growth in the past few years has been quite modest, so the gap between renewals and new leases has widened. Do you expect the pace of deceleration to pick up in '18 for renewals specifically?","Jerry Davis","At this point, I don't see any evidence that would happen. Like you said, a year ago, when I look at what renewal rate growth was in October, it was 5.1%. So right now, we're high 4s. So it really hasn't dropped dramatically. And again, at this point, I think rent growth has continued to go up modestly for the REITs. If you look at Axiometrics' studies, it shows that we're going up about 1% compared to about 2% on a national basis probably because of the quality and locations of our assets. But you're seeing rent to income levels stay steady. For us, it's about 24%. So I don't see it compressing at this point, but we're going to have to see what happens as the year progresses. But it really has remained stable, as we mentioned, over the last couple of years.","John Pawlowski","Okay. What specific markets are you seeing the most strain on pricing power due to affordability reasons, either move out to rent increase or move out to buy homes?","Jerry Davis","Really, on the rent increase, it's typically been places like San Francisco where you'll feel some of that pressure. It's not as acute as it was a year or 2 ago as rents haven't gone up at that level. But really, mostly there, there's not a lot on move-outs to rent increase that jump off of the page at the outside of those locations. The move-outs to home purchase, really, there's only 3 markets that we have right now over that we're about to give that as the reason for leaving: Boston, Richmond and Portland. When you get over 15%, you're moving into the Sun Belt markets. But when you get into the rest of the coastal markets, move out to home purchase is under 10%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","So I don't know if I missed this earlier, but can you, guys, give a really quick rundown of October to-date data? I know you've talked about it with a couple of markets, but just maybe a little bit deeper in that sense.","Jerry Davis","I think instead of giving a detailed rundown of October by market, we can give you that after the call individually. But when you -- overall though, I will tell you that we went from the 1.1% for the third quarter, that's on new lease rate growth, and it's slightly positive so far in October. We haven't fully closed out our books yet. And then when you look at the renewals in total, they went from 4.8% in the third quarter. And right now, they're just a hair below that.","Rich Hightower","And then just on New York, looking at the last couple of quarters with your portfolio, I mean, it's still weak relatively speaking, but there's a little bit of stability maybe versus what we might have expected 6 to 9 months ago. I mean, is that -- and I know you've talked about a better concessionary environment versus a year ago. I mean, is there anything to that that's specifically driving that? Or we're still all sort of expecting New York to be a weak market through 2018? I mean, just what are some of the high-level thoughts there?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I don't think New York is going to, we would still say, New York is going to continue to struggle next year. When you look at the employment information right now, it looks like it's, this year, producing about 100,000 jobs. Next year, it's going to go down to about 87,000 jobs, so down a bit. Wage growth is 2%, 2.5%, which is not too far off from national average. When you look at the supply that's coming into New York, it's most prevalent in Long Island City as well as Brooklyn and Midtown West. When we look at how we're doing in the city, we've got 5 assets borne in our same-store pool. We're definitely feeling the most effects, a bit our Upper West Side MetLife JV property, where revenue growth during the quarter was a negative 2%. As you go through either our Chelsea property, our downtown properties or our Murray Hill property, they're all plus or minus between 0.4% positive and 1.6%. So fairly tight range for that B asset that we have in New York City other than the, again, A+ deal we have up in Columbus Square.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Joe, you mentioned $140 million of current investment that's going to go up in the DCP program and then a $300 million self-imposed limit. I'm curious if that's a temporary self-imposed limit in such that you see others kind of play itself out and kind of learn from it a little bit and then maybe becomes a greater percentage of your overall development program at some point in the future if it continues to be successful? Is that a fair way to think about it?","Joseph Fisher","Yes, Rich, I think that's fair to keep it a little bit open-ended depending on the opportunity set that's out there, so not to say we wouldn't go above $300 million. If risk-adjusted returns kept coming our way and it became more disconnected from acquisition and development returns, perhaps we'd look at increasing that limit. But we also got to be cognizant of where we source that capital fund and how much of that is available. And then earnings-wise, this is accretive to earnings, so we have to be cognizant of the fact that at some point, if the opportunity set dissipates over the next 4 to 5 years as these kind of long-duration investments burn off, you want to make sure that you don't have a cliff in any one given year. And so we do try to keep it under 1% or 2% of net earnings so that doesn't become a negative thesis to the street, but we'll continue to evaluate. So as opportunities keep coming our way, then not to say we won't go above that limit for a period of time.","Rich Anderson","Sure. Perfect. And then second question, this whole supply slippage phenomenon that's happening to you and everyone as well as maybe the elevated difficulty finding financing for development in general, do you feel as though that, that is kind of resonating with the broader developer community and will maybe contribute to a protracted decline in supply growth in '19 and beyond? Or is it just too soon to make that call at this point?","Tom Toomey","I think you've got the right pieces. Rising interest rate, rising cost, NOI trends, where they're pointing, banks still remaining disciplined, all shape up to a potential to expand the program in the years ahead. And so in hence, we don't want to burn all our fuel right now on this piece of it. But we'll play it out, and I think the discipline that the team has is critical at this juncture and we're going to take '18 one opportunity at a time and make sure that we're cognizant of the overall risk profile of the company and the economy overlaid on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Neil Malkin","I mean, your stock price is at pretty good levels, and we've heard commentary from your peers that maybe '18 in particular is going to be a good time to actually acquire, go on the offensive. You have a lot of merchant builders who are bringing their product to market and need to recycle in order to keep going and maybe you have the opportunity to buy below market or get in at a good time, especially given your operational savvy and particularly because you have among the highest leverages -- leverage levels among the multifamily peers. Have you thought about raising equity and in tandem with maybe a big purchase in some markets you're focused in?","Harry Alcock","I'll start. And I know Joe is going to want to step in as well. This is Harry. I think like any other investment, we'll consider sort of buying, as you say, merchant-build deals that are in lease-up. And we'll consider that in the context of other uses of capital, specifically DCP and the amount and cost of capital sources, which Joe will talk about in a second. In terms of the opportunity set, we think it's possible there's going to be some opportunity here as construction loans approach maturity for developers who want to monetize their position.","However, I will tell you that there's very little distress in this market, which I believe will limit the opportunities. Many of these deals are funded with institutional equity. So while the developer may be motivated to sell as the value of their position declines over time, the institutional equity can be much more patient, and we're seeing quite a few deals where the equity is actually buying out the developer so the deal never hits the market.","Joseph Fisher","Just your comments regarding share price, cost of capital and leverage. I guess starting with cost of capital. From an equity standpoint, the share price has been acting okay, but I would say that we've had multiple times this year that we've traded at a decent premium to consensus NAV and you haven't seen any activity out of us. So when we built the plan around sources and uses, we made sure that it was built around not needing to access the equity market. And if we do, it's going to be for a use that's going to be accretive in nature and adds to NAV overall. So while we've been at premiums, we've chosen not to act thus far this year.","In terms of the deleveraging, I guess I would look at solid BBB+ investment grade credit rating and the fact that earlier this year, we were issuing 135 over, in line with our other BBB+ peers. So I think our debt investors are pretty happy with the leverage level and kind of where we're at. We've stuck to the plan overall that we laid out in the 2-year in terms of trying to keep relatively static metrics on debt-to-EBITDA, debt-to-enterprise, fixed charge, et cetera, and really focusing more on the composition of our leverage, meaning focusing on increasing the unencumbered pool, increasing duration, reducing floating rate and some of the items around that as opposed to absolute leverage.","So at this point as has been contemplated the idea of a deleveraging or equity to fund external investment, given the needs that we have.","Neil Malkin","I appreciate the color. And then last one for me is in San Francisco last year, you saw a lot of irrational concessions. I'm wondering if you started to see that kind of knee-jerk reaction back up to market levels as those burn-off. I'm wondering if that's actually making renewals or new leases stronger than you expected and if you think that will continue into next year.","Jerry Davis","Yes, Neil, this is Jerry. You're right, we did see that irrational pricing in, specifically, San Francisco last year. We're seeing this year, as you really look at turnover, it's down quite a bit, both year-to-date. And then when you look at it for the most recent quarter, it's also down about 300 basis points.","So I'm really not seeing any more difficulty getting people to stay when you look at the renewal rate that we had in the month or in the third quarter. It was just a little under 4%. So I'm not having any more difficulty than I would say normal to do that even though we are giving away some of those higher concessions last year. So not seeing it and I don't think the irrational pricing has come back to San Francisco. You'll still have some properties into some area that are offering 6-plus-weeks concessions, but it's nothing like it was a year ago.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to President and CEO, Mr. Toomey, for any closing remarks.","Tom Toomey","Well, again, thank you for your time today. And in closing, I'd just say this. This quarter checked all the boxes. I thought it was a strong quarter for operations, capital allocations, the discipline remains very solid, and we increased guidance. And with that, we look forward to seeing you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks"],"20863":["UDR, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.","Shelby Noble","Welcome to UDR's second quarter 2016 financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirement.","I\u2019d like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectable of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that do not get answered.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Shelby, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","The second quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR, with 8% AFFO growth, driven by strong revenue growth of 5.7% and continued leasing strength in the 400 million development and lease up. This is a direct reflection of the continued execution of our strategic plan. At the core of our strategic plan are four elements.","First, a focus on cash flow growth for our shareholders through operational excellence, which Jerry will touch on later. Second, an accretive development pipeline that can be fully self-funded. Third, a diverse portfolio mix of 20 markets with A&B communities in urban and suburban locations. And lastly, a safe low levered balance sheet. ","Combined, these four elements are designed to provide the greatest predictability of cash flow growth through a variety of economic cycles. This is reflected in our updated guidance range for the full year with a mid-point resulting in 8% AFFO growth per share, which Shawn will touch on in his remarks.","Before I turn the call over to Shawn, I wanted to add a couple of comments on the recent departure of Tom Herzog, our former CFO. While Tom was an exceptional CFO, he left UDR with an impressive bench, and I feel confident in the skills of those in the finance and accounting team to be more than adequate to handle his absence. At this time Shawn Johnston, our Chief Accounting Officer is serving as our Interim Principle Financial Officer, while we evaluate both internal and external candidates. Shawn is an exceptional candidate for the role and we are glad to have him serving in an interim capacity now. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Shawn Johnston for additional comments on the quarter.","Shawn Johnston ","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, our balance sheet update and our third quarter and full year guidance update. Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.44, $0.45 and $0.41 respectively. Second quarter's same-store revenue, expense, and NOI growth were 5.7%, 5.5%, and 5.7% respectively.","Second quarter expense growth was elevated due to a higher than expected property tax assessment on our 2014 development completion in San Francisco. Historically, San Francisco is value developments for tax purposes, by using a mix of cost to construct and income capitalization. While we budgeted for a mix that was weighted more towards the interim method than precedent would indicate, 100% of the valuation was eventually based on interim capitalization. This unexpected assessment resulted in a charge of $2.2 million during the quarter. $1.1 million of this was attributable to the period that the community was included in our same-store population, and was recognized as a digital same-store expense during the quarter.","The remaining portion of the charge is for real estate taxes while the community was in lease up, which can be found in Attachment 5. Excluding this negative tax variance, quarterly same store expense growth for the portfolio and the San Francisco Bay area would have been 3.4% and 9.9% respectively versus the 5.5% and 33.1% realized.","Next, the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was $876 million. Our financial leverage on an un-depreciated cost basis was 33.2%. Based on quarter and market gap, it was 23.6% and inclusive of JVs it was 28.1%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3 times, and inclusive of JVs with 6.3 times. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of our strategic plan.","I would like to point out a few changes to our supplemental package. First, you\u2019ll note that we have provided additional GAAP metrics in both our release and supplement in response to the recent SEC interpretation regarding GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. I\u2019d also like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We are now providing both our previous and updated guidance for ease of comparison.","With that, we have tightened our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $1.76 to $1.80, and tightened and increased our FFO as adjusted an AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80 and $1.61 to $1.64 respectively. A few key items have impacted our original guidance. First, our same store portfolio is performing in line with original guidance, but our Metlife properties which are primarily urban A have underperformed our expectations. This underperformance has been offset by the outperformance of our development lease ups. Second, the S&P 500 inclusion trade resulted in some dilution. However, this issuance gave us the flexibility to change the timing of other planned 2016 capital events to offset the majority of the dilution and ultimately have resulted in an improved balance sheet.","Lastly, we expect a reduction in our full year incentive compensation, which is partially offset by higher than expected healthcare cost, resulting in a net reduction to G&A expense of $2 million at the midpoint. A few other specifics from the page. We increased our sources guidance by $75 million at the midpoint to a range of $650 million to $750 million for the year. This is due to an increase in planned dispositions, which we now anticipate being approximately $400 million for the year. In addition to the $400 million of sales, we have issued a $174 million of common equity, with the remainder of the sources coming from secured debt refinancings. We do not anticipate any additional equity issuances through the remainder of the year.","Our debt maturities increased by $60 million as we have accelerated the accretive prepayment on some existing secured debt to the earliest possible date without penalty. Additionally, we reduced our development, redevelopment and land acquisition guidance by $50 million at the midpoint due to timing of spend, and we increased our acquisition guidance by a $100 million in order to satisfy some Section 31 exchanges that we would like to complete this year.","For same store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged, with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%; expense 3% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%. Third quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.44 to $0.46 and $0.39 to $0.41 respectively. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the second quarter or a $1.18 per share when annualized; 6% above 2015\u2019s level, which represents a yield of approximately 3.2%. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Shawn, and good afternoon. In my remarks I will cover the following topics. First, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter, and early results for the third quarter. Second, how our primary markets performed during the quarter, and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups.","We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, same-store net operating income grew 5.7%. These results were driven by a 5.7% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 5.5% increase in expenses. Year-to-date, through June 30th we've achieved NOI growth of 6.8% behind revenue growth of 6% and expense growth of 4.1%. ","Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased 6% year-over-year to $1,921 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.6% was down 30 basis points versus the prior year period. Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $2,027 per month, including pro-rata JVs. Although we are feeling the impact of new supply in a few of our core markets, namely San Francisco and New York, the positives we see continue to outweigh the negatives. Stable job growth, new household formations, better delay in home purchase, choosing to rent, as well as empty nester baby boomers moving to an urban setting with a live, work, play atmosphere. Our portfolio mix benefits from each of these scenarios. ","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on attachment 8G of our supplement, we grew our new lease rates by 4.4% in the second quarter, 330 basis points below the second quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.3% in the second quarter or 70 basis points behind last year. On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the second quarter, a reduction of 210 basis points versus the same period last year.","If you look at the 76% of the same-store portfolio not located in New York and San Francisco, our decline in blended rate growth was only 100 basis points. I'd like to point out the exceptional growth we achieved in 2015 was an anomaly. We are now back to a normal operating environment. ","Typically, renewal rate growth outpaces new lease rate growth by at least a 100 basis points. Because we were able to drive our occupancy in late 2014 to the 96.5% to 97% level, we were able to push new lease rate growth in the peak leasing season in 2015, higher than that of renewal leases. 2016 is proving to be a more normalized year with renewal growth outpacing new lease rate growth. While we wish every year could be as strong as 2015, we are very happy with the strength seen in 2016 thus far; specially given that we are currently dealing with peak deliveries in the majority of our markets. Next, move-outs to home purchase were up a 150 basis points year-over-year, at 14.1%, and even with our strong renewal increases in the second quarter, less than 9% of our move-outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving.","Now moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets which represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro DC, which represents 19% of our total NOI and 14% of our same-store NOI posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.8%, a slight deceleration from first quarter, due primarily to very strong bad debt collections in the second quarter of 2015. We are forecasting the market to generate top-line growth in 2016 of between 2% and 3% as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50\/50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the beltway. Our B product outperformed our As during the quarter by 170 basis points as sporadic supply issues continue to make for choppy results in some infield locations. ","Orange County in Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI and about 17% of our same-store NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.9% with both our As and Bs performing well above 8% and all sub markets remaining very strong as we face very limited supply. Revenue growth in Los Angeles was 5.2% during the quarter. Our same-store portfolio is primarily concentrated within the Marina del Ray submarket and is currently facing over 2000 units of new supply, which we expect will be fully absorbed by year-end. We continue to see good job growth and the supply picture improving in 2017 for our same-store LA portfolio.","New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI and 13% of same-store NOI posted 4.65 revenue growth for the quarter. While our same-store properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are feeling the impact from new supply in the Manhattan market as new lease growth during the quarter was 1.9%. New Yorkers who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods are being enticed and by pricing infinites in places like Midtown West. For full year 2016, we expect New York to have revenue growth in the low 4% range, below our original estimates of approximately 5.5%.","San Francisco, which represents about 11% of both our total and same-store NOI is continuing to feel the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including South of market. However, we still expect the bay area to be one of our best performing markets this year with revenue growth between 6% and 7%. Same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was 6.3%, due to the extremely strong blended rent growth we achieved in the third quarter of 2015. We currently see our portfolio being affected by lease-up pressures through the middle of 2017.","Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI, about 5% of same-store NOI produced a strong 6.1% revenue growth during the second quarter. The suburban assets in the North shore were our strongest performers, with growth over 7.5%. Even with new supply downtown, our one same-store assets in the back day posted revenue growth of 4% for the quarter. The Seaport district, home to our 2015 completion on 100 Pier 4 in the South end district, home to our under construction community, 345 Harrison continued to see more growth with additional office and retail tenants in the submarket.","Seattle, which represents 6% of our total and same-store NOI posted strong revenue growth of 8.5% for the quarter. 16% of our portfolio is B product, which posted revenue growth of 12.3% where our A quality communities produce 6.6% growth. We continue to benefit from the strong growth inherent in these suburban B assets which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply. Even with new supply pressure, our Bellevue assets posted revenue growth of 6.8% for the quarter where revenue growth in downtown Seattle was essentially flat.","Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4% of our total and same-store NOI posted 5% year-over-year same-store growth in the second quarter. Our B properties had revenue growth of 500 basis points higher than our A's, as having new supply in uptown and along the toll ways and packing rent growth in those submarkets. While new supply remains elevated, we expect deliveries to decline after this year and are confident they will be absorbed by the strength in the diversified job market in Dallas.","Our secondary market, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin which comprised roughly 20% of our portfolio continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economic. ","July results came in, in line with our plan. As we look ahead to the next two months we see stable pricing power and occupancy. Our 50-50 AB portfolio located throughout 20 markets has enabled out performance in our Sun Belt market, Orange County, Seattle, Boston, Portland and Monterey to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply, namely San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. ","I'll turn now to our four end lease up developments, which you can find on attachments. 9A and 9B or pages 21 and 22 of our supplement. Our pro-rata share of these four properties represents over $400 million or roughly 30% of our pipeline, inclusive of the west coast development joint venture. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan. First, 399 Freemont our 447 home, $318 million 50-50 met by JV leased up in San Francisco, with 50% leased and 43% occupied at quarter end. Today we are 57% leased and 48% occupied with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently operating six weeks' concession as we\u2019ve begun to see increased competition from other lease ups in the submarket. Over the last month, we have taken over 30 leases. ","The following three communities are all part of the west coast development joint venture. Katella brand I, our 399 home, $138 million lease up in Anaheim, California was 65% leased and 58% occupied at quarter end, and as of today it's 72% leased and 64% occupied. We are currently offering less than one month of concession at this community and leasing remains very strong with about 30 applications per month. ","8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 37% occupied at quarter end and is currently 60% leased and 46% occupied, and we are averaging over one application per day. CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 87% leased and 84% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 89% leased, and 86% physically occupied. All in, we had a very strong second quarter, and we remain very positive on the outlook for multi-family fundamentals, and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016.","With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph ","Thanks. Just sticking with operations, you outlined A versus B performance cost in many markets and the 50\/50 diversified portfolio, I think you have a unique perspective on this. So when you expect that spread between As and Bs to contract and when could As actually outperform Bs, just given the current supply picture?","Tom Toomey","Good question and, I\u2019d tell you it varies market by market, but I think overall, and we stated this probably for the last two to three quarters, we would see As getting closer to Bs probably mid-year, next year, maybe a little bit after that. And then as you get deeper into \u201918 I think As probably start competing more head-to-head with Bs. But it\u2019s definitely market dependent. For example, I would think in Washington DC, we\u2019ve seen that spread contract and expand multiple times. Last quarter it was about 50 basis points where Bs were outperforming. This quarter we expanded to 1.7, but we do see a slowdown of new supply effecting our product and DC over the next year and half. So I do think As, because there are typically better locations by the second half of next year should start doing much better there.","When you look at a place like New York, it\u2019s probably a little more prolonged, call it maybe even 2019 or further where we see Bs continuing to outperform. And in San Francisco I think its similar. You\u2019re going to see supply continue to offset the market in so many places like that at least through the middle of next year. And I think that will cause As to continue to have to go head-to-head against new supply well into \u201918. So I think San Francisco, New York, Dallas, Austin is probably pushed out a bit, but several of the other markets that saw new supply come a little bit earlier, it\u2019s shorter but, on average I'm guessing, it gets closer in late \u201917 and probably pulls even in \u201918.","Nick Joseph ","Thanks. And then as per the two-year outlook, you put out 2017 operating assumptions. You\u2019ve maintained 2016 same-store revenue growth. I was wondering if there is any update to the 2017 estimate of 4.75 or 5.25?","Tom Toomey","Yes, I can tell you we -- clearly we saw a deceleration coming in 2017. And as you said, we\u2019ve put that in our 2-year outlook. And the range was the 4.75 to 5.25, which implied about a 75 basis points decline from 2016. And we\u2019re continuing to project a slowdown in \u201917 based on a lower blended rate growth in \u201916 compared to \u201915. But at this point it\u2019s probably a little early to give guidance on where we think \u201917 is going to come in. We still don\u2019t have great visibility on pricing for September and the fourth quarter of this year, and we really haven\u2019t fine-tuned our expectations yet for 2017. So a little bit early, but it's probably leaning towards the lower end of that range.","Nick Joseph ","Thanks. And just quickly, on that range, does that contemplate the assets that are not in the same-store pool that you laid out on attachment 7B, that will roll into the same-store pool in 2017.","Tom Toomey","Yes.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi it\u2019s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just revisiting Nick\u2019s earlier question on Bs outperforming As in most of your markets. I was just curious what the price differential is between your As and Bs in some of the similar submarkets?","Tom Toomey","It depends A and B. The difference between A and a B in Dallas is probably $250 to $300. When you get to the New York, it's probably north of $1000 differential. San Francisco, it's going to be $800 to $1,000. So it can vary, but you are typically looking at it getting close to a $1,000 in some of the high rise and urban markets on the coast. And when you get into the Sun Belt it can be tracked down to just a $200.","Austin Wurschmidt","So it's fair to say around 20% to 25% in some of your larger markets?","Tom Toomey","Yes, that sounds right.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay, and then just thinking about guidance, what are you assuming in terms of blended lease rate growth in the second half of the year?","Tom Toomey","Second half of the year, the blend, we're looking at it being low for us. Probably you are going to see in the second half -- I can you this. Renewals for July are coming in on effective basis at about 5.9%. And as you look out to next month or two, it's probably going to stay in that 5.7% to 5.8% range but then in the fourth quarter it will come down probably mid-5%. And then we're seeing new lease rate growth in July is currently at about 3.2% and our expectation would be it will just come down a hair over the last three months. We really -- we saw pricing last year in the fourth quarter come down a bit. So we're not anniversaring off such high prices. But yes second half is probably going to be low for us compared to the 5.3% that we have in the first half. ","Operator","And next we have Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just a few quick questions. Jerry, on the operations, on the first quarter call you guys were -- earlier here, you guys were asking about the high guidance and actually Herzog explained how the high same-store NOI guidance, what the leakage was, that it wasn\u2019t necessarily translating to FFO growth, but now this quarter where we see some of your peers dialing back their expectations for the year, what are some of the things that because you guys to be able to maintain such a high guidance range? Is it that the amount of Bs that you have or is just a fact that in your portfolio mix you said markets like Dallas and Norfolk, southern markets that aren\u2019t represented in some of the other in some of your other bi-coastal peers.","Tom Toomey","Yes. I\u2019ll start. First I\u2019d remind you, we got out of Norfolk in the fourth quarter of the last year. So it's gone. Yes, I think a big part of it that you have to consider is we really drove weight very strongly in the second half as paid benefits this year. And when you look at the -- we anticipated there would be a deceleration in rate growth with this year and that has happened. And while I'll say directionally and in total, that reduction was pretty close, we missed on a market-by-market basis. For example, 29% of our portfolio, which is made up of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, we\u2019re missing our numbers. We came into the year thinking San Francisco would be an 8. Now we think it's probably going to end up at 6.5. We thought New York was going to high 5s. Now we think it's going to be low 4s. And Los Angeles, we came in think it was going to be call it a 7, and now we think it's going to be mid 5s.","What we have that a lot of people don't is the diversified portfolio. 20 markets, we got the 50\/50 split between A, Bs and Urbans. And what's really helping us is that 42% of our portfolio is performing better than we had expected coming into the year. So it's offsetting those three markets that are doing worse. And those are markets like Seattle which I think all of us are doing well in right now. Our Orange County portfolio with 8.9% revenue growth in the second quarter is doing exceptionally well. We're doing very well in Boston, where we have predominantly a suburban portfolio in our same-store pool. We held up at about a 6 -- a little north of the 6 revenue there. Two markets in Florida, both Orlando and Tampa are doing better than we expected. Nashville is on fire right now, and again we're very suburban B there. So we're not being impacted at all by the new supply. And then we have our Monterey and Portland portfolios that are doing well.","So the beauty of our portfolio with that diversification is we're not dependent on a couple of the markets doing well or not doing well. We realize this diversified approach that's going to continue to help us in the future, because all markets are going to go through the natural cycle. So we\u2019ll always have some that are doing better, some that are doing worse. So, I think it's really more of a portfolio diversification that's really helping us.","Alexander Goldfarb","And historically, like Toomey is talking about, hardest market, the market that you had used to source capital to help fund the development, based on what you're seeing in this cycle, does the weakness in some of the coastal markets pressure at the high end change your view and maybe some of the coastal markets are going to be seen for harvesting rather than some of the markets like Richmond, some of those others?","Tom Toomey","I think there's still a couple of markets that we probably are ready to exit a little more quickly than others, and I think Harry will talk maybe as soon as I get off this on which ones we\u2019re looking at in our disposition program this year. But markets that we've historically talked about that were in our warehouse and we kind of stopped talking about that, because we -- we've really come to realize, there're good strong markets, and they're going to perform well over the long term, places like Florida, again Orlando, Nashville, Tampa, places like that, I think we're satisfied to stay there over the midterm and probably long term. There's no rush to exit. But we'll selectively sell assets, and at times get out of markets to fund the development pipeline. But maybe Harry can give you a little more input on what we're looking to sell this year.","Harry Alcock","Yes, Alex. In the short term -- we're always looking at which assets to sell to fund our development pipeline in particular. This year we've looked at -- we intend to sell Baltimore -- at least sell down portfolio to some extent. We have a group of assets in the market today. We're also going to sell a couple properties in Dallas for the balance of the year.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then Harry, while you\u2019re on, could you just walk us through the ground lease deal that you did in LA and the economics then how this fits in within UDR's investment game plan?","Harry Alcock","Sure. Well Alex, as you know, we look at all these trades in the context of best invested return to the shareholders. La Jolla, the effective land sizes of $400,000 per unit, which is the price that's unheard of the Los Angeles, we were able to monetize most or all of our future development gain today, and then convert this one-time gain into another structured deal where we received nearly 7% return on our capital. And so while its different than Steel Creek, it\u2019s another example of how we deploy capital and then create transactions.","Operator","And next in queue we have Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico ","Well thanks. So I guess just turning back to the guidance, specifically on same-store revenue growth, where you\u2019ve gone 6% year-to-date and for the year saying and 5.5% to 6% is the range, how should we think about what level of conservatism is built into the guidance? Because it doesn\u2019t seem to imply much of a deceleration in the back half of the year?","Jerry Davis","Yes, Nick, it\u2019s Jerry. I\u2019d tell you right now, we look at our model, we\u2019re coming in right in the midpoint of guidance. There\u2019s a couple of things that could push us, there\u2019s really one thing that push us to the top-end, and that would be if we get a significant occupancy pick-up. And we have been pushing to drive occupancy a little bit higher over the last month or two. The thing that could drive us to the bottom is if we see a further deterioration in operating fundamentals. And typically those would probably have to come with more downside than we\u2019ve projected in New York and San Francisco since the other ones have been reacting kind of stable.","There is a couple of things though -- because I know what you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ve got a 6 or so in the first half of the year, which would imply second half would be a 5.5. But there\u2019s a few things to keep in mind. If here so far we had 6.3% rent per occupied home growth, that\u2019s been offset by about a 30 basis points decline in occupancy; we had very difficult occupancy comps at the first half of last year. Our occupancy in the second half of last year decelerated about 20 or 30 bps. Now we\u2019re still very high at 96.6, but it wasn\u2019t at 96.8 or 96.9. Our expectation and what we\u2019re shooting for this year is to have a positive spread over last year\u2019s occupancy. So we\u2019re not going to be losing revenue growth even if occupancy declined. We\u2019re hoping we get a little bit of pickup in that.","Then the second thing just that\u2019s interesting is our fee income is up almost 10% year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue through the second half of the year. And that\u2019s really coming partially from lease break fees; people electing to move and relocate for jobs or buy houses or things like that. And but the second part is we started working on an initiative in the second half of last year to drive higher revenues from our parking rent, which was an initiative we began working on like I said, late last year but we\u2019ve got the fruits of it this year, to find a way to increase this under optimized real estate.","So you got 6% of your revenue stack coming from fee income, that\u2019s growing at a much higher rate than my rents. And you know, how optimistic or pessimistic or conservative is that midpoint? Right now we\u2019ve factored in like I said earlier that we think blended rate growth for the second half of the year is going to be low 4s. So again, you\u2019re looking at renewal growth in the low 5s and new lease rate growth, maybe right around 3, and that seems to us to be pretty sustainable right now.","Nick Yulico ","Okay, sounds fine. I guess just one other follow-up on that. You did talk about the second half blended lease growth of low 4%. It sounds like there is other items in your sort of revenue that are helping as you mentioned fee income et cetera. So I guess point is we shouldn\u2019t be using that low 4% lease rate growth as sort of a directionally where your same-store revenue growth is heading is, how should we think about?","Jerry Davis","Well, I'll say this. You're lease rate growth or what we get from new rental renewals benefits you over the next 12 months. So a portion of what we\u2019re realizing in the third quarter of this year is based on the very strong lease rate growth and renewal growth that we got at the end of the last year. So it continues to pay benefits for the next 12 months. So what I'm telling you that I'm going to do over the next six months has some benefit over the next six months, but it also has a benefit over the following six months. So you can't just look at my current -- what am I signing leases for, because that's only for the percentage of residents or expirations that are happening at that time. ","Nick Yulico ","Yes, so I meant that the second half blend of lease growth of low 4%, whether that sort of indicator about where 2017 same-store sales revenue growth would be, not this year?","Jerry Davis","It does build. You are right. It does build into 2017. The others saying is though, what are rents going to do next year, and we\u2019re going to have some markets where you\u2019re probably going to see rate growth continue to go down, but we have other markets for example Los Angeles where we\u2019re fighting heavy new supply right now, but I expect that one to pick up quite a bit next year. So some of is dependent on how we do next year but we are building up part of our rent role right now for 2017.","Nick Yulico ","Okay, that's helpful. And just to clarify, when you talk about the fee income being strong, is any of that from actual leased termination, lease break fees of residents, or is that helping you at all?","Jerry Davis","Yes, that is -- that's about half of it. We're hitting a portion -- we'll probably pick up a little over a $1 million, $1.2 million this year of additional revenue from parking, and that's just basically -- and it\u2019s predominantly in garden communities, charging people for parking and determining which spaces are the most preferable and trying to monetize that. But the other big mover is lease break fees, where somebody wants to cancel their lease ahead of the natural expiration date. They are contractually obligated to pay us to get out of the lease. So a portion of it is that.","Operator","Next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson ","Jerry, when you look at 2017 deliveries in the New York area, is that -- how much of that is concentrated in Manhattan, and would be sort of direct competition for you guys versus how much of that stuff is in Queens and Brooklyn where you don\u2019t have any assets?","Jerry Davis","Most of it is not directly impacting us. When you look at approximate to our neighborhoods, we\u2019re not going to head to head with much, but we have been feeling the impact coming from whether it's mid-town in west Brooklyn, you have people in New Jersey, as well as Queens, they are all kind of a stealing some people away, if you can get nice new product for a lower effective rate. I don\u2019t have the numbers off the top of my head about how much is in Manhattan versus Queens though.","Rob Stevenson ","When does the that property that's just north of View 34, that we followed the property tour is scheduled to start leasing?","Jerry Davis","I think it's late fourth quarter or first quarter. We think we\u2019ll probably feel some effect from that, but their rents are quite a bit higher than ours.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, and then Harry the guidance on the acquisition went from $0 million to $100 million to a $100 million to $200 million. Is that third party acquisitions or is that you guys buying in some of the Wolf stuff?","Harry Alcock","It's not the Wolf stuff. So it generally is going to be third party acquisitions and there are couple 10\/31 trades that we're looking to execute in the fourth quarter.","Rob Stevenson","You don't want the contract currently?","Harry Alcock","No.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","A quick question. I think I remember you asking about of this call that you were seeing a little bit more supply pressures in the LA market. That\u2019s maybe a little bit different then some of the commentary if you referred from last years. So I'm curious, how much of that is driven versus by Class A versus Class B? And are you actually starting to see supply pick up in maybe the Class B space versus the Class A?","Tom Toomey","It\u2019s a good question. Here's what the deal is. 90% of our same-store portfolio is located in Marina del Rey. So it's three properties over in Marina. Marina is about a two-mile drive to Playa Vista where all of the tech firms are relocating to the area called Silicon Beach. We've got two lease ups occurring in Playa Vista right now. One is a 1,500-unit deal, the other one I think is 400 units. But they are coming in offering concessions of one to two months free. And what\u2019s it's really done, it's directly impacting my three [ph] properties in Los Angeles that make up 90% of my portfolio. So, yes, I don't think any of my peers would be feeling the same thing, because they don't have as much concentration in one sub market in Los Angeles as I have.","Operator","Next we've Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","So, Harry, you said something interesting earlier about how you were kind of abandoning -- maybe it\u2019s Jerry -- abandoning this warehousing concept, and thinking about keeping some assets in some markets in the portfolio. And so I was wondering if you could talk about any other adjustments you're making to the strategy like that. Because one of them, I recall when you spent some together last year, the 50\/50 Class A, Class B could actually morph into more like 60 or 70 Class A over time. Do you feel like maybe there's an adjustment there that you'll make in the current environment kind of like how you're adjusting your warehousing kind of concept?","Tom Toomey","Rich, this is Toomey. I think abandoning or changing is probably a little bit of an over statement. I think what we're doing is constantly weighing our market mix and the price point in what we think cash flow is going to grow at. And so when we think we have a market for example where Baltimore has performed in last five years, averaging 3% growth, we kind of look out the next five years and say, we don't think it's really going to change a whole lot. Where else do we think we can redeploy that capital in the enterprise, most immediately in the development pipeline. So we're always revisiting our markets. On the balance of 50\/50, the As that we're putting in today, 10 years from now will be Bs. And so I think we'll probably hover around the 50\/50, it might go 60\/40 but I don\u2019t see a long-term directional change in that allocation.","I think what ultimately we\u2019re trying to build, and have done so far and will continue to refine is building cash flow, and where we see it can grow the best. And concentrated positions could create concentrated risk. And so we\u2019re always going to have this diversification. We think over time it works. Some markets having Bs work better than As. Other cases where we look at jobs and where we think they're coming up in the price point, As are going to be better. So I think that\u2019s the overriding doctrine that we\u2019re overall thinking about our capital allocation and decisions, and markets from time-to-time. Florida is an example right now, talking off the cost, is going to enjoy a another couple year run, but supply will start coming at Florida in the near-future, and then we\u2019ll look at how we feel about our assets positioned in that market and rather we should move more capital out of that, and into other places where opportunities will become available.","Richard Anderson","Okay. And then as a follow-up, was there anything about the QR print that kind of caused you to at least take another look at your numbers and make sure you weren\u2019t missing anything. The is one kind of cynical view is that the rest of the group is going to have to revisit guidance, not this quarter maybe, but next quarter. I\u2019m just curious if there was any level of reaction on your part from seeing that profit take effect?","Tom Toomey","Rich, I'm not going to comment on EQR or their results and their outlook. What I am going to say is, is that Jerry and his team run a culture from the bottom-up focusing greatly on what\u2019s going on in the ground, reforecasting the business constantly, monitoring our traffic or pricing power, and that feeds right up to us on a weekly basis, and we discuss how does that fit in our outlook for the future, and we\u2019re very comfortable with the guidance we\u2019ve just given. We feel like a lot of the year is pretty much behind us. There's not a lot of leases to price in that fourth quarter window, and we\u2019re trying to really focus on our '17. And I think that\u2019s a credit to his team, to Shaun and his efforts in forecasting FP&L, that we have a pretty darn good handle on exactly where we\u2019re at, what are the levers that we can move, and what\u2019s our range of outcomes. And that\u2019s why we tightened guidance the way we did, but we feel very good about the guidance we\u2019ve given, and it's a credit to Jerry and his operating team, but also in way it's positioned","Operator","And moving on we\u2019ll next hear from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Jerry, rent growth across a number of Sun Belt markets, namely Dallas, Tampa and Orlando for example, seem to have decelerated throughout the quarter. Do you expect that reacceleration in the back half of the year across some of these Sun Belt markets?","Jerry Davis","You know Dallas I think is going to continue to be difficult. Its having new supply there. Our B product is continuing to do well, but we\u2019ve got properties in uptown as well as Plana [ph] that are going up against new supply. So I think you\u2019re going to continue to see a struggle in Dallas, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any worse. I think when you look at the other Sun Belts, Orlando and Tampa, I think you're going to see Orlando turn back around. What happened in the quarter -- second quarter is we probably got a bit aggressive on renewal growth, where we were popping out 7.9%, and opened back door a little, put a little pressure on occupancy levels, and we had to cut new lease rate growth to get occupancy back up. Our occupancy in Orlando today is 97.1%. That compares to an average of 96.5% during the second quarter and we've seen a lease rate growth in the month of July jump back up to 6.6% compared to the 4.9% that we reported in Q2. So I think Orlando feels good and then Tampa just feels stable. We've had a few lease ups in a sub market of Tampa that's affected us, and I think they're starting to stabilize now and I think our numbers will too.","John Pawlowski","And then Harry what timing can we expect on the roughly $400 million of dispositions, how is pricing shaping up versus expectation?","Harry Alcock","Pricing is coming in sort of at or slightly above expectations. We expect these things to close mostly early in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird Company.","Drew Babin","One follow-up question on the 10\/31 opportunity. Would you say that the opportunity on the disposition side, is kind of a more compelling reason for the increase in your overall transaction activity for this year, or would you say that the opportunistic use of the capital on the acquisition side is the more exciting opportunity?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. So I think there's a couple of questions there. One, we sell a number of properties every year to fund -- there's a bucket of capital to fund various uses, including specifically development. We do have 10\/31 opportunities that we're going to look at. The pricing on the acquisition we think is likely to be generally market. We'll look at markets such as DC, Boston, Southern California, Northern California, Seattle to redeploy the capital. We think that will be largely market. The cap rates on these sales, typically our Baltimore assets are going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 6%. The cap rate on one of our Dallas acquisitions that's in the market today called Cert, which is a Metlife JV asset, which should be somewhere in the neighborhood of 5.25. We've got one additional Dallas asset that will definitely be a component of the 10\/31 and we think that's probably a mid 5s type trade.","Drew Babin","And secondly I was hoping to dig in on Manhattan a little bit. With View 34 being same-store pool this year, and obviously that's been a strong asset so far. Can you talk at all about how the Manhattan portfolio is performing ex-View 34? Or conversely just provide how View 34 has done year-to-date?","Harry Alcock","Yes. View 34 actually added about 70 basis points to our numbers. And I -- hold up one second, let me get the details. I think -- look at the Manhattan portfolio, View 34's revenue growth during the quarter was about 6.1% year-over-year.","Tom Toomey","It's Toomey. I'd add. That's what's reflective when you do a good job on a rehab of a B, and you keep it in that B price point and boy, I wish I could find more View 34s is the answer?","Drew Babin","So can you talk at all specifically about how Downtown's performing?","Tom Toomey","Sure. Yes, Downtown is definitely our hardest hit submarket in Manhattan for same-stores. But our two Downtown properties had revenue growth during the quarter of just under 3%. Now when you get up to a one Met JV, which is in the upper west side, Columbus Square, that property had revenue growth of just under 1%. So that's the one that is combating most head to head new supply. And then just to do a full lap through, Manhattan we only have one other deal and it's in Chelsea. And that property has continued to do extremely well and it had revenue growth in the mid sixes.","Operator","Next we have Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Juan Sanabria","Just wondering if you could briefly run through what your exceptions are across let's say your top five markets for new supply 2016 and then going into full year 2017?","Jerry Davis","Sure. When we look at D.C. in 2016 our expectations for news -- I'll tell you, we get this data from Axiometrics. So if you get Axio data, it's going to be roughly the same, but D.C. 2016 is about 13,500 units and 2017 is projected to be about 9,000. New York is going to go from 25,000 this year to 30,000 next year, and that is the one market we see where supply in our major markets is going to be higher next year than this year. San Francisco goes from about 13,000 to about 7,000. Seattle goes from about 10,000 to 6,000 and I guess the last market I would highlight is we showed Dallas going from about 18,000 units this year to about 13,000 next year.","Juan Sanabria","A couple of your peers have commented that they may be few numbers higher than what Axio actual uses. Is there any concern on your part that those numbers may be understated and your 2017 figures could be under more pressure than where the numbers may currently spin out too?","Tom Toomey","Juan this is Tom. This is an interesting topic, and I'm glad you kind of got us there, is what is the supply picture look like in the future, because I think everybody is kind of throwing around different numbers. I would tell you some anecdotal information that's critical to this conversation would be is what are banks' lending on, and what is the bank lending environment. And if you start digging into that with the bankers, you're realizing very rapidly that the terms on construction loans, the pricing on them, and the availability is contracting at a rapid pace. And we've seen several large banks just red line and say we're not doing multifamily loans any longer, period. Or probably now price terms that are prohibitive to make the deals work.","So, I think you are going to start to see some of those construction numbers start really coming down rapidly, as people start to get into their construction loan draws, and trying to get their terms and their penciling work. I think it also creates an opportunity for UDR to look at wharf and steel type creek opportunities, that might start becoming and available in 2017, should this come to fruition. So I would stay very focused on what the supply of money looks like, the terms of that, and watch how that ultimately unfolds. I know everybody's numbers are all over the map right now, but what I look at is one of the drivers and it's not the opportunities, not the fundamentals. Those are there. It's the question of capital and the price of that capital and will deals work. And we'll stay focused on that, which is my recommendation for 2017.","Juan Sanabria","And then in Europe any remarks? Tom, you talked about being focused on operational excellence. I think you've hit a little bit on the parking upside. Any other things you could point to that you're working on that maybe we'd say some margin upside and any sort of target numbers you could talk to?","Tom Toomey","I'll let Jerry clean it up, but I'll start with it. One we're a very operationally focused company, and it comes a lot through innovation. So, there's always as you can see from prior road shows, we've always listed out initiatives that we're focused on. We have basically a biweekly meeting on innovation here, and we're talking about the product, the initiatives that we have underway, what's working, what's not and we're always constantly pressing the next envelope for our customer. And we do a great job of listening to what they want, and what they are willing to pay for. And its Jerry and his team to filter through that innovation list and put it in the practical terms.","This parking conversation that he alluded to earlier is really a conversation started two years ago, and ultimately we've built systems out, convinced the field about the pricing scheme and they've done a great job of executing it. And I can tell you that at the last count there were 57 initiatives on that schedule. Some will not work, many of them will. So we're going to continue to be innovative operationally, and that's how it makes the difference at the enterprise.","Jerry Davis","I'll give you a few examples. Tom spoke and you mentioned the parking, another one, and they're not all revenue enhancing. Some are expense reducing. So we -- and some are capital expenditures that give us that return. But one is converting common area space lighting to LED lighting, which dramatically drops down, both your electrical cost as well as the maintenance time people have to spend replacing those light bulbs. And we've seen a reduction in our electric costs this year from doing that.","Secondly package lockers. Some people believe in them, some people don\u2019t. I will tell you we do. We've installed well over 40 lockers; we've got another 35 that are being installed right now. We're doing it for two reasons. Dealing with package management is a huge time suck on our onsite teams. So it opens them up to do more work makes money for us. And secondly it's a benefit that residents enjoy to have 24\/7 access to pick up their own packages. So we get a little bit of a rent from that doing that too. And the packaged lockers have an IRR, that we look at it, well over 25% to 30%.","So, financially it makes a lot of sense, but we always do things that the residents want, and that typically is good for us. And what both of those things do? You heard me mention on the LED lights because it takes -- gives back some time to our maintenance teams. And you heard me on the package lockers, say that we've been able to give some time back to our leasing maintenance. This year, and if you look at our personnel numbers, personnel expense number, you'll see that it's roughly flat for the quarter. We've been able to reduce about 1.5% to 2% of our site headcount this year because of some of these efficiencies that we've been able to do. So those are just a couple of examples, but like Toomey said we're always looking. There are some that we'll spend a great little time on, and they don't work, but we're always trying to search for the next thing to expand our margins.","Operator","And moving on we'll hear from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","You mentioned that the supply in Marina del Rey would abate to the second half. Are you seeing any of your major markets where the supply could be back half loaded this year?","Tom Toomey","Back half loaded, let' me think. I think Bellevue -- probably Bellevue, Washington. So, one, and I'll get Harry in on this on a minute. Bellevue is one where there's lot of cranes and there's a lot of supply coming. We're currently doing exceptionally well there with 6.5%, 7% revenue growth this quarter on our same-store pool, but our expectation was that we would be more affected by new supply there and that's one of the reasons that our Seattle portfolio is outperforming. But Bellevue is probably one that I could say picking up later this year and maybe spreading into the first half of next year. Can you think of anything else, Harry?","Harry Alcock","Well, New York obviously continues to second half of this year and into next year, you're going to see that heavier supply in New York.","Tom Toomey","And I will tell you another one, that this will continue to get hit, and we don't have any same-store properties there, but Downtown LA has quite -- I mean probably got 3,000 to 4,000 new supply that's in some stage of lease up or pre-lease up right now. So Downtown LA is going to -- it's going to be interesting to operate there over the next year.","Wes Golladay","And real quick, you had mentioned the lenders who were looking to cut back on multifamily lending. Was this more emphasis on the coastal markets or is it broad based including the Sunbelt as well?","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey. We're seeing it across the template. And so when we talk to people about how they're sourcing their capital, where half of them go to other pools of money, foreign banks, local, regional banks, all of which do not have the capacity of our big national banks. And so by virtue of just pricing and the size, we expect that will drive some of the geography of where supply is going to come. So it's going to start moving to the Sun Belt and it's start going to moving suburban, and then also I think it's going to decrease that urban pressure. So we're going to see the market shifting.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll hear from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dennis McGill","A couple of quick ones. On the 4.4% new lease growth rate for the quarter, what would that look it if you split it by urban and suburban assets?","Tom Toomey","Urban and suburban. I don't have that number on me.","Dennis McGill","Okay. We can follow up. And then just a more bigger picture, it sounds like right now it's widely accepted that San Fran and New York are going through an adjustment phase. But these are markets that I think most have said have come in below expectations and weaker than even maybe six months ago, but it doesn't sound like there's any assumption that other markets could follow that path. Is that right and then I guess what gives you confidence that there is not another one sort of uncertainty around the corner, especially with the urban portfolio. I understand the suburban protection, but any urban environment where supply is pretty pronounced virtually across the country?","Jerry Davis","Here is how I would think about it. First, New York and San Francisco are not really surprises to us. They are urban settings, when you see supply coming, you see it coming years in advance. Second, we've had great job growth in both of those markets, and both have tapered off to more of the norm. And so that combination kind of gives you what those markets are. As we look towards the future, we don\u2019t see as a big supply pressures coming at the urban portfolios, but we do have a concern about job growth sustaining itself, and I think everybody should. And were waiting to see how the election turns out and how the economy turns out, but in both of those camps that's -- the future will be what it's going to be.","So I'm not at all surprised about those two markets. We are not surprised about our outlay exposure. We saw it coming. What we see was this. These are supply driven numbers that are changing our pricing power. It is not the underlying fundamentals of demographics and or job markets that are driving our business right now. Those are still in very good shape. And so we we're very focused on the supply pressure, and think we have a very good handle on it, feel good about the way we're running the business to deal with that supply. When it abates, we think we're back to guns on pricing, and we'll do very well in that environment. ","Tom Toomey","And I would just add, even though we don\u2019t see any markets right now, if one pop-up for let's say there is job loss in a particular market or something like that, that goes back to the benefit of being in 20 markets and having that A and B portfolio. We've got other markets that can counterbalance something like that.","Operator","And at this time, it appears we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to President and CEO, Tom Toomey for any additional or closing remarks.","Tom Toomey","Great, thank you again for all of your time. Again, I think we had a very solid quarter on all fronts. Certainly we remain focused on the strategic plan and the execution of it. A big part of that is just execution and we're doing it right now. What is the strategic plan focused on? Growing cash workflow through all points in the cycle. We're going through one of those right now. You can see from our results we're still able to sustain and guide to on a strong cash flow number, and I think that's attributed to the team in the room, in particular Jerry and his operating team, and their focus on adjusting their strategies by individual assets, by unit types to meet the market and get ahead of it if you will. And also we're enjoying a very good strong development pipeline that's leasing up very well and gives us confidence for the future.","So with that, we thank you again for your time and look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a nice day."],"20873":["UDR, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Vice President, Chris Van Ens. Thank you, Mr. Van Ens. You may begin.","Chris Van Ens","Welcome to UDR\u2019s quarterly financial results conference call. Our press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","Statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. Moving to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone\u2019s time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to UDR\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Chris and welcome to UDR\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, President and Chief Operating Officer and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officer, Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","The five topics I will cover today include a short recap of 2018; our high level 2019 macro outlook; UDR\u2019s 2019 strategy; capital deployment opportunities; and the senior executive promotions announced early in January. First, we again produced strong results across all aspects of our business during the quarter and for the full year. Like many REITs, our stock took a wild ride in 2018, but macroeconomic forces remained supportive of apartment fundamentals and our best-in-class operations, diversified portfolio and disciplined capital allocation allowed us to take advantage. We produced sector-leading top line growth, twice raised same-store and earnings guidance ranges and finished the year at the top end of our FFO adjusted per share range. I would personally like to thank all of our associates for a great 2018.","Second, from a high level perspective, we expect 2019 to be relatively similar to 2018, that is solid economics, demographics and fundamental backdrop, accompanied by bouts of share price volatility throughout the year. UDR tends to perform well in this type of environment. In 2019, we again expect to be near the top of the group in same-store growth with better flow-through to the bottom line as our large developments move towards stabilization and we take advantage of embedded opportunities like the option asset purchases completed subsequent to year end. Should we encounter a different 2019 economic environment, I am confident that UDR is setup well for success on a relative basis.","Third, we do not anticipate any meaningful changes to our overall strategy in 2019. In 2018, we set forth two key areas that would enhance UDR\u2019s cash flow growth in the years ahead, being the next iteration of our operating platform and capital allocation that will increasingly be influenced by predictive analytics. In both, we see the adoption of technology as a disruptive and driving factor. Historically, we have benefited from a number of technology driven initiatives and as a result have fostered a culture that embraces these advances. This is an advantage we will continue to grow moving forward.","Next, we have a wide variety of capital sources and uses available to us, but we will continue to be disciplined in our deployment. Internally sourced investment opportunities include fixed-price options on recently developed assets, redevelopment, densification of our communities, legacy land utilization, revenue-enhancing CapEx and investing in our operating platform, externally sourced opportunities include development, DCP and acquisitions. Year-to-date 2019, we have invested in a variety of these opportunities, showcasing the flexibility of our capital allocation strategy as potential uses continue to compete for capital based on risk-adjusted returns and expected accretions.","Lastly, developing talent remains a top priority for myself and the rest of the senior leadership team. The senior executive promotions we announced in January are part of a process that has been ongoing for a number of years. Jerry, Andrew, Mike, Matt, Bob and Dave are all deserving of the recognition they have earned, as are all the other UDR associates that have moved up in the ranks. On a side note, Jerry\u2019s promotion to president is not a signal that he is stepping back from operations, but rather that he is handing more of the day-to-day tasks over to Mike Lacey as he focuses on implementing the next iteration of our operating platform and ensuring strong execution. I have worked with Jerry for 18 years and Mike has worked with Jerry for 12 of those 18. I look forward to many more.","With that, I\u2019d like to again thank all of our associates for the hard work put in to making 2018 another great year. We are excited to carry this success into 2019. I\u2019ll turn the call over now to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to announce another quarter and full year of strong operating results. Fourth quarter same-store revenue and NOI growth rates were 3.7% and 3.4% and full year 2018 growth rates were 3.5% and 3.4% respectively. For the quarter, our sector leading results continue to be driven by first, a widening blended lease rate spread that averaged 110 basis points above last year\u2019s comparable period; robust occupancy averaging 96.8%; year-over-year annualized turnover that declined by 130 basis points; other income growth of nearly 12%; year-over-year controllable expense growth that has declined by 1.2%; and the continuation of positive trends and move-outs to home purchase and rent increase, both of which remain low at 11.6% and 5.4%, respectively.","Moving on the primary 2019 macroeconomic assumptions that underpin our outlook are national job growth of approximately 170,000 per month with wage growth above 3%. This compares to 2018 job and wage growth of 220,000 per month and 2.8% respectively. Next, this is set against a relatively flat year-over-year delivery forecast after potential slippages factored in. And last, B quality suburban properties are expected to generally outperform A quality and urban assets. 2019 UDR-specific assumptions, which are driven by the macro forecast we utilize and by community-specific ground-up assumptions are as follows: our operating earn-in was approximately 40 basis points higher versus last year; overall pricing power in the form of blended lease rate growth will be better than 2018; occupancy is expected to remain in the high 96% range; other income should continue to grow at high single digits but not as robustly as in 2018; controllable expense growth is forecast to remain in check due to ongoing efficiency initiatives and the preliminary implementation of operating platform improvements; non-controllable expenses, such as real estate taxes will continue to pressure our bottom line due to 421 burn-off in New York and higher valuations in assorted markets and same-store community additions for the full year will not materially impact our revenue or NOI growth forecast. Additions to our same-store pool are available on Attachment 7(b) of our supplement. Also please note, 10 Hanover, located in downtown Manhattan and Garrison Square, located in Boston are being positioned for redevelopment later in 2019. Their eventual exclusion from the mature pool is contemplated in our full year same-store revenue and NOI growth guidance ranges, positively impacting them by 5 and 25 basis points, respectively. Taken together, full year 2019 same-store revenue growth is forecasted 3% to 4%, expense growth at 2.75% to 3.75% and NOI growth at 3.25% to 4.25%, which compare favorably versus the peer group and to 2018.","Next, as Tom indicated in his remarks, I spent a great deal of my time in 2018 and will be spending even more of my time in 2019, implementing the next iteration of our operating platform, ensuring proper execution in the years ahead. I\u2019m proud of what our operations teams have accomplished over the past 10 years with regard to the successes of our top line and expense growth initiatives, both of which expanded our margins significantly.","Moving forward, we are working diligently to become even more efficient by centralizing and outsourcing repetitive non-customer-facing tasks at the site level, implementing an enhanced suite of resident self-service options available on smart devices and utilizing the internal data we track to better price our apartments and operate our communities. Where are we embarking on the next phase of our platform now? The answer is threefold. First, our customers are demanding that we conduct an increasing amount of business with them in a more simplified, technological-driven manner, similar to how they conduct business in other aspects of their life. To satisfy these demands, UDR must move more of our day-to-day interaction with residents online, similar to what they did with legacy initiatives, such as online rent payment, service request and leasing, all of which have higher than 80% penetration rates. Akin to companies that have successfully adopted transformational technologies in other industries, UDR will continue to invest and pivot as necessary to best serve our residents\u2019 needs.","Second, the technologies we will deploy have come a long way and are generally ready for primetime. Over the coming years, these solutions will allow our associates to perform their jobs more efficiently by focusing more of their time on value-add pursuits, such as improved customer service. And third we have a culture of innovation and success wherein we are focused on continued improvement. In 2019, we intend to invest approximately $20 million on smart home tech that will start us down this path. These installations will address about half of our opportunity set, with another $10 million in spend expected to take place in 2020 to round out the majority of our remaining communities. Smart home tech includes smart locks controlled by a mobile device, smart thermostats, water-leak detecting sensors and smart light switches. To-date, we have completed 1,800 home installations with rent premiums between $20 and $30 depending on the market, although there are clearly significant benefits to our controllable expenses as well. An additional $30 million investment in other technologies for the overall operating platform will also occur over the next 3 years. Some of this will be funded by successful investments in third-party technology firms, such as the one we highlighted on the face of our press release.","Ultimately, we envision that these investments will meaningfully expand our margins, make our associates more efficient, make UDR a better place to work and improve our customers\u2019 all around experience through an enhanced resident app, self-guided touring, improved pricing, more efficient workflow and greater resident satisfaction. To close out this subject, we have consistently improved our platform through the adoption of new technologies over the past 10 years, all of which has benefited our customer, the company and our shareholders. What I outlined previously in my remarks represents the next step in our evolution. Our company culture has consistently been one that promotes and rewards innovation, which gives us confidence in our ability to execute while not taking our eye off of core operations.","Moving on a quick overview of market-level growth expectations for 2019, Orlando, Tampa, the Monterey Peninsula, Boston, Seattle and San Francisco are forecast to grow same-store revenue at a rate above the high end of our 3% to 4% portfolio growth range. We expect New York and Baltimore to come in below the low end. All other markets are forecast to grow top lines within the collars of our portfolio range. Last, our development pipeline continues to generate strong lease rates and velocities. While the current wave of projects was 85% leased on average at year-end and, therefore, closed reaching physical stabilization, economic stabilization is still a couple of years away.","We are quite pleased with how our lease-ups performed during 2018, with 345 Harrison, our 585 home, $363 million project in Boston; Vitruvian West, our 383 home, $59 million project in Addison, Texas; and Vision on Wilshire, our 150 home, $127 million project in Los Angeles, all exceeding expectations. In closing, I appreciate the opportunity that Tom and the board provided me, and I would like to thank all of our associates in the field and at corporate for producing another strong year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe.","Joe Fisher","Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter results and forward guidance, a transactions update and a capital markets and balance sheet update. Our fourth quarter earnings results came in at the high-ends of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.50 and $0.46. Fourth quarter FFOA grew 5% year-over-year driven by strong same-store and lease-up performance and accretive capital deployment.","Next, I will provide several high level comments on our 2019 guidance, the details of which can be found on Attachment 15 of our supplement. Full year 2019 FFOA per share guidance is $2.03 to $2.07 and AFFO is $1.87 to $1.91. Primary drivers of the $0.09 of growth between our 2018 FFOA of $1.96 and our 2019 $2.05 midpoint include: a positive impact of approximately $0.08 from same-store stabilized JVs in commercial operations; a positive impact of approximately $0.05 from development, DCP and other transactional activity; a negative impact of approximately $0.01 each from higher G&A and the timing drag associated with the recent equity issuance; a negative impact of approximately $0.02 from higher incremental financing costs, inclusive of higher LIBOR expectations.","Moving on as Jerry indicated in his remarks, our full year 2019 same-store growth forecast is 3% to 4% for revenue, 2.75% to 3.75% for expenses and 3.25% to 4.25% for NOI, with forecasted occupancy of 96.8% to 97.0%. For the first quarter of 2019, our guidance ranges are $0.48 to $0.50 for FFOA and $0.46 to $0.48 for AFFO. Next, transactions, during the quarter, we sold Circle Towers, a 46-year-old, 604-home community located in the Fairfax County submarket of Washington, D.C. for $160 million.","Subsequent to quarter end, we completed numerous transactions. First, we exercised purchase options on Parallel, a 386-home community located in the Platinum Triangle submarket of Anaheim, California and CityLine 2, a 155-home community located in suburban Seattle for a total cash outlay of $132 million to buy out our JV partner\u2019s equity interest and pay off construction debt. Our total investment in the communities is $184 million. Both were acquired at a discount to market value and at a weighted average FFO cap rate of 5.3% on our blended investment. Second, we entered into a contract to purchase Leonard Pointe, a 188-home community located in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, for $132 million at a high 4s FFO cap rate. The community is 4 years old, has operational upside is highly walkable, has easy access to Manhattan via the L line and to Long Island City via the G line and increases our exposure to our a target market. The transaction is scheduled to close in the first quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.","Last, we acquired 500 Penn Street, a development site in the Union Market district of Washington DC for $27 million. We have been working on this deal for nearly 3 years and are excited about the vibrant, large-scale redevelopment underway around the site. And we closed on 1590 Grove Street, a development site located in the Sloan\u2019s Lake submarket of Denver, which we originally put under contract during the first quarter of 2018 for $14 million.","Regarding development, our pipeline totaled $779 million at year-end. It was 85% leased and 99% funded. We continue to assess new development opportunities but, similar to the past several years, remain disciplined in our underwriting. Over the next several years, we anticipate that our pipeline will stabilize at a level below where we have been through much of this cycle, likely in the $400 million to $600 million range, which is in keeping with our 3-year liquidity profile targets. On the DCP front, our investment, inclusive of accrued preferred return, stands at $199 million today.","No additional deals were signed during the fourth quarter, but we continue to see a wide variety of opportunities with new and legacy partners. Our 2019 uses guidance of $20 million to $30 million only contemplates funding projects already in our pipeline, but we have approximately $100 million to $150 million of additional capacity that we can choose to deploy. As a reminder, we have 1 more fixed price option in the West Coast development JV and we will make a buy\/sell decision on it when our purchase window opens in 2020. On the remainder of the in-place pipeline, we have back end participation and a seat at the table upon sale.","As Jerry indicated in his remarks, we are positioning 10 Hanover, located in downtown Manhattan and Garrison Square located in Boston for redevelopment. We anticipate these projects will both start later in 2019. The total 2019 guidance spend of $25 million to $35 million also includes some smaller-scale unit additions at other stabilized properties. Big picture, we have a variety of capital sources and uses with competition taking place within each bucket. Today, we remain focused on opportunities in redevelopment, development, DCP and acquisitions. Moving forward, we will remain flexible with our deployment and will continue to pivot to take advantage of the best-available risk-adjusted return as long as opportunities meet our hurdles and can be accretively funded.","Next, capital markets and balance sheet, during the quarter, we issued a 7.15 million common shares for net proceeds of approximately $300 million. The deal was well executed; priced at a premium to consensus NAV on a net basis; was 25% above the price at which we executed our buyback earlier in 2018; and provided us optionality with regard to asset sales later in the year, should we find incremental investment opportunities. All of the proceeds are earmarked for deployment over the near term. Also during the quarter, we issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured debt at an effective coupon of 4.27% after hedging. Proceeds were used to prepay $196 million of 5.28% secured debt originally scheduled to mature in October and December of 2019 and for general corporate purposes. As a result, we have a minimal amount of debt coming due in 2019 with cash flow in excess of dividends and cash on hand from our recent equity issuance expected to fund nearly 60% of our uses guidance.","At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, net of the commercial paper balance, was $1.3 billion. Our consolidated financial leverage was 31% on un-depreciated book value, 23% on enterprise value and 28% inclusive of joint ventures. Our consolidated net debt to EBITDA RE was 5.0x and inclusive of joint ventures was 5.6x. We remain comfortable with our credit metrics and don\u2019t plan to actively lever up or down from our average 2018 levels. Finally, in conjunction with this release, the board approved an annualized dividend of $1.37 per share for 2019, a 6% increase over 2018. The yield as of year end was approximately 3.5%.","With that, I will open up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. What\u2019s the guidance for ancillary revenue growth in 2019 and what was it in 2018 and then how much will it contribute to same-store growth this year versus last year?","Jerry Davis","Hi, Nick, this is Jerry. Last year, we came into the year expecting other income to contribute or to grow at high single-digits and it came in just under 12% at 11.5% this year. As we go into this year once again, we think it\u2019s going to be high single-digits with the hope but not the expectation that it could go higher. It\u2019s all based on increased penetration in some markets. And when you look at the contribution it made to total revenue last year, it was in that 80 to 100 basis point range and this year it\u2019s expected to be probably in the 50 to 60 basis points of revenue growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Hey, good morning guys. Maybe just following up on Nick\u2019s comment there, it looks like at least for the companies that we cover you have peer-leading same-store revenue growth and same-store FFO growth. In the past, you have had pretty attractive same-store revenue growth, but the FFO growth has been more in line. So I am curious what\u2019s driving that FFO growth in 2019 and then maybe you could breakdown the other income, is it development, is it sort of your lending program, how should we think about that?","Joe Fisher","Yes, hey, Rich, it\u2019s Joe. Couple of things in terms of what\u2019s driving it this year, obviously, the core growth as well as the joint venture in commercial is contributing to that year-over-year growth number. But as we came through it last year, remember, we had $800 million pipeline on the development side that was really going just into the lease-up phase. So, it kind of came off of cap interest took on full expense load, but we are working up on the occupancy and revenue side. So there is about $0.01 drag last year to our run-rate FFO numbers. This year, we think it\u2019s probably about $0.02 accretive. So you can add a $0.03 swing if you will year-over-year. In addition, if you go to that DCP pipeline, you look at what Harry and team have been able to do on that front in terms of continuing to deploy capital, that\u2019s been accretive for us as well. And then on the financing front, while rates continue to tick higher, we have tried to get out ahead of some of the prepayment and refi activity and lock in lower rates on that front, which has helped us well. So overall, you kind of have core driving $0.08 of it, transaction activity driving around $0.05 and then you have interest coming off $0.02 as well as G&A and the equity raise being about $0.01 each.","Rich Hill","Great. Very helpful color. Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hey, guys. Just touching on the Brooklyn acquisition, I mean, we have seen many of your peers reduce exposure to New York City recently. So you are clearly taking a contrarian view here in adding exposure. And I guess I am just curious, what gives you the confidence in the market I guess both near-term and longer term given some of the supply challenges we have seen? And then also curious, when you underwrote the transaction if you underwrote it with the L train being fully shutdown I guess over the near-term?","Joe Fisher","Hey, Austin, this is Joe. I will probably start it off and then Harry might be able to speak to some of the specific attributes on the asset submarket returns, but overall, with New York, you are right. It is a market that we can look at both Leonard and our 10 Hanover redevelopment. We are looking to get more dollars put to work in that market. While it has lagged of late from a regular standpoint given the supply picture, we are starting to see that come off. New York will be probably a little bit higher next year in terms of supply, but this is not a 1-year trade for us. We are thinking about the next 5 to 10 years. And so while supply has dampened that rent growth, when you look at the underlying economic kind of drivers of that market meaning job growth, income growth, population growth and as well as the diversification of the employment base clearly getting more technology focused and diversifying away from just kind of the fire type of jobs. We think we are setup to see kind of mean reversion on the rent growth over the next 5 to 10 years. So that\u2019s what got us positive on that front. So, I\u2019ll kick it over to Harry, and he can probably talk a little deal specific.","Harry Alcock","Sure, this is Harry. The property just, first of all, is we think, is very well located in the North Williamsburg area of Brooklyn. It\u2019s a block from McCarren Park. It\u2019s really in an established residential neighborhood, even though the property is only 3, 4 years old. Away from the glut of new supply in downtown Brooklyn and the Williamsburg Waterfront, it really is very difficult to get density in this neighborhood. The property has been fully occupied for 2 years, has a 25-year tax abatement, fully abated until 2036. And you mentioned the L train, when we contracted put this property under agreement, the L train was still supposed to be taken offline entirely. During the due diligence process, you saw the news that there will still be the L line, L train will still continue to run. So, the there is our initial underwriting contemplated the L train stopped entirely. Today, we are well aware of the circumstances which should be positive.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Trent Trujillo","Hi good morning and congrats, Jerry and all the other team members on recent promotion. Just thinking about other markets, you also recently commented on attractiveness of Philadelphia and how you\u2019re looking to expand your presence there. So since we\u2019re coming off the NMHC conference, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve surfaced any opportunities to act on this.","Joe Fisher","Yes. It\u2019s Joe. We did do the DCP deal that we talked about last year, 1300 Fairmount, for around $52 million or so. It is a market we want to continue to gain more exposure to for some of the reasons we\u2019ve talked about in the past. Coming out of NMHC, there\u2019s always plenty of deal flow coming out of that. But we have been looking, not just on the DCP side, but we\u2019re looking at development opportunities there to try to rebuild that pipeline. We\u2019re looking at acquisition opportunities as well. So, to the extent that we can find something that we think is going to be accretive, not just near-term but to longer-term growth, and then also have the ability to lay on the operational platform that Jerry spoke to in his opening remarks and also put in some more initiative penetration, I think there\u2019s an opportunity for the platform to drive outsized revenue growth there as well. So, we are looking. I think the good thing about the equity offering that we did in December, it created a lot of optionally for us around transaction so that we can consider instead of just using dispositions or moving dispositions from the plan, we now have the opportunity to try to figure out how to drive some additional FFO growth for the platform going forward.","Trent Trujillo","Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up, in the prepared comments, I think you mentioned that you expected B quality assets to outperform A in 2019. Can you maybe talk about the magnitude of that performance gap, how it compares to 2018 and if you expect that gap to trend in a particular way during the year?","Jerry Davis","In this is Jerry. In 2018, I think across our portfolio, it was probably 75 to 100 basis points of outperformance. So, I think as you go into this next year, we would expect it to be roughly that same magnitude maybe a bit tighter, but not materially different.","Trent Trujillo","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon guys. Jerry, when you were putting together your same-store revenue range for \u201819 which markets you and your team think had the widest band of likely outcomes for 2019 and if one market falls short of your \u201819 expectations when we are speaking a year from now, which market do you think that\u2019s likely to be?","Jerry Davis","Probably the ones with the largest ranges are the ones that have the heaviest amounts of supply. But what we\u2019re really looking at that determines the ranges is job growth in those markets. So, 3 that really jump out are Seattle, New York and San Francisco. We expect Seattle to be a good-performing market this next year, but a lot of it is contingent upon a continuation of job growth. Same is true in San Francisco. New York, while it\u2019s going to be one of our lower-performing markets, we still expect it to be almost 100 basis points improved revenue growth from last year. So, we\u2019ve been encouraged recently. Joe was going through some of the attributes that we saw in the Brooklyn deal. As we look at more recent rent growth there, as you see in our supplement on Attachment 8(g), new lease rate growth in the fourth quarter was 1.5%. That compares to a company average of 1%. And actually, in the month of January, new lease rate growth was 1.3%. So, we\u2019re encouraged by New York today, but we are cognizant that dependent on job growth, it could change. And then the fourth market that you have significant amounts of new supply, none of it\u2019s not much is in our backyard, is LA. LA, I would say, just always has a little bit of risk for us on the same-store side because 3 of our 4 same-store assets are located in Marina del Rey. So, when you have that kind of a concentration, if the development that is coming at us goes a little crazy on lease-up concessions, it can affect us. I guess, if there was one, I look at that could surprise to the downside and this is probably just looking more at conventional opinion, Seattle. We feel like our Seattle portfolio, while it\u2019s heavily located in Bellevue and Bellevue is \u2013 West Bellevue is not going to have that much new supply. If you do feel concessionary problems come from both Redmond where supply is going to be heavy or downtown, it could affect us.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hightower","Hi, guys. How are you?","Jerry Davis","Hey, Rich.","Rich Hightower","Good. I am going to do a quick question here on the smart home technology investment you described in the prepared remarks. I am just curious how you guys think about that investment and given the plethora of options probably available to a company like UDR and how you pick among vendors and think about potential obsolescence over the next several years as new technology comes down the pike? And then also, how did you get to the $20 to $30 rent premium you described, how do you measure that exactly?","Jerry Davis","Yes, Rich, it\u2019s Jerry. I will tell you we did look at a lot of vendors and we participated with one that we have a lot of confidence in. He is the company has success with other installations historically most predominantly in the single family home industry. When you look at the return, we measure the return and it\u2019s about a 12% to 13% IRR based on about a 6, 6.5-year life on this investment. We think there is also as I said in my remarks benefits on the expense side. One of the key features of this is leak detectors. And as you know, in high-rises as well as garden communities, water damage can be very expensive, so catching it early drives down insurance cost as well as R&M. We think by having these electronic locks, it saves our maintenance teams time in responding to service requests as well as just having to change out locks, and it also cuts down on overtime because we don\u2019t have to come out and do lockouts for residents. So, there\u2019s quite a bit of it on the expense side, too. When you look at the $20 to $30 premium, we\u2019re going to add that to the rent. So, we will be able to measure what our spread in rents was before and after installation compared to the market to ensure that we\u2019re getting that benefit. I can tell you, as I said in my opening remarks, we\u2019ve installed almost 2,000 of these. The response from the residents has been very positive. I think a lot of them already had things like Amazon Echoes in their apartments that they\u2019re tying into the system to help make it work. I think they see the convenience factors, especially on the locks, to be able to open them remotely from their mobile device when they have friends, dog sitters, people like that coming to their houses. I think for our single parents that, or parents in general, that have school-age kids that get home from school, you get a notification when the door opens. So, it gives you that kind of calmness that your child has returned home. Overall, we think it\u2019s a big benefit for the resident. We think there is a significant benefit to us. We realize that technology does change, but we think this technology is cutting edge and should last at least for 6, 6.5 years before we have to reinvest.","Rich Hightower","Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful color. Let me ask another question. So UDR I think has at least among your public peers as far as we can tell, has been, I don\u2019t know if you want to call it at the forefront, but fairly active and rigorous in pursuit of sort of the data analytics side and how you select markets for investment in the future. And New York is a market that you guys have described as maybe being a contrarian play. Philly, I think, was one that screened well in your according to your methodology as well. But are there other markets out there, and I don\u2019t want to you to give away the playbook, but other markers that sort of screen well from a contrarian perspective versus what the consensus view on that given market might be today and where you guys might differ?","Joe Fisher","Yes. Hey, Rich. There definitely are other markets that we are actively looking in and trying to deploy capital into. So, I think as you look forward to our actions over the, call it, the next 12, 24 months, you\u2019ll probably see the fruit of those labors. So, I think you\u2019ll see where we\u2019re trying to go. From a sourcing standpoint, yes, there\u2019s markets that may not screen as well for us. But keep in mind, there\u2019s always asset-specific, submarket-specific, tax-specific as well as CapEx reasons that you may want to sell an asset. So, I\u2019d say, our disposition strategy is probably a little bit less focused on the portstrat work. We\u2019ll still use it as a factor, but there are a lot of other factors that come into it, whereas the deployment of focusing personnel resources and capital resources is a lot more focused across the board.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Spector","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just maybe if we could start with the macro, I heard Tom say that the macro remains supportive and we are getting lots of incoming calls, questions on just the macro. From again just to confirm from what you are seeing, whether it\u2019s web traffic right now, I guess all indicators are showing that in your markets, the macro environment remains stable, good?","Jerry Davis","Yes, this is Jerry. I would tell you, when you look at total income growth for our markets, it\u2019s screening higher than it is for the country in general at over 6% total income. We expect job growth. When you look at how we have built up some of our budget and plan expectations, we do see job creation coming down somewhat to probably about 170,000 jobs per month, but we do see an increase in wage growth in our markets. So, you\u2019ve got that. Then on the supply side, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a whole lot different in our peer set. I think overall, we see a slight increase in supply next year and it deviates market by market.","Joe Fisher","Hey, Jeff, this is Joe. Maybe just a couple of other things as it relates to capital allocation, thoughts too, on that front. While we do see positive macroeconomic backdrops, you have seen a lot of activity out of us in the first quarter as well as the intent to kind of rebuild that pipeline on the development side to roughly half of where it\u2019s been most of this cycle. I don\u2019t want you to take away from that, that we are overly bullish or risk-on from a cycle standpoint or that we have adjusted our underwriting or discipline around that by any sense. It\u2019s really just a byproduct of a couple of things. Those being one, timing in that you have seen the two options from Wolff that started back in 2015 coming to fruition. The Union Market land was started 3 years ago, Denver was started over a year ago. So, some of this activity is just simply a byproduct of timing of a lot of these deals coming to a head at once as well as the optionality that we talked about that the equity offering give us to kind of go out there and think about where we can deploy capital that supports the grow rate. So, don\u2019t take our comments on macro and the recent activity to think that we are overly bullish on where we are going and that we are switching to a risk-on posture.","Jerry Davis","Jeff, that being said, we have got January in the books. And when you look at new lease rate growth in January, it was at 0.9%, which is comparable to what it was in the fourth quarter, and it\u2019s about 120 basis points on the new lease side, higher than we were last year. So, you\u2019ve got that on top of 96.8% physical occupancy. So, we are off to a good start this year.","Jeff Spector","Great, thanks. All very helpful comments. And then just one other question on expenses, I know you said real estate taxes of course will continue to pressure overall expenses but the rest remain in check. Can you confirm the predictive analytics that you are referring to are you using that for the expense controls, because you seem to be doing a better job than your peers on that front?","Jerry Davis","No, we are really not utilizing the predictive analytics. So, I think on the expense side, what you\u2019ve seen is us really get a start on this operating platform that we discussed in the prepared remarks. And I think when you look at how we\u2019ve done in the fourth quarter, our controllable expenses, which are everything except real estate taxes and insurance, we\u2019re down 1.4%. You\u2019re going to see an increase in repairs and maintenance but a pretty good decrease in personnel. And that\u2019s really a function of us outsourcing more pieces of our business to more efficiently drive down the total cost structure. So, I think a lot of what we\u2019ve done so far is related to outsourcing and centralization of certain functions to become more efficient. I think we\u2019ve improved some of the analytics we use on the marketing side. I think we\u2019ve, on the utility side, done a very good job of putting in more energy-efficient lighting and other tools. And I think you\u2019re doing to see those continue. So while we\u2019re still expecting real estate pressures next year, it will come down somewhat from what it was this year. But our expectation is those controllable expenses stay in check, probably close to flat as we look out into 2019. And I think as we continually drive down our margin through this new operating platform, it\u2019s going to help our existing portfolio, but more importantly, it\u2019s going to give us a platform so that when we\u2019re looking to make other investments in the future, whether it\u2019s acquisitions or developments, you are going to see better flow-through on those and more value creation.","Jeff Spector","Great. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you and wonderful job. I am just trying to drill down a little bit more on the CapEx spend. If I look at the Attachment 14, you are at about $2,300 a unit for capitalized expenditures on consolidated homes. If you add tech spend to that and maybe you have already, what\u2019s your tech spend per unit for the next few years? And then if you look at redevelopment, a good run rate of the redevelopment, which isn\u2019t adding to your unit count but is just a major overhaul of a project, how much whole dollars should we expect to spend or you expect to spend on technology as well as redevelopment?","Joe Fisher","Hey, John, this is Joe. Just on the return as web enhancing, that $2,300, that does not take into account these spends for the new platform. So, the spend that Jerry has referred to on that front for the technology spend will be separately categorized from this, and we\u2019ll provide that guidance. You can see back on Attachment 15 where we provide overall guidance for the platform spend of $25 million to $35 million this year. That\u2019s for both the technology spend as well as the smart home spend that he referred to. So that\u2019s going to be separate from this. What we\u2019re trying to show you on Attachment 14 is really the recurring CapEx required for the business to drive that NOI, so that\u2019s what the recurring number should be.","John Guinee","And then on redevelopment, you have got $25 million to $35 million, how many units is that? And are you adding any units when you redevelop spend $25 million to $35 million on redeveloping existing properties?","Joe Fisher","Yes, there is a couple of different buckets in there and Harry or Jerry can probably go into some of the details, but the $25 million to $35 million, yes, it\u2019s not a set level that we try to get to each and every year. It\u2019s opportunity-dependent, as those opportunities come along. So, in this case, we talked about Hanover as well as Garrison. That is embedded in this, but that\u2019ll be a multiyear spend. So, it\u2019ll drag over a couple of years. And we\u2019ll provide more disclosure going forward as those deals start about what the total expectations of spend are, the completion dates, et cetera. In addition to those larger type of products \u2013 or projects, you\u2019re going to see densification opportunities, unit additions, creative things that we\u2019re trying to do to take advantage of underutilized space, so taking underutilized amenities or garage space. We\u2019re trying to add units into the projects, so that spend will be embedded in it as well.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Jerry thanks for the comments on 10 Hanover and Garrison impact to same-store, could you provide the same-store revenue and NOI impact for all changes, net additions and subtractions to same-store in \u201819?","Jerry Davis","That\u2019s pretty much what it is. When you really looked at the other additions and there weren\u2019t many, it really didn\u2019t have any effect on it.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And then on property taxes outside of California and New York where there is pretty good visibility, what regions you are expecting the most pressure on property tax growth rates in \u201819 versus \u201818?","Jerry Davis","There is probably the same ones that we are going to see the pressure and that would be Florida, Texas, Seattle would be the heaviest pressure points.","John Pawlowski","Alright. And last one for me, Joe, I understand you are comfortable with the credit metrics, if GSE reform becomes more real, at any point would you try to get to improved credit rating to try to get your unsecured costs down?","Joe Fisher","Hey, John. I would honestly say that the GSE reform aspect and our credit rating and desire to move up in credit rating are probably independent of each other as we\u2019ve traditionally been a, unsecured borrower and had very competitive cost to capital on that front as a BBB+. And so, we\u2019ve gone through that whole analysis of if we tried to upgrade on rating, what we\u2019d have to give up in terms of a deleveraging and what the dilution would be to that. And to date, we have not been able to make sense of upgrading and trying to offset that with multiple as we don\u2019t think our multiple has been impaired due to our credit profile. I do think if the GSEs do tend to reform and\/or go away, like the important considerations are when you look at us as a public company, like you said, we do have a lot of different sources of capital. In addition, when you look at our asset base, which is a higher quality asset base, which is typically not as levered in the private market, we are probably more insulated as a public company relative to the private market from any impact of the GSEs.","John Pawlowski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Tayo Okusanya","Hi, yes, good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just had one quick follow-up. A comment you that you made earlier on about the development being close to physical stabilization, but it will be several years before they hit economic stabilization. I was wondering could you talk a little bit about that, I would have thought things like what\u2019s called what am I thinking about discounts and things like that, that kind of come off fairly quickly. I am just surprised you are talking about there is a big time difference between physical stabilization and economic stabilization?","Jerry Davis","Well, this is Jerry, Joe may want to jump in or Harry. When you think about physical stabilization, you complete the project, obviously, and then you start to lease up throughout. But frequently, that first year of lease-up, you\u2019re offering anywhere from 1 month, maybe 1.5 months of concession. You also have extensive marketing cost during that time frame. So that\u2019s physically stable, but not economically stable. As you get to that next year, the next turn of leases, typically, the concessions go away or for the most part go away and the marketing spend comes down dramatically that\u2019s when you start getting more of that full stabilized yield.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tayo.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning out there. Just two questions. First, on the JV same-store pool, the KFC and the Hanover or I guess MetLife, the same-store NOI has been was negative last year. And I am just curious is this I know a few years ago, you spoke about the rent levels of those properties being high-end maybe it was a problem pushing rents, but can you just talk about the performance of those assets and do you think that they will start to match your overall same store trends or you think that there is just something specific about where they are, where they are positioned in the market that they will continue to underperform?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I think at least in or in 2019 our expectation is revenue is probably going to be about 100 bps lower than what our same-store pool would be, so call it 2% to 3% and that\u2019s predominantly because they are in urban areas with high A+ products. So, they are competing more than our average portfolio against new supply. The expense growth is going to be more elevated too, more in the 4% to 5% range predominantly due to real estate tax issues that are affecting that, but you should have this next year positive NOI somewhere in the 1% to 2% range. So, they will not do as well as our same stores.","Alexander Goldfarb","Jerry, are you thinking about keeping those longer term or those are future assets to sell?","Jerry Davis","I will start then these guys can jump in. I think this is just a temporary issue as we go through supply absorption. We have been going through it for the last year or two, but we like these assets. We like the locations and the product type. It\u2019s just the time \u2013 it\u2019s a time in the cycle where new supply has come into those more urban submarkets. So, it\u2019s not making us want to flee those assets.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then on the second question, Wall Street Journal Article B7 today highlighted that a number of municipality states contemplating different rent measures, including here in New York. That looks like it could target all apartments, not just the rent-stabilized. What are your thoughts on some of these proposals, especially here in New York? And are with these proposals, are they affecting the way that you think about underwriting the markets? Or in your view, this is all of normal course? And as you\u2019ve operated in markets over time, there\u2019s always this stuff, and it\u2019s just something that is part of the underwriting mix? Or is something shifting this time, as you guys observe?","Joe Fisher","Alex, this is Joe. I would say, first off, from a national basis, and it applies to New York as well, when we think about the affordability issues that exist out there, we continue to not believe that further regulations or compression on rents or caps on rents is probably the appropriate path forward to try to get new supply and new affordability out there. So hopefully, we get to a point where we can all work kind of collectively as constituents and get to a better place, but given our desire to be in New York, that\u2019s independent of the rent control issue or rent stabilization issue that\u2019s out there today. We have spent a lot more time thinking about this, going through and looking at the rhetoric that\u2019s out there, some of the commentary as well as looking back at past attempts at regulation to understand where this could potentially go, going forward. I do agree that we\u2019ve seen a couple of comments out there of market-wide rent stabilization talks, mainly from Julia Salazar. But I think most of the other rhetoric out there is really target the rent-stabilized piece. And so, when we look at that, when you kind of look at New York overall, it\u2019s important to keep in mind a couple of facts, which are: 50% of the market is market-based units, where the other 50% is effectively rent-stabilized and a small portion that\u2019s rent control. For our portfolio, pro forma for the Leonard acquisition, we\u2019ll be about 80% market rate and 20% rent-stabilized. So, I do think to the extent that anything happens on the rent-stabilized side, it will stand to benefit the market rate. So, we should see better rent growth, better forward rent growth valuations, just given supply will probably back off a little bit. The other thing for the rent stabilized piece, whether something happens there with better oversight of legal rents, CapEx, rent stabilized or preferential rents, you likely do still have a economic return and probably a lower volatility return. So, it\u2019s something we are focused on, something we are thinking about. We factored it into a downside underwriting for Leonard to try to think about what could be a worst case scenario if we went very draconian and we still thought given the probability of that happening, it made a lot of sense moving forward with that deal.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you Joe. Helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually just wanted to ask you about the progress you\u2019ve made on the expense side and what we can expect in the future. As you look across the different lines, Jerry, you talked a little bit about how the platform investments over time will help with the cost structure as well. Do you see that more on the repair and maintenance side or the personnel side? Are you able to be more efficient with the number of employees per building or things like that? Just some more color on those items.","Jerry Davis","Yes, it\u2019s exactly what you said. I think you\u2019re going to see the blend between R&M and personnel. I think we\u2019re going to be able to continually run at either flat to slightly negative, just like we did this year, as we create more efficiency, both on the cost structure as well as the workflow. So, but I would guess as you look forward to next year, you\u2019re going to see R&M probably inch up a little bit higher, but you\u2019re going to see personnel costs come down, even though you\u2019re going to have wage inflation across our markets of 3 plus expense. Our expectation is a natural attrition. We\u2019ll look for opportunities to be more efficient and outsource or centralize. And I think you are going to see the personnel come in probably lower than most of our competitors.","Hardik Goel","Also on the utilities line, do you think there is potential especially with buildings becoming more amenitized as we go through at least from a newer product that there is potential for these sensors and other technology and investments to kind of reduce those costs as you manage utilities for the amenitized or common spaces better?","Jerry Davis","Absolutely. I think when you look at common area, electric or gas and the temperatures that are in hallways or other common areas, we definitely have room for improvement there within our company. And I think when you look at that as well as again LED light fixtures, we are looking at solar, I am not sure if we will move forward with that. But we are looking at all kinds of opportunities to reduce any of the cost structure on the business that doesn\u2019t impact our residents.","Hardik Goel","Got it. Thanks so much. That\u2019s very helpful.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, there. I am sorry if I missed this, but did you mention specifically what the real estate tax growth outlook embedded in your 2019 same-store expense range is? And I guess as part of that how much of an assumption is embedded specifically from the 421-a tax abatement pressures in your New York portfolio and how long or approximately how many years of a headwind should we expect these tax abatements to be?","Joe Fisher","Hey, Haendel, for real estate tax next year, we think it\u2019s probably got to come in somewhere in the 7% to 8% range. If you look at what\u2019s really driving that, Jerry mentioned a couple of the markets already, but specific to 421 and I will expand that to redevelopment impact too from View 34. The 421, we just have 95 Wall in the same-store pool going forward next year. It\u2019s about a $700,000 impact on real estate taxes, which with over $100 million you are kind of in that 70 basis point type of range for impact. In addition, when you look at View 34, the big redevelopment that was completed several years back, the impact of that is flowing through into the valuations and therefore the real estate tax on a 5-year average basis. And so that one has cost us another call it 150 or so basis points on real estate taxes as well. So if you are kind of at 7.5 midpoint, our true unadjusted number is probably more in that kind of 450 to 500 basis point growth range.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, appreciate that. And then it sounds like we are at the front-end of the tax abatement headwind curve, approximately how long should we expect this to be a headwind approximately?","Joe Fisher","Yes, across the platform, we really only have two large 421 projects, that\u2019s 95 Wall and then 10 Hanover. As we have talked about in the past, I think last year, it was about $1.3 million. The collective impact this year will be about $1.8 million, and then we actually peak out in 2020 at just over $2 million. So we are actually coming up into the kind of 421 headwind and then it will start ramping down from there.","Harry Alcock","And Haendel I am not sure if you, this is Harry, if you were asking about the new acquisition in Brooklyn, but that has a 25-year tax abatement. It\u2019s fully abated until 2036 and then there is a 5-year bleed in.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then a follow-up on the ancillary revenue, I guess I am curious how much more of an opportunity is there. It sounds like maybe I am wrong, but should we infer from the deceleration in this year that the opportunity has been pretty much maxed out and will be on the wane going forward and maybe you could perhaps share some thoughts on perhaps the additional ancillary income levers beyond maybe the in-home technology that you are looking into that you can pull that can be incremental to your revenue over the next few years?","Jerry Davis","Sure, Haendel. And I would say this that the technology won\u2019t go into ancillary income that will be added as rent growth and when you look at the impact of the smart homes, it\u2019s probably 10 to 15 basis points of our revenue growth this year, but it\u2019s going to be more in the rents. But when you look at the ancillary income again last year it grew at call it, 11.5%. This year like I said we expect it to be high single-digits, although we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it got back up to low double-digits depending on success of continuation of parking as well as the short-term furnished rentals. So we are still growing that at multiples above what rents are growing. So, while it\u2019s slowing a bit or expected to slow a bit, it\u2019s still going to be a strong contributor. One other avenue that we started getting some traction on last year that we expect to grow this year are renting out to third-parties our common areas that are underutilized frequently, especially during daytime hours, to businesses. Last year, it was a modest contribution of call it $0.5 million. We think that this year is going to at least double and we think it\u2019s a platform that we have started out in the West Coast and it\u2019s moving eastward. So I think there is potential for that to grow. And I will tell you we are constantly looking for additional avenues to grow other income through pieces of our real estate outside of our core apartment units. So, while those are the items that are on the list today, I am confident over the next couple of years, we will continue to reload.","Haendel St. Juste","Great. Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Bernstein","Hi, good afternoon. At NMHC, there was a lot of talk about co-living, co-working and so I just wanted to understand maybe what new issues you have on those and how you are incorporating that into your business model over the next couple of years?","Jerry Davis","Yes, we have looked and talked to people about co-living. We really haven\u2019t implemented anything. To-date, we haven\u2019t had occupancy pressures where we felt it was something that was necessary, but it is something we will continue to study. I do think when you look at the economic reasons that certain individuals move into co-living situations as well as social side of it, I think it\u2019s something that you could see progress and Harry may want to talk a little bit about one of our DCP deals in Philadelphia where they are actually going to have some co-living space. So we are seeing examples of new developments that are being actually built for co-living and not just converted existing apartment units. And I think by us being an investor in this deal, we will be able to actually watch it and see the benefits and some of the cons as they do their lease up and managing this. So Harry, anything you would add?","Harry Alcock","Yes, the DCP deal he is talking about is in Philly. It\u2019s near Temple University, about 25% of the 400 plus units are allocated to co-living and they kind of created a separate little area within the building, within the property to accommodate these. So we will see how that plays out over the next 18 to 24 months as the developer completes construction and we go through lease-up.","Daniel Bernstein","Okay. So it\u2019s not \u2013 if you are looking at it, it\u2019s not playing a huge role yet within the construct of your properties?","Jerry Davis","I would say, right now, it\u2019s not playing any role but it is something we are screening.","Daniel Bernstein","Okay. One last quick question if I could. Predicting job growth is probably like predicting the weather, I am not going to hold you to the 170,000 a month, but I was trying to understand within your guidance to occupancy and rate growth. Is there some range of job growth you are contemplating? And historically, if you look at \u2013 back at the real \u2013 or the economic cycles, there is some place 100,000 jobs a month, 50,000 jobs a month where you start seeing some more impact on occupancy if the economy doesn\u2019t look out so?","Joe Fisher","Yes. Hi, Dan. So when we go through kind of the overall budgeting process, it\u2019s a dual kind of two-legged approach from top down and bottom up. So bottom-up in the field is really based off of what do they see as competitive supply, what are the recent rent trends that they have and what\u2019s going on from a demand side within their market? So that\u2019s really how you get to the midpoint. And of course we overlay what we see coming from an overall top down supply and demand standpoint. We make sure that we feel comfortable with those forecasts as well and work with them on kind of refining it, but then the ranges around it, there isn\u2019t any easy one-to-one type of relationship that you can kind of come up with and say if 50,000 jobs down, here is what it does to revenue because it is so micro-oriented in terms of the submarket adds, etcetera. So we really don\u2019t have math that kind of takes you up and down to the high-end where we can say 170,000 is base case, but if we went to 120,000 here is where it goes.","Daniel Bernstein","Okay. Very good.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Chairman and CEO, Mr. Toomey for closing remarks.","Tom Toomey","Thank you and a quick wrap up. First, thank you again for your time and interest in UDR. We started off the call with a recap of 2018, which was a great year for us as well as our view of 2019, which we anticipate to be very similar to 2018. And we are off to a very good start. It\u2019s been a very good rewarding 45 days into the year. And with that, I would like to again thank all our associates for all the hard work they have put in and continue to do every day.

(Operator instructions). This conference is being recorded today, Monday, July 30, of 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations. ","Christopher G. Van Ens ","Thank you for joining us for UDR's second quarter financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC.

Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas W. Toomey ","Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","My comments today will focus on three topics; first, broad operating trends and our quarterly results; second, our business plan update; and finally, an update on our CFO search. Following my comments, Jerry will provide additional commentary on the operating results and emerging operating trends.","During the quarter our business continued to operate at high level, driven by accelerating new and renewal rental rate growth as well as stable occupancy. Multi-family supply and demand fundamentals continue to provide a strong tailwind for apartment owners and we expect will do so for a number of years to come. And especially for those REIT with portfolios concentrated in markets that exhibit above average job growth, low single-family home affordability, a high propensity to win and limited new multi-family supply pressure.","In the second quarter of 2012, core FFO per share of $0.33 increased by 3% year-over-year. Strong year-over-year same-store revenue and net operating income growth of 5.6% and 6.7% respectively, as well as solid execution in our non-same-store portfolio, drove the improvement. Offset by dilution from our late May secondary equity offering. Second, a business plan update. Creating shareholder value remains our top priority.","As such we will continue to focus on growing NAV per share and on increasing our cash flow per share, which in turn supports dividend growth. Increasing top line growth and expanding operating margins are low risk, insistent generators of NAV growth per share. Our strong operating platform has historically been one of UDRs hallmarks and we expect will continue to be our primary driver of NAV creation moving forward.","Capital allocation is the second variable in NAV growth equation. Over the past few years our portfolio quality and footprint has improved dramatically, primarily the result of purposeful repositioning into coastal gateway markets, while simultaneously selling suburban locations and non-core markets. Some comments with regard to these activities.","First, acquisition activity. We intend to further expand our presence in our core markets over time. Markets that exhibit above average job growth, low home affordability, a high propensity to rent and limited new multifamily supply pressures. The capitalization of any future acquisition will be determined in the context of a lower leveraged operating model, but currently there are limited number of deals that fit our acquisition criteria.","Second, disposition activity. We are on a number of communities located in non-core markets, but not all non-core markets are equivalent in our view. Let me break them down. We have several markets that do not fit our long-term operating plan and we intend to exit them over the next 12 to 18 months. Combined, these markets represent $200 million to $400 million of value, minimal when compared to our total enterprise value.","Beyond these, we operate in a number of geographies that do not fit our long-term plan, but serve as warehouses of capital until sold. These market would comprise the majority of our non-core portfolio are more susceptible to new supply and generate lower rents and margin than our coastal market. Some of these markets include Florida and Nashville, are generating solid results currently. We are in no hurry to sell these assets and these solid performers. Their ultimate disposition will depend on potential use to the proceeds, asset pricing and the cost of alternative capital sources at the time of sale. When the time is right these depositions will be consummated in the usual course of business and will represent normal capital recycling.","Moving on to development and redevelopment. We intend to deliver roughly 5% of the enterprise annually; this implies the development and redevelopment pipeline into $1 billion to $1.5 billion range, versus our current pipeline of $1 billion. When assuming a constant dollar funding approach, and a two to four-year average construction cycle. First, development, new development is an attractive option to drive external growth whereas acquisitions are often event-driven and therefore their timing is difficult to predict.","Development represents relatively predictable capital investment. Our current $742 million pipeline is 45% funded and 80% of it is scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2013. With stabilized yields the 100 basis points to 150 basis points above spot cap rates on average. We are confident in the value creation these project represent and will continue to target core coastal markets for future expansion.","Second, redevelopment. Redevelopment often is minimized in our prepared remarks but should not \u2013 given it's important to our business as well as significant value creation potential. Our current $279 million pipeline is 15% funded and 35% of it is scheduled to be delivered by the year end 2013. We continue to evaluate our existing portfolio for redevelopment opportunities and have identified candidates located in key markets including Southern California, Washington D.C. and San Francisco.","One final point on redevelopment. Our projects go beyond simple kitchen and bath upgrades. When redeveloping a community our objective is twofold; we aim to meaningfully grow rental rate while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement. All of our redevelopments are significant undertaking.","Moving on to cash flow per share growth. We expect that our improving operation as well as real estate investment we've made over the past three years will drive growth in years ahead.","With regard to the balance sheet, we've reached peer average leverage metrics following our late May equity offering in the subsequent community disposition activity. We have worked diligently over the past three years to deleverage our balance sheet and do not intend to re-risk it, even as we continue to examine growth opportunity, we expect that this strategy will yield dividends moving forward, especially in more volatile economic times.","Finally, our CFO search has progressed. We have retained an executive search firm. We understand the importance of filling this position in a timely manner, but we also have the necessary skill set at UDR to wait for the right hire. To summarize all aspects of our business continue to perform well.","With that, I\u2019ll pass the call over to Jerry.","Jerry A. Davis ","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, same-store and operating income grew 6.7%, driven by 5.6% year-over-year increase in revenue and somewhat offset by expense growth of 3.3% versus last year at this time, same-store income per occupied home increased by 5.6% to $1,330 while same-store occupancy remained flat at 95.8%.","As we indicated on our first quarter conference call, 2012 is unfolding according to plan. In the second quarter, effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities accelerated 4.5% on average. Renewal rate growth remained comparable versus previous quarters averaging 6.5% higher per year. Accounting for approximately 31% of our same-store NOI, San Francisco, Boston, Austin, Dallas and Orange County were our best-performing same-store markets during the quarter, delivering weighted average revenue growth of 8.5% year-over-year.","Market such as other Mid-Atlantic, Sacramento markets and Monterey Peninsula struggled, contributed a relatively minimal 9% of same-store NOI in the second quarter. Weighted average revenue growth for these markets was 0.4% year-over-year. Resident turnover remains relatively contained at an annualized rate of 58% for the second quarter, 300 basis points higher than last year at this time. Importantly the pace at which we've been able to refill move out has not slowed.","Turning to the performance of our non-same-store wholly-owned communities. 4,600 homes are approximately 65% of our total non-mature pool were stabilized during both the first and second quarters of 2012. These 14 communities generated sequential revenue growth of 3.6% during the second quarter, far outperforming our same-store sequential revenue growth of 2.0%. Our non-mature communities now contribute 26% of NOI down from approximately 32% last quarter. As 2012 progresses we expect this to decline to approximately 15% of NOI by year-end.","As you can see on Attachment 7(NYSE:C) Highlands and Marin, a redevelopment located near San Francisco and (indiscernible), the first phase while the Vitruvian Park project both entered our same-store pool during the second quarter. Another 2,350 non-mature homes around our same-store portfolios by year-end 2012. These are primarily located in higher growth markets including Washington D.C., San Francisco, Boston and New York and have a weighted average income per occupied home of 2,185 in the second quarter. By year-end 2012 these additions should increase our same-store income per occupied home to roughly 1,385 all else being equal. Additional details can be found on attachment 7(NYSE:B) of our quarterly supplement.","A brief update on New York. As many of you head during our Columbus Square property tour, our Manhattan acquisitions are still generating above market rate rent growth, the blended new and renewal leases increasing 8% to 12%. This level of growth has not impacted occupancy which averaged approximately 96% during the quarter. The Rivergate redevelopment is progressing and we have 33 homes through the end of second quarter and achieved rent increases in line with expectation.","Moving on, I want to address the question that I\u2019m frequently asked. What is the next six to nine months or longer looked like from an operations perspective? The dominate thing that we have seen over the past few quarter continue to hold true with our view that apartments still has a good runway for growth over the coming years.","First, we expect the general economic recovery to remain choppy, but many of our markets should continue to exhibit incremental steady growth. Year-to-date the majority of our core markets have generated job growth above the national average. Second, demand for apartments remains robust, especially in urban coastal markets. In addition more cyclical geographies such as Florida and Texas are generating improved results.","Finally, new multifamily supply. Typically new supply has been a predominant driver behind a slowdown in rental rate growth as the recovery progresses. However, new multifamily supply pressures still appear moderate, deliveries is this year and next are expected to be below or at worst near historical averages in many of our markets. The single family rental market has not negatively impacted our business, now you will not see this as a significant risk given our substantially reduced exposure to markets with high single-family affordability. In short, we continue to see a good runway for growth in the multi-family space over the near and in immediate term.","Turning to more recent results. Through the majority of July renewals continue to trend well, up 6.7% or 60 basis points above last July's result. Renewal increases sent out for the remainder of the third quarter have averaged 6.5%, and we expect to capture close to all of this increase as is generally the case. With occupancy holding close to 96%, we expect that third quarter results will be strong.","A couple of words on expenses. You\u2019ll notice that year-to-date same-store expense growth of 1.6% is still below our 2012 guidance of 2% to 3% growth. We continue to believe that our guidance will prove accurate, expense comps toughen in the second half of the year. Turnover is expected to incrementally increase and higher real estate taxes are expected to hit.","As a reminder, we provided updated 2012 guidance at June NAREIT conference. These expectations can be found in our second quarter press release published this morning. Assuming no further equity raises for the balance of the year our 2012 fully diluted share count will be approximately 252.7 million.","Finally, I would like to direct everyone's attention to a couple of new attachments in our quarterly supplement. First, on Attachment 4(B) you\u2019ll see a debt covenant analysis. Second, you\u2019ll see a new development layout on Attachment 9(NYSE:A) which better illustrate redevelopment versus the under construction project.","With that operator, I\u2019d like to open the call up for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question and answer session. (Operator instructions). One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Jana Galan, with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jana Galan - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to get a little bit more detail on the turnover and if you are seeing any changes based on reasons for a move out or maybe elevated turnover in geographies versus others?","Jerry A. Davis ","Sure. This is Jerry. We are seeing reasons for turnout. They are pretty consistent with what they have been. Move outs to home purchase is up about 100 basis points from where it\u2019s been running at about 13%, and the markets you are really seeing that in for the most part are the locations like Austin, Nashville, Richmond, the Inland Empire and one surprising one where we are seeing an increased move out to home purchases in Boston. Most of our West Coast markets, with the exception of San Diego, are still seeing move out to home purchase under 10%. So, West Coast affordability is still difficult for most of our renters. And when you look at move outs to rent increase, it's been growing each of the last probably five quarters and today it stands at about 8%. One area that we have seen a slight reduction year-over-year in move out reasons is money issues, which is skips evictions, lost jobs things like that. And markets where we\u2019re seeing an increase in front over to the first six months, they are predominantly in the West Coast markets where we\u2019ve had quite a bit of pricing power. And -- So, we've been increasing people over the last two to three years and those happen to be the markets where three years ago our peak to trough rents dropped the most, so your B renter was able to move into an A property or your C renter was able to move into a B, and now we\u2019ve escalated rents to a level where they\u2019ve gone back to where that was before.","Jana Galan - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch ","Thank you, Jerry. And I believe in your prepared remarks you said you expected to continue to increase in the back half of the year. Do you mean higher than this kind of 58% level or is it just the year-over-year turnover that\u2019s increased?","Jerry A. Davis ","No, I think year-over-year turnover for the year is probably going to be three to four basis points over what it was last year, which will put us in that probably 55% to 56% for the year. Third quarter historically is our highest turnover quarter. So it usually gets north of 60 on an annualized basis, but then it comes down significantly as you get into the fourth quarter.","Jana Galan - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Karin Ford, with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi good morning. I wanted to ask Tom about a comment in your press release where you said most of the heavy lifting on de-levering and repositioning are behind us. Can you just talk about where you see UDR when you say most? What type of percentage that means for each one of those activities where we are today?","Thomas W. Toomey ","Certainly Karin, and good morning. With respect to the portfolio when we look at it, we start with its $12 billion enterprise today and our portfolio in the Southeast, which is somewhere, around 12%, 15% of the enterprise is a portfolio that\u2019s performing very well. Strong NOI growth this recent quarter and we expect that to continue over time, but it probably doesn't fit the long long-term aspect of where we would like to be, which is basically from DC to Boston and the West Coast. And so as a result, we view it as a warehouse piece of capital that over time if opportunities are found, developments are completed, we\u2019ll look at the pricing that we can achieve in that portfolio and then redeployed the capital into there. So we are looking at it as relatively a static $12 billion enterprise and asking ourselves, when do we and how do we move out of those markets? And we feel no rush, in fact the performance and where it looks like we\u2019ll probably hang on to them for some extended period of time, but it\u2019s a directional aspect and I would not probably see us be an active seller of those anytime soon. Jerry or Harry, would you add anymore to that?","Jerry A. Davis ","Well the market started talking about the South Eastern markets, and we are talking about three major cities that are Nashville, Tampa, Orlando, I think they had same-store NOI growth of about 9%, interest rates are low there continue to be investor interest. So to the extent, we do decided to sell those markets in the future. We expect that to be very liquid markets. There are a couple of markets that we would expect to probably sell in the short-term. We are done for the year given for a variety of reasons, but as we look into the relatively near-term, there are a couple of markets that we probably look to exit that might be to $200 million to $400 million in total.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great. And just on the delivering front as well, following the equity deal and the portfolio of sales. Now where do you think you are versus your plan today?","Thomas W. Toomey ","I think we are in line with our peer group and our intent is to stay in line with the peer group and any activity undertaken in the future will be to continue to be in line with the peers. So I don't think you\u2019ll see us make dramatic moves one way or another the natural growth of the cash flow of the enterprise will help. In addition as we refinance maturing debt will help, but we are comfortable continuing to be in line with the peer group.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe, with Citi Group. Please go ahead.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi Group","Hi, thanks. Just a question on your operating guidance. It looks like you are expecting around 5.5% revenue growth this year. So I just wanted to sort of break it down in terms of the different components and see what your expectations are. It would sound like from your commentary that you are sort of expecting this mid-6 renewal rate, this kind of growth continuing mid-4s on new leases and sort of flattish growth on occupancy. Is that pretty much what you are expecting for the balance of the year?","Jerry A. Davis ","Yeah. I would say that's what I am expecting for third quarter. I think when you get to fourth quarter, if history repeats the way it has the last two to three years you will see the new lease rate growth decelerate down to the 2% range. I think the renewals do tend to stay fairly strong that this year our expectation is to back down a hair on the renewal increases probably starting in October. So, instead of being in that 6, 6.5 range I think we are going to get down more in line into the 5.5 because last year we saw our occupancy in 4Q dropped to 95.1. Our preference is to keep occupancy north of 95.5. But this is pretty normal seasonality, but yeah the midpoint of the guidance is 5.5, that's where we are at right now. I continue to see strength in most of our markets and very little deceleration.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi Group ","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned that some of your non-core markets were performing very well. I think you said 9% same-store NOI growth. Is it surprising to you that these markets are doing so well, even though they don\u2019t have a lot of the characteristics that you would seem to want in markets that presumably obviously the most obvious is, home ownership is quite much more affordable. So, I\u2019m just curious if that's surprising to you at all and whether that makes you more inclined to kind of keep a decent percentage of those non-core markets in your portfolio over the long-term?","Thomas W. Toomey ","Eric, this is Tom and then I\u2019ll ask Jerry to comment as well. My view, over the long period time, you look at those markets and they are bouncing off the bottom. In case of Florida, it was five years of down trending on rent and NOI growth and now it\u2019s coming back up and it probably has a good two to three year run in it. But in that time frame development pipelines will start to rebuild rapidly and will represent a threat to the long-term value of those assets. And so for us, I think, we\u2019re going to ride the cash flow up and then we'll look at it, and ask ourselves when are they are going to get threatened by supply or any other economic downturn that may occur there, and we\u2019ll timeout our exit and repositioning of those dollars accordingly.","Jerry A. Davis ","I would agree. There is very little supply coming into those markets. When you look at the long-term average, for example, when Nashville is to add almost 2% of supply a year and over the next year it\u2019s only going to add about 1.4%, and you look at that same metric in Tampa. Tampa usually adds almost 2%, it's looking like they\u2019ll add 1.2%. And then Orlando typically adds just under 3% a year, and it\u2019s only going to add 1.2%. So, very little new supply and I would say, in addition to what Tom said, in those markets we do have no exceptional management teams that probably outperform the market in general.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citi Group","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg, with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates ","Hi, good morning. Just a couple extra questions here on the disposition plans that were outlined at the beginning. The $200 million to $400 million of near-term sales. Can you talk a little bit more about what markets those would be in?","Thomas W. Toomey ","Yeah. This is Tom. I think they're going to continue to always look at what we can do with the Norfolk portfolio, the Sacramento portfolio. I mean we feel like we have assets there that are generating decent cash flows, but its tough when you have a boat go out and it takes \u2013 drops your occupancy from 97% to 90%. And that volatility to sustain cash flow growth and pricing power is awful hard to continue in that market. I think Jerry and his team done a great job of operating them. So we will see what they fetch in price and then if they don't, we are glad to run them and continue to generate the cash flow off of them.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates","Okay. That\u2019s helpful and I think Jerry alluded to this, but are you currently marketing anything for sale now?","Jerry A. Davis ","No.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates ","Okay. And last question is, under what scenario might we see you buy any assets in the next few quarters?","Jerry A. Davis ","Well I think that the scenario that would cause us to buy something would be finding the right asset and having the ability to capitalize that appropriately. So I think, look -- we are continually in the market looking at better deals like everyone else. We simply haven't found anything of size that we\u2019re comfortable with pricing or have been able to make a deal with the seller. In fact we brought a couple land parcels. We have got a couple smaller deals now that are really contiguous to existing properties so we can sort of obtain that at operating efficiency. But if you think about it, we haven\u2019t bought anything of size for several quarters, Columbus; we made that deal on the fourth quarter last year, closed in the first quarter this year. So we\u2019re continually out there looking, we just simply haven't found deals between these off-market deals that we like to look at and we just simply haven\u2019t been able to strike a deal with the seller.","Thomas W. Toomey ","David, what I would add is, our view of an ideal transaction would probably be something that is first off market adjacent to or very close to our existing communities where we have some operating efficiency that has a redevelopment potential, something we can look at over time horizon and have a very high comfort that both, we can grow NAV through one of our three metrics and drivers, which would be either ground-up development, the operating platform, or the redevelopment platform. And we are not going to find that in trying to win an option for Class A urban asset where a dozen people show up. And so hence we see them, but we were not overly engaged by them and don\u2019t see the upside for us or our shareholders in doing so. So I think we'll stay more focused in the off market and it\u2019s probably a quiet period, we anticipated it being a little bit more quiet. I think we\u2019ll be intrigued at what happens in the pending tax code and rate structure and if that triggers a selling window. But mostly the assets we\u2019re looking for aren\u2019t really going to be in that caliber. So I think you'll see a lot Bs come to the market, probably not stuff we are going to look at unless we really think it\u2019s well located and got to rehab. So I would expect us to be pretty quiet for the balance of the year on the acquisition front and we\u2019ll look at it from their next year and see how the market evolves.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one last related question. Tom, you opened last call and you spoke about improving the portfolio both as it relates to the market mix but also urbanizing the portfolio itself within core markets. So we\u2019ve talked a lot on this call about the first part. Can you touch on the second and what markets that are core markets of yours would you like to urbanize the portfolio and how much work does that involve?","Thomas W. Toomey","That's just a long-term directional aspect of it. I tend to think when we look at our portfolio we really break down each market into quartiles of sub-markets and we stay very focused on wanting to be in the two upper quartiles and I think over time we'll continue to examine how those sub-markets evolve and position ourselves accordingly. It gives us what I'd call just a direction. Timing on exiting and urbanizing you know it is just part of normal capital recycling of the enterprise for us. We don't feel like that $12 billion (indiscernible) urgency to try to grow the enterprise significantly. We will naturally over time as the cash flows grow and the development, redevelopment activities come online but we are comfortable with our size and a steady growth trajectory. I think that's how I think about it and the Group thinks about. Anyone wants to add anything?","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Tom, you mentioned growing your development pipeline to 1.5 billion. If you can you talk about the markets where you're planning to do that. And also do you worry about the increase in supply effecting your development plan?","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, I think for us when we look at the size and scope of the development pipeline, we look at the triangulation of our skill set, our capital structure, our debt maturities and maintaining financial flexibility and leverage of the enterprise. And so those will probably be the governor of how big of a development pipeline we\u2019ll get. The second, we\u2019ve of targeted initially at this space in the company at about $0.5 billion of annual delivery. We think that\u2019s prudent. On the specific market, we\u2019re certainly going to weigh what the supply threat looks like, but as a long-term value creator, long-term holder, you can\u2019t get swayed by what the next six months pipeline or year pipeline looks at. You have to look over the long period of time and then I think we\u2019ll just weigh through that factual discipline in determining where and when and how much our development shapes. ","And I\u2019ll just remind just remind, I think one thing that does go unsaid very often is the redevelopment efforts that we undertake and the value creation in those. And you\u2019ve visited a number of our redevelopment efforts and you can classify them as much more than kitchen and bath. We\u2019re actually changing both the cash flow trajectory of the asset, but also the cap rate aspect of it. And we think there's a lot of value in that and that Southern California is a perfect example of that market where we can rehab and we do not lose all the cash flow or the community. We in fact retain a lot of the existing residents at the new higher rent and that's underway right now at Rivergate in New York and we\u2019re having a very good success there as well.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then Jerry, what percentage of NOI, the non-same-store pool would enter the same-store pool by 1Q. You guys have a good breakdown in the south now with the number of properties, but if you can just quantify the percentage of NOI which will enter by 1Q. I think that\u2019s when most of your New York assets enter the same store pool.","Jerry A. Davis","As of right now, 26% of our NOI is in non-same-store. By year-end non-same-store will be 15%. I don't have handy exactly what it will be in one quarter, but we can look that up and get back to you.","Thomas W. Toomey","It is fair to say that the entire portfolio is at about $1,500 a month in rent. And so we just kind of gravitate. If we don\u2019t do anything, it kind of rolls itself into and you\u2019ve got to be probably as you said over the next four quarters.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. Good morning. A housekeeping question for you. What the amount of the one-time vesting charge in G&A?","Warren L. Troupe","Paula this is Warren. It was $3.8 million.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. And did you incur any one-time cost in relation to Dave Messenger\u2019s departure?","Warren L. Troupe","We had a very small associated with some stock that had vested during the quarter, not as a result of the departure but just normal vesting.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Okay, thanks. And then what was the transaction that generated the gain in the TRS?","Thomas W. Toomey","It was Belmont.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Okay, thank you. And then just a bigger quick picture question for Tom. Could you just give us a little bit more color on the CFO search? Are you already reviewing candidates? Are you seeing the breadth of \u2013 in-depth of quality and skill sets that you are hoping to see? Just kind of give us a little bit of color on where you are in the process?","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, certainly, Paula. We\u2019ve engaged a search firm in that and we\u2019ve had a number of people come forth and offer themselves as candidate and we have looked at internal candidates and that process is really just beginning and we feel very comfortable with the executive group participating in that and the depth of the team and Mark Schumacher and his skills in the financial reporting area. So we feel like we can take our time and be very selective and thoughtful about the process and fell that we\u2019ll find the right person for the company.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","And what are the defining characteristics of the right person given the blend of the skill sets you already have in the team?","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, we would like a guy that could finish the 4 by 100 in the pool and win the gold. I think it\u2019s fair to say that there is a lot of characteristics we are going to look at. We are going to look at the entire attribute of the candidate, but it\u2019s really an opportunity for us as a Company to get somebody that\u2019s probably going to be active, engaged with the street in communication, but can go anywhere in the enterprise and make it more efficient, more profitable and culturally fit with this executive group and the Company\u2019s culture in the field. So I think those of the attributes to start. There are a lot of qualified people out there who will fit those and we\u2019ll just go through meticulously and get the right person for us.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks Tom, appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. Jerry, first question. Can you give us the loss to lease statistic for the portfolio and also what your expectations are for D.C. just given the amount of supply coming online the second half of year?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. Loss to lease at the end of the quarter, Mike, was 4.9%. That's down from the same time last year when it was I think high fives. So it's still maintaining at a good level and if you look at that blend really between my new leases and my renewals, it blends into that mid-fives range. So we feel good about that. D.C. for the remainder of year, we were, I guess little pleasantly surprised that we saw our year-over-year growth actually accelerate in second quarter versus first because a couple of our properties in Arlington had lease-ups that completed earlier in the first quarter so we didn't have that stress on us. There is a lot of new supply coming as you know in D.C. over the next 12 to 14 months. I think for the remainder of this year we'll stay probably in that 4% revenue growth range and I think we are going to be stressed a little bit as we get into 2013 in D.C. I don't think it's going to go negative, but my guess is that revenue growth will probably be about half of what it was this year.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, appreciate the color there. I don't know if you look at it this way, but if you look at the non-same-store portfolio maybe adjusting for periods where you didn't own the assets, but do you have a same-store number, I mean a year-over-year growth number for the non-same-store portfolio kind of on a comparison basis?","Jerry A. Davis","We have tried so hard to figure out the best way to communicate that and we had difficulty going back to last year because in many cases we either didn't own the asset or so we don't have reliable financial data or it was \u2013 it wasn't mature yet and stabilized. So the metric we\u2019ve really try to use more to show is performance versus our same-store is to look at sequential data because it was typically stabilized in 1Q. When you look at that, our non-same-stores that were stabilized in 1Q were growing revenues at 3.6% and our same-store was going at two. So it\u2019s almost double the rate.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then finally just on the investment front and you guys talked not expecting a significant amount of acquisitions in the second half of the year. What should we expect in terms of development starts and also additional land investment?","Thomas W. Toomey","This is Tom. I think in our prepared remarks we\u2019ve described on a relative number of times between 70% and 80% of the development pipeline, redevelopment, so almost $1 billion. 70% to 80% of that will be delivered in the next \u2013 by the end of 2013. So if that comes out of the pipeline we\u2019ve got to add back into \u201814 and \u201815 deliveries. So we\u2019ll be looking at that and again kind of stay in that confines of about 500 million of annual delivery number. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be targeting and we think we have a pipeline that probably fits that, meaning the inventory that we already controlled and are just going through the process of defining scope, product and starts. So I think we are well on the way of being able to sustain that level without having to go into the market and finding new opportunities.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. But your guidance for the second half of the year does contemplate additional starts, correct?","Thomas W. Toomey","No. It really doesn\u2019t \u2013 probably more of the guidance is what we\u2019re going to spend on the existing assets that are already underway. If we find, if we\u2019re able to finalize plans on some of the stuff that we're looking at today than obviously we will kick it into the start mode, but we\u2019re still in a steady mode on those and scope mode and just not prepared at this time to put forth exactly what will be built because we are still trying to figure that our self.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Good morning guys. Tom, just to follow-up on the last question. What\u2019s the level of land that you guys either option or controlling that\u2019s not appearing on the attachment 9A on the supplemental? How material is that?","Thomas W. Toomey","Really the only other land parcels that we have that don\u2019t show up on the schedules are the land parcels that we own with MetLife. So there is 10 of those parcels remaining. Some of those we will develop over time. We have very small ownership interest, but in the future that could change.","Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. So the Wilshire and the 7 Harcourt plus what you've got left at Vitruvian, is basically the owned and then you\u2019ve got Beach Walk, Fremont and Pier 4 in Boston which are JV sites and outside of that your land that you control is relatively minor outside of that land?","Thomas W. Toomey","Rob, I think you missed the Fremont site in San Francisco. We control that as well.","Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. All right. And then, Jerry, you had a comment early on about skips and evicts being pleasantly surprised there. Where is that that trending and has it been sort of consistent despite the \u2013 over the last few quarters despite what you've been seeing in terms of move out the financial reason?","Jerry A. Davis","Yeah. It typically runs for us at about 0.4% of potential rents and that\u2019s a long-term average. Last year in the quarter, I think it spiked up to 0.5%, maybe 0.6%, but we don\u2019t see that growing anymore. It\u2019s staying fairly stable and it\u2019s really sub-market driven and it hits as much harder at our lower rent markets than those tertiary areas.","Thomas W. Toomey","I would also add that, I think Jerry has done a great job of moving the vast majority \u2013 85%, 87% of the residents pay us online at the first of the month, so we are able to identify people that are going to struggle, are the slow pay piece and years gone past and including most of the private sector, you get that drift in by the 10th or the 15th of the month before you realize you have an issue and we pretty much know it by the third to fourth day of the month who is going to be a problem and you are able to jump on it by narrowing the bandwidth and excuses. So I think you can operate in that range and that electronic payment has helped us a great deal in that area.","Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Is that going to be moving more now that you're in more urban areas like New York City where the eviction process is long and drawn-out and things of that nature? I believe Boston and other parts of California have issues as well. Does that change the dynamics there at all?","Jerry A. Davis","I don\u2019t think so, you are right, it\u2019s harder to get those guys out in places like New York, Boston and the West Coast. But I think as you go to a higher-end resident profile, they don\u2019t live as much paycheck-to-paycheck. So your better quality resident offset the more difficulty with the court systems.","Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And then one just odd ball question. What\u2019s the relative number of corporate units in the portfolio these days?","Jerry A. Davis","It\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get a totally accurate count. I think it\u2019s in the 2% to 3% range.","Robert Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Thank you. Good morning. First question; just going to the guidance for the rest of the year, I don't recall the $0.03 of RE3 gains being in the guidance before. Is there anything upcoming in the back half of the year like any other either RE3 or one-timer gains?","Thomas W. Toomey","This is Toomey. No.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Okay. And was there a reason that that wasn't disclosed in the NARIET where you provided the full year guidance update. Was there any reason why that gain wasn't included on that page?","Christopher G. Van Ens","This is Chris. When we sold the Belmont there was the $0.03 of gain. There was $0.02 \u2013 a little over $0.02 of gains in our original guidance. So the difference there was not all that meaningful.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Okay. And then second question is looking on the JV page Attachment 9B, if I just do the yield out of the various JVs, the MetLife I, the original Hannaford MetLife JV, the yield on that looks to be about 100 basis points lower than the second MetLife JV and the KFH. When do you think we would expect the first MetLife JV that yield to be more in line with the others?","Thomas W. Toomey","My view is that Met JV I is still in a transition period and that we are not done working with Met on that portfolio and what it will ultimately be for UDR. So, I think, it is premature to look at it or look at it in light of catching JV too, because it\u2019s in a state of evolution. Second aspect it is will improve as we just continue to operate the assets which are doing very well and that is very happy with as well. On KFH, I think after looking at it, adjusting for the management fee structure on that, returns will probably get better in that JV too. So, that one is probably just not a full complexion there. When you look at just the NOI, you have to really look at the fee structure that\u2019s also added to that and those are probably above 5, 5.5 range.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Okay. But Tom, on the MetLife I, what are some of the things that you guys are doing that would improve, because I think you\u2019ve had it now for about two years or so. So what are the some of the things that would improve the yields as you guys manage that portfolio?","Thomas W. Toomey","I think one, the commercial space there\u2019s always the challenges that relates to the retail and getting tenants in there. The second is, we\u2019re continuing to refine and move those rents pretty rapidly and those improve as well and lastly is just a continued effort on the expense side. So, normal operation stuff that Jerry does day in and day out, we just see a pretty good expose trajectory out of those assets. And we continue to have a dialogue with Met on a wide range of things about what to do with JV I and we\u2019ll continue that dialogue and feel like it\u2019s going very well.","Jerry A. Davis","I would add Alex, there is probably two, maybe three assets in that Met I that completed lease up mid way to late last year with heavy concessions. So as you continue to have that concession burn off, that should garner some benefit over the next 12 months.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","Hey, thanks. Tom, a question for you. I think the general population public that follows you trusts the Company. You've made some pretty substantial investments over the recent past in some of these core markets. And I think generally speaking, like I said, people have a trust for your Company and your decisions. But even Mickey Mantle struck out a few times. So I\u2019m curious, what could happen or what are you contemplating in growth going forward for these major investments, mainly acquisition for them to work out for you? Do you have any expectation for growth that you could share and what happens if rent growth decelerates substantially? Will they still make sense to you?","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, Rich, a lot of different embedded questions inside of that and where I would start with is, I guess every one of them was undertaken with the thought that we could grow the value of the asset and add to the overall enterprise. And so in many cases you look at New York, we look at it at a point in time and say we think these assets have embedded operating efficiency which will get us over the initial low cap rate and Jerry has delivered on that. The second phase of that is that we think they are well located for future job growth and they are generally what I call a B type portfolio quality where high propensity to rent, job growth, lack of supply is going to drive outsized cash flow growth and our operating model is basically keeping them full and at higher rents. And lastly is looking at them for redevelopment efforts and that we feel like a lot of them are well located and that we can continue to add to capital to them and incrementally get outsized returns on that incremental capital for rehab and Jerry has done very much that at Rivergate where he has turned 38 doors and he is getting an average rent increase of 25%. And many of the people who are living there are just moving to new units. So that\u2019s the type of long-term value creation that we have looked at when we've bought assets and I think we would continue to do that. ","We know it\u2019s a very competitive landscape. We prefer buying from non-marketed, non-auctioned deals because we think we can identify those and we have a track record of successfully executing on those. So I think that\u2019s the first aspect of growing the enterprise. We\u2019re not intent on a site as much as we are intent on an NAV creation model and things getting in that and the big part of NAV creation is, what\u2019s your cost of capital and are you adding to it, are you destroying it? And so in our like view we think we've been adding to it. It takes time sometimes to deliver on that and we appreciate people\u2019s patience and willing to go look at the assets and see and walk them with us and I think you've done it a number of times and you can see what we're doing and you look at it and say, yes, you are executing on what you told us you would do and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We want to be very transparent and very clear to our shareholders that we intend to grow NAV and that we have a team that can do that and we\u2019re going to continue to garner opportunities. We don't know what size and scope they are going to bring, but we\u2019ll be disciplined about it.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","If you had known \u2013 if you knew that in 2014, 2015 rent growth in some of these markets would decelerate meaningfully, would you still have a view of buying these assets and thinking longer-term or would you maybe\u2026","Thomas W. Toomey","Yeah, I\u2019ll let Harry add to it, but certainly it\u2019s a fair question and we think of what are the potential outcomes of economic downturn and will we slide into a recession which looks like a higher probability every day. And our view is that multi-family has done very well in a recessionary environment. And if you look through the number of recessions I\u2019ve been through, multi-family holds up better than any other asset class and we think that will be true again in this next recession that will come. So you can\u2019t necessarily look and try to time it and say, gosh, we think \u201813 is going to be this way and \u201814. We tend to take a longer term view and realize that in the markets that we\u2019re in there is a higher propensity to rent, there is less likely to be supply and that job we\u2019ve try to concentrate on it, but we\u2019re not always going to it right. The healthcare law is going to spawn a whole new wave of job additions and growth in a number of markets and we are weighing that as well in our future. But we\u2019re a long-term value creator and you\u2019re not going to get it always right on timing, but if you buy right, you run it right, over long period of time we\u2019ll do just fine.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","Understood and obviously that\u2019s the right answer, long-term focus on making big investments. And then, Jerry, just a question to you. How much does the addition of the non-same-store assets influence your same-store guidance, if at all? Does it add 50 or 100 basis points for the growth?","Jerry A. Davis","For which year?","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","I mean, obviously it\u2019s not going to get in until deep into the second half, so how would you characterize it for \u2013 not to give guidance on, unless you want to give guidance. But for 2013, do you think you could add 50 or 100 basis points to the pool just because of the newness of the asset?","Jerry A. Davis","I doubt it. It\u2019s not quite that much. My guess is it\u2019s probably somewhere 10 to 30 bps.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks guys. Actually Tom, I\u2019m just curious for your perspective. Some of your peers have suggested that construction activity in the industry, which has been growing is a bit of a bubble, that these are projects that were planned and permitted and not built last cycle and that once we chew through them the pace of growth is going to moderate or at least maybe not climb above current level. How are you thinking about supply I guess nationally and what you do see is more of a passive growth in your markets over the next few years?","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, a very good question and give me a liberty to talk broadly about it. We talk to a number of merchant building models and for us one of the red signals is when we talk to them about are they doing one-off deals, the source of their capital, their expected returns and are they entering into programs and programs are where you have an investor who says, I\u2019m going to do three, four, five deals with you. And what\u2019s been no to us in the past, when people have seen rapid increases in the supply part of the equation, has been when there have been a number of programs offered up or investors having capital that can sustain that and we\u2019re not finding that in the environment today as I'm aware of probably a dozen merchant build very skilled groups. I'm only aware of one who has a program at this time. And so investor capital is very cautious about supplying them and they are very skilled at garnering sites, entitlements and putting up things rapidly. So the second aspect of that and I think is under weighed by the space is the impact of Basel III on the capital structure of bank, and that a lot of supply comes from regionals and local banks, more so than the nationals. ","And by getting \u2013 having to come into compliance with Basel III, we think it\u2019s going to be a constraint on the construction loan side, which has a higher capital requirement, which in essence banks are going to say they want to be paid more for that and who is going to charge more in the construction financing side or constrain the amount of lending on it. So I think that those two factors are the ones that we look at and draw a little bit of comfort that the supply is not going to get out of hand. That being said, if our rents continue to grow dramatically capital will find a way to garner space and opportunity. So we feel that that is the overall landscape on our individual submarket and market overviews \u2013 we see very little threat at this point in time. All we can do is look at the same data you do and look at permit, land trade, look at who's buying it and ask our self the likeliness of how competitive that product is going to be against ours and when it\u2019s going to come online. We can't do anything about constraining that, but we continue to monitor it and do not see it as a viable threat to the business over the next 12 to 18 months. Beyond that you are hour glassing it just like the rest of us.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","So you don't necessarily see the industry as 250,000 units, let\u2019s just say, pick a number, headed towards 350,000. You think it\u2019s going to sort of running out of gas if you will in terms of just where we can ultimately peak it to have units under construction.","Thomas W. Toomey","Yeah. I think it\u2019s often management teams and certainly analysts try to focus on that aggregate number. We are less concerned about the aggregate because where is the 300,000 or 250,000? To us it\u2019s how is in our submarket, directly competing to us? The fact that they are building in Houston is almost irrelevant to us because we\u2019re practically out of Houston. So we don't pay much attention to the gross number. We aggregate and very think much on our submarket market driven numbers. And our red flag is when it gets above 1% of the submarket then we start really assessing the impact to us. But again we\u2019re long-term, if it\u2019s a strong submarket that we are in, 1% is not going to disrupt us that much.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","And just a final question or two going the other end into the spectrum, I guess concerning the Pier 4 parcel in Boston, is that residential over retail and I guess how close is your partner there to breaking ground on that project?","Harry Alcock ","It is residential over retail. There\u2019ll be about 10,000 square feet of retail, a 20-story tower. We are still finalizing the scope and plans and cost in this thing. The project is entitled. We have BRA approval so that once we get through this exercise, we\u2019ll be in a position where we conceivably could start construction over the next several months.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, and just one last question. Jerry, sorry if you gave the figure, but do you guys track move outs to home rental and how is that trending? I might have missed it if you said it.","Jerry A. Davis","We do. It\u2019s right around 4% and it\u2019s stayed fairly consistent. We don\u2019t see many people moving out to rent homes.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over to our host, Mr. Tom Toomey, President and CEO.","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, thank you all for taking the time this morning to exchange thoughts with us and we do appreciate your time. In closing, I\u2019ll just say, in July of this year, marks the 40th year for UDR as a REIT and our 160th consecutively paid quarterly dividend and I think that\u2019s in testament to the associates over the years, the management team and certainty a trend that we are very proud of and look forward to continuing in the future.

Our Press Release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","Statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute Forward-Looking Statements. Although, we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and Risk Factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions to one plus a follow-up. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to UDR's Chairman and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas Toomey","Thank you, Trent. And welcome to UDR's fourth quarter 2019 conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","Our fourth quarter results highlighted by robust same-store NOI growth of 4.1% and FFO as adjusted per share growth of 7% continued to demonstrate strong execution across all aspects of our business.","To recap, 2019 was a very good year for UDR and our shareholders. First, we continue to perform well on operations, which drove approximately 65% of our 2019 FFOA per share growth. ","The year was highlighted by the ongoing development and execution of our next gen operating platform, which allows our current and prospective customers to engage with us online and in a self-service manner they have demanded across most aspects of their lives.","Second, our capital sourcing and allocation remained disciplined, using equity priced at a premium to NAV and low cost debt to creatively grow our business through 1.8 billion in acquisitions. These acquisitions have significant operational and investment upside - are in markets targeted for expansion and will produce outside FFOA growth in 2020 and beyond.","Third, we wound down KFH JV and halved our relationship with MetLife via an accretive asset swap. These actions simplified our business and added more high quality real estate on balance sheet.","Fourth, we proactively and accretively derisked our enterprise through well timed issuance and pre-payments that extended our duration and improved our liquidity. And last, we accomplished these goals, while dramatically improving our resident satisfaction scores. Maintaining strong employee engagement and completing a wide variety of ESG related initiatives that enhanced our return.","In summary, 2019 was a very good year and representative of what investors can expect from UDR as we continue to execute our long-term strategies. My thanks to the UDR team for their hard work in making 2019 a very special year.","Turning to 2020, our business is strong as the fundamental landscape for apartments look like it will be fairly similar to that of 2019. Specifically, we expect a relatively robust economy and balanced supply demand environment, set against volatility that we have all come to see as normal.","But whatever the macro environment, we believe we have the right strategy, portfolio and team in place to grow FFOA and the dividend per share at an elevated rate overtime through a variety of value creation mechanisms. For 2020 we are expecting 6% FFOA per share growth at the midpoint of our guidance and announced a 5% year-over-year increase in our dividend per share.","Last, Warren Troupe, our Senior Executive Vice President will be transitioning to a consulting role with UDR effective April 1st. I have worked closely with Warren for 18-years and I'm thankful that UDR and its investors will continue to reap the benefits of his expertise in transactions, legal, risk management and capital markets activities for years to come.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks Tom and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to announce another quarter and full year of strong operating results. Fourth quarter, same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth rates were 3.3%, 1.3% and 4.1%. Full-year 2019 same store growth rates were 3.6%, 2.5% and 4% respectively.","As Tom alluded to in his prepared remarks, UDRs primary operating objectives are to consistently generate above peer average same-store growth while also expanding our operating margin both of which drive FFOA per share growth overtime. Over the years, we have successfully executed these objectives in a variety of ways.","Prior to 2019 we primarily focused on top-line growth initiatives such as parking, short-term furnished rentals and common area rentals. In 2019 these top-line growth initiatives continued to produce outstanding results, but we also pivoted our strategy to more actively minimize controllable expense growth through the implementation of our next gen operating platform.","Why did our focus shift? Three reasons. First, our customer increasingly expects to conduct business with us on their time, across a wide variety of industries intuitive, easy to use, self-service apps have come to define high quality service. Interacting with our customers should be no different, which is why the backbone of our NextGen operating platform is built on self-service.","Second, centralizing certain operating functions, outsourcing others, providing better self service to our current and prospective customers and more actively utilizing the data we collect will result in greater efficiencies at our cost structure.","By 2022 we expect these efforts will expand our controllable margin by 150 to 200 basis points, which translates into $15 million to $20 million in incremental run rate NOI or $300 million to $450 million in value creation at a 22 times multiple.","Third, the consistent adoption and execution of operating initiatives that boost revenue growth, constrained expense growth and enhance FFOA per share growth is ingrained in UDR's cultural DNA. But the NextGen platform is and will remain somewhat of a distraction to our teams in the field and at corporate until fully implemented by the end of 2021.","As we consider the sequencing of growth initiatives over the coming years, cost efficiency will be the focal point in 2020, with additional revenue growth initiatives beginning to come online in 2021 and beyond, once our property technology and data analytics platforms are fully built out.","Moving on, we are now a year and a half into the implementation of the platform and have achieved approximately 25% of the original underwritten NOI improvement. Thus far, our controllable margin has expanded by 60 basis points, and slight level headcount has been reduced by more than 15% through natural attrition.","After reducing our same-store controllable expenses by 0.4% in 2018, 2019 controllable expense growth was just 0.9%, resulting in average annual growth of only 0.3% over the last two years, versus 1.8% for the peer group. For 2020, we expect our controllable expense growth to be at or below this level.","At the same time, 2019 resident satisfaction scores improved by 11% and we anticipate further improvement in 2020. As such, expanding our margin through cost and headcount reduction is clearly not resulting in a decline in actual or perceived customer service. Rather, is more efficiently delivering a superior all around experience to our customers.","Our NextGen operating platform is proving to be a win-win for UDR, our associates, our residents and our investors. We are excited to update you on our continued progress and expected economics throughout 2020 and beyond.","Next 2020 has started well, occupancy remains high at 96.9% and our $1.8 billion in 2019 acquisitions are ahead of underwriting expectations. As a reminder, we expect the weighted average yield on these acquisitions to improve from a trailing 4.7% of purchase to above 5.5% by year three. These accretive investments will continue to drive our FFO growth and value creation for years to come.","Looking ahead, full-year 2020 same-store revenue expense and NOI growth ranges are 2.7% to 3.7%, 2.2% to 3.0% and 2.9% to 3.9%, respectively. Drivers of our revenue growth include higher rents including Smart Home contribution and slightly higher occupancy.","Offset by a lower contribution from other income, as a growth rates from initiatives rolled out over the past several years such as parking, short-term furnished rentals moderate and lower utility expenses reduce our reimbursement revenue. ","It is important to note that as 2020 unfolds, our quarterly same-store growth rates will be higher than our year-to-date same-store growth rates as 2019 acquisitions move into our quarterly same-store pools.","In addition to MetLife JV communities acquired in 2019 are included in our full-year 2020 same-store pool. These are not expected to significantly impact same-store growth rates. Their inclusion will provide more transparency through 2020 beginning with our first quarter supplement.","At the market level, we expect 2020 top-line growth rates will exhibit less variability than in years past. The Monterey Peninsula, Portland, and Boston markets are forecast to grow same-store revenue at a rate above the high-end of our 2.7 to 3.7 portfolio growth rate range in 2020. New York, Baltimore and Orange County should come in below the low end. All other markets are forecast to grow revenue within the collars of our portfolio growth ranges.","Regarding accelerating versus decelerating markets in 2020 versus 2019. We expect the Portland, Tampa and New York will generate the highest year-over-year acceleration in 2020 same-store growth. And San Francisco, Seattle and Baltimore are forecast to decelerate the most.","In closing, I would like to thank all UDR associates in the field and at corporate for producing another year of robust operating growth, successfully integrating 1.8 billion of acquisitions and continuing to embrace the future in the form of our next gen operating platform. 2019 was an eventful and very rewarding year. I'm immensely proud of each of you.","With that, I will turn it over to Joe.","Joseph Fisher","Thank you, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results. Full-year 2020 guidance expectations, a transactions and capital markets update and a balance sheet update.","Our fourth quarter earnings results came in at a midpoint of previously provided guidance ranges. As appose adjusted per share was $0.54 approximately 7% higher year-over-year and driven by strong same-store and lease-up performance, accretive capital deployment and lower interest rates. Full year FFOA per share was 208 representing year-over-year growth of over 6% and driven by factor similar to our quarterly results.","Next, our full-year 2020 guidance. Full-year FFOA per share guidance is 218 to 222, driven by continued strong operations, 2019 capital deployment and interest expense savings. Primary drivers of these $0.12 of growth between our 2019 FFOA of 208 and our 2020 midpoint of 220 per share include a positive impact of approximately $0.07 from same-store, stabilized JVs and commercial operations, a positive impact of approximately $0.05 from transactional activity, DCP, development and redevelopment, a positive impact of approximately $0.03 from lower financing costs, flat year-over-year G&A and the negative impact of approximately $0.03 from a variety of other corporate items, including groundless recess and amortization of certain next gen operating platform investments. A full guidance update including sources and uses expectations, and first quarter guidance ranges, is available on attachment 15 of our supplements.","Moving on to transact transactions in capital markets. During 2019, we acquired approximately 1.8 billion communities at share at a weighted average trailing yield of 4.7% with equity priced at a premium to NAV and low cost debt.","As Jerry mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see this weighted average yield grow into about 5.5% by year three generating an additional 10% NOI growth above and beyond the 3% annual market rate growth we used in our underwriting.","This encapsulates UTRs value proposition when we are able to overlay our well-tuned operating platform combined with targeted CapEx investment on undermanaged assets that are located at markets targeted for expansion. In short, we can buy assets at market prices, but drive above market returns and growth overtime.","We utilize this value creation equation again subsequent to quarter end by purchasing the Slade at Channelside, a 294 home community and Tampa for $85 million or $290,000 per home. Similar to our 2019 acquisitions, we anticipate Slade's yield growing from 4.6% in year one to 5.3% by year three.","Next, during the quarter we pre-funded the majority of the acquisition of Brio 259 home community in Bellevue, Washington on which we have $170 million fixed purchase price option in 2021 with a $115 million note at a 4.75% interest rate.","This property is contiguous to our existing elements and elements to properties in Bellevue and after stabilization will be operated as a phase of those properties thereby garnering operating efficiencies.","Regarding the Developer Capital program subsequent to quarter end, we exercised our purchase option to buy the 51% we did not already own of the Arbory, a West Coast Development JV Community with 276 homes in suburban Portland. Our cash outlay for the transaction totaled $54 million including the payoff of debt. The Arbory is expected to generate a year one FFO yield of approximately 5.4% on our all-in blended price.","Finally on the topic of transactions, during the fourth quarter, we closed the $1.8 billion UDR, MetLife joint venture transaction that was originally announced in August, which effectively halved our relationship with MetLife. We believe this deal was a win-win for both sides and continue to value our partnership with Met.","Turning into 2020, we will remain disciplined with our capital sourcing and allocation and pivot to investments that provide the best risk adjusted return should we have an advantageous cost of capital and can match fund.","If further external growth opportunities present themselves in 2020, we will continue to evaluate all capital sources. Currently we have approximately $300 million of assets being marketed for sale.","Regarding capital markets, in December we settled all 1.3 million shares sold under our previously announced forward sales agreement and a forward price $47.41 with net proceeds of 63.5 million. No additional equity was issued during or subsequent to the quarter.","During the fourth quarter, and as previously announced, we continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $400 million of unsecured debt and a weighted average effective rate of 3.1% with a weighted average 13.9 years to maturity, $300 million of this debt qualified as a green bond and represented our first use of this ESG friendly product.","Proceeds were used to prepay $400 million or 4.65% unsecured debt. Please see our supplement for further details on our transactional and capital markets activity.","Moving on to the balance sheet, at quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, net of the commercial paper balance was $867 million. Our consolidated financial leverage was 34% on un-depreciated book value and 26% on enterprise value, inclusive of joint ventures. Consolidated net-debt-to-EBITDA RE was 6.1 time and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.0 times.","Our consolidated leverage metrics at your-end looks slightly elevated due to only having one month of NOI from the acquired MetLife communities set against the full debt load of those communities. Normalizing for this would bring our consolidated net net-debt-to-EBITDA RE down to approximately 5.8 times and within our targeted range.","Over the next three years, less than 3% of our debt comes due after excluding our commercial paper facility and working capital credit facility. Additionally, our weighted average duration is now over seven years. Both of these put us in a advantageous position regarding three year liquidity.","We remain comfortable with our credit metrics and don't plan to actively lever up or down. Moving on, in conjunction with our release yesterday, we announced a 2020 annualized dividend per share of $1.44. A 5.1% increase over 2019.","Last, we would like to officially welcome Trent Trujillo to the UDR team as our Director of Investor Relations. Trent will be running our day-to-day Investor Relations, and we are happy to have him on board.","With that, I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Jerry, you talked about the same-store revenue growth assumptions. What is embedded in guidance in terms of blended lease rate growth and if you can discuss new and renewals expected in 2020?","Jerry Davis","Yes Nick this is Jerry. Blended lease rate growth is expected to be fully comparable to last year, right around at 3% range. With renewals probably in that 1% or so range. And what was your second question?","Nick Joseph","No, that was that entire question. I was thinking to ask about the new lease rate growth in fourth quarter we saw turn negative and the spread between that and the previous year widen. So I was wonder if you could provide some more color on that.","Jerry Davis","Yes, really when you look at that Nick, 4Q of 2018 was a pretty exceptional year where you didn't see the normal seasonal softness that we witnessed in prior years. We look at 4Q of 2019, new lease rate growth was negative 0.5, that compares to negative 0.5 in 4Q of 2017. And to a flat in 4Q of 2016. So 2018 at 1% was more the aberration. In that quarter, we didn't feel the effects of new supply that we have seen in the other three years in the past four.","I will tell you when you look at January though, we have seen a normal seasonal acceleration. Blended growth is up 2.4% which is higher than it was in the fourth quarter, but honestly, it is 60 basis points higher than it was in December. So you are seeing good sequential monthly acceleration, but it still is 40 basis points less than it was in January of last year.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. That is helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question ","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Just going to the guidance, Jerry. Just a couple questions. I think you said that for 2020. Obviously, the same-store pool is changing a lot. But did you say that there is no real benefit or detriment from having a higher pool meaning that, if we didn't change the pool your same-store numbers would be similar?","Jerry Davis","Yes. When I said well the inclusion of the MetLife portfolio into the full-year same-stores the delta to revenue and expenses is fairly immaterial. What we are really saying is, as you see the sequential or each quarterly growth rate as the year rolls on. Acquisitions we made last year will be rolling into the pool. So those are expected to have higher growth rates than in full-year pool of same-stores.","Joseph Fisher","Hey Nick, this is Joe. Maybe just to add to that a little bit in terms of MetLife. That goes back to one of the reasons that we had talked about in terms of why we liked the assets that we acquired, meaning that they had less near-term supply pressure. So I think investors are used to seeing MetLife portfolio underperform a little bit relative to legacy, same-store.","But for Jerry's comments, you are seeing that the MetLife assets that we acquired right there in-line with our same-store legacy portfolio. And we will end up breaking that out for you on attachment five, starting in 1Q of 2020. So you can see legacy MetLife, as well as the combined, which is what we guided to.","Nick Yulico","Okay that is helpful And then I don't know if I missed this, but can you just quantify what the impact is from rent control initiatives in New York and California on 2020 same-store revenue?","Jerry Davis","So it is in that 10 to 15 basis points range. I think back in the third quarter, we told everybody New York was 500 to a million range [1482] (Ph). We did the calculation after that came out is about $300,000 or so. And then you know the other thing that is impact this is a bit is anti-gouging laws that went into effect in California in response to wildfires in the fourth quarter. And a bit of an effect on 2020 as far as short-term furnished rentals in California of a couple hundred thousand dollars.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Just one last question is going back to 2019, the final number on same-store NOI growth. It looks like you ended up hitting the bottom of your guidance range and I think you also revised it up a little bit that range in the third quarter. So what happened it ended up driving you know the low end of the revise range?","Jerry Davis","Yes, it was really couple of things primarily. One is we had two significant fires in the portfolio that in October that took somewhere in the 40 to 50 unit range out of service for the entire quarter, which drove down our occupancy a bit.","Secondly, as I said on the California anti-gouging laws that were put in place from late-October through late-November, it had not only an effect on short-term furnished rental income in the first quarter of 2020. But also some impact in the last month or two of 2019. And we had elevated levels of insurance expense, as well as some elevated electricity costs.","Nick Yulico","Alright, thanks everyone.","Thomas Toomey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question ","Shirley Wu","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So I guess my first question has to do with occupancy. So this coming year, you are thinking a little bit higher in occupancy. Is that a function of kind of bringing those 40, 50 units back online or is that a little bit of a shift in strategy in maintaining your occupancy by pulling back on rates?","Jerry Davis","It is really not pulling back on rates, I will tell you, as we get more information on data analytics, the third phase of our platform is data science and there is a couple of things we have been determined as we have had first looks at this, we think are going to allow us to reduce the number of days, units at vacant from when a resident moves out to when they move in. Every day we can reduce that to about 12 basis points of occupancy pickup. So it is really more focused on that than anything with playing with rent versus occupancy.","Shirley Wu","Got it. That is helpful. And so my second question is on your Smart Home initiative. So you guys have gotten around 60% of the homes so far. So can you talk a little bit about your cadence in 2020 and the contribution to revenue growth from the initiative?","Jerry Davis","Yes in 2020, our expectation is to add another, call it 7000 to 10,000 homes, probably most of those would be completed in the first half of this year. So as the earning comes in the expectation when you look at how much it is going to contribute to that portion of rent growth, call it 60 basis points. When you factor in the follow through from what we did last year as well as the new leases that go into effect in 2020.","Shirley Wu","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hightower","Hey good morning guys. Just a quick question on NextGen OP and there is an impact to FFO and then you are going to capitalize certain parts of the total costs, or can you just walk us through sort of the accounting there and maybe how much of the amortization of certain expenses that is hitting FFO and just break it down that way really quickly.","Joseph Fisher","Yes, hey Rich it is Joe. So in terms of the, call it $30 million that we have laid out for expenditures for the platform that is being spent in 2019 and 2020, we ended up capitalizing that and depending on the actual investment it typically averages out to about five to six years of amortization.","So once that is prepared and ready to be put into service, we start the amortization period, which is really starting to kick in here in the first quarter as we bring more of the process or project online.","In terms of the impact, it starts out at call it between one and two pennies this year and ramps up to around two pennies on a go-forward basis until it burns off and - through it also, say non-cash impact is just non OREO depreciation that works against us from a FFOA head point.","Rich Hightower","Got it. Okay. Thanks for that Joe. And then maybe just a little bit bigger picture question, as we contemplate 2020, if you had to pick one or two factors maybe across supply, growth, job growth or changing customer preferences as we think about maybe a move out to the home purchase and things like that, you know, where do you think the biggest risk to your forecast could be at this time?","Joseph Fisher","Yes, I think more so on job and wage front. I think on the supply side, we have a pretty good handle in terms of where we are leveling out there in terms of supply being up, call it flat to up 10% in our markets. On the irrational pricing front, we really haven't seen any on a market wide basis.","Of course, some of that is taking place on a sub market specific basis. So, I think we have a good handle on the supply front. The demand front is where we would be more concerned, either to the upside or downside that could drive pricing power in either direction.","But obviously the jobs report the last couple months have been fairly strong, wages have been strong, power have been strong. So, we feel good about it at this point, but that is probably the bigger variable for this year.","Rich Hightower","Got it. Thank you Joe.","Joseph Fisher","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","Thank you. Just to clarify the same-store results that you have this year. So, it sounds like the quarterly results will be higher than the full-year figure just given the acquisitions from last year being added to the pool. And I was wondering if you could just quantify what that difference may be if you averaged the quarterly versus the full-year?","Jerry Davis","I don't have that number right in front me. We will probably have to give you a call back with that unless Joe has it.","Joseph Fisher","No. We will come back to you on current quarterly impact, but you will probably see between 10 and 20 bips pick up between quarterly pool and full-year pool as we move throughout the year.","John Kim","Okay. I guess it has been a couple of months since the press reported your interest in the [indiscernible] multifamily portfolio and obviously it is not in your guidance. But do you want to describe what the situation is like as far as your relationship to the deal that supported?","Joseph Fisher","Hey John it is Joe. Obviously not going to make any comments on rumors that are out there in the market. So, don't think we are in a position to talk on that front. I guess what we would say is generically when it comes to external growth and capital deployment.","We have laid out a pretty clear set of parameters by which we have operated and tend to continue to operate, be that making sure we get near-term FFO growth and accretion. Make sure that we are match funded, leverage neutral, risk neutral. And making sure the assets we looked to acquire have NOI and platform upside to help drive some of that accretion.","So, none of that has really changed. The other piece with external growth to think about. We have talked in the past about development pipeline where we want that to trend towards. We spent most of the cycle at a billion plus. We have talked about getting back to 2% to 3% of enterprise value.","I think when you look at the current pipeline of $300 million plus land that we have and opportunities that we have internally, I think we have a good path to get back to that. So, let's get the comment so we can make an extra growth at this time.","John Kim","Okay. understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Stevenson","Good afternoon guys. Jerry, when you guys did your budgeting for 2020, what market has the widest bands between the likely top and bottom in terms of possible outcomes on same-store revenue?","Jerry Davis","Probably Seattle. Seattle is one every year you look - projected to have significant supply impact. But job growth always seems to come in and surprise to the upside. We also have been a very adept in recent years to push through and get high penetration levels on our other income initiatives. But, it is one of those, I can tell you, for example, in Redmond, we have one asset, there is a couple thousand units coming online there.","Right now, we are not feeling as much of an impact from that as you would have expected. So it is just interesting to watch, especially on that East side of Metro Seattle, their ability to both take supply, but because of the significant job growth that you see in places like Belleview, Redmen, Kirkland, that it gets absorbed so quickly at such high rate. This past quarter our Bellevue assets had revenue growth of 5.2%. ","Now, you look at Amazon, which has jumped across lake Washington to there. And they have 2,000 jobs in Bellevue today, going to increase it by another 2,500 by the end of this year, and I believe they have taken well over three to 3.9 million square feet of space that could accommodate eventually 25,000 Associates on that side of the lake. You compound that with other tech companies that are coming over into the East side, whether it is Facebook, Microsoft, expanding their campus, Google, things just feel very strong.","So that would be the one that I would say probably has the widest variants followed by San Francisco, we have told you, fourth quarter we began to see or feel the impact of new supply both in Soma as well as down in Santa Clara. San Francisco is another market that if you don't feel a rational pricing, and we are not feeling it yet today, that job growth and its quality job growth can absorb those units very quickly. So that is another one, I would say that can surprise to the upside.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then when you guys look at supplying your California markets over the next, whatever, 18, 24 months or whatever, you guys have good data on. How much of this stuff has condo maps. And do you guys expect that the various legislation and ballot initiatives in California are going to make condo projects and or conversions more attractive, which could also help a little bit on the supply side on the rentals?","Joseph Fisher","Hey Rob, it is Joe. So when we look at our supply when we track the permitting data that is out there. And say California generally is probably one of the markets that has trended lower from a permanent activity.","So, over the last three to six months, you have seen permits nationally tick higher, really is led by more of the Sunbelt markets and a little bit on the East Coast. But West Coast has been looking better.","As it relates to the condo mapping, we have not gone to that level of detail to figure out how much of that supply or permit activity is related to that. So really no comments on that front.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. Because presumably, your high rise stuff in these West Coast markets is the stuff that where you have supply coming online is probably the easiest to do condos, right. I mean and so some of your supply if you are going to get hit with would make the best condo conversions or condo sales just right out of the box. Is that right?","Joseph Fisher","Yes, potentially.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wesley Golladay","Hi guys, I just few DCP questions for you. What are your expectations for Alameda point block?","Harry Alcock","Wes this is Harry. Right now we have a land loan in this project that we have had for a couple of years. The land loan matures at the end of March, the developer continues to work through final pricing and in the like we have an option upon satisfying certain conditions to provide sort of permanent DCP and that, but we are not at a position yet to be able to comment on it.","Wesley Golladay","Okay, a potential expansion may happen, would that be a potential assumption there?","Thomas Toomey","Wes this Toomey, certainly that would be one consideration. We will look at what Harry highlighted when the numbers come in. But what we are excited about Alameda is in August, I believe the Ferry starts its operations and so that whole corridor is going to be activated and we like the price point relative to the markets around it. So I think it is going to be an area to keep your eye on. And we are hopeful we can find a deal inside of that.","Joseph Fisher","And Wes I guess that the project itself has made tremendous progress in terms of infrastructure, in terms of road now connecting the rest of Alameda to the waterfront. The first market rate of apartment project has started construction of the first two town hall, water sale projects has started construction. So it has now turned into real viable project at this point.","Wesley Golladay","Okay. And then looking at Brio, could you just bought that asset today and done the lease up yourself, it looks like, you know, you guys would do a much better job on the lease up than a developer. So how would you think about that versus a doing a secured loan for a year?","Harry Alcock","Wes this is Harry. So the structure is that we funded 115 million at 4.75% with an option to acquire the property, one year post TCO, which will happen sometime next year. UDR if we are managing the lease up, we get some new significant operational synergies on this and the structure allows us to mitigate lease up dilution while still managing the lease up. It gives us a fixed price option next year, we fund 75% of the purchase price today. Now we have done business with this developer in the past. We like the asset and location.","Jerry Davis","You know, what I would add to that. Harry said we get synergies just to let you know this deal is in Bellevue. I just gave you an update of all the positive things happening over in Bellevue, Kirkland. But, what makes this deal more enticing to us as it is contiguous to two additional phases of elements, buildings that were built by the same developer.","We will have price differential between Brio and the 10-year and I guess nine-year old product that it will be run with. But series said you will get synergies, we think we will be able to run meet this property on stabilization, maybe one extra person in the office and one extra person in maintenance. So, quite a bit of a benefit being located right there and being able to lay on our operating platform.","Wesley Golladay","Yes. It makes lot of sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi good morning. Jerry, you mentioned that you plan to turn the focus back to revenue initiatives in 2021. You will still be reaping the benefits, I guess from the expense efficiencies over the next three years, but can you give us a sense of what those new revenue initiatives are that you are exploring and the potential magnitude of that opportunity?","Thomas Toomey","Hey Austin, this is Toomey. Maybe I would stepped back and I will get to let Jerry answer that question, but a couple of things come to mind. And you know, I have been at this 25 plus years and I have seen over that trend developments, excuse me, investors focus, shift away from development, capabilities, to consolidations to market mix to the last five years has probably been around revenue. But our strategy and our view has always been that long-term value creation, share price appreciation comes from cash-flow growth.","And you have got seven companies today that are really good and you can see it in the convergence of our revenue on top of each other and very little differentiation. But ultimately, starting in 17 we started to look at it and say, where is our customer going, where is our margin going, because mature businesses eventually arrive at that conclusion and after 2017 concluded and started implementing in 2018 our operating platform and whether you have a billion of revenue or three billion, 100 to 300 basis point margin expansion, it is a heck of a lot of value on the table.","And I'm really happy that we are after that you can see our progress that Jerry and team are reporting on that front. And I think the best days lie ahead. But when I look back at the last years, one thing I'm struck by is in 2018 we grew cash flow 6%, 2019, 6% and 2020 at the midpoint 6%. I would like to keep that trend goal and I think what Jerry and the team are all working on with respect to the initiatives in the platform, certainly are going to be the biggest driver of that going forward.","So, I think the industry is arriving at a new door of opportunity. We are all going to go through it. There is no doubt in my mind about that because our customers already stepped through that door, and how we implement it and the speed which we implement it, will be the differentiating point. But you talked about revenue and potentials off of the platform. I will kick it back to Jerry and let him talk about where he is headed.","Jerry Davis","Yes, I mean I answered some of this earlier. But when we look at the data science component of the NextGen operating platform, I would tell everybody here that is got first glimpse of it, it has gotten pretty excited.","We see opportunities to better price our homes, when you can see things spatially through heat maps, opportunities jump off the page at you and you can just identify and really quantify where there is opportunities that you were missing when the information was either in a spreadsheet or just not quite as visible.","The other thing I think we are going to be able to do much better job on is improving resident retention, as we are able to accumulate more information about our residents and where is the best place we can go acquire, those residents in the future. I think it is going to help us drive down turnover, increase retention.","And, I think we are also going to be able to gain more and more data, compare communities to each other find best practices to reduce the time it takes to reoccupy homes or the way we always say this reduce the number of vacant days.","So, I think what you are going to see is most of it is going to come on the true occupancy and rent side, not other income initiatives that we are going to find through this data science.","Austin Wurschmidt","That is helpful. I appreciate all the commentary and thoughts there. And I guess that kind of goes a little bit into the next question, given the ability to acquire market cap rates and generate upside and cash flow growth. At this point, your acquisitions though, have been largely one-off more surgical opportunities over the last couple years and spread out fairly well geographically, but just wondering if there are any markets where you feel like you are significantly under exposed or under index to, that you would like to take a little bit more of a concentrated run at potentially through a larger transactions or a series of one-offs.","Joseph Fisher","Hey Austin it is Joe. I think our diversified approach continues to expand in terms of when we deploy capital, over the last 12 months to 18 months you have seen us all up and down the East Coast. You have seen us down in the Florida markets. We just talked about Brio and what we are doing there in Seattle.","I do you think we would like to be more active in [indiscernible] but trying to map out the risk reward and the cap rates that we get there, which are fairly compressed. So, I think you will see us continue to be diversified in the approach and spread our best and try to match on those and go get NOI upside of the platform.","Thomas Toomey","And I would just say, there is a lot of opportunity when you think about our footprint today and the buying the one next door, buying the one down the street. We don't lack for an opportunity set, we just have to be very disciplined about making sure that we accrete create the value and not the seller. And so we are going to stay focused on what we have been doing and it is worked.","Austin Wurschmidt","Understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Hill","Hey guys. Hey Joe, I think this might be a question for you given it is maybe a little bit of a guidance question. But it sounds like you guys are getting much, much smarter on your NextGen OP big data. So I'm wondering as we think about that 3.4 full-year NOI guide. How are we supposed to think about that cadence Is it still very time to leak peak leasing season? Are we supposed to think that as you get smarter and more efficient that we are going to start to see some acceleration in the back half of the year?","Joseph Fisher","Hey Rich, it is Joe. We have traditionally not provided quarter-by-quarter guidance as it relates to same-store. So, probably not going to start at this point, we would provide at 1Q FFO guidance. So probably going to leave it at that. And then you will see the cadence developed throughout the year.","Richard Hill","I figured I tried Joe, I'm not asking for thoughts. But figured I tried. Understood, understood. So coming back to the development. I think we have chatted in the past that maybe that could get up to 500 million versus a $1 billion at the peak. So I think you have referenced some land deals are starting to pencil out a little bit more. Can you just walk us through what is driving that increase and development, potentially?","Joseph Fisher","Maybe just some quick historical context. Maybe here Harry will jump in too. We had been at a billion plus for most of the cycle. So we have been very disciplined around making sure we get that 150 and 200 basis points. We haven't been focused on maintaining it a billion at all costs.","So you saw that billion shrink to zero kind of from the 2016 to 2019 timeframe as deal is completed. At this point in time, we have been working on land for quite a while, you saw the Denver parcel that we acquired last year. You saw the Union Market deal in DC that we acquired last year, both of which have been worked on for an extended period of time.","Today, we got the $300 million pipeline across three deals. Union Market is not in the active pipeline as of quarter end, but we expect it to be shortly. That is about 140 plus or minus deal. So that will take the pipeline up.","In addition, the Vitruvian to the MetLife transaction, where we had Vitruvian West 1 and now West 2 in the pipeline. We have been getting good deals with those on the mid-sixes. And so we have Vitruvian West 3 that we think will be able to move forward with your in short order. ","So that will get you back to that plus or minus a half billion, I think, depend on circumstances cost of capital and opportunities, that probably ticks a little bit higher than that in the 2% to 3% range of enterprise. So call it $500 million, $600 million, $700 million, $800 million.","But that is easy to fund when you think about the cadence of it, and the free cash flow that we throw off of 120, 150 a year, the leverage capacity that we have each and every year. And then the dispositions that we typically put out there as normal course business. So definitely not anything insurmountable from a funding standpoint.","Richard Hill","Got it. And just for clarification, this is an addition to and not lieu of the CDP program, right?","Joseph Fisher","It is a standalone, so when we talk about 500 to 700, that is typically ground up, consulted at development that we are speaking to. When you look at DCP we always traditionally thrown out there kind of the 300 million, 350 million, 400 million type of number of which we sit in the high twos today, we have some capacity to add there as well.","Richard Hill","Got it. I'm sorry for the confusing question. What I really meant was you wouldn't be reducing development capital program to increase development, it would be development increasing while the development capital program stays where it is, maybe even increasing a little bit more.","Joseph Fisher","Correct.","Richard Hill","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey good morning out there. First just a congrats to Warren, so well done. So two questions Jerry on the Smart Home technology front in answering one of the earlier questions you mentioned the revenue opportunities, occupancy and expenses, you know, the expenses I get, obviously you guys had talked about personnel retention, being able to retain your better employees and not have to go through the people cycling in and out. But as far as occupancy and rent, you know, you guys are like 96% plus, you know, the industry has had yield star or LRO any number of the pricing systems. And you said that this really isn't about driving other income. Can you just elaborate more where the Smart Home - I get it on the operational, on the expense side, but where on the revenue side if you have had really good occupancy and you have had really good rent growth through the system is where the Smart Home will help you grow on the revenue side.","Jerry Davis","On reality Smart Home, we get a rent increase at a new lease terms, call it that $20 range. We do think there is efficiency that we gain either through our maintenance people, our prospective residents being able to do some kind tours and be able to utilize the Smart Homes. Implementing leak detection devices drives down RNM as well as insurance costs.","But I don't foresee Smart Homes are going to drive occupancy. I think there is that rent pickup that you get as you add that amenity that again allows a lot more flexibility for entering your apartment, dog sitter or somebody like that have access to it.","But when we look back as we have installed these Smart Homes and look at what our market rent has done in those communities from the time before we installed till after we are comfortable that we are getting that $20, $25 pop in rents.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, Joe, just the perfunctory rent control obviously the latest from Albany is if they are looking at CPI plus three, which is, you know, light better than the CPI plus one and a half, but still obviously would not be a positive thing. Maybe you can just give your latest thoughts on what will happen in Albany and then also how that is affecting you guys looking at New York City, if you are still actively looking in New York or if you are interested in the region is now exclusively in the suburbs.","Joseph Fisher","Hey Alex. So maybe just to clarify on Albany, you may have more information than we do on this, but I think the way we looked at it, it was the greater of CPI times 1.5 or 3%. So it seemed like they were setting a 3% floor on renewals, but you still have vacancy decontrol. So, just want to clarify that.","So if that is the scenario and you still have vacancy decontrol, you still have the upside on news and you get 3% renewals as a floor. It is not what we would ideally like to see. You know, we would like to see a more constructive discussion around public, private partnerships, up zoning densification, less regulation, things of that nature.","But it is a factor that plays into our thinking when we are thinking about New York City and allocation there, as well as the broader region as well. It goes in a qualitative factor but that is pretty consistent nationally as well. You know, we are seeing increased activity nationally, and so it goes into our thinking everywhere, but that is why we like to diversify the platform that we have.","Alexander Goldfarb","But would you still consider buying in New York or you are more focused on Jersey?","Joseph Fisher","We would still consider New York. We would consider New Jersey as you saw with One William last year. New Jersey also is talking about CPI plus 5% I believe. So, I think there is a number of markets out there that are looking at that. So we will take into account each time we look at a transaction.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Security. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Malkin","Hey guys thanks. First, I want to touch on capital allocation. Given your track record, very good operating ability and capital costs both on equity and debt that are favorable. Just maybe could you talk about why the acquisition or potential acquisition outlook in your guidance was pretty light and also, if you have anything you are potentially looking at right now, that would be great.","Joseph Fisher","Hey Neil it is Joe. In terms of guidance, historically, our practice has been to not guide a speculative activity. If you go back to our guidance last year, clearly, we surpassed that from an acquisition standpoint, we were able to find creative opportunities and match fund those with well priced equity and debt. So the acquisition guidance you see there on attachment 15 - [140] (Ph) million. That is really just for Slade channel side that we announced, as well as the buyout of our group with joint venture.","So going forward, we will continue to do what we have done over the last 12 or 18 months, which is, look at the pipeline try to find opportunities that can drive additional upside as we did this year, and drive more earnings accretion and growth. And if we can do that, we will figure out where to pivot towards in terms of the source of capital.","I did mention that we have $300 million of assets in the market today. So, generally normal course business for us, but we have a pretty diverse slot of markets and cap rate rentals that we are looking at. And we like the feedback we are getting so far. So we are looking at that as well as a source of capital.","Neil Malkin","Okay. But you can't - I mean, you are talking about 300 million of assets on the black cell but I mean, in terms of you know the pipeline or the pool of assets that are potential acquisition candidates, I mean, has that trended higher just in terms of how the market flows or your cost of capital?","Joseph Fisher","I think we are saying back in November, the pipeline had dried up a little bit. But I don't know if you were down at [NMHC] (Ph). The other week, typically, that is when you start to see more activity coming to market. So typically, pipeline starts to pick up around that time, so we would expect to see more deals coming to market but again, we are going to keep disciplined around the parameters that we got to see and not just simply go out there and buy just to utilize a cost of capital.","Neil Malkin","Okay, thanks. And the other one for me is, could you just talk about your outlook for supply in Northern California and Seattle? The data vendors, there seems to be a fair amount of disconnect between data vendors. What ethics this talks about? I'm just wondering what you are seeing in those markets or what you expect to see for 2020.","Joseph Fisher","I think when you look at both Northern California and Seattle, when we look at third-party data, permit data in terms of the regression approach that we take and then talking to individuals on the ground, as we work through our budget process, both of those markets are expected to be up generally, Seattle's a little bit more flattish at a market level.","San Fran overall probably a little bit more first half weighted depending on the slippage that we see there. And then when you flip over to kind of the longer term look, and think about what we would see going forward, the permitting activity in Northern California has dropped off quite a bit more over the last three to six months versus where it had trended. Whereas Seattle has remained a little bit more static.","Neil Malkin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Joe, maybe this one is for you. You mentioned your balance sheet or your leverage is at 5.8, if I calculate the full run rate of cash flow, the JV deal, you guys closed in the fourth quarter? At 5.8, if you were to acquire something that is $2 billion portfolio I'm not saying it is the Matt Kelly one or not. But if you were to take down a deal like that. How much more could you lever up or what is the appetite to lever up, if you have an opportunity like that, that make sense? And is the current leverage kind of inhibiting you or driving you to not make those decisions, because of where it is?","Joseph Fisher","Maybe it is good to just kind of layout what we communicate in the past in terms of the goals on the balance sheet. We have talked about five to six times debt to EBITDA, fairly consistently, and our desire to stay within that range. The plan calls for that. So I guess if you say, on a justice basis, we are at 5.8 times, I guess you could say that we have the ability to lever up point two times to get to our plan, or stay within the range we have laid out.","So we really don't have any intent or desire to lever up at this point in time. We like being the solid BBB plus, BAA1, like the cost capital that affords us. And we have really been focused beyond debt-to-EBITDA on a lot of other metrics, i.e. fixed charge free cash flow, duration for three year liquidity, et cetera.","So, in totality, I think it is important to take a holistic approach to thinking about the balance sheet. Not just walking in on that debt-to-EBITDA metric, which did tick up, but obviously due to one-time issues related to MetLife time and so I wouldn't say you should expect us to lever up for transactions.","Hardik Goel","Got it. I guess maybe taking in a slightly different way. If it was to be an attractive deal out there that required a lot of capital, you would need to also have the cost of equity to kind of take it down, because as you mentioned, your balance sheet only allows you to 0.2 times?","Joseph Fisher","It is either an attractive cost of equity or we have dispositions. We have free cash flow, we have other levers to pull as we look out over the next two to three year business plan. So it is not always cost of equity when multiple sources of capital they tap into.","Hardik Goel","Got it. Thanks Joe that is helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey I guess good afternoon. I guess most of mine have been asked, but I have got a couple of market specific questions. First on Boston Market. A market that you guys have outlined, you expect to grow at a pace better than the overall portfolio assets. A market that is expecting to see a lot of supply come online this year. So just curious and by the way in the urban core, where I believe you do have a number of assets. So just curious what gives you the confidence for that kind of statement facing that kind of supply? And then maybe some comments on the lease-up over at Garrison?","Jerry Davis","Hey Haendel, this is Jerry. I think we would agree with your assessment that there is going to be supply pressures downtown. We are feeling that Seaport. We felt it there in the fourth quarter where Pier 4 had revenue growth of just 2.1%. Our properties though that are in the North shore as well as down in the South port should encounter our less supply pressures and do better.","So it is really going to be dependent on which assets you are looking at. The only property that is in our same-store pool that is downtown is Pier 4 for full-year same-store. So again, we would agree that there is going to be supply downtown. There is going to be a bit less when you get out to the suburbs, especially when you are looking at some of the B product that we have that is up in the North shore.","Garrison lease up is just doing well. It is 82% to 84% physically occupied. We finished the renovation of the amenity building that was part of that [indiscernible]. We are looking to re-engage on a unit turns again in the next couple of months. And we anticipate, while we are leasing up against a lot of new supply that a location in the back bay is highly desirable. I think is, the construction moves out of that small area or site, meaning the construction that we do during the renovation period that it is going to be a great asset.","Haendel St. Juste","I appreciate that. Jerry, what type of spread are you projecting or as you think about the revenue outlook for Boston in terms of the urban versus suburban?","Jerry Davis","Spread between those is, I think it is about a 200 basis points.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Thank you for that. And second question on Baltimore. I recall spending a lot of time last year, last summer I think we visited talking about your market predictive model and how it was leading you to be a bit more enthusiastic about Baltimore, a market where a lot of your peers seem to be shying away from. So, can you talk a bit more about what you are seeing in Baltimore today leading you to call out of the market that you expect to see some of the most deceleration. It doesn't look like there is a lot of supply coming online in that market this year. So maybe you can talk about what has perhaps changed in your view on Baltimore over the last six or so months and what was perhaps underappreciated in your market revenue model.","Joseph Fisher","Alex it is Joe. And then I will kick it over to Jerry for some more specifics. [Technical Difficulty] As it relates to the predictive analytics piece and how we were looking at that a year ago and what drove us to think about that. You know, that is a quantitative approach, so it shines a light on markets that we think are set for our performance.","But you still have to take a qualitative approach and make sure that the expectations on the ground actually meet up with what the model or the machine tells you. So things that got us excited about Baltimore, historically it has had very stable job growth typically in-line with national averages.","We have seen that continue from an affordability standpoint, one of the most affordable East Coast cities out there, you know, job diversification wise, when you look at it, especially in the cyber security and defense side, very strong there, but they also have a good biomedical, healthcare, education government.","So you have a good stabilizing factor in terms of volatility performance in Baltimore, which is good from a portfolio of construct standpoint. And then you have a very highly educated workforce, you know, their top 10 in STEM jobs, top 10 and graduate degrees as a percentage of workforce. So there are a lot of things that were going for the MSA as a whole.","And then you obviously have to narrow it down to a sub market - which is what we did with Roger Sports. So we are not necessarily in Baltimore proper. So we had to pick the right sub market. So that is kind of what led us there over the long-term. You know, short-term volatility obviously comes through in results, but it is more of a long-term play. So maybe if Jerry wants to close it out.","Jerry Davis","Yes, I would just add it is one of the markets we see where there is going to be elevated supply this year versus last year, a couple thousand units. When we look at our sub markets got about 700 of those units are coming within a mile of our property in the Towson area.","So last year we did 3.1% revenue growth, this year we expect it to be down in the twos. So again, I think as Joe said, we like the market but that is more of a mid and long-term not any \u2013 how is it going to come here? And I think over the next year, we are going see [Technical Difficulty].","Haendel St. Juste","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Toomey","Hey John, are you there? You might be on mute. Operator do we have anyone else left in the queue? ","Operator","Yes we do. Our next person in queue is John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Thanks a lot for the time. Harry, hoping you could describe for us on the DCP front and a bit intense year-end. Just last three to six months how the competition has fared one way or the other?","Harry Alcock","Sure, John, I think you have seen supply has been relatively stable. There continues to be demand from developers. There is also additional competition from a number of dead funds. It has been the same the past 12 or 18 months, we are continuing to find opportunities that sort of fit our parameters in terms of assets that we want to own long-term. They fit our return hurdles. You saw us close a deal in Oakland last year. We have others that we are looking as we look to not only back build our historic pipeline, but also add incremental.","John Pawlowski","As the pricing within that solid deal flow as a pricing on deals become more competitive?","Harry Alcock","I think there are circumstances where it has been. Again, just as you have more players in the space but the deals we are doing, we are underwriting a consistent IRR. We are always looking for deals that fit our parameters. So our expectation is that the transactions we enter into the returns will be very consistent to what we have done historically.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue. I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Toomey for closing remarks.","Thomas Toomey","Well, a quick closing. I want to thank you for your time and interest in UDR. Clearly, you can hear that we are excited about 2020 and certainly our future beyond that. We have the right team, the right plan. Just look forward to executing on it.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Vice President, Chris Van Ens. Thank you, Mr. Van Ens, you may begin.","Christopher Van Ens","Welcome to UDR's first quarter financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. Statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to UDR's Chairman, CEO and President, Tom Toomey.","Thomas Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and welcome to UDR's First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe; and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. ","Our strong first quarter results reaffirm the 2018 macroeconomic outlook we provided back in February, in which we anticipated solid job growth and accelerating wage growth with a bias towards tax reform being a net positive. These factors, when weighed against elevated new apartment supply, contribute to our ongoing view that 2018's pricing power and occupancy will be relatively similar to 2017 levels. Taken altogether, a strong backdrop for apartments. ","Moving on, the UDR team is optimistic on our prospects. Why? First, our operating platform continues to produce steady results in a volatile world. While it is still early in the year, occupancy is near 97%, and we are set up well entering the peak leasing season. Jerry will further highlight our success during his prepared remarks. ","Second, our $811 million of development in lease-up is 90% funded, with aggregate rental rates and velocities in line with expectations. Strong pre-leasing at 345 Harrison and a pickup in leasing velocity at Pacific City, our 2 large developments in Boston and Huntington Beach, reaffirm our view that 2019 development earn-in will improve materially versus 2018. Jerry, again, will provide some color on these communities. ","Third, our balance sheet remains liquid and safe. Disciplined use of capital during the quarter included $20 million of share repurchases and the funding of a new Developer Capital Program deal. We continue to underwrite a variety of opportunities in the market with a focus on additional DCP investments. Joe will provide more details in his prepared remarks. ","Last, a special thanks to all our UDR associates for your continued hard work to produce another solid quarter of results. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. First quarter year-over-year revenue and NOI growth for our same-store pool, which now represents 85% of total NOI, were 3% and 2.7%, respectively. After including pro rata same-store JV communities, which are heavily weighted towards urban, A+ product and is battling new supply, revenue and NOI growth were 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by solid blended lease rate growth of 2.7% and a robust top line contribution from our long-lived operating and technology initiatives. While it is still early in the year, we're encouraged by what we are seeing on a number of fronts as we approach the prime leasing season. First, our year-over-year blended lease rate growth for the quarter was 20 basis points higher than during the same period last year. This crossover is the first positive spread we have seen since the first quarter of 2016. ","Second, other income grew by 9% in the quarter. As in past quarters, this was driven by our revenue-generating initiatives, specifically parking, which increased by 19%; and our shorter-term leasing program, which has grown nicely since its rollout in early 2017. ","Third, year-over-year turnover declined by 120 basis points. This is especially impressive given that our shorter-term leasing initiative should result in higher turnover. ","Fourth, while our quarterly overall expense growth was elevated at 3.6% due to real estate tax pressures, our controllable expenses declined by 0.4% year-over-year. Of particular note, our personnel cost declined by 2.8% due to our continuing focus on achieving efficiencies throughout our business. We remain comfortable with our same-store expense growth guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%. ","And fifth, rent concessions during the quarter were 22% lower than last year, and gift card expense was down 48%. Both of these indicate a more rational pricing environment for lease-ups. These factors, when combined with our 96.9% occupancy, set us up well for the prime leasing season. ","Next, a rundown of markets. The vast majority of our markets are performing in line with expectations with a few exceptions. To date, Orlando has meaningfully outperformed our original forecast, while Austin has struggled as the result of new supply pressures. As a reminder, these are both relatively small markets for UDR. ","Regarding New York City. Year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth turned negative during the first quarter. This is more so the result of positive one-timers realized in the first quarter of 2017 than a change in market dynamics. We continue to forecast slightly positive growth in New York during 2018. ","Moving on. We saw minimal pressure from move-outs to home purchase or rent increase at 12% and 6% of reasons for move-out during the first quarter. Likewise, net bad debt remains low at 0.1% of rents. All are at levels consistent with previous quarters. ","Last, our development pipeline, in aggregate, continues to generate lease rates and leasing velocities in line with original expectations. In our $350 million Pacific City development in Huntington Beach, leasing velocity increased significantly during the first quarter as construction was completed. We ended the quarter at 51% leased and sit at 56% today, all with rent rates in line with our underwriting expectations. ","At 345 Harrison, our $367 million project in Boston, we ended the quarter at 35% pre-leased and are 39% today, with rental rates in line with underwriting expectations. We deliver our first homes in early May and are enthused by the communities' reception to date. ","Our two JV developments remain on budget and on schedule. Similar to last quarter, our Vitruvian West community, located in Addison, Texas, continues to perform well in excess of underwriting expectations. Our vision on Wilshire community, located in Los Angeles, recently opened its doors and is performing in line with expectations. Community-specific, quarter-end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 of our supplement. ","Finally, I would like to again thank all of our associates in the field and at corporate for another strong quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results and forward guidance, a transactions and investments update and a capital markets and balance sheet update. ","Our first quarter earnings results came in at the midpoints of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share were $0.47 and $0.45. First quarter AFFO was up $0.02 or 5% year-over-year, driven by our strong operating results and disciplined capital allocation decisions. ","I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 of our supplement, which details our latest guidance expectations. We have reaffirmed our previously provided full year 2018 FFO as adjusted, AFFO and same-store growth guidance ranges. For the second quarter, our guidance ranges are $0.47 to $0.49 for FFO as adjusted and $0.43 to $0.45 for AFFO. ","Next, transactions and investments. As previously announced during the quarter, we sold Pacific Shores, a 264-home wholly owned community in Orange County, for $90.5 million at a low 5% yield. ","Regarding development. Our desire to add land to the balance sheet to restock our pipeline over time continues to be a goal. However, given the difficulty in sourcing economical land in many of our markets, our pipeline will continue to shrink for the foreseeable future. Still, there are opportunities that satisfy our disciplined underwriting approach. With this in mind, we entered into a contract to purchase a $13.2 million land parcel located in Denver during the quarter. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. ","In our Developer Capital Program, we invested $20 million into a 220-home development located in Alameda, California at a current return of 12%. In addition, all of DTLA, a 293-home West Coast development joint venture community located in Los Angeles, transitioned to a longer-term hold as the option period for purchase lapsed during the quarter. ","At quarter-end, our DCP investment balance was $159 million with an effective yield at the mid-7% range and maturities that take place over the next 4.5 years. We continue to favor further investment in our DCP program assuming new opportunities satisfy our parameters. ","Next, capital markets and balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased $20 million of common shares at an average price of $33.69, a strong use of capital given our prevailing discount to NAV and the inherent risk-adjusted return in our stock. ","At quarter-end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity net of the commercial paper balance, was $843 million. Our financial leverage was 33.1% on undepreciated book value, 25.8% on enterprise value and 30.7%, inclusive of joint ventures. Our consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.8x and inclusive of joint ventures, it was 6.4x. ","We remain comfortable with our credit metrics and don't plan to actively lever up or down, although you will likely see lower commercial paper balances later in 2018, depending on the size of our forward capital commitments. ","With regard to the profile of our balance sheet, we continue to look for NPV-positive opportunities to improve our 5.1-year duration and increase the size of our unencumbered NOI pool. ","Finally, we declared an annualized common dividend of $1.29 in the first quarter for a dividend yield of approximately 3.6% at quarter-end. ","With that, I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph","I wonder if you can walk through your decision to transition to West Coast JV asset to long-term hold versus selling or anything else that you contemplated.","Harry Alcock","Nick, this is Harry. I'd tell you, we like the asset long term, but realize there's some short-term headwinds in downtown L.A. with supply. Therefore, we didn't want to be a buyer due to the short term nor seller due to the long term. Wolff, our partner, agreed that we ended up with a hold where our return is based on our below-market value, volume and price.","Joseph Fisher","And the only thing I'd add to that, this is Joe, is just in terms if you look at our guidance how we moved around the uses. The fact that we did not execute a buy on DTLA, we were actually able to pivot some of those planned uses over into a stock buyback of about $20 million. So we effectively traded a low 4s cap for a midsize on our stock.","Nicholas Joseph","And then you mentioned the crossover in terms of blended lease rate growth in the first quarter with 1Q '18 being higher than 1Q '17. Does guidance assume that the positive spread is maintained throughout 2018?","Jerry Davis","Nick, this is Jerry. Right now, the guidance really assumes it's going to be about even with last year, so maybe slightly ahead. And as we look into the month of April, we're continuing to see it being right on top of where we were in 2017. Our expectation is it may broaden a little bit, depending on how the leasing season goes. But yes, when you look at the blended rate growth for the full year, we think it's probably going to be in the mid- to high 2s, which would be up right about where it was last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Juan Sanabria","Just on the same-store revenue guidance. What's the upside and downside risk from here relative to the midpoint? And could you give us a sense of any second quarter trends you're seeing today, either on new or renewal trends?","Jerry Davis","Sure, Juan. This is Jerry. Right now, as we look at the second quarter, we're seeing for the rents, we're seeing April come in slightly higher, as I just said to Nick, than it did last April. But it's modest. But it's the typical seasonal progression, as you would expect. In the first quarter, we had blended -- or we had first quarter new lease rate growth of 0.4%. But when you look at the components of that, it went from a negative 0.3% in January to a negative 0.3% in February, and then it jumped up to 1.5%, which, again, is kind of normal seasonality. Right now, April, for new, is looking like it's going to be low 2s. So continuing to increase as we would expect throughout the summer. On renewals, those stay pretty static throughout the year. We came in right around the 5 in the first quarter, and that's about where April is looking to come in. And that's what we would expect for the second quarter. When you look at revenue growth or the progression, we had a 3% revenue growth in the first quarter.","We expect that to increase slightly in the second quarter. And then when you get beyond second quarter, it's heavily dependent on the strength of leasing season. But as we look at leasing season, the position we're in today, with the occupancy of 96.9%, concession levels being a bit lower than they were last year and not as much of a reliance on gift cards, we feel pretty good going into the middle of the year in this prime leasing season. When you say how do you get to the top and bottom of our revenue guidance, and again, to remind you, our guidance is 2.5 to 3.5. So we're right on top of the midpoint of the first quarter. It's probably going to be difficult to get to the bottom half unless there's really a downturn in rent levels later in this year. But when you look at the upside, what it really takes is a continuation of the contribution from other income, which is putting in about 60 basis points of additional revenue growth as well as a pickup in rate that, ideally, we would get with a seasonal uptick.","Juan Sanabria","Great. And then just one more question for me, just on supply. What's the level of conviction that '19 supply deliveries will, in fact, be down across your markets? And any thoughts on the volatile, but stubbornly high permit levels and just general comments on access to construction financing?","Joseph Fisher","Juan, this is Joe. So I don't think our overall view on supply in '19 has really changed from last quarter when we spoke to kind of a flat to down 10% type of number. That was predicated on what we saw throughout '17, which was permits and starts activity, both coming down about 10% from 2016 levels. Obviously, the outlook is a little bit more fuzzy with the starting permit activity that we see in the start of the year that's ticked back up a little bit. But when we look at the '17 activity, when we look at our permit-based regression model, and then when we take into account all the qualitative factors, meaning the difficulty in finding land, the difficulty on the construction financing side, continuing to see hard cost exceed rent growth, and therefore, difficulty hitting return requirements. I think you still have a difficult environment and see supply ramp up meaningfully. But overall, we think we're probably flat to down 10% in '19, with -- market-wise, markets are down more in our view would be Orange County, Orlando, Nashville and Austin. And those that probably might see a little bit more flat to maybe even up would be D.C., L.A. and Northern California.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","I wanted to maybe just dig in a little bit to the Southwest portfolio and specifically, Austin and Dallas. We hear about some increasing demand in the state of Texas, but it seems like it's becoming a much more nuanced market between cities and even micro areas within cities. So maybe the Southwest was a little bit weaker than we were expecting. So I'm just curious about what you're seeing, maybe focus on Dallas. Would you consider the Houston market? How are you thinking about the Texas market at this point?","Jerry Davis","I guess, I'll start first about what we're seeing in those 2 markets, and then maybe Tom or Harry can jump in on the markets we're not currently in. But you look in Dallas, and it definitely was a slowdown from the results we put up last year as far as revenue growth. And while job growth in Dallas continues to be strong at about 69,000 new jobs expected in '18 or about 2.6%, you're seeing, especially in our portfolio, heavy new supply coming into that North Dallas area of Plano, Frisco. We've got 1,000-unit property that's in the legacy village retail area. And new supply has been able, currently, to offset the positive impacts of jobs from Toyota, Liberty Mutual, JPMorgan into there over the last 6 months and what we would expect for the next couple of months. We've -- down in our Addison area, we've got some B properties down there. And when there's not new supply, they're doing extremely well, with revenue growth of about 7%. But also, we're doing the fourth project in our Vitruvian Park assemblage. And that property is doing extremely well.","We're getting a little bit more than pro forma rents. But in the -- for 3 months since we've opened there, we've gotten leased occupancy up to about 56%. So it is a submarket-by-submarket issue. So that Addison area is tending to do well. B product is doing extremely well. Uptown, where we have just one property, it's very difficult down there. But right now, what's affecting our same-store numbers predominantly is that Plano area. Then when you jump over to Austin, same story. Job growth is strong there, but heavy new -- and job growth is about 3.5%. But heavy supply of about 8,000 homes coming in 2018 is really putting a lid on where rent growth can go. What's interesting, though, is our MetLife joint venture product, which is A+ downtown product, is doing really well. It came in with stronger revenue growth than we've seen in the last couple of years. It was at 2.6%. And now it's even higher than some of our B product up in the Cedar Park area. So it's pocket by pocket. Downtown Austin is starting to loosen up a bit and allow us to get some growth, but it's moved down to other submarkets and price points.","Richard Hill","Got it. And are you seeing anything -- any opportunities in Houston? Or you're sticking to your knitting in Austin and Dallas at this point?","Thomas Toomey","I think we're very comfortable -- this is Tom -- with respect to our Dallas and Austin exposure, and we'll continue to look for opportunities in those 2 markets. Houston is not particularly attractive to us at this time.","Richard Hill","Okay. And Joe, maybe one -- just one quick question for you. On the DCP program, it looks like it's maybe a little bit lower than where it's trended recently. You think you can get that back up to $300 million, maybe even a little bit higher?","Joseph Fisher","Rich, our goal, our soft ceiling that we've placed on it is around $300 million, really driven by we want to be an asset to markets that we would want to own long term. And then obviously, the earnings accretion that comes from it is nice. But at a point in time when construction financing may come back in the future, we don't want to get squeezed out and have an earnings cliff despite the fact that we do have pretty long duration on these assets. So we have about another $50 million, call it, of funding related to the DCP other assets that are down in the bottom of 12b. So that will take us to just over $200 million. And I said Harry and his team are still hard at work trying to find additional assets to backfill any future roll-off or try to get to that $300 million. I think we'll hopefully have some success at some point this year on that front, but nothing's been taken into account within guidance at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","First one, Jerry, you mentioned rent concessions and gift cards have abated pretty significantly year-over-year, and I'm just curious what markets are you seeing the biggest declines? And any markets that are increasing, I guess, on the flip side? And what are you expecting for that? How do you expect that to trend as the year progresses?","Jerry Davis","I think as you compare to last year, I wouldn't expect concessions to go up. They'll probably stay fairly stable to down modestly. Seen a little bit more concessionary pressures in New York. I wouldn't say it's significant. Markets that are down most significantly. Our Bellevue properties are feeling less new supply. That could perk up a little bit later this year when another 600 to 1,000 units get delivered. We went through new supply last year and right now, it's fairly stable. And then our San Francisco, specifically SoMa area, properties are down. So most of the decline is in those markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","And maybe sticking with San Fran a bit. It's been a market -- you said on the last call, I think, that it started out the year better than expected. Blended lease rates were up sequentially and year-over-year, yet revenue growth decelerated a bit. Is that just timing related to when those leases hit? Or was there something in the other income component that was a bit of a headwind? Can you just provide a little bit of color there?","Jerry Davis","It's really not other income. That's still doing well. I think San Francisco should continue to accelerate as far as revenue growth throughout the rest of the year. You're still playing off -- when you look at revenue, it's a buildup of, as you know, what you've done over the prior 4 quarters. So we are encouraged by the strength of blended rate growth right now in San Francisco. And while the first quarter came in roughly where we expected it to, I think some of the rents we've been putting into place over the last 60 days or so should help it to outperform, unless there's a slowdown that comes. But we're looking -- we're really seeing a bit of a strength -- I won't say strength, but stabilization that's happening in that downtown area. A lot of jobs have come into Financial District, the Salesforce building that opened. You're seeing new job creation down in Mission Bay. And we did feel some weakness, though, in this quarter in the Peninsula.","Harry Alcock","Austin, this is Harry. Just real quick, one other point. Jerry mentioned the jobs, but it's pretty remarkable if you look at the sort of volume of office leasing activity that's taking place both in downtown and at Mission Bay, where Salesforce is taking 700,000 square feet. Dropbox is taking 500,000 square feet down in Mission Bay. Uber is taking 500,000 square feet. There's sort of a rumored single-tenant lease of 700,000 square feet to come in the future at -- near our 399 Fremont project. And these are going to tend to be high-paying jobs. It really is pretty remarkable.","Austin Wurschmidt","Appreciate the additional color. What was your revenue assumption for San Fran this year?","Jerry Davis","Oh, gosh. I want to say it was in the high end of our guidance range. We typically...","Christopher Van Ens","He got cut off.","Jerry Davis","Let's move on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Richard Hightower","So I want to start on the labor expense success during the quarter. It's pretty impressive compared to other trends that we've seen. Can you -- Jerry, can you maybe a little bit more color as to what was driving the same-store reduction? Was it reductions in FTEs or something related to staffing models? Or just what was some of the detail there?","Jerry Davis","Sure, Rich. It was predominantly what you just brought up. Our personnel was down 2.8%. We give raises at the beginning of each year, and I can tell you, the raises that we gave were between 2.5% and 3%. So we are continuing to increase people's compensation. But late last year -- middle to late of last year, we started looking at finding ways to create a more efficient workforce, either through technology or just reductions in staff cut several percent of our workforce out in the field. The second thing, though, is in the first quarter, we probably -- it was an open decision, but waited longer than we would want to because of the lack of available labor. So a little bit of it was purposeful staffing reductions. A smaller portion of it was holding positions open a little bit longer as we look to find the right people. Our expectation, as you get through the full year, would be that personnel expense would be slightly negative to maybe flat. So I wouldn't expect it to be down 2.5% to 3% for the remainder of the year, but I still think we're going to have good control over it.","Richard Hightower","All right. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up there. Are you noticing a divergence between B assets and A assets or different markets where maybe supply has been more of an issue that might lead to more labor tightening as you think about where expenses might grow across the portfolio and where you're seeing those reductions that you just described?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I think the reductions that we found predominantly were on B garden assets as we really looked at it hard. I think pricing or wage pressure, you're finding being more prevalent in the A assets, specifically in urban locations where there's heavy competition from the lease-ups for people.","Richard Hightower","All right. That's very helpful. My next question here is probably for Joe. Just in terms of the share repurchase activity for the quarter, is there a message to communicate there to the market in terms of the predictability of those sorts of investments? Or is it just opportunistic as you're able to sell assets and sort of recycle that capital in a way that realizes that positive cap rates spread that was mentioned earlier? How should we think about that in terms of the predictability of the volume, the pace, et cetera?","Joseph Fisher","Yes. I think, Rich, one of the words to use there is opportunistic is probably the most appropriate. When you look at the parameters we laid out in the past around discounts to NAV sources and uses, leveraging, et cetera. The only one that really changed within the quarter was the discount to NAV from last time we spoke. So we got down to a fairly substantial discount. Was able to purchase shares at 5.6%. And what you saw was we didn't actually shift our sources of capital, meaning, we didn't go out there and try to ramp up dispositions to fund it. We simply pivoted from additional development and additional acquisitions. So I think we'll take it week by week, month by month and evaluate when we get to a certain level of discount if we have additional capacity available to us. And like the risk return on buybacks versus some other alternative investments, we'll look to pick away. But we definitely aren't committed to a certain dollar size. We're not going to come out and communicate that. But overall, we like what we're able to execute even if it was a little bit small.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman.","Dennis McGill","First one just has to do with the short-term lease program that you talked about and the success that you're having. Can you just maybe help frame a little bit how, what percentage of leases today are on that short-term basis? And then any characteristics of the residents that are choosing short term? And any thoughts on why that's been gaining traction?","Jerry Davis","Sure. I would tell you, even though it's had a significant impact to -- or fairly significant impact to our other income growth, we think it's going to contribute, call it, $3.5 million to $4 million this year to our bottom line. So the number of leases at any given time rarely get above 100 throughout the portfolio as some of those being in our MetLife portfolio, some being in the same-stores. So it's a fairly small percentage of our total occupancy. We try to put a limit at most properties of no more than 1% to 2% of the unit count so we don't get overly exposed. So not a huge risk there. And when you look at who's coming in, it's really a split between 50-50 roughly between business. So it's corporate relocations, short-term assignments of people wanting to come in. And they need to come in for 31 days plus, although our average stay is up in the 70s, and it's much more affordable than a hotel. And then the other half is more on a personal basis, I sold my house. I need somewhere to live for a little while. I have some sort of a medical issue or I need to be near a hospital, things like that. But it's about 50-50 between personal and business.","Dennis McGill","Okay. That's helpful. And just to clarify, that would only be on new leases. You're not offering that on renewals?","Jerry Davis","Yes. These would be -- I don't know if we would -- probably if somebody really wanted to, we would look at it. But I think everything we've done to date has been on new.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Perfect. And then separately, can you maybe just offer thoughts on Seattle and what you're seeing in that market seems to be transitioning maybe a little quicker than some of the other markets or not necessarily your portfolio, but industry-wide and curious on your perspective of what you're seeing?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I think Seattle, as you know, has heavy new supply currently. I know in the first quarter, we had revenue growth of 5.2%. We're -- we have really no wholly owned assets in the downtown area. We have one MetLife joint venture that is combating new supply. So it's a bit of a challenge downtown. We have 2 properties up, University District has new supply. But a lot of the new supply sitting today is downtown. The majority of our portfolio is over on the east side, with a heavy segment in Bellevue. And as I stated earlier on the call, Bellevue went through a bout of a new supply coming throughout last year. We expect some new supply to come at it later this year too. But right now, Bellevue remains strong. It had revenue growth in the first quarter of 5.9%. So it's strong. Interestingly, when you look at office vacancy rates in Bellevue, it's down to 2%, so it's full. We've had a lot of large tech firms and other types of companies create campuses over there. REI just consolidated 4 or 5 of their facilities to form a campus. Salesforce has rented out a building over there. Amazon jumped across, like, Washington, and they have a foothold there too.","Facebook is over there. So Bellevue is doing very well. And then we've got some B product also that continues to put up very strong numbers. I think when you look at the supply that's coming at Seattle, a lot of it has been focused downtown. So it does affect the entire market. It probably affects us a little bit less than most because of our heavier weighting over on the east side. A lot of people are concerned about the HQ2 diverting some of the jobs away from Downtown Seattle. I can tell you, it seems like it's being supplemented as those Amazon job projections go down a bit. You've got an influx of people into both Bellevue as well as the South Lake Union area from Apple, Facebook, Google. So job growth continues to feel good. Wage growth in Seattle is over 3%. But supply, I think, is going to be a headwind throughout this year, maybe early next year. But it's going to be predominantly focused in the downtown area.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Robert Stevenson","Jerry, D.C. and Orange County were in your sort of 2.5% to 3.5% same-store revenue growth bucket when you gave guidance a few months ago. Anything operationally you're seeing after 4 months give you more optimism on D.C.? And then on Orange County, given that they did 4.1% in the first quarter, are you expecting any deterioration in same-store revenue growth there? Or is it on track to outperform initial expectations?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I'll start with the Orange County, Rob. Orange County had a good first quarter. Like you said, 4.1%, a little bit higher than our full year. It's kind of pacing where we would expect it to. I think you're going to see new supply, especially in the Irvine as well as Huntington Beach area put a little pressure on us. So I still think, at this point, we're comfortable that it's going to probably come back down a little bit. Ideally, we'll find a way to beat that range. But right now, I don't think there's a big change. You're seeing decent job growth, but new supply of 5,000 homes is putting some pressure on us. D.C., we had an uptick on revenue growth from where it was in 4Q. It was 1.9%. In 4Q, it's 2.3%. There's heavy new supply, as I stated in prior calls, still coming at us in the Southwest Waterfront, Ballpark, NoMa areas. Our B portfolio is doing well. Our A assets inside the city are continuing to feel pressures, especially our U Street product -- our 14th Street rather up around U is getting hit pretty hard. We're seeing a spread between the As and Bs in D.C. where As are currently at about 200 basis points lower growth than Bs. So last year, that had kind of compressed. Now it's expanded again as new supplies come in downtown. But we do believe that we'll end up at least in that range of 2.5% to 3.5%, as we had said early in the year. Nothing really negative at this time. Job growth is starting to come into the city. And while there's still some heavy concessionary pressures, again, in those certain submarkets within the district, it doesn't feel like it's having as much of an impact as it did in the second half of last year.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then from -- given your comments about capital allocation, from that perspective, where does redevelopment rank today? And what's the redevelopment opportunity, both in terms of the more general kitchen and bath and other small-scale refreshes versus the larger-scale construction projects in the -- available to you in the portfolio today?","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Robert. It's Joe. You mentioned two different pieces there. One, being our traditional revenue-enhancing program, which we guided to $40 million to $45 million. So slightly down from last year, but still seeing a good opportunity set in terms of the ability to get mid- to high-teens cash on cash, getting IRRs that are 150 basis points above what we have for our WACC. So still seeing good opportunity set there. I'd say about, call it, 35%, 40% of those are K&Bs with the rest being more amenity-based projects. From a redevelopment standpoint, we continue to look at it, whether it's densification, larger-scale opportunities, taking down a building off-line and that's fine, saying take 30 units off and put 100 up. There's a number of opportunities that are being evaluated given the fact that overall, we feel pretty good about the fundamental profile going forward in most of our markets. So it ranks up there. It's a priority that the group's working on, but I think today that we put into the pipeline.","Jerry Davis","And I would add, Rob, there's probably, I don't know, 5 to 10 properties that would screen towards potential redevs as we look at them. When I look at the markets they're located in, there's probably a couple in Seattle, a couple in Boston, a handful in D.C. that would probably screen towards that at this point. But it's not a super deep bench, but there are some opportunities. And I think we'll be looking at those as we get into the summer to determine if there's any we would want to start and have in process next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","On the Denver land acquisition, can you just provide some color on the submarket where you purchased the land and the potential timing of construction? And then I think in the past, you talked about Denver being a market with supply pressures. I'm just wondering what makes you comfortable building in this market.","Harry Alcock","Sure. John, this is Harry. First, it's in a justifying area, right up above Mile High Stadium. It's near transit. It's an area, we believe, will benefit significantly from continued densification in and around the site Denver Broncos have a major plan, which is right across the street. Elix Garden's redevelopment is also right across the highway. Continued Sloan's Lake development, et cetera. We wouldn't start construction until the first half of next year, meaning, this is really a late '20 or early '21-type lease-up, which is one of the variables that gives us comfort in terms of a supply. We're really looking at 2.5 or more likely 3 years out. And just in general, as it relates to development, we continue to look for sites given, as you know, we like development and all of its benefits long term. We continue to be disciplined. As you can see our pipeline at $800 million or so, which 90% is funded. Most of our existing pipeline will be completed by early next year, and this is just the site that conserved the backfill of our pipeline in ordinary course.","Jerry Davis","Yes. I would add, John, just 1 or 2 things about that site. It's -- Harry told you about the location. It's very walkable to the light rail. When you look at the price point he's going to be able to build that, the rents are going to be significantly below what downtown product is renting for. And similar to what we did at our CityLine property up in Seattle, where you get that kind of a divergence in price from that core to a slight travel in, I think it really has the opportunity to do extremely well. And I do think the retail in that area is going to build up along with the nightlife. So -- but the big thing Harry said that you keep in mind, it's several years out. The supply pressures that we're feeling right now should easily get absorbed by the significant population and job growth that's coming today and should come for the next several years.","John Kim","Okay. And then the 9% increase you had in real estate taxes, how much of that was related to 421-a in New York versus other markets? And are there any opportunities to appeal tax in other markets?","Joseph Fisher","John, it's Joe. So I'll briefly touch on just the 421, and then Jerry can maybe take you through appeal opportunity. So if you actually look on Attachment 6 in our supp, you can see that down there in the bottom, we do still provide detail related to 421 down in Footnote 2. So you could see in the quarter, about 366,000 or basically 1.4% increase to real estate tax. If you look at our full year expectations, we think it's going to be about $1.3 million, which is again about a 1.4% increase to real estate tax. Obviously, a much lower percentage impact when you go to total expenses and really only about a 15 to 20 basis point impact in NOI overall. So fairly minimal, but we do expect kind of a similar impact going forward for the next several years.","Jerry Davis","And I would just add on total real estate taxes. We appeal everything. I think there's a few out there that we would expect to win that aren't in our forecast, but I don't think it's going to be a hugely significant amount. As we stated earlier this year, when we gave out guidance on expenses, we knew the real estate taxes were going to be high single digits. We still believe that's probably going to be true. And we're working hard to offset it with controllable expenses being kept in check. This past quarter, they were basically flat, if not down slightly. But in addition to New York, as Joe said, you're looking at valuations going up in places like Seattle, Florida, Texas that are driving a lot of this real estate tax growth, too. So you got a look at the other side of it, while your taxes are going up, so are the values of the properties that are having to pay these higher taxes.","John Kim","And can you remind us, is the 421-a burn-off a onetime issue predominantly this year? Or is that going to be an issue going forward?","Joseph Fisher","No. It's going to remain an issue for the next several years for us. It peaks out in 2020, not much above these levels and then dwindles from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Santos with Sandler O'Neill.","Daniel Santos","Just quickly, just wanted to know if you guys can comment on your general ability to shelter gains from asset sales to fund buybacks?","Joseph Fisher","Daniel, it's Joe. So we do have restrictions as regards to share in terms of payout of income and gain capacity relative to our taxable income and our dividend. Today, I'd say we have about $100 million of gain capacity in the system, which dependent on the efficiency of the asset, i.e., the embedded gain that exists, can give you anywhere from, say, $100 million to $200 million, if not more, to be able to sell in a given year. Those sales are typically allocated to fund normal course business, meaning our development program, our DCP program, et cetera. So to go beyond that and sell additional assets, you do have certain levers that you can pull, meaning pulling forward dividends and things of that nature. But those are really kind of onetime in nature that may set you up on a go-forward basis and a less advantageous position. So at this point, we don't feel the discount is compelling enough to start to pull forward dividend and gain capacity, but we do have that lever to pull in the future to the extent that we have a much larger discount.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","I'm a little new to this, but it looks like you did a $20 million land loan in Alameda with a 1-year maturity. It almost seems not worth the effort for only a year maturity. Is there more to it than that?","Harry Alcock","John, this is Harry Alcock. Yes, the expectation is that once the developer has a completed development plan and begins construction that we would grow that in actually increase it into sort of a normal Developer Capital Program\/preferred equity-type investment. And in fact, in the document, we have a right to provide that, providing the ultimate economics makes sense to us. Our expectation is this is going to roll into a much longer-term investment.","John Guinee","Great. Okay. And then sort of a big-picture question. It seems to me that depending on whose numbers you look at, we're delivering about 350,000 units annually in this country. And that probably equates to at least 2,000 projects. And it appears to me that most of these projects are delivering except in the most aggressive areas, that a 6 yield on cost. Why is it that UDR has chosen to not play that game? This supply is going to come whether UDR or the public REITs build a project or 2 or not?","Joseph Fisher","John. Maybe I'll just take a little bit of it. One, I think you got to start with cost of capital. You look at where we're at today at a discount to NAV, which doesn't necessarily give you a strong signal to go and be aggressive on external growth. So if you look at alternative uses, we do have other opportunities out there. So we are not just purely a developer. We can pivot at any given point in time, which we've shown with DCP and buybacks. And then lastly, we are participating. We just remained incredibly disciplined around it, which has been shown through the shrinking pipeline over the last couple years. But now that we are starting to find some opportunities such as this Denver deal, that still meets our 150, 200 basis points spread requirement and gets us up into the 6-plus type of yield. So it's not that we're not going to participate. It's not that we don't want to. It's simply that there's a discipline and alternatives around it that we can go to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Going back to the property tax conversation. Outside of the typical catch-up from assessed values to market values, are you guys seeing any inflection points from perhaps fiscally strained cities or states that are reaching more aggressively for property taxes, which could persist for a couple years now?","Jerry Davis","This is Jerry. The only one I've heard or seen that occurring maybe is in the Seattle market with either King or Snohomish County, but I haven't seen it anywhere else.","Thomas Toomey","The only thing I would add, I think your research has pointed it out. I mean, this is primarily driven by the fact that the asset values continue to go up, and operations trends continue to improve. So I mean, our earlier remarks, we continue to believe that the real estate and tax environment is going to be challenging, but reflective, it makes rational sense if operations are improving and values are improving. How states fund themselves, I think there's a wide range of outcomes on that topic. And I'm waiting to see some more research from people when they start looking at deficits and how cities are planning to fund their education for the future.","John Pawlowski","Exactly. That's why I asked, trying to catch early glimpses of the next Chicago to overuse a case study. Harry, how would you characterize the competitiveness of the preferred lending space versus last year? Is this tranche of financing becoming cheaper or more expensive for the developers you guys usually work with?","Harry Alcock","I think it's remained fairly consistent. There continue to be opportunities. The senior sort of lending environment has not changed, meaning, proceeds have not ticked up. Developers are still typically limited to 50% to 55%, maybe 60% loan to cost. In some circumstances, equity is still available, but not in the same levels that it was two years ago. So I think that tranche has remained fairly consistent over the past 12 months or so in terms of both opportunity set and in terms of pricing levels.","Thomas Toomey","John, this is Toomey. I'd add a couple of points that are interesting to me when I look at it. The spread on construction loan, L plus 200 a year ago, 2 years ago, is now an L plus 350, 400. When you combine that at a 55% proceed 60, there's probably more opportunity coming our way. What's intriguing to me is the construction loans rolling over to perms, and you're realizing people that have 10-year are basically borrowing at 4.25 at 70%. So I'm intrigued to see how all this construction activity gets refi-ed. Will it be done quicker to try to get off of that burden of those construction loans. And what we do know is Fannie is a little bit behind in its book of business this year. So you're probably going to see a lot of people trying to stabilize and push, get off those construction loans. So it's an overall topic we're discussing, looking at it and asking ourselves where's the opportunity set moving to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with BTIG.","James Sullivan","A couple of questions about the New York market, just to follow on some of the commentary earlier about 421-a. When I take a look at the expense growth in that market on a same-store basis, really going to '16, the expense growth was at 7% at '16, 11.5% last year, just about 7% here in Q1. And tying that together with the comments that were made earlier about 421-a, should we be expecting that the -- or do you expect the same-store expense growth to kind of stay at that level until the 421-a burns off, number one? And kind of number two, you've referred to concessions generally, and I know they've been a factor in New York. To what extent is that at play here in these numbers?","Jerry Davis","This is Jerry. First, I do think you should expect to see New York expense levels remain elevated until that period. Joe was talking about when the 421s burn off. The rest of our expense load there had been well controlled. So yes, I think you're going to see that until at least 2021 till it moderates somewhat. Concessions, they're in contra revenue accounts, so they're not impacting the expense line at all.","James Sullivan","Okay. So if we look at the revenue line back in '16, you had better than 4% growth in the top line, and that delivered a little over 3% same-store. And of course, that has been weakening since that time, '17 and so far, in '18. And given your view as to the amount of supply that's coming and how much is coming in the markets that you're sensitive to, when do you expect -- or thinking about it out through the next several quarters, do you foresee that top line getting back to kind of a 4% number within that period of time? And I guess, if not, to what extent do you think about monetizing some of the value that, that would create in New York?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I'll start with the growth. We had a weak quarter. It was negative 0.4% really related to 2 or 3 things. One-- the primary one, very tough comp to last year, where our utility reimbursements, which are a revenue line item for us, were at kind of an elevated level compared to this year just because utility expenses were much higher. In addition, concessions were a bit higher this year than last year. But yes, right now, New York is very competitive with new supply. We have predominantly a B portfolio. Two of our assets are in the Financial District. One's in Murray Hill. And those properties, while we're losing people over to the new lease-ups in Long Island city or Brooklyn, I do think that first-time renters that typically would have started out with us there are seeing other opportunities in LIC and Brooklyn. So it's really putting kind of, again, a ceiling on where our rent growth could be.","So while we've had exceptional really industry-leading revenue growth in New York for the last 3 or 4 years, I think right now, because the competition from some of these inferior boroughs that have new product, they're putting more pressure on our lower price point Manhattan properties. When is it going to get back up to 4%? I don't see that happening until probably at the earliest, I don't know, 2020. I think 2019 is going to continue to be difficult, and I think job growth in New York has picked up. Wage growth is north of 3%. So I think on the demand side, you're seeing some strength. But we just have to get through these 25,000-or-so new apartment homes that are being built. Now it as far as monetizing, Tom or Harry, want to jump on that one?","Harry Alcock","Sure. This is Harry. We would consider that in the context of sort of ordinary capital allocation decision processes where we look at overall sources of uses, opportunities to redeploy capital, gain capacity, long-term fundamentals of the market or individual properties, that type of things. So we don't have any immediate plans to talk about. But New York, we consider in the context of these other opportunities.","James Sullivan","But it sounds like if the same-property NOI growth is going to trail the portfolio averages for a while, it should certainly be kind of high in the list of candidates to monetize?","Jerry Davis","Yes, maybe. I think you've got to look at long-term perspective. It's -- we're not looking at 1 or 2 years out. We're looking at the long-term fundamentals of New York, and I don't think we want to make a snap decision for what's going to be happening over the next year or two.","Harry Alcock","And if you think about it, just to sort of pile on that a little bit, as tax abatement burns off, therefore, your sort of NOI flattens out, each sort of year where that tax abatement burns off, in theory, the cap rate on the underlying asset decreases because again, the long-term NOI growth increases as you look out 10 years or whatever in the ordinary buyer would. So in theory, the value of the asset is going to be fairly priced in the market, and that would be reflected if we were to sell the asset.","Operator","Next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wesley Golladay","Just going back to the Alameda, the 4% yield is quite nice. Is that just a function of the shorter duration a little bit early in the process of the development? Or is there not just not a lot of skin in the game for the developer at the moment?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. And again, as you've seen our Developer Capital Program, we've priced these in a number of different ways, anywhere from 6.5% to with a 50% participation all the way up to this one and a couple of others at a straight 12% coupon with no participation and a couple of that are in between. But it's really just a function of a negotiation with the developer between the sort of allocation between current coupon and participation. So there's nothing unusual about this one.","Warren Troupe","There was just in terms of skin in the game, this is not a legacy land parcel that we're giving appraised value to. This was new cash coming into purchase a land parcel. So we're up to about 80% of cost on this one. So we have sufficient cushion behind us.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. I'd like to hand the call back to Chairman, CEO, and President, Mr. Toomey for closing comments.","Thomas Toomey","Well, thank all of you for your time and interest in UDR today. We started off this call with a statement that it was a strong first quarter. And clearly, from the prospects that we have for the second and the tone of this call, you can see that we're in pretty darned good shape headed into Q2. I want to reiterate that continued focus on our execution, and we have a lot of opportunities with a backdrop of an improving market. So I'm very optimistic as well as the rest of the management team that 2018 is off to a good start and looks to be a good year for us and excited to see you at NAREIT in the future.

As a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens, Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Van Ens","Welcome to UDR\u2019s third quarter 2016 financial results conference call. Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I\u2019d like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday\u2019s press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectable of everyone\u2019s time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that do not get answered.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to UDR\u2019s third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","UDR reported another strong quarter of results, highlighted by solid same-store and cash flow growth. Strong leasing velocities and rental rates at our development communities, several strategic transactions and continued improvement of our balance sheet. Jerry and Shawn will provide additional details in their prepared remarks.","As we near the end of 2016, I\u2019d like to take a couple of minutes to discuss our strategic plan and how we\u2019ve executed on it. As you know, consistently generating 6% to 10% cash flow per share growth has been the cornerstone of our plan since it was first published in 2013. In 2016, we expect to again achieve that goal with full year AFFO per share growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint of our guidance.","Next a deeper look into how the primary drivers of our cash flow growth have performed. First, operations, we expect that our full year 2016 same-store growth metrics will compare well on an absolute and relative basis. In spite of the headwinds that New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles generated this year.","We have successfully weathered this storm and continue to do so, partly because of our diversified portfolio. But much of our success stems from our operating platform. Starting with the team\u2019s ability to quickly adjust operating tactics, to maximize revenue growth and a shifting market, as well as a consistent implementation of innovative technologies. I\u2019m grateful for our team\u2019s hard work.","Next capital allocations, we delivered a $163 million of accretive development in 2016 and believe that our $937 million under construction pipeline will be no different. Our development pipeline provides our shareholders with the strong risk adjusted return on their capital and allows us to consistently refresh our portfolio via our self funding model. Fully funding our development growth in a non-dilutive manner through retained cash flow and capital recycle from asset sales is a funny mechanism that we can employ year in and year out.","Moving forward, we remained comfortable with this strategy. Last, our balance sheet continues to improve, our leverage metrics at the end of the third quarter were better than those originally envisioned for the year ended 2016. As we look into 2017 and without providing guidance, we remained confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plan.","Currently, we are in the midst of building the 2017, 2018 plan from the ground up. We see no need to change our strategies as they continue to work well as we move through this part of the business cycle. We will share the updated details of the plan with you on the fourth quarter call.","In summary, while 2016 has presented challenges, we have successfully worked through them and we\u2019ll achieve the guidance provided at the beginning of the year as part of our strategic plan. Given the outlook for sound intermediate and long-term multifamily fundamentals, we remain confident that adhering to our strategic plans core principles, will continue to help us drive strong cash flow growth for many years to come.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry for additional comments on the quarter.","Jerry Davis","Thanks Tom and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, same-store revenue and NOI growth totaled 5.9% and 6.9% respectively.","During third quarter, operating trends further normalized as compared to 2015 when the majority of markets were accelerating. Localized demand\/supply dynamics today are creating strengthen some markets and weakness in others. Making up 45% of our NOI, strength was evident in Seattle, Orange County, the Monterey Peninsula, Boston and our Sunbelt markets. On New York City, the Bay Area and Los Angeles, which comprise 28% of our NOI remain changed due to the concentrated new supply and concessions.","Overall, our highly diversified portfolio is defined by market mix, price point and location with end markets continue to perform well during the quarter and we expect will generate growth that compares favorably versus the multifamily group average over the foreseeable future.","Turning to operating tactics, as you know, driving rate growth was our primary focus over the past two to three years. This approach was successful largely as a result of the robust, multifamily fundamentals present throughout the majority of our markets and evidenced by our cumulative same-store revenue growth of 16% between 2013 and 2015.","As 2016 has progressed, diminished pricing power due to concentrated new supply caused us to reevaluate this tactic. Towards the end of the second quarter, we made a change pivoting in our operating tactics to favor higher occupancy, overrate growth and markets that were more challenged new supply.","Higher occupancy in select markets prior to the seasonally slower fourth and first quarters, when few of our leases expire is a more prudent approach to maximizing revenue and cash flow growth in the current environment. This strategic shift for fruit with third quarter occupancy averaging 96.8%, a 20 basis points sequential increases. We will operate the portfolio in the high 96% range through at least the end of this year.","With regard to the prime leasing season, 2016 results were clearly not as robust as those realized in 2015, but still compared favorably versus historical standards. But in the third quarter, portfolio wide new lease and renewal growth totaled 2.7% and 5.6%. We continue to see minimal pressure from single-family competition with move-outs to home purchase totaling 13% during the third quarter.","A lack of affordability is also not meaningfully affecting us as portfolio-wide move-outs due to rent increases remains relatively constrained at 7%. Net bad debt remains at 0.1% of rents at levels consistent with that of third quarter 2015.","Next, forward expectations, we\u2019re now providing 2017 guidance, we are projecting our revenue earning of about 2% going into 2017, versus the 2.75% earning that was baked into the beginning of 2016. Directionally, we continue to expect deceleration in 2017 same-store growth metrics as elevated new supply is further absorbed in some of our higher rent markets.","With that being said, next year is still expected to look good, when compared against our long-term 15-year revenue growth average of about 3%. We will provide detailed 2017 guidance and an update to our two year strategic plan in our fourth quarter call.","Now moving onto the quarterly performance on our largest markets, which represent 72% of our total NOI. Metro DC, which contributes 19% of our total NOI continues to incrementally improve. Job growth is gaining steam versus a couple of years ago, though new supply remains persistent in some infill locations. We expect our highly diversified DC portfolio to see continuing improvement throughout 2017.","Orange County and Los Angeles contribute 16.5% of our total NOI. Orange County has been one of our strongest markets in 2016, primarily because our portfolio was concentrated west of the 405 Freeway, and is benefited from good job growth set against limited new supply.","Conversely, Los Angeles has struggled this year due to significant new supply and excessive concessions, hitting in our highly concentrated Marina del Rey portfolio. This pressure is now subsiding and we expect pricing power in LA to improve in 2017, and for Orange County to remain stable. New York City makes up 12% of our total NOI, they continues to struggled due to the concentrated new supply in mid-town in west, as well as Brooklyn, and excessive concessions.","Given a lot of building permits issued prior to 421a is expiring we expect that driving meaningful growth in Manhattan will be problematic through at least 2018. Like New York City, San Francisco, which contributes about 12% of our total NOI, continues to be negatively affected by supply, especially south of Market Street.","Expected 2016 job growth of 2.9%, still looks good versus long-term averages, but it\u2019s decelerated from 2015, 4.5% growth rate. Our data providers indicate that supply pressures should subside in the cities, we moving to the second half of 2017, at which time, pricing power should improve.","Boston, which contributes 7% of our total NOI, has held up well largely due to our suburban B exposure. On a relative basis, our Downtown and Back Bay Communities have also outperformed due primarily to the differentiated characteristics. Boston continues to look like a good market for us going forward.","Seattle contributes 6% of total NOI, remains UDR\u2019s strongest core market on the West Coast. VMSA\u2019s [ph] relatively higher affordability, strong growth and well-paying jobs and urban renewal continue to attract educated tech-savvy residents. We expect to Seattle will continue to put up good numbers moving forward, although we are keeping our eye on near-term Bellevue supply as that submarket further transforms.","Our secondary market, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin, comprised roughly 25% of our portfolio. Pricing power remains strong in the majority of these markets and continues to help offset, the relative weakness in some of our higher rent coastal locals. Move-outs to home purchase remained constrained and our expectation to these markets have a long runway for growth due to continued favorable multifamily fundamentals.","Last, our development lease-ups continue to perform well, achieving rates above original expectations and with leasing velocities ahead of original forecast. Thus far in October, lease trends have remained firm and our development pipeline remained highly accretive than average value creation spread an excess of the top end of our targeted 150 basis point to 250 basis point range.","Community specific quarter end lease up statistics are available on attachment 9 or page 21 our supplement. Summing that up, we had another good quarter proactively pivoted our strategy to maximize revenue growth remain positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Shawn.","Shawn Johnston","Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results, a transactions update, our capital markets and balance sheet update and our fourth quarter and full-year guidance.","Our third quarter earnings results were at the mid to high-end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share were $0.46, $0.45 and $0.41, driven by solid same-store revenue, expense, and NOI growth of 5.3%, 2.5% and 6.4%, respectively.","Next transactions, we\u2019re under contracted sell seven communities in Baltimore and one community in Dallas for $285 million. We expect to close these transactions in the fourth quarter at a cash flow cap rate of approximately 6% and a weighted average IRR of 13%. We also completed a series of strategic transactions with MetLife that further simplified our joint venture.","First we completed a swap of our land interest and pre-development sites, where we acquired MetLife\u2019s 95% interest in a land site located in Dublin, California, in exchange for our 5% weighted average ownership interest in two land sites located in Bellevue, Washington and Los Angeles, California. The Dublin site is within walking distance of the Bay Area, BART line and provides the opportunity to develop a differentiated product in that sub-market.","Next UDR MetLife joint venture sold a 100% of the surge, a high-rise community located in Dallas to an unrelated third party for approximately $75 million at a cash flow cap rate in the mid fours and an IRR of 10%. Subsequent to quarter end, we also acquired MetLife\u2019s 50% ownership interest in Ashton Bellevue and Ten20. Few adjacent high-rise communities located in Bellevue, Washington were $68 million plus assumption of $38 million of debt at a cash flow cap rate in the mid fours.","We know both of these assets well, it complement our other assets in the Bellevue sub market and we like the long-term prospects as more established tech companies continue to create a presence on the Eastside of Metro Seattle.","After accounting for joint venture refinancings, these MetLife transitions were net cash positive to the company by approximately $14 million and reduce the size of the UDR\/MetLife Joint Venture by approximately 10% or $355 million.","Next, capital markets. During the third quarter, we issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured notes priced at 2.95%. A $158 million of the proceeds were used to prepay 2017 debt maturities with an average interest rate of 5.61%. The majority of the remaining proceeds were used to pay down our revolver.","With the prepayment of the 2017 debt, next year\u2019s maturity is now totaled only $71 million. Development will likely represent our large use of capital in 2017. We will continue to sell fund our accretive development the pipeline, we have retained earnings and asset sales and we\u2019ll provide a detailed update of our 2017 sources and uses on the fourth quarter call.","As a result of the unsecured offering, our weighted average maturities increased by nearly half a year to 5.3 years and improved our near-term liquidity by approximately $140 million. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was $931 million. Our financial leverage on an un-depreciated cost basis was 33.5%. Based on quarter end market cap, it was 24.4% and inclusive of joint ventures, it was 29%. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.3 times and inclusive of joint ventures it was 6.4 times. All balance sheet metrics continue to track ahead of our strategic outlook.","I would now like to direct you to attachment 15 or page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We have tightened and increased our full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80, $1.78 to $1.80 and $1.62 to $1.64 respectively by increasing the bottom end of the range by $0.01.","For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense growth of 3% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 forecasted occupancy is unchanged at 96.6%. Fourth quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.45 to $0.47 and $0.39 to $0.41 respectively.","Next, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the third quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized. This is 6% above 2015s level and represents a yield of approximately 3.3% as of quarter end.","Finally, a housekeeping item. We moved in consolidated our preferred equity investments and participating loan information and economics to a new attachment 12b. All information that was previously provided for these investments is still available on the new attachment.","With that, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. I appreciate the color on the expected 2% earn in for 2017. I\u2019m just curious what was underwritten into the two-year strategic plan that you gave in February for revenue growth next year of $475 million to $525 million?","Jerry Davis","Nick, this is Jerry. When we build up the years, we don\u2019t always factor in a year or two out what we expect to have going in. If I have to think back to what it was, it was probably something in the 2.4%, 2.5% range. Typically you\u2019re going to earn in something close to half of what you\u2019re going to expect for the next year.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then, you outline the different MetLife transactions to simplify that structure going forward. Would you think about the MetLife JV more strategically? What should our expectations be for that partnership going forward?","Tom Toomey","Nick, this is Toomey. We\u2019re always in a dialogue with Metabout opportunities, our view, I mean the portfolio performance, where we think markets are going. So, overall, I\u2019d say the good relationship, great relationship. And we\u2019ll continue in the future. We like the returns that we\u2019re getting. We like the opportunities that it presents us and Met makes a great partner.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And just finally, the same-store pool changed with the sale from the Baltimore portfolio and the redevelopment in Dallas. What\u2019s the impact from that change of same-store pool on same-store revenue for 2016?","Jerry Davis","Yes, Nick. It\u2019s Jerry. For the Baltimore pool it somewhere between 10 basis points and 15 basis points. I would tell you that when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, we anticipated there would be the Baltimore assets that we\u2019re sold \u2013 it really had no effect on our guidance range. And then the asset in Dallas that we pulled out to do a redev, that\u2019s a 17-year old deal that we started the redevelopment late in the third quarter and it should last through good portion of next year. That was probably more or like 3 basis points.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just curious if you could you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in LA, Jerry talked previously about some new lease ups imply this that we\u2019re causing some issue that you expected to subside sometime around the fourth quarter. And it look like new lease rates snapback in LA since the mid-quarter update. Can you just give a little color on the Marina del Rey portfolio?","Jerry Davis","Yes. And you\u2019re right. That is 90% of our same-store pool is in Marina del Rey and it competes with Playa Vista. During the first \u2013 call it seven to nine months of this year, we were competing against that new supply that was offering up to two months free rent. Luckily, the properties in that submarket that we were battling with have come very close to heading stabilized occupancies pushing 90%. We\u2019ve seen concession levels late in the third quarter start to come back down to one-month free.","And what\u2019s really encouraging is like you said we had new lease rate growth in the third quarter 0.1% and when I look at where we are at in Los Angeles so far in the month of October, it\u2019s over 3%. So we are starting to emerge of our problem area in Los Angeles.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then looking into supply and sort of your submarkets next year, what\u2019s the expectation, any other potential supply headwinds that you see?","Jerry Davis","You know probably the place you see new supply we don\u2019t have any same-store assets we have the MetLife asset in Downtown, Los Angeles. You\u2019re going to see a continuation of new supply being delivered as well as leased-up. So I think that\u2019s going to be difficult. I think you\u2019re going to see a continuation of some supply pressures in SoMa, at least through the first quarter, maybe second quarter of 2017. Downtown, Seattle continues to battle new supply, we do not have any same-store assets there, but we do have two different JV properties there.","And the other one that I have been keeping my eye on, but we really haven\u2019t seen a in downturn in fundamentals has been Bellevue, Washington. We\u2019re very high on Bellevue, even though, there\u2019s probably five or six properties delivering there. Bellevue, as you know, we just purchased the other 50% of two assets from MetLife there. And you\u2019ve got jobs that are coming in there. Amazon is creating a mini campus if you will over on the eastside of Lake Washington, where they just sign the lease for a 350,000 square foot office space that \u2013 our rumor has it Apple was looking at the same building and it\u2019s continuing to look in Bellevue.","So, Bellevue, I think, is going to have job growth that should absorb the new supply, but we are watching the new supply there. And other than that, obviously, when you get up to New York City, where we\u2019ve been battling not direct competition in a submarket, but throughout Manhattan, we\u2019re going to continue to face supply headwinds throughout our Manhattan portfolio all through next year probably well into 2018.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for the detail. I know that the southeast and southwest are a little smaller piece of the portfolio, but seem to have held up fairly well here, even into the third quarter. What sort of your outlook on the supply side for those markets?","Jerry Davis","Yes. We see \u2013 again, we used predominantly Axiometrics for this. But we see Tampa delivering supplies in 2016 of about 4,500 units, next year, it\u2019s going to be about 4,000; Orlando, it\u2019s going to be about 5,500 to 6,000 each of the two years. Nashville, where most of the new supplies hit the Downtown, urban core is going to slow from 9,000 units to 6,000 units next year. And then Orange County is probably going to see a tick up as some deliveries have slipped from 2016 into 2017, it\u2019s going to go from about 4,000 units to about 6,500 units.","A lot of those are concentrated in blue line, one deal that we\u2019ll start leasing up in \u2013 or occupying to the next month or so, is going to compete against that new supply. But a good portion of our product in Orange County is more B product and it\u2019s west to the 405, and it\u2019s held up pretty well, especially our Costa Mesa and Huntington Beach assets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, good afternoon. I was just hoping, you could speak a little bit about to difference in performance of your A and B and maybe if you could talk specifically about\u2026","Jerry Davis","Juan, you still there?","Juan Sanabria","Yes.","Jerry Davis","You cut out on us, second half of that question.","Juan Sanabria","Sorry, if you could just talk a little bit about the performance between the A and the B assets in your portfolio maybe this is occurred in New York and San Francisco?","Jerry Davis","Sure. I guess, on a national basis, I would say that, B\u2019s continue to outperform, A\u2019s probably by about 100 \u2013 2,550 basis points. But it does definitely vary market by market, in New York. Most of our portfolio is B, especially in the same-store. But our B\u2019s today, when you look at same-store as well as our MetLife property, our B\u2019s are coming in at about 3.4% for the quarter, and our A\u2019s are at about 4.3%. Our Chelsea property is also included in that 4.3%. So fairly type, you\u2019re seeing confessions and pricing issues affect both A\u2019s and B\u2019s as people in B\u2019s at times now can step up to A\u2019s.","Juan Sanabria","San Francisco?","Jerry Davis","San Francisco, and again, ours is San Francisco and San Jose combined interestingly for the quarter, they were fairly even. And again it\u2019s the same type of situation where B renters when you \u2013 I have an eight properties down the street that\u2019s offering 1.5 months to two months free. Its price probably on an effective basis just above what you\u2019re paying into B. So you can pay a little bit more into the step up and quality.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Juan Sanabria","And then if you can just speak a little bit to supply expectations across some of the Sun Belt market. Do you see kind of more supply heading to those, kind of suburban Sun Belt markets versus kind of the urban coastal markets? Or how do you see that trend playing out as we look forward sort of to 12 months to 18 months?","Jerry Davis","Yes. As we \u2013 again actually or recently revise there a supply data from what we were seeing in two to three months ago and now 2016, 2017 in total are roughly even as about 360,000 to 370,000 multifamily homes. And when you look at individual markets, there is not a whole lot of differentiation I gave the numbers on the prior question. But basically the Florida markets are roughly flat between 2016 and 2017.","Nashville is going to come down about 3,000 homes. And then like I said earlier, you\u2019re going to see a bit of a tick up in Orange County, you\u2019re going to see Boston stay roughly flat, Dallas should stay roughly flat, Austin is going to see a reduction of about 4,000 homes from 2016. So you\u2019re going to hopefully give a little bit of easing in that job growth continues to be strong in Austin, you should see a pick up.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you very much.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead.","Drew Babin","Thanks for taking my question. First question is on West Coast JV assets, it\u2019s really closer to time window where you would have the option of purchasing those, I was curious as to pay the probability that you would do so and be aware NOI yields maybe on the option pricing relative to 6.5% preferred return requirement you have?","Harry Alcock","Drew, this is Harry Alcock. First, three of the assets are in lease up and they have all leased up very well. The first asset in Seattle was stabilized. The next two in Anaheim and second Seattle asset again leased up very well. Rates that are at or above our original expectation I think when we talked about this, we thought that the all in sort of return on costs in these assets would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 5%.","We don\u2019t have anything that changes our view on that and again as we look at the option windows that began opening up next year. We\u2019ll make the determination as to which assets we want to buy and which assets we want to sell. But again the first one would be the two Seattle assets and the Anaheim asset. First half of the year will make that determination.","Drew Babin","And as you go forward into next year in 2018, in terms of acquisitions that makes sense for UDR, it\u2019s kind of the main research priority going to be these JV assets versus going out and kind of looking at what\u2019s become a pretty frothy market in terms of the asset pricing?","Harry Alcock","Yes. Well, I think as you think about how we\u2019re going to deploy capital next year. Development is going to continue to be sort of our preferred means to deploy capital. Second between the West Coast JV assets and against Steele Creek, we have option window that opens next year, we\u2019ll make a determination as to which of those assets we want to buy and which we want to sell. And I think you\u2019re right in that regard.","Drew Babin","That\u2019s helpful. And then one more question on Boston. Well it\u2019s sold on strong year-to-date that was bit of deceleration in 3Q on some of the pricing given kind of the exposure, the suburban exposure there and most of the supplies being urban, is there anything going on there or is that just kind of a little pick up and what should be a pretty stable market going forward?","Jerry Davis","I think \u2013 it\u2019s Jerry, it\u2019s predominantly a hick up. We did \u2013 we saw a bit of a back up in occupancy throughout that portfolio and there are four assets in our same-store pool, two are up in the B assets in the north end, those continued to do well. Our Downtown Back Bay property probably had revenue growth in the 2.5% range. So it definitely is started to feel more of the competition from urban supply.","And then we also have one of our same-store assets is down in the south and in range \u2013 it\u2019s been competing against new supply, it\u2019s being popping up in Quincy. So the north end continue and hold up well Downtown felt some supply pressures as did the south end, but I think they\u2019ll continue to do pretty well.","Drew Babin","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. One of your competitors today recently increased expense guidance you\u2019ve been able to maintain expense further to moderate level. But I was wondering if there are any components to expenses that you\u2019re feeling outward pressure?","Harry Alcock","Yes. Real estate taxes for sure have been given us pressure for the \u2013 really the last year. So, you\u2019ve got the Sun Belt assets had typically been seen real estate taxes go up high single-digit. That\u2019s really a function of the NOI growth, which taken the valuations up. Similarly, Seattle has felt that kind of pressure, and then because of our 421 abatement burn-offs we\u2019re going to feel it there to. We\u2019re always watching personnel cost and there is a lot of demand for the quality people that we hire especially in high new supply areas.","Fortunately for the quarter-end, year-to-date, we\u2019ve kept that growth at 1.1%, and we did it really because we\u2019ve realized quite a few efficiencies over the last year or two at our sites staffs that have allowed us this year to reduce staffing levels by 1.5% or so. And that\u2019s through things like our inside sales group who assist in renewals and leasing.","And secondly, we\u2019ve deployed about a 70-package lockers out into the field that take the burden of packaged handling of our site people, so that they can spend more time on sales and service. And we\u2019ve able to turn that in some headcount savings. But, I\u2019d say the biggest expense pressure continues to be real estate taxes, as the valuations for real estate continue to go up.","John Kim","Okay. And at the same time, you\u2019ve kept turnover relatively stable versus last year despite new supply really picking up. Can you just elaborate on what you\u2019ve done strategically to address with the market where you\u2019d be seeing lot of the supply pressure?","Jerry Davis","Yes. Well, we probably two things, one is earlier this year based on the success we\u2019d had again with its inside sales team that helped us on new leases. We created a department of a few people that really assist our people on renewal. So they call everybody that has made a decision to renew or give notice yet, it\u2019s our renewal offer has been out there for a while. And try to answer any questions to prompt them to renew more quickly. We ask them as a secondary source to go out to people, but have given notice to try to convince them to stay and sometimes this may result in slight negotiation on renewal rates.","I think those are the biggest things, I think, we\u2019ve obviously seen the renewal increase is come from last year they were north of 7%. Right now they are in the mid-5%. So there is not quite as much pressure. But, I think we\u2019ve got a focus on service, and a focus on sales and I think doing things like again putting these package lockers. And we don\u2019t look at it just the savings to our site times, we see this in the amenity that people can self serve 24\/7, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to provide our residence with more, what they\u2019re looking for.","John Kim","I may have missed this, but \u2013 what were the new renewal leases trending so far this month?","Harry Alcock","The month October new is at 1.1%, and renewals so far in October at 5.3%.","John Kim","Okay, great. Thank you.","Harry Alcock","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes. Good morning out there. Jerry, just following along that, that John\u2019s questions. It sounds like, you guys have been pretty proactive on the portfolio this year, as well as budgeting guidance that you\u2019re able to maintain while peers have revised down. So, as you look at your guidance for next year, back in June when we met you guys expressed confidence that you would still be on track for your 2017, but earlier in this call, you guys said that you\u2019ll address 2017 later. So just looking at your multi-year plan where do you guys are now it would see you\u2019re still on track to hit 2017, is that fair. Or there are some things that are coming up that you think could cause you guys to deviate from that?","Jerry Davis","Yes, Alex, as I indicated in my prepared remarks so that provided 2017 guidance. We do expect same-store growth to continue to decelerate in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. And we\u2019re currently projecting as I said earlier, earn in of about 2% compared to 2.75% that was based in the beginning of 2016. As a result, we see it unlikely that we would be able to achieve the lower end of the 4.75% to 5% in quarter 2017 same-store revenue growth range that we originally provided in our 2016, 2017 two-year plan that was published earlier this year.","With that time, the operating environment and some of our higher rent coastal markets was much more accommodating, when we originally provided the range and that next year\u2019s top line growth, is still expected to compare favorably against our long-term revenue growth of about 3%. That being said, we\u2019re going to give more detailed 2017 guidance and our update to the two-year strategic plan on our fourth quarter call.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But it is very stake because back in June, you guys expressed confidence to still meet. It is that your range this year was wide enough to accommodate or did the market further decelerate post June-May REIT that\u2019s caused your revise, think that you won\u2019t even that the bottom end would be lower?","Jerry Davis","I think there has continued to be slowing especially in New York and San Francisco throughout the summer months. That made it more clear to us that \u2013 again that 4.75% is probably not the card.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, this is a question, maybe \u2013 but Toomey or Warren wants to take it. But on the MetLife JV, the simplification it\u2019s going on. Is any of that related to MetLife\u2019s overall business model where they are breaking down parts of their businesses and you expect more of the MetLife JV to unwind or were these totally independent of what Met is doing corporately and therefore we should still see you guys maintaining the relationship with Met?","Tom Toomey","Alex, this is Toomey. With respect to Met and you\u2019ve seen it every year that we\u2019ve been in this relationship for the last six, we\u2019ve always had some degree of some trade going on during \u2013 throughout the life of this joint venture and I would probably see us continuing that same pattern in the future. We see no impact from what\u2019s going on at Met at corporate to the real estate appetite, views of the world or their capital availability or deployment of capital.","So, I think we\u2019ll discontinued to have these dialogue that we doing with a great partner at future opportunities that help us advance UDR and help them advance their capital deployment. So, I don\u2019t see any change to that. I think it was just one of those years where we decided to sell an asset, buy two shrink land inventory and like the side of the trade that we ended up on.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And did this take care of your 5% stakes that you had with Met? Did this take care of them all or there\u2019s still more of those?","Tom Toomey","Yes.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay.","Tom Toomey","Okay, basically down to land inventory with them is through the end.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Thanks, good morning. So, Jerry, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re kind of dangerously close to going negative in any market either in next year or the year after no looking for guidance, but clear residential did suggest that New York is probably going to go negative for them next year. Do you \u2013 just to get it on the record if we can, do you feel like anything is going that self in the next couple of years, or do you still think it will above the Mendoza line or whatever?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I don\u2019t see that at this point. There is differences in our portfolio mix, especially in New York with some of our peers, again remember put it more of a B operator there, we don\u2019t have anything in places like Brooklyn, we don\u2019t have any specific \u2013 any properties that are directly in Midtown West. So while we are affected and it will tamper our ability to really pushed rate, I don\u2019t see us going negative anywhere.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then Tom, you mentioned the 6% to 10% cash flow per share growth kind of strategy, obviously that\u2019s not really a trend number or at trend or kind of average number over the course of many, many years. What do you think \u2013 why you\u2019re not going to give the outlook for 2017. But what do you think the \u2013 sort of the average number would be 6% to 10% is a premium growth rate. Do you think the number for bottom line AFFO growth is significantly below that or what\u2019s your view using your history as a guide?","Tom Toomey","Well, it\u2019s a long history, Rich, and timeless this question. For the last three years make it 4%. We had three years at 10%, we had this year looks like an 8% and as we\u2019re looking now towards the future. I think in a stable supply demand demographic that we\u2019re in a phase, its probably in the 6% to 8% kind of range, lot of it would take to get below that fix, I think is a recession and the depth and in the nature of that. I\u2019m not calling for one, but I think that has been the my historical pattern is when the country goes into recession, its where is our exposure to it, how deepened of our portfolio do we have in those particular areas or industry exposure. Hard to forecast that element of it, but what we\u2019ve trying to do is build the company that can stay in that 6% to 10% through most cycles and I think we\u2019ve done that.","And I think we\u2019re going to continue to in the future and when you look at the next strategic plan, you\u2019re going to see a lot of the same strategies that we\u2019ve been executing on in last four years. Very focused on capital deployment, operations and continued balance sheet improvement.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And I hope Chris I think a man because he is way bigger. I want one more question. The self funding strategy hinges a lot of on dispositions, decelerating fundamental. Do you see any risk that people buying public of multifamily real estate might make it more difficult for that self funding strategy to stay intact over the next couple of years?","A \u2013 Harry Alcock","Rich, this is Harry. I think the short answer is no. What I can tell you is that there are continues to be plenty of liquidity in the market that there are still keep that available, there\u2019s plenty of buyers, although buyer pools are somewhat shallower. But you could see is that buyers continue to underwrite lower growth rates that cap rates could increase a bit.","Remember you still have solid fundamentals in most of the markets, so that even if cap rates increase a little bit and NOI should continue to increase. So there\u2019s no obvious impact to absolute value. But, there\u2019s the big point as that is a liquid market, if you look at 2016, transaction volume, it\u2019s still going to be very robust, it\u2019ll be slightly lower than 2015 kind of record levels. But should be similar to 2013 and 2014 and there\u2019s no evidence that, that\u2019s going to abate anytime soon.","Rich Anderson","Great. Thanks.","Jerry Davis","Rich, I\u2019d follow on little bit. Even in the debts of 2009 and 2010, transactions were getting done. We may not like the price, but there is still liquidity and Fannie and Freddie were still doing business. So, I think, there\u2019s going to be always a supply of capital. I think we\u2019ve got a diversified portfolio that we can always look at and say there is a liquidity opportunity there. And so I don\u2019t see much risk from us at the sales level that we\u2019re anticipating being able to execute.","Rich Anderson","Okay, fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","Hi, guys. You mentioned the risk of concentrated supply and you also highlighted Bellevue has having a bit of a supply increase. Do you think that job growth is sufficient to absorb the supply and with the developers be more rational? We saw in LA where demand was pretty solid yet the pressure on the existing properties existed somewhat in \u2013 how you see those two markets being different?","Tom Toomey","Yes. I guess, there\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t see a rational concession levels in Bellevue at this point that they\u2019ve actually been offering a month free on leases, if not something less. Our portfolio in Bellevue has been able to maintain to date as the supply has been delivering north of 6% revenue growth and you getting very good renewals as well as new lease rate growth. Yes, I think the job growth when you look at Amazon coming in next year, you look at Apple that\u2019s looking to come, you consider that Bellevue has pretty close to Redmond, so it doesn\u2019t just have to job growth in Bellevue, it\u2019s the part of the those places on the east side that benefit.","I think Bellevue is a bit different. And I do think job growth will continue and that core of Bellevue will eventually run out of developable space. The other thing to keep in mind and this is a little more long-term but in about five years or six years, the light rail is going to reach across like Washington and really connect both Bellevue as well as Redmond to the west side of town and I think it will enhance the east side even more.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then going back to LA, obviously you have too large development out there, weighing on your results and normally pressuring you guys this year. Do you see any other large developments that might cause a hick up in another market next year?","Jerry Davis","There is a couple of developers that come in with very aggressive pricing, they can affect us and the places that we\u2019ve seen has happen this year has been the platinum triangle of Orange County. I could see it potentially happening in [indiscernible] and we\u2019ve also felt to that, I can\u2019t say but I don\u2019t foresee it at this point anywhere else.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And next is Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Good morning guys. Just I\u2019m curious on your take on this is handful of jurisdictions in Northern California looking at rent control, selection season and I think a few more than a half dozen year properties following to those areas and maybe just a portion of that is would be subject of laws of they\u2019re contemplated. What\u2019s your take on that legislation maybe the odds of its passage and I guess how do you think that effects valuation of it came delay?","Jerry Davis","I\u2019ll talk about our assets there here you can talk valuations afterwards but, yes when you look at it there is five cities in Northern California that are bringing forth somewhat control issues to the balance. There is two markets where we\u2019re located that are bring it is, San Mateo on Mountain View. We really only have three properties that cost to about 2.5% of UDR\u2019s NOI that are going to be affected by it.","It\u2019s only for pre-1995 build assets but would still be the right control with the range from 1% to 5% on increases. I\u2019d say another California property association is been finding that pretty strongly and thinks the probability of passages probably limited that we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but right now I can tell you over the next or so.","I don\u2019t think those are up to 5% on increases would make much of difference. It\u2019s not the way it was two or three years or a year to three years ago \u2013 very high rent increases but again it\u2019s relatively low exposure 2.5% of UDR and Harry, talk more about what you think would be the valuations?","Harry Alcock","Sure. where we sort of really dealt with this type of issue within New York City where you have brand stabilization. Say I guess I answered the couple of different ways. One the short-term that will have probably a slight negative impact on value where the absolute rent growth in the near-term will be slightly lower because you do have these fixed cap on increases. However the way you look at it over the long-term is really a timing issue that typically you have vacancy control, so over time you captured those sort of embedded shortfalls as you\u2019re tendency turns over","In the long-term if you get say, five-years into a rent control program, these assets actually traded lower cap rates, because of the embedded upside that exist on the rent roll so that you have a certain number of units that are well below sort of market rent, you\u2019ve assuming that over time, just really on an actuarial basis you\u2019re going to get 5% or 10% or 15% of those assets \u2013 or those units that turn over and are able to capture that upside.","Jeffrey Donnelly","And if you so \u2013 I guess some \u2013 before this legislation came to light, did you ever proceed with the discernible difference between how lenders and investors underwrote 395 product in California or is really no difference?","Harry Alcock","No. I don\u2019t think there has been a difference. I don\u2019t think there is a difference today. But again I think what I just described is sort of how that will manifest itself with any of this legislation is passed.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I Appreciate it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Pawlowski","Thank you. Tom. Can you provide color on how the board\u2019s CFO search process is going and an estimate on when we can expect an announcement?","Tom Toomey","Sure, John. We\u2019ll probably have this wrapped up and be able to make an announcement around nearly.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thanks. Jerry, you have about nine assets hitting same-store pool next year, and your preliminary 2017 revenue growth guidance, what kind of benefit was new same-store pool addition contemplated in the revenue growth guidance?","Jerry Davis","Hey, we\u2019re still doing the 2017 budgets and honestly I didn\u2019t come right out and I have factored in even on preliminary basis what the boost is. Five and the six assets I will tell you it will be part of home portfolio from last year. So whatever you\u2019re expecting Washington D.C. to be. I\u2019d say those should be fairly comparable for us. You also have one other new development in Washington D.C. del Rey Tower that rolls in when you have our Seaport property in Boston that will be rolling in. And then you have one redevelopment that was in San Francisco. So, you factor in that a six of the seven or the six of the eight or so in Washington D.C., one is in San Francisco, and one is in kind of the per size core of Boston, and I would necessarily expect them to have a significant positive impact to our same-stores.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rich Hill","Hey, guys. Thanks for all the transparency thus far, just to trying to first about your development pipeline and many more strategic question thinking word. What sort of markets if you have to sort of project right now or do you think are strongest and maybe which are the weakest. And so, how are you thinking about your development pipeline and how might that be pivoting in the future?","Harry Alcock","So Rich, this is Harry. As we talked about before we\u2019ve really developed in seven or eight different markets. So Southern California, Northern California, Seattle and the in the major East Coast markets plus Dallas and potentially Denver as we did in the Steele Creek. So those \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue to focus our development activity in those markets, if you can imagine some of that question is really opportunity base that we\u2019re going to look at the opportunities in those markets it has the best location and using the sort of revenue growth that one would expect in those markets we will underwrite that type of growth and where we find opportunities that that sort of meet our return thresholds those, those are locate, those are projects that that we\u2019ll actually move forward and deliver. We\u2019re going to continue to maintain at least that our business plan is to maintain our $900 million to $1.4 billion type development pipeline. So you don\u2019t see increase above that level. And again, we\u2019ll continue to use a disciplined underwriting approach.","Rich Hill","Got it. So, new market that you\u2019re developing in right now that, that you may see it less opportunity in the future than you do right now, it\u2019ll \u2013 go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Harry Alcock","I think certain markets, at certain times we are going to have less opportunity and I think you could use San Francisco is an example that anywhere, where you do have some pressure on the rental rate growth, you still have land prices that are very high. And so you probably has a kind of a set of circumstances in the City of San Francisco where it\u2019s probably hard, but in near-term for any projects to make sense, but again, these markets change over time and the fundamentals of those markets will change and will continue to underwrite those opportunities accordingly.","Rich Hill","Great. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Well. Thanks. Just sort of question on your \u2013 this is for the Attachment 5, give your return on invested capital metric and as help me understand what you guys are trying to show there if I look historically, kind of goes up year-over-year. And then if I go back to like prior supplemental, the absolute numbers really not that much different from, where you guys are reporting a return on invested capital today. So what exactly you guys showing measure there?","Harry Alcock","Nick, we\u2019re looking at 5 and it\u2019s an operating margin page.","Nick Yulico","I\u2019m sorry, I mean the Attachment 5.","Harry Alcock","Well, thank you, sir.","Nick Yulico","Yes.","Harry Alcock","Anybody got an idea on the question? Looks pretty constant. Nick, we\u2019re all scratching our head and trying to figure out where you gone with the question.","Nick Yulico","Well, like if I look here already, it was up 7.6% versus 7.3% a year-ago, that\u2019s like a 4% difference here at your same-store NOI was up over 6%. And if you go back historically, you\u2019re kind of in somewhere in this ballpark 7% to 7.5% on this metric in your supplemental going back several years. So, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what kind of exactly this metric is trying to show since it doesn\u2019t seem like your return on invested capital for the same-store is really gone up that much over the last several years?","Harry Alcock","The new capital put in, it will be probably just operations in new capital.","Jerry Davis","But 7.6% or it\u2019s a 7.3% call it a 4%, 4.5% growth rate which is relatively consistent with the NOI growth rate.","Nick Yulico","Approximately $12 billion of assets.","Jerry Davis","Yes.","Harry Alcock","Shareholder value $400 million, $500 million.","Nick Yulico","Yes I think we can follow-up on offline. Thanks.","Operator","And it does appear we have no further questions. I\u2019ll return the program to President, John Toomey. Please go ahead.","Tom Toomey","Well, just to be clear it\u2019s still Tom Toomey, I\u2019m still President and CEO. Let me just close with thank you for your time today, and second we\u2019re very focused on finishing up the strong year and certainly look forward to 2017 and 2018 and rolling out that strategic plan again in February of next year as we wrap it up. And we will see many of you at Mary, and we look forward to that exchange and time together in a couple week. So, with that take care and have a good day.","Operator","And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation.

On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call. My comments will be brief today.","First, we had a good quarter in all aspects of our business and feel great about the balance of 2013. Jerry and Tom will cover the details.","Second, we remain focused on executing our 3-year strategic plan. With the first year nearing completion, we are on track or ahead of plan on all fronts. Our 3-year plan is focused on growing cash flow, NAV and dividends while continuing to improve the balance sheet and portfolio quality. As we look toward the future, we see an economic environment and supply demand fundamentals in our markets that confirm our view that our 3-year plan remains the best course. Our team remains highly focused on successful execution of this plan.","Looking at the drivers of our plan, as you're aware, the vast majority of our cash flow comes from the operating platform. Over the past 6-plus years, we've produced same-store revenue growth in our markets that placed in the top third of the peer group 60% of the time. This success has been achieved through Jerry and his team's unwavering drive to consistently improve our operating processes through the advancements of our technology platform, and of course, the hard work of our community teams.","We have a development -- redevelopment pipeline of $1.2 billion. Of our $1 billion in development that remains under construction, 30% will be delivered by year end. Overall, we are meeting or exceeding our expectations, and I'm grateful to Harry and his team for their foresight to get these communities underway in 2010 and '11. We continue to see favorable development opportunities in our core markets.","On the balance sheet front, we are executing on plan and expect that our balance sheet metrics will continue to improve through cash flow growth from our development and redevelopment pipeline. Our portfolio quality continues to improve, revenue per home has increased dramatically over the years and we have a good mix of markets in A and B quality communities. We will give you full 2014 guidance and a full update on the 3-year plan on our February 2014 conference call.","Finally, I would like to thank all of my fellow associates for their hard work in producing another great quarter.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: first, our third quarter results; second, Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries; third, a balance sheet update; fourth, an update on our development pipeline; and last, our fourth quarter and full year 2013 guidance. I'll begin with our third quarter results.","FFO per share was $0.37 inclusive of $0.025 of final settlement of Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries that resulted from damages and business interruptions incurred in 2012 and 2013, none of which was contemplated in our previous guidance. Our FFO as adjusted per share was $0.36 inclusive of $0.01 of Hurricane Sandy business interruption recoveries incurred in 2013, which offset lost commercial rents at the affected properties. The $0.36 of FFO as adjusted exceeded our Q3 guidance at the midpoint by $0.02 as a result of the $0.01 of Sandy recovery and an additional $0.01 of miscellaneous timing items. Third quarter FFO per share was $0.31 which also exceeded our Q3 guidance at the midpoint by $0.02.","Next, in September we reached final settlement of our Hurricane Sandy claims. In total, we recovered $27.5 million of $30.4 million in damages and business interruption losses. We are pleased with this outcome.","Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on a historical cost basis, was 39%. On a fair value basis, it was 30%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.0x, which is also approximately where we expect to end the year. These metrics are consistent with the 3-year plan expectation set forth at the beginning of 2013. Moving forward, we will continue to gradually delever the balance sheet through non-dilutive means while targeting BBB-plus credit metrics.","As previously announced, in September we issued $300 million of 3.7% 7-year unsecured debt. The notes replaced debt that matured earlier in 2013 and the proceeds were used primarily to pay off our revolver. From a liquidity prospective, our balance sheet is in good shape with $1 billion of available funds at the end of third quarter consisting of cash and credit facility capacity.","Turning to our development projects. We expect to deliver approximately $290 million in developments or 30% of our active pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2013. As Tom mentioned in his earlier remarks, our in-progress pipeline should be solidly accretive to earnings and NAV when comparing current and trended yield expectations against market cap rates and our cost of funds. We continue to estimate these developments will on average deliver a current trended spread of 150 to 200 basis points. As of the end of the third quarter, there were $320 million left to spend to complete our current $1.1 billion pipeline.","As detailed on Attachment 11 or Page 23 of our supplement, we are actively in process of reloading our development pipeline with a number of projects. We expect to announce a new start or 2 later in the fourth quarter or early first quarter of 2014. Additional starts can be expected as 2014 unfolds. For us, development continues to represent a very positive risk-adjusted use of capital.","On to 2013 guidance. We are raising our full year FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance estimates to $1.43 to $1.45, $1.38 to $1.40 and $1.22 to $1.24, respectively, to reflect the Sandy-related insurance recoveries previously discussed.","Our same-store guidance is also increasing with full year revenue now expected to grow 4.75% to 5%; expenses, 2.75% to 3%; and NOI, 5.75% to 6%. Additional guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.","For the fourth quarter of 2013, we are providing FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance of $0.34 to $0.36, $0.33 to $0.35 and $0.29 to $0.31, respectively.","During the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.235 per share or $0.94 when annualized, our 164th consecutive quarterly common dividend paid. Lastly, we'll provide 2014 guidance and a full update of our 3-years strategic plan during our fourth quarter call in February.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry A. Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: first, the recorded operating results; next, fundamentals in our largest core markets, as well as recent A versus B performance in our portfolio; and finally, a brief update on our development lease-ups or redevelopment projects.","We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the third quarter, same-store net operating income grew 6%, driven by a 4.9% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.6% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 4.7% year-over-year to $1,490 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.1% was 20 basis points higher year-over-year. On a total portfolio basis, including our pro rata share of joint ventures, revenue per occupied home was $1,640 per month. Sequentially, third quarter same-store net operating income declined by 10 basis points due to normal seasonality.","Turning to new and renewal lease rates. In the third quarter, effective rental rates on new leases at our same-store communities increased by 3.7%, while renewal rate was strong at 5.5%. San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and New York remained vibrant, while Mid-Atlantic regions struggled. As a reminder, new and renewal lease rate and turnover by market for the third quarter are available in our supplement on Attachment 8G.","Annualized turnover in the third quarter increased by 160 basis points year-over-year, although still 50 basis points lower on a year-to-date basis. The third quarter increase was a result of our initiative over the past year to move more of our 2013 lease expirations into the third quarter, which exhibits better demand characteristics than the first or fourth quarters. Rent as a percentage of our tenant income held steady at roughly 17%. Move outs for home purchase were same as the third quarter 2012 at 12.7%.","Expense growth was 2.6% higher for both the quarter and year-to-date as real estate tax pressures were offset by reductions in repairs and maintenance expense and marketing costs. Making our service teams more efficient, which enables them to do more work in-house, has been a top priority. We're seeing positive results from that.","Next, some remarks on our primary core market order of [ph] contribution to NOI. New supply in Washington, D.C. can [ph] more directly affect us during the middle of the third quarter, however, we still see blended rental rate growth remain positive in the fourth quarter. San Francisco remains strong despite some difficult seasonal slowing. We are seeing good demand in the city proper and our Mission Bay development is sdzfpre-leasing very well. Orange County employment growth is improving and results are getting better in this market after a weaker first half 2013. Downtown Seattle has supply coming in. The job growth seems to be absorbing. Bellevue may still be the best [indiscernible] market we have right now.","As mentioned last quarter, New York has fully recovered from Hurricane Sandy, which is evident in the strength we saw in rental rate growth and occupancy during the third quarter. Finally, Boston has been one of our better markets in 2013, but it is entering its seasonally slower period. Still, we expect this market to remain well above average as we go to 2014. Dallas is generating significant jobs right now but also a lot of new supply. We're not seeing a major difference between our North Dallas, Addison or Uptown products with regards to demand, and it comes -- continues to be a good market for us.","Moving on to performance of our core A and B communities. In the third quarter, As -- Bs, excuse me, outperformed the As in our core market for the first time as we began tracking the data couple of years ago. However, the disparity was not as large at 4.9% full-ended lease rate growth for Bs versus 4.6% for As. I will remind everyone, although we have moved our portfolio towards the heavier mix of As over the past decade, our core market A\/B mix is still roughly 50-50. This inflection point in lease rate -- lease growth is likely due to our lower quality properties not competing directly with new supply to our higher quality communities with easier growth comps Bs have versus As. At the market level, this dynamic was evident in Washington, D.C., Boston, Dallas, Orange County and San Francisco during the quarter.","Turning to our development and redevelopment program, which are highlighted in Attachment 9 and 10 of our earnings supplement. During the quarter, we completed the development of 520 homes on $70 million in incremental spend. Lease-ups at Bella Terra in Huntington Beach, Channel Mission Bay in San Francisco and 13th and Market in San Diego are tracking well ahead of initial underwriting expectations at this point.","Gross lease-ups in Mission Viejo and Domain College Park across the Street and University of Maryland's business school are achieving lease rates and closing ratios in line with our underwriting expectations. Fiori at Vitruvian Park JV is achieving the rental rates we expected, but leasing units at a slower pace than anticipated. Finally, Capitol View. Our only completed project at this juncture reached stabilized occupancy during the summer roughly 9 months after welcoming our first resident. All in, we are quite pleased without the lease-ups are progressing.","Moving on to redevelopment. During the quarter, we completed the redevelopment of 209 homes on $22 million in incremental spend. Both Rivergate and 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde are generating renovated home rent [ph] in line with our initial expectations. As a reminder, additional details regarding quarter end lease and occupancy percentages for both development and redevelopment can be found on Attachments 9 and 10 of our earnings supplement.","With that, I will open up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derek Bower of ISI Group.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jerry, just wanted to follow up on the A versus B performance. Can you talk about what that spread was in the D.C. market specifically?","Jerry A. Davis","I don't have it in the D.C. market. I've really broken down D.C. more between submarkets. And what I can tell you is our weakest submarket in D.C. right now is the product we have in suburban Maryland. We are doing a little bit better when you look at the BB-minus products. We only have one of those within the city where we have revenue growth north of 5. But most of the product inside the Beltway is fairly close to the 3.3% revenue growth we had. When you go outside the Beltway, it's about the same except when you get into the supply-impacted areas such as Woodbridge for us. And I did see your call note this morning where you were asking about the effect of rent-stabilized homes in D.C. and I did want to address that. We really only have one asset in Washington, D.C. that's rent-stabilized. It's called Waterside towers, and it represents about 13% of the total revenue in Washington, D.C. It produced 5.4% revenue growth, and if you take that out of our D.C. portfolio, we still would have revenue growth of 2.9%.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just going to the reduction for the development redevelopment spend for the year, can you just speak to is that reduction caused for a reduction in attractiveness in rates or are you being less aggressive with supply [ph] and capital, as I assume you're still not going to issue equity below NAV at this point?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, Derek, this is Tom Herzog. It has nothing to do with performance or access to capital. It's all due to timing. As I think you know, we've got 1 or 2 starts that we're expecting in the fourth quarter of 2013 and more in 2014, so this is all just timing.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","GoT it. Great. And then just last one. There was a pretty large pop in the Sacramento same-store performance and I -- it sounds like you guys may be actively marketing that according to a couple of publications. So can you just kind of talk about the performance of those assets and timing of dispositions and how that might affect that capping -- cap rate pricing?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, this is Jerry. I'll talk about the performance, and then I'll turn over to Harry to talk about the transaction activity. Yes, I would remind you first, Sacramento represents 1% of our total NOI, so it's small. We've always been looking to exit that market for the last several years when the timing was right. I can tell you I think fundamentals in that markets have improved a little. There's no new supply. They've added about 11,000 jobs there. I would also add that our team at the 2 properties we have there is the best we've had in years, and that what you're really seeing in that growth is a recovery over how we performed in the last year or 2. But yes, when you do look at it, it is a significant revenue growth and it's really been pushed not only by some occupancy gains but also above-average new lease rate growth. So the team's doing well. The market has improved and I think it's an awful [ph] time to be exiting the market because of the condition we have those properties in, but I'll let Harry talk about the other part.","Harry G. Alcock","Jerry answered most of it. We are in the market with the 2 Sacramento assets. As Jerry mentioned, it is a market that we have always intended to exit. Candidly from a timing standpoint, selling the property when the fundamentals are positive tends to yield a more positive result.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Going back to D.C., how did new and renewal rates trend over the quarter and where are rentals going [ph] out today?","Jerry A. Davis","Hold up one second. Renewals trended throughout the quarter: July was 5.2%; August was 4.6%; September was 4.3%; and October is 4.1%. And what we're seeing now in D.C. for the next 2 to 3 months is probably in the 4% range. I don't have except numbers in D.C. with me. I can tell you when you look at the trending for the total company same stores, we trended 5.8% renewal growth in July and then it was 5.4% in August, 5.4% in September. October's looking like a 5.3% and what we sent out at -- company-wide average for the next 2 to 3 months in that 5.25% range. And we typically do achieve very close to what we send out.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the development pipeline, what construction cost pressures are you seeing today? Could continued pressure affect potential decisions with starting new developments going forward?","Harry G. Alcock","Hi, this is Harry. First, there's no question costs are rising. The amount really depends on the market and construction type. I think generally, costs are up as little as 5% over the last 12-to-18 months to as much as 10% to 15%. We do expect costs to continue to rise over the next year, perhaps another 10% to 15% -- 5% to 10%. Looking forward, rent increases are generally offsetting these cost increases, although again, that's product and market dependent and we do consider the impact of the increased costs in our underwriting. As we look at our land portfolio, we're confident that we have a number of projects that we will pencil in the future. We won't start a new project unless we have a 100 to 150 basis point spread and leased [ph] to current market cap rates, until we have a complete set of drawings, until we have a max price contract with a third-party general contractor.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan from Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe following up on the construction or the development pipeline. It looks like scheduled completion was pushed out a quarter for the San Francisco and the Alexandria projects. I was just curious the reasoning behind that.","Harry G. Alcock","Hi Jana. This is Harry Alcock. Mission Bay, the initial deliveries are going to be this quarter as scheduled, but given the high number of deliveries that we had, unit deliveries in November and December from a construction standpoint, we simply pushed some of these units into January and February.There are no construction delays. In terms of del Rey, the construction is delayed about 6 weeks from our original estimate. We originally thought the end of Q1. Current schedule shows the middle of Q2. We're confident that we'll meet this revised forecast.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, Jerry, if you can let us know maybe move-out to the homeownership in the third quarter?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. It was 12.7%, which is basically flat with 3Q of last year. It's down slightly from 2Q of this year. One thing we did see is move-outs to home purchase were a little bit heavier in the A product than the B product, which you would expect. They're more qualified. Our As were at about 14%. Our Bs were at about 11%. And the 2 markets that we have where we had move-outs to home purchases that were north of 20% of the reasons for move-out were Charlotte and Boston, where we have a very high percentage of the portfolio is A.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jerry, a question for you. Appreciate your earlier comments on turnover, but I wanted to dig into the Sunbelt a bit. We saw a healthy bit of turnover this past quarter in the Sunbelt. Can you give us a bit of the story behind the numbers and talk about Sunbelt in relation to New York, the West Coast, where the turnover was relatively unchanged? Is the turnover being driven by perhaps waning pricing power, perhaps a supply concern? Appreciate some context.","Jerry A. Davis","Sure, Haendel. Yes, I don't think it's pricing power. What I would tell you is about a year, 1.5 years ago, we finally came to the realization after seeing it for multiple years that pricing power on new leases has a definite seasonality in the apartment sector nowadays where more leases in the third quarter and second quarter tend to be 300 basis points higher than they were in the first quarter. And what we did last year is we worked to move more of our lease expirations from the fourth quarter into the those higher lease rate quarters in the second and third. So we effectively moved about 200 to 300 lease expirations into third quarter from fourth quarter, and assuming about half of those people renewed, half moved out, that accounted for about 150 more move-outs in the second -- in the third quarter than we had last year. Now, most of those, as you saw, did occur in the Sunbelt markets. What I would tell you is when I look at my month of October turnover, I have 120 fewer move-outs in my same-store portfolio in October of this year than I had in October of last year. So our strategy being able to reprice those, the 150 units, at more of a 4.5% rent increase rate instead of the 1.4% or so that I'm experiencing [ph] in October, worked.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And just to follow-up to that, can you share with us the October and November renewals? And then perhaps break it out by just giving the Sunbelt numbers specifically?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. October renewals, currently they're running at about 5.3%. In the Sunbelt markets in -- they're more, in the Florida and Texas markets, in the 4%, 4.5% range. What gets me up to my 5.3% renewal rate growth in October, what lifts it is more of my California influence as well as Boston and New York.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. One last question on taxes. We saw you lowered the high end of your expense range. Just curious about your experience on the real estate tax assessment [ph] during the quarter. Is the lowering of the high end of expenses largely reflective of perhaps more successes there?","Jerry A. Davis","We've got a little bit of success that we were able to show in the third quarter and we're hopeful as we go into 4Q that we'll have more success. But yes, a lot of that is tax rate driven.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Nick Euleko [ph] with UBS.","Unknown Analyst","I'm wondering on the development side, what at this point is holding back starting the projects in LA, San Francisco, and then even looking at the MetLife partials which are all in California or Bellevue?","Harry G. Alcock","Hi, Nick. This is Harry. In each of those cases, we're working through as we speak the -- in some cases the entitlement process. In some cases we have entitled assets and are working through the design development process to get through to a permit-ready or shovel-ready project. So it's really just the timing of completing those events that dictates the start dates. Certain of the projects we're going to be in a position to begin construction the first part of 2014. Other projects are further out in later '14 or even into 2015. And that relates to both the UDR wholly-owned projects, as well as certain of the land parcels that we own in partnership with MetLife.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, so it sounds like some of them are going to start next year, some might wait later into 2015. I guess what I'm just wondering is, I mean, how should we think about that? Because I mean, California's already fundamentally doing very well. I mean, is this is really going to be another slow [ph] year sort of cycle for California? And was the risk for kind of leasing starting development in California at the time where the fundamentals are strong?","Thomas W. Toomey","Nick, this is Tom Toomey. You make a couple of good points and let me try to provide some clarity. Within the confines of the 3-year strategic plan that we put forth, we identified and said we would spend on an annual basis $400 million to $500 million and that we would only commence development when we have a GC contract in-hand, when the investment as a spread over existing cap rates was 100 to 150 basis points and that we had a funding source that made sense on a accretive basis, both NAV- and earnings-wise. So that's the driver behind us making the decision to go forward with the development activity. We will stay within those parameters, $400 million to $500 million on an annual spend. With the respect to markets, looking at the current pipeline of deliveries, you have about 45% that will be delivered probably next year, 18 months in California, another 10% in Boston, so I feel good about the market mix of our delivery and the timing of the strengthening of those markets. I think we'll do well on the lease-ups to those with Jerry's team, and I feel good about that. Backloading it, Harry is right. We're going through the process on all the other opportunities we have. And as we get them there and if they meet the return requirements, then we'll push them into the pipeline and announce them as they get there. But we feel good about the quality of it, about the returns, about our execution capability and the size and scope of it given the size of the enterprise.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Schaffer with Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer","Your positive revenue growth in D.C. was pretty impressive given your peers have been reporting negative growth. I was wondering if you'd highlight anything specifically that you did in order to achieve these results?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, this is Jerry. I think, like some of my peers have already discussed, we went out and tried to attack renewals -- really 90 days before expiration to get a better indication of what people were going to do so we could address notice to vacates more proactively. I think the other factor that I brought up many times is I think our team in D.C. is second to none. And I think the locations that we operate in, while they are somewhat affected by the new supply, the exception of the U Street Corridor and out in Woodbridge, we're not really feeling the direct impact the way that some of the other multifamily REITs are.","Andrew Schaffer","Okay. And secondly, for your Pier 4 element in Boston, I was wondering what the expected average unit size is and the rents are for this project?","Harry G. Alcock","This is Harry. If you remember, we are not going to deliver first units on that until the first part of 2015. The average unit sizes in that one are a little over 800 square feet. And we expect the rents per foot to be slightly above $4 per foot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So does the 5 -- or excuse me, 3-year plan with a fair amount of development involved in that plan suggest a slower FFO growth model for that -- over that period of time relative to your peers?","Thomas M. Herzog","Rich, we've got a -- this is Tom Herzog. In the 3-year plan we have indicated somewhere in the vicinity of $400 million to $450 million in 2014 and 2015, just the numbers that we have put out. We're not straying too far off those numbers. We have a little bit of a gap in the timing as the result of the starts at the end of 2013 and into '14. But I don't see us having a marked difference in the numbers that we're running as we look forward in '14, '15 for this particular item. So we haven't given our 3-year strategy for '14, '15 and '16 yet, which we will in the next call, but I don't see this being a major factor at this point.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, so if you're out there with a 3-year plan and sounds like you're going to roll that forward, do you -- can you remind us of the -- your image of the fundamental landscape at the end of 2015. And assuming that you had an image and kind of worked backwards to develop the strategic plan, what do you think the market for multifamily real estate will look like from a economy standpoint, a supply, a rent growth standpoint? Like what's the vision you have?","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, we set forth the various expectations in the 3-year strategy document with the various economic factors. And at this point given our timing, we're not ready to provide an update to that. We will in the February call, but we're not going to roll that forward at this point.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I apologize for not having that committed to memory, but I mean is it -- just to put it, yes or no. I mean, do you see the fundamental picture for multifamily extending much further than what maybe the common perception is in the market today? I mean, is this a second or third inning that we're in right now, or is it -- maybe just give me a little color on that end.","Thomas M. Herzog","I'm going to give you my take and then I'm going to turn it to Tom Toomey. I would tell you this, as we look to where we are at in 2013 and how we're performing, what our numbers look like, ops, development, balance sheet, et cetera, we are tracking on or ahead of plan, and as we look into 2014, we think we have a lot of momentum. So we feel good about where it's going again we're not going to give specific numbers but, Tom, let me turn it to you, see if you might have some things to add.","Thomas W. Toomey","Yes, Rich, certainly I don't think anybody's got a good crystal ball, but our clarity probably would be much of the same fundamentals that we see today. In that you see a steady job growth diet of 150-kind-of-thousand jobs a month, what I think is more importantly, is what's the waiting of our markets to that national number, and I think our portfolio will perform well versus the national numbers primarily because of our exposure to tax, energy, certainly import\/export markets and I like our exposure to biotech. So I think that we've picked the right markets for the right jobs over the next 2 or 3 years. And I think that will be reflective. I think we picked the right A, B mix in those markets to garner better than average in performance. With respect to what's beyond that supply, my guess is we're right in the transition period in the banking industry with respect to lending and that's going to have a great influence on the amount of supply. I don't see the swelling of capital or bank lending pattern that's going to indicate that we're going to get in above 350,000 deliveries on an annual basis. So I suspect we won't see the threat of supply that we've typically seen in the past in these economic periods. And then what's the wildcard? Obviously, on the finance side, you've got the GSE reform question that looms. The fact they can't even agree on how to run the government probably means they won't change a whole lot on that front. And so I see stability but not a robust capital environment that leads to a great deal of inflation for asset values. It's probably just going to garner out cash flow growth. So on that, I guess, Rich, look at our assumptions. You ask the question about how our FFO growth is going to compare to peers. I don't know what the rest of the peers are forecasting. What I do know is we're targeting annual AFFO growth in the 8 to 10. That's what we put forth in the '13 plan that we put over the next 3 years. And we'll update it in February if we see it materially change. But we feel good about the business.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And just -- I think part of what is holding down the sector has been this perception that it's good but decelerating growth on a year-over-year basis. I mean, is that the thesis, too, when you look to 2015, that it's good but it's decelerating from 1 year to next? Or do you think you could stay in the mid-single digit type number over the course of 3 or 4 years?","Thomas W. Toomey","My -- to continue to expound upon that, it's going to turn into markets and the right combination of markets and exposures. And then I think that that will be what your job is, is to sort through what those individual market dynamics are and how they are painted out. My view is the fundamentals of the business point to -- and I thought that the guys at Avalon had it right. There's a potential shortage of housing in America from a number of fronts, from the single-family, from the multifamily front, and that we're going to run at a very high occupancy and pricing power is going to be dependent upon job growth and wage inflation. And so I feel good about those 2 dynamics playing out to better than what the expectations are from the Street. We'll see how that dynamic plays out. I think we've got a great operating platform to take advantage of it, if it's there. But I'm more optimistic, have always been glass half-full type person, and just see a more positive robust opportunity than maybe what most of people are publishing these days. And I'd add to it, Rich, costs go up for replacing these assets. The value of your in-place inventory has to continue to grow if it just costs more to replace it. And so I think the combination of cash flow and cost increases probably is going to lead to a little bit more NAV growth than people are forecasting at this present time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","First question's on the development yields. If I understood correctly, are -- the 150 basis point spread that you target, is that on trended development yields versus today's cap rates?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, Dave, this is Tom Herzog. We think about it this way -- we think in 2 ways. It's 100 to 150 un-trended and 150 to 200 basis points trended on average across our development pipeline. So there will be some at the high end, some at the low end and some down the middle. But that's how we've expressed those.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so when we see you start deals later this year or early next year, you'll be looking for 100 to 150 basis points spread over prevailing cap rates?","Thomas M. Herzog","That's correct. On an un-trended basis, it's 100 to 150 basis points.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Second question is on Attachment 1. Looking at 2 expense line items that we think are outside of your same-store expense pool, property management and other operating expenses, we noticed outsized growth for these items on a year-to-date basis relative to the same-store expense pool. Can you talk about the drivers of these 2 lines?","Thomas M. Herzog","I'm sorry, property management and what was the other one?","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Other operating expenses.","Thomas M. Herzog","The property management, we're going to have -- the Vitruvian is one of the items within that. But I tell you what, these items are not included in Attachment 5 when you get down to those same-store results, or any of those operating results. Those lines are excluded when you're trying to get to your margins on Attachment 5, if that's part of what you're looking at.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Tom, do you mean Attachment 6?","Thomas M. Herzog","No I think it's Attachment 5.","Harry G. Alcock","It's 6.","Thomas M. Herzog","Is it 6?","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","But Tom, are we correct that those 2 lines are not included in Attachment 6, same-store expenses?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, that's correct.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then what's driving the 6% growth for property management expense and the 22% growth for other operating expenses on a year-to-date basis?","Thomas M. Herzog","You know something, Dave, I'd actually have to -- I have to take a look at that. I can't answer that right off the cuff. But if you give me a call after the call, I'd be able to take you through that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Tom, just going back to the starts, should we expect those to be on balance sheet or are you looking more towards venture capital given where the stock's trading right now, in terms of new developments?","Thomas M. Herzog","Harry, maybe you want to take that?","Harry G. Alcock","Mike, it's Harry. I mean it really just depends on the property itself. Some of these properties are owned in joint ventures with MetLife and therefore they will naturally be JV properties. Some are wholly-owned and therefore we will develop them ourselves.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Would you expect to sell any of them into joint ventures?","Thomas W. Toomey","This is Toomey. That's always weighs in our decision about moving forward is the capital source and the size and scope of the development pipeline. If we found [ph] opportunity but felt that it stretched our capital capabilities beyond where we want to go, we'd certainly look at joint venture partner to offset some of that. We're going to stay in the confines, Mike, of the $400 million to $500 million of our spend on an annual basis, stack the best opportunities we can inside of that number and weigh capital as one of the those alternatives.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Jerry, a question for you. Can you give us where the loss-to-lease stands at the end of the third quarter? And also if we look at in-place rents today versus current market in D.C., how does that compare?","Jerry A. Davis","I don't have D.C. on me. My guess is in D.C, there's probably no loss-to-lease at this point, the in-place is comparable. Again, I don't have that with me. I'll get it for you later on the follow-up call. For the company, the loss-to-lease at the end of the third quarter was 1.5%.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then finally just as you're looking at the 3-year capital plan right now, I'd be curious, as you look out -- and potentially slowing growth, to go back to Rich's question, does that give an impetus to maybe accelerate some of the recycling you'd planned out over the 3-year plan? Maybe you'd pull a little bit that forward in terms of capital raising and funding in the next cycle -- in the next go around of development?","Thomas M. Herzog","Probably not, Mike. When we look at -- as you noted from our 3-year strategy, we had acquisitions and dispositions generally matched up. We would be putting [ph] in certain assets and acquiring assets that could be more core for us. So that has not caused us to necessarily accelerate the plans around liquidation of those assets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as you've been on the market looking to sell a few assets there, are you seeing price escalation or retrading on any of those?","Harry G. Alcock","Mike, this is Harry. I think if you look at the A.S. [ph], that's the may-to-main [ph] type assets, there continues to be significant investor demand, and these buyers tend to be less leverage sensitive. We haven't seen any retrading there. As you move to the Bs, you have seen some cap rate expansion. I mean there was clearly some retrading activity going on last summer when we initially went through this sort of volatile interest rate environment. Today, I'm not sure we've seen enough trades to form a definitive conclusion but interest rate movements have calmed down. Interest rates have actually floated down, which is going to help with values and predictability. But suffice to say there has been a little bit of cap rate movement on the B properties.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jerry, just a question for you. How are rent-to-income ratio's trending? And is there any notable difference between As and Bs?","Jerry A. Davis","I don't think there are. I looked at it last quarter and there wasn't a notable difference. I can tell you right now, rent-to-income is staying very consistent with what I've reported over the last probably 5 to 6 quarters in that 16% to 17% range. Right now it's at a 17.1%. Last quarter it was 17%. A year ago it was 16.9%, so it stays pretty stable.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A portion of the call. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Thomas W. Toomey","Well again, I thought we had a great quarter as a team, as a company, our associates on the ground doing a great job. We certainly are happy with the 3-year plan and the first year almost in the bag and where we stand with it. Look forward to giving you more details about 2014 as we wrap up the business plan part.

Our quarterly press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","Statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements.

On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","We again reported strong results during the second quarter and feel good about our business for the balance of 2018. Therefore, we raised full year 2018 same-store revenue and NOI growth guidance expectations, as well as FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges. The drivers of these increases will be discussed by Jerry and Joe in detail in there prepared remarks. But in summary, through the first half of the year, blended lease rate have trended above original guidance. Our lease-up communities have produced results ahead of initial expectations and our investment in accretive developer capital program is producing the return we underwritten.","With the prime leasing season now more than half over, we are confident in our ability to continue to produce steady results throughout the remainder of 2018. Looking into 2019, we are optimistic in our prospects given the increased probability for better year-over-year revenue earnings and the anticipated improvement in bottom-line contribution from development activities. From a capital allocation standpoint, we remain flexible and will continue to invest in uses that provide the best risk-adjusted return within the confines of our annual sources and uses plan.","Last, a special thanks to all our UDR associates for their continued hard work to produce another solid quarter results. We look forward to the same for the remainder of 2018. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. Second quarter year-over-year revenue and NOI growth for our same-store pool, which represents approximately 85% of total NOI, were up 3.4% and 3.5%, respectively. During the quarter, we posted solid blended lease rate growth of 3.8%, a robust top-line contribution from our long-lived operating and technology initiatives and continued to rein and controllable expense growth. First, year-over-year blended lease rate growth for the quarter was 20 basis point higher than during the same period last year. While this positive spread did not widen versus what was realized during the first quarter, market rents exhibited typical seasonality during June and July by continuing to accelerate, something we did not see during 2017 when market rents from our same store portfolio peaked in late May. Second, our other income grew by 11% in the quarter. As in past quarters, this was driven by revenue-generating initiatives, specifically parking, which increased by 22%, and our shorter-term leasing program, which continues to outpace initial expectations. This focus on monetizing our real estate in innovative ways is a recurring differentiator and a meaningful driver of incremental growth. ","Third, year-over-year turnover continues to decline. Year to-date, annualized turnover is down 160 basis points, and acceleration from the first quarter is 120 basis point decline. This is especially impressive given that our short-term leasing initiative should result in higher turnover.","Four, while we feel pressure from real estate tax increases for at least the next couple of years, our focus on driving efficiencies throughout our expense back continues to yield strong results. During the quarter, controllable expense growth declined 0.2% year-over-year as we have been able to find efficiencies insight-level staffing, benefit from reduced resident turnover, invest in energy-saving capital expenditures and drive down marketing cost while still growing occupancy 30 basis points year over year. We see a long runway for future expense growth mitigation via technological initiatives and process enhancements.","And fifth rent concessions during the quarter were 29% lower than last year and gift card expense was down 54%. Throughout the first half of 2018, the pricing environment for lease-ups remains more rational than during 2016 or 2017. These encouraging signs for the prospects of our business, when combined with our 97% occupancy, set us up well for the remainder of 2018 and gave us the confidence to raise the bottom end of our full year same store guidance ranges. A year-to-date revenue and NOI growth through six months was 3.2% and 3.1% respectively, just below our upwardly revised midpoint of 3.25%. For 2019, we are optimistic that if current leasing trends hold, our year-end operating earn in will compare favorably to that of 2018. ","Next, a quick overview of our markets. Similar to the first quarter, majority of our markets are performing in line with expectations with a few exceptions. The Florida markets, San Francisco and Boston have outperformed versus original forecast, while Austin and New York continue to struggle as a result of new supply pressures. Regarding New York, we continue to forecast slightly positive top-line growth for the market in 2018, despite a negative year-to-date result.","Moving on, we saw minimal pressure from move-outs to home purchase or rent increase at 12% and 7% of reasons for move-out during the second quarter. Likewise, net bad debt, which is write-offs offset by collections, was 0 for the quarter. All are at levels consistent with previous quarters. ","Last, our development pipeline in aggregate continues to generate lease rates and leasing velocities, in line with two slightly ahead of original expectations. At 345 Harrison, our 585-home $367 million project in Boston, we ended the quarter 59% leased and are 64% leased today, after only been open for 11 weeks. This when combined with rental rates that are in line with original underwriting expectations is a phenomenal result. We remain enthused by 345\u2019s progress in its anticipated contribution to 2019.","At our $350 million 516-home Pacific City development in Huntington Beach, velocity averaged 34 leases per month during the quarter. We ended the quarter at 68% leased and sit at 70% today. ","Our two JV developments totaling $94 million and pro rata spend remain on budget and on schedule. Our suburban midrise community located in Addison, Texas, at Vitruvian West continues to be a homerun, performing well in excess of underwriting expectations in terms of rents and especially leasing velocity. Our vision on Wilshire community located in Los Angeles is a higher price point community and is performing in line with forecast. Quarter-end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 of our supplement. ","Finally, I would like to again thank all of our associates in the field and at corporate for another strong quarter. With that I'll turn it over to Joe. ","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include: our second quarter results and guidance, a development and investments update and a balance sheet update. Our second quarter earnings results came in at the high end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.49 and $0.45, respectively. Second quarter AFFO was up $0.02 or 5% year-over-year, driven by strong same-store performance, lease-up performance and accretive investments into our developer capital program. I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 of our supplement, which details our latest guidance assumptions. We have increased full year 2018 FFO per share to a $93 to a $96 and AFFO per share to a $78 to $81. Primary drivers of the increases included: upside from our store portfolio and improved contribution from our lease-up properties and additional accretion from expanded DCP deployment. ","Full year 2018 same-store revenue expense and NOI growth guidance ranges were each increased by 25 basis points at the midpoint to 3% to 3.5%. Year to-date, blended lease rate growth outperformance probably upside to top-line guidance, or non-controllable expense pressures increased our expense growth guidance. For the third quarter our guidance ranges are $0.48 to $0.50 for FFO and $0.43 to $0.45 for AFFO.","Next, development and investments. We continue to work towards stabilizing our development pipeline from $400 million to $600 million. But we have indicated in past quarters, sourcing economical land remains difficult given the disparity between construction cost increases and rent growth in most markets. As a result of our unwillingness to lower required return thresholds, we reduced our development and land acquisition spend guidance on Attachment 15, while increasing our DCP spend, where we see more opportunities. Big picture, we will continue to pivot on our capital allocation strategy to take advantage of the best risk-adjusted returns as long as those opportunities continue to meet our hurdles within the context of our annual sources and uses plan.","Regarding redevelopment contribution to our earnings. In 2018, $716 million of wholly owned projects are in lease-up at an FFO yield that will average in the mid-2s. In 2019 and 2020, we anticipate this yield will improve toward stabilization.","Next capital markets and balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, net of the commercial paper balance, was $771 million. Our financial leverage was 33.4% on an underappreciated book value, 25.2% on enterprise value and 30%, inclusive of joint ventures. Our consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA RE was 5.7 times, and inclusive of joint ventures, it was 6.3 times. We remain comfortable with our credit metrics and don\u2019t plan to actively lever up or down.","With regard to the profile of our balance sheet, we will continue to look for NPV positive opportunities to improve our 4.8-year duration and increase the size of our unencumbered NOI pool. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.3225 in the second quarter or $1.29 per share when annualized; representing a yield of approximately 3.4% as of quarter end.","With that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Juan Sanabria","Just hoping you us your latest thoughts on supply. There have clearly been some slippages in years past, but if you can give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of '19 versus '18 deliveries and any major movements across markets that you could highlight would be fantastic?","Joseph Fisher","Juan, this is Joe. So I would say overall our expectations really haven't changed in this point from the last couple of quarters. We have factoring in an expectation of slippage throughout the year. So when we are talking, we talking about 2019 being flat to down 10%. That's already incorporated that number. So through a combination of working on third-party data, looking at our internal regression models, then of course talking to our people in the field and get a better sense for where is that, stepping flat to down 10% works. When you think about the markets that are going to increase and decrease potentially, the increases for us look like probably Bay area and DC, whereas the decreases are going to be our two Florida markets, our two Texas markets as well as New York City and Orange County. ","Juan Sanabria","Great. And then just on the revenues that you guys talked about \u201819 and improving based on the earn at the end of the year at the start of '19. Could you just give us a sense of kind of from an earning perspective where you are today and kind of what guidance applies to end of year out versus where you ended last year out?","Jerry Davis","Juan, this is Jerry, I don't have that number for the earn in as of today, but one thing I wouldn't want to put down and why we said that to be expecting our net to probably be higher as you get to the end of '18 and '17. So when you look at market rent growth, I had this in my prepared remarks, but the market rent peaked last year's well as 2016 in the month of May. We saw acceleration from May to June and then we\u2019re just now closing our July books. We're seeing continuing acceleration. So we're getting back to this seasonality that was more typical throughout the early 2010 to 2015 level, when market rents just continually went up through July or August then started to slide back down in the back three or four months of the year, last year being an aberration. So when you look at the earning to next year, a lot of that is built throughout prime leasing seasons which we're roughly halfway through right now. So that's why we feel better as we lead into next year, our expectation given what we're sending out for renewals and what we seen for available rents going forward is that you're going to see a continuation of what that normal seasonality rather than the 2016-\u201817 scenarios were.","Juan Sanabria","Great. Do mind sharing the July stats for the new rent renewals?","Jerry Davis","July is in the mid-2s for new, and it's in the high fours force renewals.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks. On development key factor what you're seeing then you\u2019re desired effect of the pipeline. One in the event you don't have any new starts, how do you reallocate or adjust resources from an organizational standpoint?","Joseph Fisher","Hey, Nick. It's Joe. I'll kick it off and then pass it over to Harry. I think if you take a look in the supplemental on Attachment 15, you'll see once again just like last quarter, we did take down our development funding expectations slightly and reallocated that over to the developer capital program. So I think that gives you a little bit of sense for how we're thinking about the opportunity set on both those as well as the risk-adjusted returns. So we do continue to have a decent amount of capacity on DCP. We continue to see opportunities there and we'll continue to focus on that area and think we'll probably have a couple of things hit here in the next six, 12, 18 months. ","On the development side you saw in my prepared remarks, we think by later in 2019 will probably stabilize out of that 400 to 600 range, and as a reminder we're going from 800 million today which is 96% or so funded down to zero relatively quickly. Do backfilling with a number of deals and I'll let Harry kind of take it over in terms of what those deals are and kind of opportunities there moving forward.","Jerry Davis","Yes, Nick, I mean you know you hear it from everyone else, the market's difficult right now, market prices are increasing faster than rent, so it -- which tends to stress development yield somewhat. Within our existing lands that we have a property in Dublin that we expect to start, we\u2019ve got next place. We\u2019ve got a property in Denver that we talked about that's tied up and a couple of others that we\u2019re working on that gives us comforter confidence that will be back up into that $400 million to $600 million range throughout \u201919. I will tell you that we continue to believe the change that our underwriting program. We underwrite each asset until merit using revenue cost, direct growth assumptions that we believe are appropriate, while maintaining our target 150 to 200 basis point spread. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks. But to shift more maybe to DCP. Is there still soft target of about $300 million for that? Or could you see that moving up as well?","Thomas Toomey","I think it\u2019s really going to depend on the opportunities that moving forward. So we have a 180 million today, we have additional funding of 30 million with the pre-existing pipeline. So at least a 100 million to get to that soft target, but as we have talked about, there's a number of other factors that go into it. So as those deals come in and we think about our sources and uses, the alternative uses that we have out there are opportunities, you could see a drift higher, you could see it not get to that 309 million level, but we will take a deal by deal and then talk about with you guys as they come in.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, maybe quickly on occupancy. It looks like 2Q same-store occupancy at 97% maybe an all-time high. First half was almost 97%, you maintained the guidance for the year, which implies slightly lowered in the back half of the year. Is there something specific that you're doing or expecting that would result in that lower occupancy is just an assumption that these high levels can't be maintained?","Thomas Toomey","I think the high levels -again, you\u2019ve out this period for last several months, I would point out a couple of things. Occupancy gets prompt by our short-term furnished rental program, which adds probably 20 to 25 basis points to that occupancy level and those types of rentals have a bit of seasonality. So I would expect as that you continue with the drift a bit. The other thing is that when we\u2019re looking at our revenue for the year, we\u2019re cognizant as Joe said earlier that I think that the back half of 2018 is going to have more deliveries in first half. We\u2019re just a little cautious as we look at the back half of the year how directly or getting be impact by those deliveries. Right now, occupancy to-date still at 96.9 or so. So it\u2019s hold enough very well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Austin Wurschmidt","You\u2019ve talked our abound some of the challenges you\u2019ve faced in New York City due to supply? We've seen some peers of yours opportunistically reduce their exposure evaluate reducing our exposure to Manhattan because I\u2019m just curious if that's something that you guys would consider. ","Joseph Fisher","Austin, it\u2019s Joe. We would definitely consider reducing it. However, when you look at where we think the market is going over time we\u2019ve actually seen New York job relative to our initial expectations supplies to the upside this year. And then if you look at supply, I think everyone's well aware that supply expectations in 2019 should start to come down fairly dramatically. So while the market is still relatively weaker within our markets today, and could still be next year, we think we do have a little bit of an acceleration story over the next 2 to 3 years there. But it is a market that if we didn't like the prospects longer term, we would absolutely take a look at reducing thatbut maintaining cape market, with exposure relative to peers today make sense.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then separately, in the context of prior conversations around entrance into new markets, we talked a little bit about Philadelphia as maybe an opportunity. So just curious if you could provide an update on that front and some details as to your thoughts on how you would enter a new market and maybe whatkind of exposure you would take longer term?","Thomas Toomey","Yes, overarching kind of portfolio strategy is, of course, the view that we are going to maintain specification across plus or minus 20 markets, et cetera. So you mentioned Philadelphia there, which we have been taking a look at, and I do want to remind everyone that\u2019s not necessarily a new market. We have a pre-existing asset there within the jointventure and so become active in the margins. We have boots on the ground. We are looking at potential develop our capital program transaction within that market. It\u2019s a market that from a job perspective, whether you look at medical or educational, screens positively there. If you look at technology opportunities, it is starting to gain more of its fair share of tech jobs. Obviously, job growth and kind of rent growth over the longtermrelatively stable and volatility relative to some of the other coastal markets. So we like it on that aspect. And then within our predictive analytics models, it does actually screen okay. So there's a number of factors that are positive there. But again, we are thinking about kind of DCP context as we look to potentially expand a little bit in that market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Hill","I want to circle back to the development pipeline. I noticed that you mentioned that all you development pipeline was in lease up. How are you thinking about your development pipeline going forward? And look, if development was to shut off today entirely, in your view that you can continue to grow this trajectory that we have seen over the past couple of quarters?","Thomas Toomey","As I go back to the prepared remarks and then a couple of comments that we had a few minutes ago, we really don't expect it to go all the way to zero or may temporarily go there for a quarter or two. As Harry mentioned between the double parcel we have, the Denver parcel we have under contract, the Vitruvian parcels that we have within the joint venture as well as visibility on a couple of other items we are working on. We do expect that to ramp back up to that kind of $400 million, $500 million range, $500 million Admittedly that is approximately half of where we've been running most of the cycle. So again, the discipline that we\u2019re exercise around the required returns has allowed that development pipeline to shrink, but we do want to continue to have a development pipeline, maintain that team and keeps creating value that piece of the platform.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery. Scott, please proceed with your question.","Rob Stevenson","Jerry sitting here and essentially August 1st, what markets have outperformed and underperformed your expectations form the beginning of the year by the widest margins thus far? And what sort of magnitude that we are talking about?","Thomas Toomey","I\u2019d say anything significantly off from original expectations. Probably the three markets that have surprised to the upside would be the two Florida markets, Orlando and Tampa both done very well forced and a couple of our best markets. But I would say they\u2019re maybe 50 basis points ahead of the plan. The next one is San Francisco, where I think the first couple of quarters did slightly better but what we're seeing as we head into the back half of the year we're encouraged by the level of new and renewal rate growth we're getting today that should continue, but we are cognizant again that new supply is going to come in to the Bay Area little heavier in the second half. So I would say those three are the positive outliers. Really there's two negatives, one is Austin where supply outside of the CBD has been hitting us at three of our mature B asset quality properties and then probably the biggest disappointment in New York City. New York year-to-date is at negative 0.4%. Going into the year we thought it was going to be called at positive 0.5 to positive 1%. And a couple of things have really affected us there. One is the outsized new supply in Brooklyn and Long Island City, I think seven more going to affect on our B assets in the financial district than we originally projected.","Second, we've lost a corporate tenant in the financial district during the quarter that had been with us for about 5 years. And when we recovered occupancy very quickly on that one, but we did take a rent drop because those people in their 5 years taking good renewals. So the reset of rents was about 6% and that affected us. And then the third one, it was built into our plan but just to let you know part of the reason our growth is subpar is we did a central system building upgrade at one of our properties in the second, in early 2017. And that drove down both utilities expense and also utility reimbursement. And we show utility reimbursement as a revenue component. The benefit to NOI was positive but this change in the system resulted in a reduction of our second-quarter revenue growth in New York by 40 basis points. So if you excluded that, we would have been just very slightly negative.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then I think it was Joe's comments earlier on supply in a number of markets you guys expecting to see accelerate in the back half of the year. How much operating traction are you seeing today in the DC market? And how much of a slippage are you expecting as we head into the back half in early part of '19 from that supply.","Unidentified Company Representative","No. We didn't see the supply, I think, as long as we're watching concession levels. But DC is holding up very well. And actually, I don't have the exact number, but I think blended rate growth in the month of July was good. I think occupancy still stands in the mid 97s in DC. And we're optimistic. A lot of the new supply that's coming is over in the Ballpark area and NoMa and while we don't have any specific assets there it is affecting most of our properties within the district our weakest submarket in DC right now is right along 14th Street. But as you know, about half of our portfolio is B quality and our properties outside the beltway are performing extremely well. So right now we would not expect a significant drop off in DC. We're running strong right now. But last year as you went from like June through October, when supply started to hit, you saw two months free rent enter the marketplace that suppressed our ability to push rents. So we have our eye out for that, but it really hasn't occurred yet this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","Hey, Jerry, you just talked about some of the disappointing markets. But I\u2019m wondering if you would include the MetLife joint ventures as part of that conversation, the disparity between the performances of your joint ventures in the consolidated assets continue to lighten. And I\u2019m just wondering what was driving that.","Jerry Davis","I think it\u2019s a couple of things. One I think a lot of you have on MetLife assets. They are top of the market A+s really in predominantly urban locations that are combating new supply. So I think that's the main component. But when I really look at the MetLife assets which are significantly lower than our same stores, 36 properties that are current and were in during the quarter had negative revenue growth that are finding new supply. And these six properties make up about 40% of the revenue within the portfolio. And those properties are in the upper west side of New York. The East Village in San Diego, we got, probably, the premier property in downtown Seattle. That\u2019s finding new supply. We got a property in downtown Denver this included in this group. And then we also have one of the Baltimore market. So I think when you\u2019re in those pockets of heavy new supply where concession levels are high, you\u2019re going to see this, I think, longer-term the MetLife properties are going to do exceptionally well, but that\u2019s the main thing we're seeing right now.","John Kim","Can I ask question about other income? You have parking grown at 22%. And I\u2019m wondering if you could provide some color on how much runway is left in other words, how much -- how many properties are you charging for parking with the opportunity going forward? And in relation to the joint venture do you have the same other income leverage on your joint venture that view on a consolidated portfolio?","Unidentified Company Representative ","That\u2019s a good question. Sometimes we do and sometimes we don\u2019t in parking. We\u2019ve always been very good at charging for parking in urban areas where we have garages and parking is at minimum. So while a lot of the MetLife deals are in those urban areas there is less opportunity to drive outsized rate or parking fee growth at the MetLife deals. I would say for the rest of the portfolio we've turned parking on throughout the entire UDR platform. Two years ago, we started charging just to existing or to new incoming residents. Over the last year or so we started assessing that on new residents. This year we\u2019re looking -- and next year we're looking more at reserved type parking spaces where people can select whether they want to park as well as finding opportunities in some locations to allow nonresidents to park in our communities that\u2019s been a good driver up in Seattle, for example. But I think, we\u2019re going to continue to see outsized growth again this year it was about 20%, last year it was about 20%. I\u2019m reluctant to say you can keep go into that pace, but I just say it's going to continue to grow well in excess at multiple rents on our apartments grow. So I do think other income whether it's from parking or the short-term furnished rentals are going to continue to have outsized growth and be a difference maker in our earnings model going forward. There's a few things that were -- we started this year that I think they have again grow incrementally over the next few years to such as renting out common area spaces such as conference rooms, rooftops, resident lounges to nonresidents. This year it's going to be a minimal impact maybe $0.5 million, but we're still learning that system and I think it's going to continue to grow too.","John Kim","Can you give a baseball analogy as far what inning you think we're in on the other income bucket?","Jerry Davis","I\u2019d say, we're in the first half of the game.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Babin","I wanted touch on Orange County as well as our financials. But serving in Orange Country, do you feel like the Pacific City development is maybe cannibalizing some of your same-store performance? The market is still growing recently in terms of your revenue growth but accelerating some. And I guess if you could just talk about that as well as kind of the general supply demand dynamics in the market that would help?","Jerry Davis","Sure, Drew. This is Jerry. Pacific City, again, that's in the lease up right now, it's little over 70% leased. We do have three other properties in Huntington Beach. One is probably a mile away from Pacific City. And I\u2019d tell you, yes, I do believe that property is being negatively affected by Pacific City. And I think the other two assets, one is older and at about much different price point. So I don\u2019t think it's affected at all as in our military community, which we built four or five years ago is not really located on the beach. Its right up on the 4053 way, probably being somewhat affected but not as materially. But I\u2019d tell you that Huntington Beach is one of our -- if not be, weakest submarket that we have in Orange County right now. When you look at supply and demand within Orange County, we have got about 1,700 units there and being delivered this year that are within a mile of our communities. So about 500 of those would be Pacific City, but we also have competition in other areas. But I think when you look at it, really the job growth has been a little bit less than we would have hope for this year. Current projections are about 21,000 jobs in the Orange County. And when you look outside of just the proximity to our properties, you're going to have about 5,000 units delivered. But Orange County is slightly weaker than we had anticipated. But we are optimistic as you get into the next year that you are going to see supply come down a bit and some stability reemerge.","Drew Babin","Okay. And then small piece of the puzzle though I was hoping to ask about the Marina del Rey portfolio, the turnover was up a little bit. Was there any supply kind of directly impacting that this year and just kind of what are local dynamics to that?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, it's really, it's about 600 units of new supply that\u2019s coming into play up in that Marina area. Yes, NDR is, I mean, it's -- think turnover when you look at that, again, our turnover was down about 200 basis points, a lot of things could impact that. Probably the largest impact is when you have a lot of new supply with the rationale price income directly added. And I\u2019d say last year we were pretty stable. This year it's up 400 or 360 basis points but still roughly about the UDR average. So I don\u2019t think there is really a story there in LA other than the smallish portfolios. So it doesn\u2019t take many new move-outs to affected. But in addition to new competition in the area that can drive turnover up. The other things tend to be how many leases do you have expiring in a certain period and then how much attention are you placing on customer service. And I will tell you -- we as well as all my peers, I think, do a much better job listening to our residents and addressing issues. And I give a lot of credit, especially to our West Coast team who had turnover go down over 500 basis points year-over-year to focusing on the customer service side of the business.","Drew Babin","Great. Thanks for that. And one more for Joe just on the DCP opportunities. Is there any read through there in terms of maybe a pullback into the small development lending or anything ahead of industry wide that would be causing the opportunity set wide for you or is it just maybe more coincidental or kind of bit more time, kind of out of the gate with the DCP program talking to folks.","Joseph Fisher","I think your last comment there Drew is really what's driving it for us, specifically meaning that the fact that we have been out there for a while. We've been consistent in the space. I think the funnel just continues to widen a little bit. You see more and more opportunities coming our way which means better ability to hold to the pricing that we expect and the yields that we are underwriting to and better ability to hold to the terms that maybe other market participants may not be able to. If you have seen a lot of these debt funds out there raising capital more competitors in the space, but thankfully given the size of the funnel we're not necessarily seeing pressures from that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hightower","I wanted to touch on the same store revenue guidance really quickly. So we've had two quarters of better than expected results in each case, the midpoint of the range has come up, the high end, however has been left unchanged. And Jerry maybe you answered this question earlier on the topic of supply in the back half. But is that the risk that's embedded within the guidance as it currently is in terms of not raising the high end? Is it supply-driven or is there anything else going on there?","Jerry Davis","I think it\u2019s supply-driven. I think we're more likely to be in the middle to upper end than the bottom but we are cognizant that you do have supply come into several of our markets, little bit more heavily in the back half of the year that we're just watching out before. But there's we feel like we're doing a very good job. We have industry leading revenue growth. And I think that top end of five that's strong numbers. And when you look at the components, which include the occupancy growth of 30 basis points, contribution of other income of about 60 to 80 bips and the rest come in from rents. We're happy with where it's coming in. But we're always watching out for indicators of concern and while we\u2019re currently not seeing anything coming out of that gives us pause other than in New York City for the most part on the new supply side. We see the same stats as everybody else. And I think as long as pricing again stays rational and you don\u2019t see a lot of people coming out with two months free. We feel good about where we'll end up this year.","Rich Hightower","Okay, that's helpful Jerry. And then the second question, can we dive in on Boston a little bit and just there seems to have been an inflection point of sorts in the market over the last quarter or two and then you described your experience with the very strong lease up at 345 Terrace. And just walk us through what's going on in the market there? And has anything structurally changed in the last three or six months that we should be aware of to the positive that is?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I think we had a time period that we're still in where competition especially downtown against new supply kind of subsided in our Seaport area and the Boston that I think it achieve stability. So we are able to get a little pricing power at our Pier 4 community. Our two properties up in the North Shore did extremely well. They have revenue growth over 5% -- or about 5%. When you look at the combination of our Pier 4 as well as our Back Bay property did they were come in around 3%. And then you know the South Shore where we have some eight communities that's been a bit weaker but still coming in it too. But I would say you have a continuation of a strong economy in Boston and I think you've had a slowdown of deliveries when we look at our portfolio yielding at 800 units this year delivering within mile of our property. And I think that's allowed us at least for the time being to push again there is some new supply that starting to deliver right now that we\u2019re watching. But I think the other thing is Boston has a heavy seasonality every year where you come out of the gates in first quarter with concern because of the weather patterns. And then once you get to March, over the last two to three years, it seems like we've been able to hit the accelerator take off and this year proved to be no different.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed you\u2019re your question.","Rich Anderson","It's ironic that parking is a driver of growth if all I had to say that. But Jerry I\u2019m curious about this parking strategy. Are you leaving the market or meaning is your competition charging or are you following the market. And the question being or intends potentially going to be dismayed by the fact they have to pay for parking in certain spaces when they had in the past.","Jerry Davis","I think we\u2019re leaving especially in suburban areas throughout the country. I don't think a lot of our peers are really following. What I would tell you is its rather decenniums amount that you\u2019re talking about $5 to $10 typically for an unreserved parking space in the garden community and one of your average rents in those types of garden communities are say 1,500 to 1,700 the UDR average it's over 2,000, it's urban high rise. It's just not material amount. And I think when you can offer someone these specific spot that payers want to get home at 10 o'clock at night, I think its beneficial and I think especially when you look at some of our older properties where parking is at the minimum. We just know they built in call it's in 1960s, 1970s. I think people want to be sure that they have a space. So I think that are policing in the parking lot makes it benefit to the residents that we have not seen or heard and a price from our residents. We haven't seen turnover go up, obviously, as you look at our numbers. And I think it's something that we will be accepting.","Rich Anderson","I guess the numbers kind of put in perspective to in terms of relative to the rents we\u2019re paying. So I appreciate that color. Second question is a little bit broader picture. I asked on the Avalon call about just the nature of this economy and job growth and the stimulus that come from the tax reform and all that. Do you guys have a sense that this is maybe perhaps a short-lived economic improvement that could whether a bit maybe a year or two from now? And if that is the case the way you're seeing at, how is this sort of caught an inflection point change your behaviors the company relative to what we've seen more typically in previous cycle shifts?","Thomas Toomey","Rich, it's Toomey. We talk a great deal about where we think markets are and where we think we are the economy and the rest of the business. Our conversations always come down to about three topics, which is on a national basis, where do we think the industry is. And I would say that the economy is showing amazing resilience. And particularly, when you look at GDP and our business usually as an echo of that that drives us to an optimistic view of the economy demographics, but hell after talking about it for 15 years you are actually seeing the delivery of it. And then for us on a national basis we just continue to talk about supply and what would accelerate it, what would kill it off and how we've weathered the storm on this supply cycle. And the second thing we talk about is where our value creation opportunities are. And so you are hearing it in the operational side. And Jerry didn't mention many of it, but a lot of it is, I think the multifamily space has been low to adopt technology solutions. And we've been more of an industry that's followed instead of led. And I think there's a lot of opportunity inside of that that will carry beyond and more significant than the other income attributes that we've been going through recently.","And the last topic is we talked through markets and where we think those opportunities where we are in the cycle of individual markets. And with 20 of them, there's always some that flow to the top where we think things are going positive and others where we are probably a little bit more defensive in nature in our investment. So the combination of the three always leads to where is the offense of game plan, how can we take advantage of it how can we allocate our capital and our resources of people to get better numbers, better results. And I think that nice dialogue that we have here in the full breadth of the experience in the room is weighing to just what you saw, a very good quarter and prospects for the balance of the year to be good. And more frankly we are very focused on '19 and where we think we can be positioned. So that's kind of our attitude and I know other people try to draw too big of a blanket over the topic. But the truth is the company is focused on figuring out how to march forward with all the cards in front of us and don't feel like we are doing anything but the responsible thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","I just was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capitalized interest. You guys said that you are having $800 million of development now that\u2019s going to go down to zero from maybe a quarter or two before ramping back up to that $4,600. So it sounds like as we think about our 2019 numbers, interest expense would go up materially as the capitalization comes off. Is that a fair way to think about it? Or there are some offsets there?","Unidentified Company Representative","I think you may have jumped in by one year on that one. Really in 2018 if you look at our guidance for interest expense relative to last year, we are up about $14 million on interest expense, half of that is really driven by the decrease in cap interest that we saw from '17 to '18. So that number came down from, I think, around $17 million $18 million down to around $11 million midpoint this year. The predominate of that was really felt kind of - the first half we had higher cap interest, driven by 345 in Pac City, and the second half, we're going to have relatively minimal cap interest. We'll probably end up the second half somewhere around $2.5 million to $3 million, which tells you that the first part of next year will probably be around that run rate. Then as we take the development pipeline back up as we talked about, let's say $0.5 billion by late '19. You'll start to see cap interest pick back up. But I think we're kind of leveling out here a little bit on cap interest given how much we've come down last year or two.","Unidentified Company Representative","Alex, let me just add one thing. As cap interest comes down, we expect NOI to go up. So in effect putting on an earnings standpoint of that's how you're looking at it, FFO will more than offset the reduction, I mean, NOI increase will more than offset the cap interest reduction.","Unidentified Company Representative","That's a great point. Just to remind Alex that $716 million between the two big developments that's what yielding in the mid-2s this year between FFO and NOI combined. Next year, we think that'll move closer towards stabilization in '19 and '20. So you do have a nice pick up going forward from an earnings standpoint off of those two developments.","Alexander Goldfarb","Appreciate that. But it often seems like there's a mismatch in the impact of cap interest coming off. It\u2019s sometimes greater than the ramp up in the NOI but I appreciate that. The second question is on the DP, on the developer program book, you guys, you said, obviously, it sounds like there's more opportunity for you but imagine there's still more competition. So as interest rates have risen and as constructions cost has gone up, have you guys been able to maintain your same targeted returns on that program and investing in the same part of the capital structure meaning the price per door, your LTV, however you want to look at it, you'll be able to maintain that or if you had to go sort of with less subordination or lower returns to make the deals pencil?","Harry Alcock","Alex, this is Harry. I'll answer that, the -- first in terms of risk on our position to capital stack is unchanged. We have not increased the risk profile at all in order to continue to deploy this capital. And secondly and it's really a function of the market with the reduction of both available debt capital and equity capital. There's been a natural gap in the capital stack that's been created. And so there's actually more demand for this product. So our risk has stayed the same and actually our returns have floated up. The sort of first cycle deals we did in '13 to '15, $230 million or so. We were sort of underwriting 10% to 11% type IRRs today that number is more like '12 to '13. So no change in risk, and actually an increase in expected returns on this product.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Jerry, a follow-on to the MetLife question from earlier. And I know we talked about the better part full years as supply being an issue. As it continues to lag, is there any incremental concern that the absolute level of rents from that portfolio are too high and just propensity to push rents over the next 3 to 5 years will continue to be impaired?","Jerry Davis","I don't think so. I think again once you have that stabilization of the development deliveries and their submarkets, I think, things will be fine. I'll give you an example. Year ago there was a bit of a slowdown in the submarket in Seattle where our Class A+ property is and we have 4% or 4.5% revenue growth for a couple of quarters with that one property. So I think it's cyclical dependent on these deliveries. But I think we've got extremely well located timelessly built assets that have great floor plans that, I think, we\u2019re going to do very well. And I think a lot of these assets too have larger floor plans. So I think as these millennial stages and they want to continue to live in a city or they maybe not painful to move out to suburbs and buy a home, I think it's going to be a good renting option. And then the other part I also believe that this asset tightness as far as we have as baby boomers continue to age and sell their big houses out in suburbs and move into the city. I think this portfolio cares well to them. So I think it's just timing and it has been an extended timing, so I'll give you that. But I think over the kind of couple of years, I think they are going to perform at least as well as our same stores.","John Pawlowski","Harry on competitive development front, I think, your expense that sponsors that are competing for you guys and attend. Is that the sense that they are retching up leverage and doing some financial engineering? Or they just function any rational growth rates to adjusted by the IRR?","Harry Alcock","I don\u2019t think, I mean, I guess, I would answer this way. I don\u2019t think leverage has changed meaningfully. I mean that there is debt capital has increased moderately recently in terms of the loan to cost on available construction financing, but the debt hasn\u2019t changed meaningfully. I think what has happened to some extent is that equity capital has become moderately more aggressive as they look to deploy and affect their dry powder. So I think when you have a situation where equity is pushing the merchant builder to deploy capital, you've got a situation where I think at times underwriting becomes a little bit more aggressive.","Thomas Toomey","John, this is Toomey. I'd add to that, I mean, as you talk to global capital players, the asset class of multifamily is growing in prominence with respect to their share of a pie. And it seems to be just getting favorable across so many different networks either pensions, foreign capital that haven't been here for a decade and they are shying away and pulling away from the unknowns of retail, they're pulling away from office. And so I think we're just getting a bigger piece of capital pie.","John Pawlowski","Tom in this conversation, we stretch our heads too. They keep putting money work in the private market but you and your peer share prices are at a discount. How are you changing your pitch for investors to look at public REIT as a proxy for real estate? And are you making any inroads? Do you have any hope that the foreign, Swiss and the pension funds will look to the REIT market increasingly with private market pricing have been pretty aggressive?","Unidentified Company Representative","You know what I would say is that I think the team as REIT doing fabulous job of outreach across the broad spectrum. You\u2019re seeing more and more speakers at conferences talk about asset class in their particular market gaining favor. And so my suspicions are is that the local investor will pump capital into the local markets take that to Berlin, the Nordics, as examples and many eastern block countries. As they see that performance elevate then they are like expand more to what I would call the publicly traded share model. But it's just going to take time. What I'd say is it took us 10 years to get up off the floor. We are now into the ring. My suspicions are is that if we keep putting up numbers like this on a risk-adjusted basis, eventually they will find the public space.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Chairman, CEO and President, Mr. Toomey for closing comments.","Thomas Toomey","Just a quick closing, guys. Thanks for your time today. I thought we had a great conversation. Again, to remind you, we feel good about our business for the balance of '18 and looking into 2019. We are optimistic on our prospects. And we wish all of you have a good summer. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a nice day."],"20874":["UDR, Inc.

On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results. As well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","Our strong first quarter results, highlighted by FFO as adjusted growth of 6% and the value creation we produce for our shareholders, again confirmed that we are successfully executing on our overarching strategies, which focus on operational excellence, maintaining a diversified portfolio, accretive capital allocations, maintaining a liquid investment grade balance sheet, and promoting a culture of empowerment and innovation.","Big picture macroeconomic drivers remain supportive of a stable apartment fundamentals during the quarter, something we had anticipated, which we built into our sector leading 2019 same-store growth guidance.","While we are only four months into the year, and we are just starting peak leasing season, we continue to see positive momentum in leasing trends, record low turnover, and strong occupancy. As the majority of peak leasing season is yet to come, we are not providing guidance update at this time. But operations look good. Jerry will provide additional color in his remarks.","Moving on, we had a busy first quarter for transactions. Numerous acquisitions in markets targeted for expansion, when we reported on the fourth quarter call, and represented accretive near term uses of the $300 million of equity we issued last December. Our strong cost of capital persisted throughout the first quarter, and we took advantage, issuing approximately $192 million of new equity at a premium to NAV through our ATM program.","In his prepared remarks, Joe will guide you through the high level value creation potential for our $517 million year-to-date uses and an additional $109 million acquisitions we have under contracts. All in, the market has generally provided us a signal to grow since last December, and we have responded with accretive deals that strengthen our position in targeted markets, while also maintaining geographic and asset quality diversification.","Last; I and senior management team would like to express our gratitude to Lynne Sagalyn and Rob Freeman, both of whom have faithfully served our shareholders as Board members for over 20 years. They have decided not to stand for reelection this year. We thank them for their dedication and leadership during their tenures, and wish them the best moving forward.","With that, we'd like to extend a special thanks to all our UDR associates for your continued hard work. And now I will turn it over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks Tom, and good afternoon everyone.","We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results, with same-store revenue and NOI growth rates of 3.8% and 4.1%, both near the top end of full year 2019 guidance ranges. As first indicated on our fourth quarter call, we continue to believe that more of our 2019 topline growth will be driven by rent increases versus 2018's occupancy gains and other income growth. Examining the three primary drivers of same-store revenue growth, we saw that.","Blended lease rate growth was 3.3% during the quarter or 60 basis points above last year's comparable period. For the remainder of 2019, we are continuing to forecast that our year-over-year spread will remain near this level.","Occupancy declined by 10 basis points year-over-year during the quarter to 96.8%. We continue to forecast flattish occupancy in 2019. And other income grew 12.7% or 350 basis points above the rate produced in the first quarter of 2018. While this result is encouraging and above our initial forecast, we caution that some of the outperformance was due to onetimers and other income ramped significantly throughout 2018, thereby increasing the difficulty of each quarter's comp moving forward.","Regarding expenses, the process and procedural improvements we implemented throughout 2018 and thus far in 2019, continued to produce solid results. The two controllable expense line items, where these successes are most eminent, are personnel and repairs and maintenance, as presented on attachment 6 of our supplement.","During the quarter, personnel was down 4.3% year-over-year or approximately $620,000. Repairs and maintenance grew by 14.1% or approximately $1.1 million, but included $300,000 in unusual weather-related costs. After excluding these unexpected costs, combined growth in these two categories would have been less than 1%, and well below inflationary norms.","Moving forward, we encourage those listening to examine personnel and R&M expense growth, in concert with one another, as our ongoing platform initiatives will likely continue to push the respective growth rates in opposite direction, but also reduce the combined growth over time. For non-controllable expenses, real estate taxes increased by a rather modest 3.4%, as we realized better than expected refund activity. That being said, we are still forecasting full year growth in the 5% to 7% range for this category. All in, we feel good about our operations and believe we are running on all cylinders.","As Tom indicated in his remarks, we are not providing a guidance update on this call. But absent a macroeconomic hiccup or some other exogenous shock, the probabilities of hitting the low ends of our full year same-store revenue and NOI growth ranges appear remote at this time.","Moving onto a platform update. As indicated earlier in my remarks, we're seeing solid returns from the implementation of process and procedural improvements on our controllable expense categories. On the revenue side, we have upgraded approximately 9,200 homes to-date with smart home technologies and are achieving the incremental rent premiums we underwrote. Therefore, phase 1 of our upgraded operating platform, which focuses on these attributes, as well as outsourcing and centralizing non customer-facing tasks is progressing as expected.","Phases 2 and 3 which entails the launch of an expanded suite of self-service options for our residents available on their smart devices, and utilizing the internal data we tracked to better operate our communities are on schedule, on budget and will provide benefits in the years to come. In future calls, I will continue to provide updates on our progress.","Next, a quick overview of year-to-date market level performance. San Francisco, Washington DC and Austin, which represent 34% of our same-store NOI, has marginally outperformed versus initial expectations, as the result of increased demand for our apartments, which drove occupancy, as well as above average contributions from other income items, such as parking, short term furnished rentals and rentals of common area spaces.","Conversely, Orange County and Seattle, which comprise 22% of our same-store NOI, have underperformed due to uncharacteristically harsh weather during the first quarter, and in the case of Orange County, weaker job growth. All other markets are performing more or less in line with our initial expectations coming into this year.","Last, a short update on our developments and redevelopments. During the quarter, we started the second phase of Vitruvian West in Addison, Texas. The community will comprise 366 homes with our 50% share of the cost to construct at $32 million. We are excited about this project, given the highly successful lease up of phase 1, which consisted of 383 homes and took only six months during 2018.","The remainder of our development projects outlined on attachment 9, are now physically stabilized at over 90% and continue to march towards economic stabilization. In aggregate, we are pleased with how these communities have leased up, the lease rates we have, and are attaining, and the value creation they will continue to provide to our stakeholders.","On the redevelopment side, which you can review on attachment 10, 10 Hanover Square in lower Manhattan and Garrison Square in the Boston Back Bay were removed from our same-store pool during the quarter and placed into redevelopment. Expected spend on these two communities is approximately $35.5 million, with completion scheduled for late 2020 or early 2021, as unit interiors will be updated on term.","These are both examples of accretive capital being put to work in markets we are targeting for expansion. As a reminder, the 2019 full-year same-store guidance ranges we provided on our fourth quarter call, contemplated the redevelopment of these communities.","In closing, I would like to thank all of our associates in field and in corporate for producing another strong quarter of operational growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.","Joe Fisher","Thanks Jerry.","The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, a transactions and capital markets update, and the balance sheet update. Our first quarter earnings results came in at the mid to high end of previously provided guidance ranges. FFO as Adjusted per share was $0.50, up 6% year-over-year, and driven by strong same-store and lease up performance, and accretive capital deployment.","Next, as indicated earlier, in our prepared remarks, we're not providing an earnings or same-store guidance update on this call, due to how early we are in the year. However, updated sources and uses expectations and second quarter guidance ranges are available on attachment 15 of our supplement.","Moving onto transactions and capital markets; as previously announced, we acquired four operating assets located in New York, Suburban Seattle, Orange County and Tampa, for a total investment of approximately $362 million in the first quarter at a weighted average year one FFO yield in the high fours.","In addition, we purchased two development sites located in Washington DC and Denver for $41 million. Combined, these acquisitions along with smart home investments and funding Developer Capital Program commitments, represented accretive uses for the $300 million of equity we issued at a premium to NAV last December and the additional leverage this equity allows.","Positively, our equity cost of capital remained advantageous throughout the quarter. As such, we took advantage and issued approximately 4.4 million shares for net proceeds of $192 million via our ATM program at a 5% premium to consensus NAV. We believe that our disciplined approach of identifying near term uses prior to sourcing new capital, best serves our investors by not speculatively diluting our earnings stream.","Primary uses of these incremental ATM proceeds, included a post quarter acquisition of Rodgers Forge, located in Towson, Maryland for $86 million and the pending acquisition of Park Square located in the King of Prussia submarket in Philadelphia for $109 million. Park Square is expected to close during the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.","Near term and longer-term value creation from our year-to-date acquisitions comes in a variety of forms. First, and as already indicated, they have been funded with accretive capital. Second, they are in markets targeted for expansion by our predictive analytics work.","Third, there is plenty of upside by improving core ops and implementing legacy other income initiatives. And last, these communities fit will with Jerry's next-generation operating platform.","Economically, all of these transactions exceeded our weighted average cost of capital, enhanced our portfolio growth rate and IRR and our NAV and FFO accretive. Please see our first quarter press release and supplement for further details on our transactional and capital markets activity.","Regarding development, as Jerry indicated we started construction on the second phase of Vitruvian West with our partner MetLife, and we continue to assess other new development opportunities, but remain disciplined in our underwriting.","Over the next several years, our view is that our pipeline will stabilize in the $400 million to $600 million range, a level well below where we have been much of the cycle, assuming targeted spreads hold. This is supported by our overall views of the macro and real estate cycles, the opportunities at our disposal, our cost of capital and our three year liquidity profile.","Moving on, our Developer Capital Program investment inclusive of accrued preferred return, stood at $213 million at quarter end. Thus far in the second quarter, we have closed one new commitment, Modera Lake Merritt located in Oakland, California.","This transaction represents an approximately $27 million commitment, with a yield in the high single digits and a profit participation. After closing Modera, we have approximately $100 million of additional capacity that we can choose to deploy if opportunities present themselves.","Big picture, we have a variety of capital sources and uses with competition taking place within each bucket. We will remain flexible with our deployment and we'll continue to pivot to take advantage of the best risk adjusted return available, as long as opportunities meet our hurdles, it can be accretively funded.","Next, balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity net of the commercial paper balance, was $1 billion. Our consolidated financial leverage was 30.6% on undepreciated book value. 20.4% on enterprise value, and 24.6% inclusive of joint ventures.","Our consolidated net debt to EBITDAre was 5.3 times and inclusive of joint ventures was 5.8 times. We remain comfortable with our credit metrics and don't plan to actively lever up or down from average 2018 levels.","With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","You've become more active on external growth, what gives you the confidence to accelerate it at this point and how do you balance using your current cost of capital in the market signal to growth, versus being pretty far into the business cycle?","Joe Fisher","Nick, it's Joe. So in terms of activity, it's probably good to break it into a couple different buckets, because some of this is pretty long lived activity that's been on the works for a while. So the two options we talked about last quarter, we\u2019re really a byproduct of 2015 loss JV. So those were not necessarily representative of us being aggressive for time and cycle or more active. It is simply we had assets that we could buy below fair market value. Same with kind of the land prices or land deals that we did, those were both one year and three years in the making.","I think all the new activity though that we're talking about, the New York deal, Tampa, Baltimore, and Philly, really just a byproduct of where our cost to capital has been. So when we raise capital back in December, at a premium to NAV, and again during the first quarter at a premium to NAV, we really tried to size that to be commensurate with the uses that we had out there, with the goal of making sure that we had minimal near-term dilution and then of course added to longer-term accretion.","So I think what you're seeing is $0.5 billion of equity raised thus for our premiums, which has translated into about extra 0.5% growth when you get out to 2020 and beyond. So I think pretty good value creation coming off that. In terms of going forward, what would cause us to do more activity. We continue to have a variety of uses going down the stack from acquisitions to redevelopments, DCP, development et cetera, as well as variety of sources, be it equity, dispositions, free cash flow.","So we're going to continue to monitor those look at the opportunities in front of us. Can we drive more accretion, better long-term growth and better IRRs for investors. If so we'll look to be - continue to be active.","Nick Joseph","And other then the cost of capital, what other signals are you going to focus on, before committing to more projects?","Joe Fisher","In terms of other signals that we're looking for, we want to make sure that from a risk standpoint, don't take on additional risk on to the enterprise. As you said, where we're at in the cycle doesn't seem prudent to add risk. So balance sheet wise, going to continue to maintain leverage metrics in line with 2018, sources and uses line capacity through your liquidity, continue to make sure that any activity that we do, do, does not violate any of the principles that we have on that side. Match funding I think we've done a very good job of making sure that we are lining up the uses with the sources in an appropriate amount of time.","We do take on a little bit of dilution, freezing that equity right before we deploy. But we do make sure that we've got a pretty good line of sight into those assets that we're deploying into on the acquisition side. I mean and go into contract working for due diligence and a pretty good visibility on closing. So we're going to continue to kind of maintain those couple principles. So, if we're fortunate to have a cost of capital or fortunate to find uses of that capital continue to be active.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower, Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hightower","Joe, I want to - I guess I appreciate that given where we are in the calendar, revisions to guidance were not in the cards even after the very solid print last night. But maybe to the extent possible I guess within that parameter. Can you help us understand the FFO walk from what happened in the first quarter, relative to same-store plus the acquisition volume that obviously increased pretty tremendously versus prior guidance, and then maybe the subtractive effect of the ATM shares, just from a modeling perspective?","Joe Fisher","Yes for sure, so from a same-store standpoint, I think you heard Jerry say, things are coming in very nicely, very positive on where we're at. We effectively are saying that it would be very difficult given what we see today, to come in at the low end for the full year. So I think it's fair to say that, that came in a little bit better than expected on the operations side. In terms of the accretion dilution, we did take on slight dilution from the additional ATM activity.","We talked last quarter about the $300 million raise that we had and that cost us roughly - a little bit less than a penny on the full year. Majority of that you kind of felt in the first quarter and then the extra $192 million that we raised throughout the quarter, we didn't really start deploying that until subsequent to quarter-end with the Baltimore acquisition and the pending Philadelphia acquisition. So, we did take on a little bit more dilution, but it's not really more than a couple tens in the quarter from the additional ATM issuance.","Rich Hightower","And then maybe secondly here, just with respect to the DCP program. Can you describe the competition you guys are seeing maybe from whether it's other REITs or non-bank lenders for the paper that you're buying in that program. Just what that landscape looks like?","Jerry Davis","Sure, this is Jerry. I mean as we know we've been doing this for five plus years. There continues to be demand for this product, which is good. It's a product - it's an asset that we like from an investment standpoint. I think I mean you seen some other region who they are as it certainly has an active program. I think a majority of our competition is either from private funds and there are several of them out there. The large PE firms are also very active, and they all have their sort of different take on this activity. But the amount of capital chasing these deals has certainly increased over the last three or four years. But still has the demand, given the sort of relative reduction in construction financing proceeds and that type of thing.","Rich Hightower","Yes, thank you.","Joe Fisher","Hi Rich.","Rich Hightower","Yes.","Joe Fisher","Rich may be just one other thing. I think it is important to point out the unique attributes of the program relative to maybe some of those other mezz funds, debt funds et cetera that are really focused more on straight coupon. I think one of the things that we do well is, amending what we require and we're kind of working with the equity partner to try to figure out what it is that they need. So you see a lot of these deals that have either options related to the Wolff deals, which we still have one of those in place, as well as our backend participation.","So when you look at our capital exposed to DCP today, we have about 60% of our capital as backend participation, which - the goal here is to get outsized IRRs. Get access to the real estate that we want to own, and by having that participation, it helps mitigate the residual earnings that may come off if we don't ultimately reinvest that into a similar type of investment. So I do think our product is a little bit unique relative to competition out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Trent Trujillo, Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Trent Trujillo","So you've spoken about expanding your New York footprint and you took a step forward that by acquiring Leonard Pointe. And I'm just curious with pending changes to legislation in New York, are there any additional opportunities you're seeing on the transaction market?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. I think Joe could talk a little bit about legislation. I think at this point, you saw we acquired Leonard Pointe in Brooklyn. I think at this point, there are opportunities out there. Our general preference is to take a wait and see approach to see how the legislation plays out next month, before committing additional capital to that market.","Trent Trujillo","And I guess, following up on that from a bigger picture perspective, there are some rent control and proposed affordability measures, not just in New York but in various markets across the country. So how is that influencing your thought process for potential development to acquisitions and I guess more broadly, capital allocation decisions?","Joe Fisher","Trent, it's Joe. Yeah I think on the positive, we are seeing a lot of good discussions taking place amongst all constituents out there in the market. We're not going to go through and speculate out any of these individual kind of evolving situations play out. But we do continue to believe that the long-term solution here to affordable workforce housing is of course not going to be restrictions on rent growth or economics to the owners, which would most likely result and less capital invested and less supply. So hopefully, we do get to a point where you see more upzoning, more densification, less red tape and more programs kind of like the 421 program in New York.","I think one of the best parts about the strategy overall, is of course diversification. So while we do have exposure to some of these markets, and states that we're talking about. We do have 20 different markets. We got diversified submarket exposures, price point exposures.","So that is one of the better parts, that allows us to kind of pick and choose or source capital from certain locations and use capital in certain locations, because this does play into how we think about capital allocation at the end of the day. We've talked a lot about our predictive analytics platform in the past, but again that's a quantitative based approach. That is one factor into our process, if you will, but we do spend a lot of time thinking about rent control and other qualitative factors, when we're trying to decide how to allocate that capital. So we are thinking about it and it continues to evolve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just curious how you guys would characterize the depth of the acquisition pipeline you have today, and as well as, just competition for deals. And then how should we think about your willingness to use the ATM program moving forward as a funding mechanism, versus maybe the traditional overnight that you did last December, as you look to fund potential new investments?","Joe Fisher","So I'll kick it on kind of ATM overnight sources of capital piece and then I kick it over to Harry to talk about transaction market. Yeah, I kind of broached there earlier in terms of the diversified sources of capital and how we're thinking about ATM or overnight, equity relative to dispositions. I think when it comes down to the overnight versus ATM discussion, I think if you go back to what we did the last couple of quarters, we did factor in or did take on a little bit of dilution with the large overnight deal of $300 million back in December.","And at that point in time, we kind said, we don't want to put more dilution onto the investor base in 2019. So by utilizing an ATM in first quarter, we think we minimized the impact of dilution and still set ourselves up well for accretion on a go-forward basis.","So I think if we have appropriate amount of lined up accretive uses and the timing works, you could always consider an overnight. But I'd say ATM at this point would be a preferred use, if the pricing is there and the uses are there.","Harry Alcock","In terms of looking at acquisitions, we do have a diversified portfolio. We are looking to deploy capital in several different markets that you've seen us thus far this year deploy capital in, in Baltimore, in Philadelphia, in New York, in Orange County, in Seattle. So that that does create of fairly broad sort of acquisition template.","In terms of competition, it really depends on the deals and I could tell you the deals that that you've seen us transact either the situations like the New York deal we have, we did a direct deal where we didn't have sort of a traditionally competitive situation. Many of these other acquisitions that we've looked at, have been in markets that perhaps aren't - haven't been chased as heavily by sort of the traditional, national capital sources. So we're competing with the more regional type groups, which gives us a very strong competitive advantage.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just switching maybe then to Philly and the success you had there with the acquisition in suburban Philadelphia. Curious what you consider to be kind of a scalable level in that market, and is there a preference today for suburban versus urban and what's kind of the backlog there on either the acquisition or development side, more near-term?","Joe Fisher","Yes, in terms of trying to get to scale, there is a scaled number that over time we would like to reach. We have a half asset and the pending asset plus the DCP deal that we hope to get access to in the future or at least participation on. So that's clearly not at scale. But I think the economics that we're getting on each one of these deals, outweighs that lack of efficiency that exists today. So we're going to continue to be prudent. Like we said, on a predictive analytics model and a lot of other qualitative factors, we like Philly.","So we are going to want to try to increase exposure there, that could come in the form of acquisitions, development or DCP. But we're going to be prudent in terms of timing. We're not going to set a target and then just rush to get there. So I think we'll be patient on that front.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin, Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Babin","Question for Jerry, on the leasing spread out performance year-over-year, it was about 60 bps and last quarter was closer to 100. A quarter before that, back at 60. I guess you've heard that pretty healthy year-over-year second derivative improvement, I guess implied by the midpoint of full year revenue guidance; sort of are we still going to be seeing that year-over-year improvement in blended leasing spreads in the third quarter and fourth quarter in your opinion, and if so, what might that margin look like?","Jerry Davis","Yes Drew, I think it's going to be very similar to what it was this quarter, it may expand a bit. But we are looking at that 50 to 70 basis point increase. One thing to factor in, we'll get a little bit of contribution from our smart home roll-out. We're going to have probably between 15,000 and 18,000 smart homes in place by the end of the summer.","So as those roll in, increases - rent increases of $20 to $25, it should help elevate that spread a bit. But we're still seeing continued growth to the positive, both on the new - especially on the renewal side, when you look at renewals this past quarter, they came in at 5.2%. As we look into the second quarter, it's up into the mid-5% sourcing and strength there, and it's pretty prevalent throughout the entire portfolio. So things are still good today, as we look into the prime leasing season.","Drew Babin","And then on New York and Boston, I just wanted to touch on something, it looks like year-over-year revenue growth actually slowed a little bit sequentially in those markets, with your peers kind of reporting the opposite. Obviously, especially in New York for the smaller portfolio. A lot of things could be going on there. But I was curious whether the removal of the redevelopment properties in both of those markets might have created some noise there, or kind of what else might be going on, that might be influencing revenue growth in the short term?","Jerry Davis","You know in Boston, I think it was probably a little bit pulling Garrison Square out. The South Shore though, where we have probably a third of our same-store pool, has only grown at about 2%. So it has slowed a bit due to supply issues. Our deal in the Seaport is popping at about 5% and our North Shore assets are coming in at 5%.","So pretty good strength, although this is a market that we see occasional fluctuations in contribution from other income, that can make growth rates quarter-to-quarter go up and down a bit. But Boston does feel good right now. New York City, you're right, we came in at 0.5% growth, which was pretty close to what we were expecting, pulling out of 10 Hanover affected a bit, but the bigger issue was probably - last year we had quite a bit of a larger contribution from other income and not quite as much this quarter.","And secondly, you're absolutely right. When you only have three assets in the same-store pool, if one submarket is sluggish it can bring down the entire portfolio. The sluggish submarket for us this quarter was our Murray Hill Asset Q34, it had revenue growth of negative 0.4%. When you compare to the other two same store assets, our 95 Wall deal in the Financial District was just under 1%, and our deal up in Chelsea was almost 3%. So I think low sample size probably the biggest factor here.","Drew Babin","And just one last one on the King of Prussia acquisition, Rodgers Forge, it looks like the occupancy is 91%. But the renovation that occurred is - I think almost about 10 years ago and so, obviously you'd want to get occupancy up there. Kind of what's the opportunity there, is it under management, is it capital, what is that kind of full potential - how does the full potential of that asset kind of come together over the next year or two?","Jerry Davis","Drew, you named two of them, it does need some capital infusion. We will be spending several million dollars there to improve the curb appeal, mostly. Unit interiors in decent shape, but there can be some improvement there. There is also some amenities that we plan to add to the community. But I think there's a capital infusion that will enhance the yield.","I think as far as the management of the property, we obviously feel like we have the best platform in the sector, and we do see opportunities, whether it be on pricing, on how we do lease expirations, just the entirety of running the property, we see a lot of benefits. But you know, what we really liked about this deal, and it's something you can't change is the location. It was in a great neighborhood with top schools.","So we do expect to be able to derive benefit that product should have been getting, given its location.","Joe Fisher","Drew maybe just one other thing to give you there. I'm not going to go into the specific economics on that Baltimore deal. But I think it is important to think about what the economics are from all the capital activity we're doing here. So we talked previously about those two option assets, $130 million of capital we expended. That was a blended FFO cap rate of about 5-3. When you look at these four other one-off acquisitions that we've done for about $430 million, the year one FFO yields in the high 4s, and by year two, it's going into the mid 5s.","So whether it's the Rodgers Forge deal and the operational upside we see there. Park Square has a lease-up upside and then Peridot in New York, both have operational upside in our eyes. So we are getting about a 10% year-over-year growth by year two off of these acquisitions that we're putting capital into. So I think the economic story to go along with operational store Jerry is talking about springs pretty well for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","Joe, you quoted on your acquisitions and FFO yield in the high fours. I was wondering if you could provide NOI cap rate? And also this FFO yield is tighter than what you acquired in the fourth quarter, I'm just wondering if you are seeing cap rate compression in your markets?","Joe Fisher","So just in terms of the FFO yield, its basically a pre-management fee CapEx number. If you go to kind of market convention with management fee and got $250 million, $300 million of CapEx, you're down to about a 4.7% type number. So I will call it 20-25 basis points to go to what's traditionally known as a market cap rate.","Harry Alcock","The second part of the question, this is Harry, in terms of cap rate compression. We're not - it does point, there continues to be a lot of capital, as we know that they chase multifamily deals, transaction volume in the first quarter was relatively similar to last year, down slightly, but it continues to be fairly robust. But we're not seeing a cap rate compression. Cap rates continue to be a very similar to what they've been in the past.","John Kim","And then on your development spending guidance for the year of $100 million to $150 million. For the remainder of the year, do you expect to have development starts or just positional land acquisition part of that?","Harry Alcock","Well, you saw we just started one project in Dallas. So that gets us to the low end of the guidance. In addition to finishing up our other development and redevelopment projects to get to the high end of the guidance would require either the Denver acquisition and\/or the, the DC acquisition to start construction, sometime this year, which we expect to occur.","John Kim","And just to clarify, redevelopment is a separate bucket to that, right?","Harry Alcock","Right.","Joe Fisher","That is correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Spector","Just one big picture question on the record low turnovers. I get a lot of questions on this, what has happened over the years, why tenants are staying longer, is this temporary? Do you think this is more of a permanent shift change? How are you guys thinking about this?","Harry Alcock","Yes. This is Harry. And as you saw, our turnover was down 110 basis points, I'd remind you because of our short-term furnished rental program, if you back the effect of that out of both periods, it would have been 170. So it's even a little better than it comes out in print. I think it's a couple of things.","I think it has something to do with demographics. I think it also has something to do with leasing strategies that new supply has put out there, and you know, when you have rational pricing and we've said this before, one month free on a lease-up. It typically doesn't draw outsized move-outs to competition.","And I think in most of our markets, you're seeing lease-up concession levels between probably half a month and a month. So has kept it in line. When we look at move-outs to home purchase; for us, it actually got down to the lowest level I've seen, probably in the last four to five years, at about 10%. But I think you're just finding an environment demographically, and with the - all of the housing supply, whether it's multifamily or single family that's coming out there, that it's not drawing people out to move.","Jeff Spector","And then\u2026","Tom Toomey","Jeff, I might add, this is Toomey. You know what's interesting to me having gone at this for 30 plus years, is the product we put up today. The amenities that we offer and the service level we offer. That you find a lot of people looking at it and saying, that's better than the home they could buy or maintain, and it gives them the time. And I think we're all in a race for time and what we want to do with it.","And so, to me, it seems like a long-term permanent inflection point has been reached, and as I talk to my children, they look at it and say homeownership, why? That's just more work I've got to put in on that, taking away from travel and all of the other things I want to do in life.","So I am not sure that we can look in the past and say that these are levels that may even go lower, in my view, as it relates to turnover and length of stay. And you can see it in our numbers, where an average resident is staying with us 27 months, and average age is 38. So it's probably more of the housing stock permanent nature.","Jeff Spector","That's very helpful. And then if I could also ask on the stronger demand, peak leasing season has started. I believe the Gen-Z generation is now starting to graduate college, they are 22. Anything you could discuss at this point about that renter? Are you seeing them enter the pool? Is it normal timeframe, like you've seen other college grads, any particular cities, that has been of focus?","Jerry Davis","I wouldn't say there's anything significantly different between them and the millennials are just a few years older, I think. They are still showing a preference going towards some of these gateway cities or some of the sunbelt cities that have, a cool effect of not just good job growth, but activities they can do outside of work. But no, I haven't seen anything large that's changed over the last couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC Nikko. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Anderson","Say that slowly. So a lot of the conversation on this call has been a lot about redeploying equity proceeds in external growth, all interesting. But somewhat a contradiction to a view of late cycle and, perhaps not the type of experience you would have, if you were thinking about what might happen in a slowdown scenario. So I'm curious if you think the outperformance that perhaps you - or the change in guidance you'll perhaps report on next quarter, will be more focused on - I am not saying you are going to do that, but let's just presume you will, will be more a function of external growth or internal growth? because it seems like there is mixed signals here, in the sense that a lot of external activity late cycle?","Joe Fisher","Rich the signal we are trying to send on the external growth front, is not one that is necessarily next six months or 12 months accretive. We think it's relatively neutral, over the first year or so. And then we think, by the time we get to 2020, is really where we add, call it a 5% to our perpetual growth rate because of that, and then hopefully additional growth above and beyond that, as we continue to get some of that operational upside and market outperformance that we expect through the predictive analytics platform.","In terms of the cycle location, I just come back to, what have we done? We've reduced our development pipeline from where it's been most of the cycle, improved our - to the best location it has been ever. And from a DCP standpoint, we've been very prudent, very patient to blend that capital. So brings you back to the external activity that we do have, which is very much match funded with equity on a leverage neutral basis. So if we do see a downturn, and the cap rates go up or NOIs come down, that would happen for that cost to capital either way.","So we're matching up kind of economic views. But going out and getting more accretion and better relative growth on the investments we're putting it into, versus where we are sourcing it from. So I don't think it's necessarily us opining on cycle location and taking risk late in the cycle. I think we're doing a pretty prudent job of match funding it, as best we can.","Rich Anderson","That's fair.","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey. Just to add to it. I mean I think Joe said it absolutely right, which is we are not trying to call it a point in the cycle. That's the glass half full, half empty argument. We've got very good fundamentals on the ground, and a good cost of capital and a variety of ways to deploy capital to grow the enterprise and strengthen it.","So I think the match funding aspect is prudent at this point, whether you think it's half full or half empty, with respect to the cycle. And then we look at the fundamentals on the ground, and the things that could disrupt that are obviously employment or supply. And both of them seem to be in our favor right now, and there is enough transparency around information, that if one of them or both of them were to go positive or negative, we might take a different posture.","But right now we are - simply raise the capital for deals that we know, pencil and do well, and we [indiscernible] our operating platform, we can create value. So that's our posture.","Rich Anderson","So, like given perhaps a year from now or six months from now, maybe the focal point will be less on the cluster of external activity that you're doing, and more on the opportunity set within the company. Is that a fair statement?","Tom Toomey","No, I don't agree with that. I think the first opportunity is always the operating platform and expansion of margin. That is our cheapest dollar invested and greatest return and Jerry can walk you through that. Second is the external aspect of the organization, in where we deploy capital. But the thing that's going to move our dial for the years ahead, will be the margin expansion in the platform.","Rich Anderson","And then second question, talking a little bit about the same-store pool and different generations, what about, the kind of the reentry of the baby boomers into the rental pool? I assume that's happening more and more these days. At what point does the same-store pool become an adult swim, I guess?","Jerry Davis","We haven't seen the average age of our residents overall change materially. It's still at about 38 years old. I do think when you look at some of our high-end product, especially the larger floor plans in our urban locations, those do tend to be baby boomers that are selling the big house in the suburbs and want to come urban. So I think we have product that accommodates all age groups, and we try to cater to all of those.","So I do think we are going to continue to see the boomer generation be a demand source for us. And it's not just going to be based on job growth that drives occupancy and rent growth, I think you're going to see this entry of boomers continue to play an even greater part in the near future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson, JMS. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Stevenson","Can you talk a little bit more in terms of the scope of the 10 Hanover and Garrison Square redevelopments? $55,000 per unit seems a little pricey for just kitchen and bath upgrades, and can you also talk about what returns you guys are looking at there?","Jerry Davis","Yes, I'll start and Harry can jump in if I leave anything out. We are doing full interior renovations, as you described. Those are probably more in the - I'd say $25,000 to $30,000 a door level. When you get to 10 Hanover, again, I'd remind you that property was converted from an office to apartments I think in 2005. So it's about 14 to 15 years old.","We're rightsizing a lot of the major systems, which were still set up for office use. We're resealing and doing some things with the entry plaza level, which I had some issues, we're redoing the lobby area, as well as some of the amenities. So it's not just interior units, it's all of those things to finish it off. It has got a 8% to 9% cash-on-cash return on that deal.","So you're going to see rents at that property go up somewhere between $300 and $350, above whatever mark it would go. And we would expect this entire process, because it's 493 units, to take probably 15 to 18 months. We've completed about 11 units to date, and so far things are going well.","Garrison Square is 160-unit property in the Back Bay. That property is -, I think it's about 20 years old, 25 years old. Had a whole lot of work done on the unit interior, so they are very dated. It's in a killer location, the Back Bay, but the unit interiors were sparse.","So those are getting a full upgrade. In addition, we had an adjacent building that we had bought a few years ago, where we are going to add amenities, it was basically an amenity-less building. So we're going to add a fitness center, a small club house and a leasing office, because we have been leasing out of unit. That property, again, we expect to get about 8% to 9% cash on cash, and if the rents are going up somewhere in the $400 to $450 range.","Rob Stevenson","And then\u2026","Jerry Davis","Sorry we're also - we do have some other deferred maintenance if you will. We are replacing all the windows and doing a few other things to the exterior.","Rob Stevenson","And then has anything changed in terms of Airbnb and the other rental programs in terms of the - the positive or negative takeaways from you guys and your residents from having people renting units next door to them?","Jerry Davis","No. I mean we still don't - our leases don't allow for Airbnb. So I mean, I'm sure they get in there sometimes. But we don't participate with Airbnb, we do continue to have an active short term furnished program for leases over 30 days, the average term is much longer and we've talked about it on calls for the last year and a half. I can tell you, that that program continues to grow, and in the first quarter, it was up another over - well over 100%.","So when you look at the contribution to our revenue stream, it continues to come in heavy from other income, which is - a lot of it is parking, which grew at 21% this quarter. Short term furnished grew over 100%.","We started leasing out our common area spaces to non-residents through an external platform, that, while it's small is up about 150%, and then the fee income we realized from our package lockers is up almost 90%. So other income grew at about 12.7% during the quarter, which honestly was a bit of a positive surprise. We expect it to moderate down throughout the year and probably have high single digits for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just some quick questions. First on New York, I think most of your portfolio is actually sort of on the newer side despite some of the older buildings. But can you just go over sort of what percent of your New York, Brooklyn, portfolio is either subject to some sort of 421A or 1974 vintage rent stabilization?","Joe Fisher","Alex, it's Joe. So I think last quarter maybe we gave a couple of details on that. Market rate units for us on a pro rata ownership basis, inclusive of Columbus and inclusive of the new acquisition of Leonard. We're about 80% market rate with the other 20% being rent stabilized.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then\u2026","Harry Alcock","374, yes.","Jerry Davis","There we go.","Alexander Goldfarb","So then the 20% of the mix [indiscernible], the legal cap and the preferential rents. Okay. And then on the recent energy initiative that was passed, how do you guys think your portfolio stands versus the 2024 mandate, and then that the jump up in 2029?","Joe Fisher","Alex, it's Joe. It's pretty early at this point. Our operations team and asset quality teams have been working together and kind of doing preliminary assessment. But it looks like at this point, relative to the '24 target, majority of our assets are already in compliance.","So we'll continue to take a look at it and figure out what we need to do to be in compliance 100%, as well as look out to 2030 and figure out what the capital plan is to get there. But at this point, it looks like we're pretty much already there, given previous activity that we've had.","Alexander Goldfarb","Then just a final thing, on Vitruvian, you guys have owned this asset a long time, and I remember - and I'll confess, I haven't been there in a number of years. But a while back, it was sort of - there was a lot to do there. There was a lot of surrounding supply and maybe that area hadn't come around yet to warrant more investment. But clearly you guys are starting, so some things have changed. Can you just update on where this submarket stands now, versus where it was a number of years ago? Like when you had your NAREIT event there in Dallas, that was like, maybe four or five years ago?","Tom Toomey","Alex, this is Toomey. On Vitruvian, I'd characterize as this. When we build product on the first couple of phases, I think our oversight there or miss might have been the realization that the Uptown was getting a heavy dose of supply and capped our potential. And so we pivoted in the next couple of phases to a more of a moderate price, and you saw it in this last phase where we are leasing 90 units a month.","And so as we contemplate going forward, we'll look at the marketplace and see where we think the right price point fits and still very anxious about what the outcomes will be. So we'll be more prudent about it going forward, but the next phase is right at that last - exactly a replica of the last, and we hope it enjoys the same 90 units a month kind of lease-up phase.","So I think long term, great asset, great submarket. The city is still thriving aspect of restaurants and nightlife, and that's where our residents want to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","In terms of just Southern California overall and your portfolio in particular, you noted that Orange County was slightly weaker. What is your outlook going ahead for that market? Some of your peers have highlighted it being a little weaker, just curious what you guys think?","Jerry Davis","Yes, we would agree. Orange County has had slower job growth. It is projected to pick up a little bit. We'll see how strong that comes in. The other thing that affected us in the first quarter was extreme rain events, kept traffic down. So we had depressed numbers there. It's probably the one market, I would tell you, that we're missing, versus our plan this year.","But you know, we'd like the market long-term, but I think it's going to be a struggle this year. When you get up to LA, we had 5% revenue growth. We feel much better about LA with the tech jobs that are coming. Our same-store pool there is not located downtown, where most of the new supply is coming, it's over in Marina Del Ray. So we're close to well-paying jobs, and there is limited supply coming in there.","Hardik Goel","And just as a quick follow-up on your largest market, I guess on DC, do you think there is potential maybe just looking beyond '19 even, that DC could see a meaningful acceleration in revenue growth, even if the supply kind of trajectory remains where it is, or just your outlook on DC just a little longer term?","Jerry Davis","I think DC is going to continue to have supply issues. Obviously you have Amazon coming in and other tech jobs. So on the job front, it's going to be good. But you still got supply issues hitting, especially in the district that I think will keep some part of a cap on the ability for revenues to grow significantly higher than the national average.","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey. I'd add on long-term DC. The one thing that always strikes me when you look at it over a long horizon, is it has one job engine that nothing else can be recreated, and that's called the Federal Government. And that doesn't appear to be on the horizon to be gained shrinking anytime soon. So it's got a natural engine to it, and it will have supply windows. But I'm confident that the government is going to continue to grow in size and scope.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wes Golladay","Quick question on capital allocation. I know it's hard to predict acquisitions, but maybe for some of the long lead time projects, developments and redevelopment, how should we look at the mix of capital going into those buckets going forward? Looks like there is a nice even mix to begin the year?","Jerry Davis","I'd expect more of the same I think. One of the things we continue to try to do, is pivot to the opportunity that exists in front of us. So whether it's the DCP, the development acquisitions, or redev or some of the smart homes and platform spend. Going to continue to pivot based off the opportunities that have come along. So you saw a couple of those land parcels in first quarter that were very long lead time. The Group continues to look at other land opportunities, as well as densification opportunities within the existing portfolio.","So hopefully sometime in the next 12, 24 months, we will have more to speak to there. So we do have the desire to ramp that up. But obviously, up to independent, so we may never get there. So just sit back and we'll try to pivot where we can and create some value.","Wes Golladay","And then on densification, is that more your assets or are you actually looking at retail densification projects?","Jerry Davis","I think we've talked a little bit about our own densification opportunities that we've been looking at. We're looking at one larger scale opportunity in DC that we're still going through kind of process there trying to figure out if we can make sense of the cost and the returns. We've talked about utilizing vacant land or underutilized land within our portfolio, as well as going after parking garage spaces.","We have - and especially in San Francisco, parking garages that are over parked and we have a pretty high degree of vacancy in those parking lots and so trying to figure out how to put additional units there, that both help us from an economic and densification standpoint, as well as help the city with more affordable housing, given the size and price points of those.","So I think you'll see more of that. Then on the retail side, I think from that standpoint, it is a piece of the industry that continues to recalibrate and we continue to look at with any deal, any standard development or land parcel. It's going to be dependent on sub-market, the real estate, the risk and the economics. So we're looking at it as we look at all things, but that's kind of where we're at.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pawlowski, Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Just one question from me, you're Sunbelt exposure has been a nice hedge versus your coastal peers. The last, call it three to five years. Staring out over the next three to five years, would you underwrite higher lower revenue growth across your Sunbelt markets versus the coast?","Joe Fisher","John its Joe. I think one of the things we talked about before. Scott predictive analytics and the ability to potentially tilt us kind of tilt the rent growth forecast in our favor. To the extent that we're following that, as well as thinking about qualitative, you can\u2019t see where we think rank is going to do well going forward.","So where we're deploying capital Tampa, as an example of that down in the Sunbelt. But most of our other capital deployments coming up in New York, Boston Vitruvian, Baltimore, Philly. So some of these, under loved markets that have not done as well of late, we think are set up to probably come back here over the next three to five years.","Tom Toomey","John, this is Toomey. I'd add that not just the market diversification has helped us but also the product price point diversification has helped us and it's a credit to Jerry and his team to produce sector-leading operating results on that portfolio.","But for us, I think it's always been try to have enough markets to always be looking at opportunities, recognizing the cycles move and change and having diversification and price point. So that in any market we can look at it and say it's an A or B opportunity. Let's go after that so it's playing out very well for us and I would see us continuing in the future to hold that same template of diversification across markets and price point products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste, Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Haendel St. Juste","So Tom specifically on the point on that question, John just asked I'm curious. And again I think earlier in the call, you had made the point that you're not trying to call any point in the cycle here but I'm curious on your thoughts on possibly expanding your B-quality exposure your B certainly turned out in Form A's late in the cycle.","And there is no doubt we are leader in the cycle. So I'm curious what your thoughts are on growing that exposure and then any color you can provide on how the demand, and that's how the market looks like, what the cap rate spread between A's and B's is that interesting enough for you as well?","Tom Toomey","I'll let Harry speak with respect to cap rate compression in spreads, but from our perspective, I don't think we have a tilt towards A or B. We tend to end up looking at a particular market and a community and you saw it in the case of Baltimore, a solid B, but in Tampa, we saw the opportunities in A and so we want to take a unique and underwrite one opportunity at a time, it would be cognizant of the overall balance to the portfolio.","So it's not this perfect, if you will, platform of we're going to be 50-50 or we're going to take them one opportunity at a time and try to balance where we think the best risk adjusted returns are going to come out. Cap rates?","Harry Alcock","Yes, well, I think, Tom, got a right that were, I would say relatively agnostic about A versus B on the investment side, we look at each opportunity and underwrite it on its own merits, whether it would be Baltimore where we have CapEx and operational upside, whether it be Tampa, where we have operational synergies.","Given that we have other properties in the sub-market. Whether it would be Brooklyn, where we have a clear operational upside call it an A minus B plus type asset, whether it be Philadelphia where it's been A minus type asset, we like price point and we're trying to grow scale and operational efficiency in that market. So each individual investment we assess in the context of its of its own merits.","Haendel St. Juste","Jerry, one for you here, just wanted to go back to out the question on Addison. I am curious, so why you think now is the right time to start the new phase of the project there giving lingering supply and in uptown in the adjacent markets. And then, curious what type of higher growth you guys think you can achieve there and any color you can provide on the current level of concessions in that submarket currently?","Jerry Davis","Yeah, I'll start then Harry can talk on the investment side, but I guess one thing that a lot of confidence as we built the first phase to this three phase profit last year 300 units, six months. Rent levels are about a bucket but smallish units growth. So, and I think when you look at the product that we're putting up, which is a step down from what we have done in our first three phases and some [indiscernible]. I think we've hit the right price point. They don't compete against the new supply and uptown. So I think we've found a product that works right now and again we've got a minute building that we had built previously to service about 1,000 units. So adding the unit count, not having to stack on all the amenities, makes it a more efficient product.","Harry Alcock","Yes. And just to in terms of yields. The first phase as Jerry mentioned leased up extraordinarily well. We continue to raise rents throughout the six-month lease-up process. We released 383 units in six months and we continue to increase rents and we're starting to eliminate concessions so that one's going to stabilize in sort of the high sixes.","From a return standpoint, the phase we just started is really a Phase II. It will share the amenity building, that's going to be some operational efficiencies. We expect to achieve kind of a low to mid six type return on that asset. We actually built a similar price point, but we actually went slightly smaller average unit size. So we've actually further reduced the average nominal rented that the Phase II project, which we're optimistic you well received by the market.","Haendel St. Juste","And then one last quick one. I'm not sure if I missed it, but did you guys provide any update on the April trends in terms of occupancy and lease rate?","Harry Alcock","No, April occupancy though it's right in that 968, 969 level where tended to run for the last year. And when you look at new lease rates in April is 27. That's up from the one bond that we had during the first quarter. Renewals are coming in at 5.6 and that compares, I think to 5.2that we had in the first quarter. So you're seeing that normal seasonal progression. I think the one changes, I think we are very pleased with where renewables are coming in right leasing to stay relatively flat. They were the fours and low fives last year and we're seeing them perk up-to-mid fives right now.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Chairman and CEO, Mr. Toomey, for closing comments.","Tom Toomey","Thank you and thanks all of you for your time and interest in UDR today. And again, I want to thank all of our team for a great quarter. As we head in the leasing season. I think we're well positioned and we're going to put up some good results.","As you can tell, we're taking advantage of what I consider a very good economy and certainly robust apartment fundamentals with a wide range of match funding capital deployment. And I think that path continues going forward as the opportunity sets continuing to underwrite to good returns.","As we look towards the future though, we're really excited about the implementation of the next generation of the operations platform, and again the goal there is to create an increased margin off of our existing communities and those that we will build and acquire in the future, and also it's in response to our residents and the way they want to do business in the future, and we're excited about the implementation of it and the progress we're making and hats go off to Jerry and the team for the work they're doing there. And lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next month. And with that, take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.","Shelby Noble","Thank you operator. Welcome to UDR\u2019s second quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, www.udr.com. In this supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although, we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday\u2019s press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake the duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you'll be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Shelby and good afternoon everyone and welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","The second quarter of 2015 was a busy and fruitful one for UDR. As we continue to execute on our two year strategic plan. This quarter was highlighted by favorable capital allocation and ongoing impressive operating results.","As a result, we have again increased our full year same store growth and earnings guidance ranges. The following four topics highlight the second quarter.","First, operations continue to accelerate throughout the second quarter with strong new lease and renewal rate growth leading to over 7% effective rent growth for the quarter. This is an increase of almost 300 basis points year-over-year and over 200 basis points ahead of the first quarter of 2015.","Second, our development platform continues to perform very well. Our two communities in lease up the $218 million development in Boston seaport and $92 million participating loan Steele Creek development in Denver are well ahead of budgeted absorption and rent expectations. Including Steele Creek in the West Coast development joint venture projects, we will complete $310 million of accretive development in 2015 and $377 million in 2016. All of which will continue to drive cash flow and NAV growth.","Third, we entered into an agreement to acquire up to $908 million of apartment communities in the Washington DC markets in conjunction with the announced merger between home properties and Lone Star funds. This transaction will allow us to increase our exposure to a recovering DC market at favorable pricing. It is consistent with our strategic plan as it will be immediately accretive to earnings, we will be able to issue OPE units at or above NAV and it improves our balance sheet metrics.","And finally, we are increasing full year earnings guidance in same store growth ranges for the second time this year to reflect the strength evident in our operations. Since issuing initial guidance in February of 2015, we have increased revenue and NOI growth expectations at the midpoint by 125 and 175 basis points respectively. Additionally, we now expect full year FFO as adjusted growth to be close to 9% as compared to 6% at the start of the year.","In short, we feel great about the reminder of 2015 and while it\u2019s early we think 2016 is lining up to be another great year for UDR.","With that, I'd like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow UDR Associates for their extraordinary work in producing another strong quarter of results. We look forward to continued success in 2015.","And I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Herzog","Thanks Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, our balance sheet update, our development update, recent transactions and our revised full year 2015 guidance.","Our second quarter earnings results were at or above the upper end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO, the FFO was adjusted and AFFO per share $0.41, $0.42 and $0.38 respectively. This was primarily driven by better than expected second quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth which was strong at 5.4%, 1.8% and 6.8% respectively. Jerry will provide additional color in his prepared remarks.","Next the balance sheet. During the quarter we've received an upgrade from S&P to BBB plus. At quarter end, our financial leverage on an un-depreciated cost basis was 37.5%. On a fair value basis, it was 28%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA were 6.2 times an inclusive of pro rata JVs it was 7.1 times. All metrics continue to improve as we had anticipated in our strategic plan. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility was $446 million.","Turning to development, we commence construction on our 516 home, $342 million specific city development at Huntington Beach, California. At quarter end, the pro rata share of our development pipeline totaled approximately $1.1 billion and our equity commitment was 69% funded. Currently, the estimated spread between stabilized yields and current market cap rates is at the top end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis points range. Additionally, our pro rata share of preferred equity and participating loan investments and West Coast development joint venture and Steele Creek totaled $363 million at quarter end and our equity commitment was 94% funded.","As to future development, we continue to underwrite opportunities for the focus and we anticipate the size of our pipeline to remain in our targeted range of 900 million to a 1.4 billion. On to recent transactions, as previously announced in May, we closed on the West Coast development joint venture with the Wolff Company. We invested a 136 million or 48% interest in a portfolio of five communities that are currently under construction in our core coastal markets.","Second, during the quarter, we announced an agreement was Lone Star and Home properties to acquire up to six communities valued at 908 million in recovering Washington DC markets. The terms of the transaction are dependent on the number of home OP unitholders converting to UDR common OP units which we will know next week.","If all home OP unitholders convert to UDR common OP units the transaction will be funded through a combination of 753 million common OP units issued at $35 per unit, the assumption of $90 million of debt and $65 million in cash. This transaction is consistent with our strategic plan and provide several benefits. First, we\u2019re able to select from homes entire portfolio and choose the specific assets the net our investment. These assets include the four newly constructed originally redeveloped properties and two properties which redevelop an opportunities. With our best-in-class operating platform, we hope to generate operating efficiencies and the acquired assets and there could be additional upside for the properties which we developed in potential.","Second, if all home OP unit holders convert to UDR common OP units, the transactional positively impact our 2016 - metrics with that two assets improving by up to 175 basis points and net debt to EBITDA improving by up to 0.2 times.","Third, the transaction will be predominantly funded with OP units to issue the in line with NAV and will have no associated the issuance cost.","Lastly, the transaction will be accretive to FFO, FFO was adjusted in AFFO by up to one and half cents per share depending on the number of units issued and the assets acquired. A fewer than 100% of the home OP unit holders are like to convert will have the option to acquire less than the fixed properties will alternatively acquire some of the properties can 31 exchanges.","We will issue a spate press release when we determine the number of OP units we will issue. More details on each transactions can be found under the presentation section of our website www.udr.com.","Finally, we sold three communities containing 812 homes in three separate markets Orlando, Tampa and Portland for approximately 110 million. Sales were transacted at weighted average cash flow cap rate of 5.7% at an average monthly revenue per occupied home of $1190 and were 30 years old on average on the third quarter and full year 2015 updated guidance. We increased our full year FFO, FFO was adjusted and AFFO guidance ranges for the second time this year due primarily to stronger than expected operations.","Our FFO guidance range increased by a penny of the midpoint and FFO was adjusted in AFFO guidance ranges increased by $0.2 at the mid points. Full year 2015 FFO was adjusted and AFFO per share and now for cash at $1.64 and $1.68, $1.63 to $1.67 and $1.46 to $1.50 respectively. The same store would be have increased full year 2015 revenue growth guidance by 75 basis points as the mid-point to 5.0 to 5.5% expense growth is unchanged at 2.5% to 3% and our NOI growth forecast is increased to 100 basis points as the mid-point to 5.75 to 6.75%.","The increases were driven by strong in new and renewal rate growth and stable occupancy. Third quarter 2015 FFO, FFO was adjusted in AFFO per share guidance to $0.39 to $0.41 and $0.34 to $0.36 respectively. Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on attachment 15 or page 28 of our supplement.","Finally, in the second quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of 27.75 per share or $1.11 per share when annualized. 7% above 2014 level and representing yield of approximately 3.3%.","With that I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom and good afternoon. In my remarks, I\u2019ll cover the following topics; first, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and an overview of our current operating strategy. Second, the performance of our core markets during the quarter and last a brief update on our development lease-ups and redevelopment progress. We are pleased to announce another stronger quarter of operating results.","In the second quarter our same-store per occupied home increased by 5.3 percent year-over-year to $1,703. Occupancy was up 10 basis points to 96.9%, this lead to second quarter revenue growth of 5.4%. Our total portfolio revenue per occupied home at quarter end was $1,885 and close to JV's and armature homes. Our revenue growth for the first half of the year was 5.2% year-over-year as a result of a 4.9% increase in revenue per occupied home and an occupancy game of 30 basis points. As Tom mentioned earlier we increased our full year revenue guidance range to 5% to 5.5%.","Our strategy this year has been to drive rate growth which will benefit both 2015 just importantly 2016. In the first half of 2015 we experienced the slight increase in occupancy compared to 2014. For the second half of the year we expect the same occupancy pick up. We are focused on continuing interest rate which will benefit 2016 revenue and NOI growth. That being said we still expect to maintain occupancy levels in the mid 96% range.","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth which is detailed on Attachment 8-E of our supplement. Our ability to push new lease rate growth continued to outpace historical precedent during the second quarter by wide margin, we grew in the lease rates by 7.7% in the second quarter, a full a full 410 basis point ahead of the second quarter of 2014. Renewal growth also remained robust at 7.0% in the second quarter or 150 basis points ahead of last year. In July, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 7.8% and 7.3% respectively. The strength in pricing and demand served us the primary driver of our sizable 75 basis point increase in the same-store revenue at the midpoint or 125 basis points from our initial guidance provided in February.","Second quarter expense growth of 1.8% came in on plan and brings our year-to-date growth 2.1%, for the full year we still expect the expenses to increase 2.75% which implied second half growth is more than 3%. In the third quarter we will begin seeing the phase out before 21G real estate tax payments at our two properties in the financial district in New York City. The expense related to these two properties in the second half of 2015 will be $375,000. Real estate taxes in general tended to be the expense line to con-fluctuate the most ever the make of our plan.","Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary markets. These markets represent 66% of our same-store NOI and 72% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 17% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 6% and is outperforming versus our budget expectations thus far in 2015. Our Los Angeles portfolio posted strong second quarter revenue growth of 6.0% and acceleration over the 3.8% revenue recorded in the first quarter and we expect full year same-store growth to be right around 6% NOI.","Although, the portfolio is concentrated in the Marina Del Rey and Playa Vista submarket which continue to be impacted by new supply. We are seeing new jobs enter the market which is an encouraging sign for 2016. Company such as Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft are all taking up space in the Playa Vista submarket with hundreds of smaller startups getting up shop along the coast from Santa Monica to Playa Vista. As we indicated a couple a years ago, the jobs are finally coming to this growing tech hub in Southern California. New York City represents 13% of our total NOI. We saw revenue growth of 5.7% year-over-year in New York and expect full year revenue growth to be in the mid 5s. We continue to benefit from our B quality portfolio in the New York City submarket and are encouraged by the 600 basis point reduction in turnover year-over-year. We believe this is primarily due to low home affordability as the reason to move out for home purchase is less than 5%. We continue to see a long runway of growth potential in our New York City portfolio.","Metro DC which represents 13% of our total NOI posted year-over-year same store revenue growth of 2.1%. We are forecasting full year revenue growth of just under 2% in 2015. Job growth is returning and then some sub markets supply everything. The best performing sub markets for us in the quarter were on down - circle sub market in Capital Hill. We will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the beltway. We released rates in July or coming in a 2% renewals are over 4%.","San Francisco, which represents nearly 12% of our total NOI continues to show no signs of slowing down have seen by revenue growth of 9.3% in the quarter. New lease rates growth to-date July is 15.3% and renewals are at 10.5%. Our results were mixed cross our sub markets. Santa Clara properties posted revenue growth in north of 12% a property along with Peninsula strong revenue growth of 10% in our south of market properties which are competing against new supply came in at 6%. We're seeing a wide spread in performance between As and Bs with Bs outperforming As quarter by 270 basis points.","Seattle which represents 6.7% of our total NOI posted 6.1% revenue growth in the quarter. Our portfolio continue to benefit from the strong flow inherent in our suburban B asset those located in rent and North Seattle which are sub markets that are less exposed to new supply.","Long-term continue to like to Downtown Seattle sub market as evidenced by recent post development joint venture transaction and believe that the ongoing creation of jobs by companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle\u2019s urban core. Boston which represents over 5% of our total NOI put a 5.5% revenue growth in the second quarter despite new supply pressure downtown. Our South Shore properties continue to see the least amount of new supply pressure followed by our North Shore downtown properties.","Last, Dallas which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI posted 4.6% year-over-year same store revenue growth in the second quarter. Our Addison properties carried this market up Plano and Central Dallas lagged due to new supply that we expect we'll continue for the remainder of 2015.","For the full year, we expect revenue growth to modestly accelerate from our second quarter results and coming around 5%.","I'll turn now to our in-lease up developments, which you can find on attachments 9A and 9B or pages 21 and 22 of our supplements. And we recently completed redevelopment in 34. Our pro rata shares of these three properties represents over 400 - 100 tier 4 are 369 home $218 million development in Boston Seaport district with 69% leased and 57% occupied at quarter end and today its 81% leased and 65% occupied. The first move-ins in mid-March we are well ahead of our expectations on both rate and leasing volume. Asking rates a day of 477 per square ahead of our original underwriting of 430 per square foot. Currently we are leasing about 35 homes per month when the expected stabilized occupancy of 90% by October of this year.","Steele Creek are 218 home participating loan investment of the Cherry Creek sub market of Denver its currently 60% leased and 45% physically occupied. The property is achieving rents in the 330 per square foot range versus initial underwriting with about 310 a foot. For the past two months our leasing velocity is averaging almost 30 applications per month.","34, our 739 home $98 million redevelopment in the Murray Hills neighborhood New York City its currently over 97% occupied and has been over 90% occupied for the prior fourth quarters. We have $3 million remaining to spend as we complete the roof top potentially the elevator banks are given stabilized occupancy we re-muted from your redevelopment schedule on the supplement this quarter. As a reminder it will be added to our same store pool in the first quarter of 2015.","As we sit here today I can tell you that July results came in well ahead of plan thanks to our physical occupancy today is 96.5%. The new growth in August is projected to be roughly the same levels they were in July at 7.3% and leasing remained strong. If we continued pricing power stable occupancies in almost all of our markets these factors leave us very confident for the remainder of 2015. More importantly the impact from our rate increases today will be the catalyst for what we believe to be another strong year in 2016.","With that I will open up the call to Q&A operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Just two quick operating questions for DC, you mentioned improvement in the results in the job growth if there\u2019s talk of supply picking up again, what\u2019s the markets you think that supply could most likely come to and if the supply doesn\u2019t categorize do you think DC could accelerate from here?","Jerry Davis","I\u2019ll start with that and turn it over to Harry about the sub markets where the new supply is coming. We actually as you said Nick we\u2019ve seen acceleration, we think we bottomed in four quarter of last year. As we look out to 2016 our expectation is revenue growth is going to accelerate from the roughly 2% that we\u2019re expecting this year. we look at what we built in on renewal it\u2019s renewals may come in north 4 and they\u2019ve continued to do that in the month of July at 4.3% and new continues to be north of 2 so on a blended ratio probably a little lower 3% so I\u2019d to guess today it would be higher revenue growth next year. we\u2019re seeing some new supply today that\u2019s continuing in our Del Rey sub markets which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, where having new suppliers reclaim that\u2019s to finish up the lease up there, while still getting away about a month, a month and a half free.","That being said, the other location that we\u2019re located in we have a heavy presence along that new street, Logan Circle Port work is performing extremely well with revenue growth, 3%, 3.5% we would expect that one to continue to do well. As far as locations have new supply I know - tie this corner there\u2019s quite a bit new supply coming inside the Del Rey, Harry you want to take that?","Harry Alcock","Other sub markets have several projects in some of these newer neighborhoods around the ballpark in the Southwest Waterfront we\u2019re also getting to see a significant amount of new supply as Jerry mentioned around Del Rey in Northern Virginia we continue to see new supply in that sub market as well.","Nick Joseph","Thanks and then just in terms of occupancy you kept guidance of 96.5% which is 30 bps lower than what you saw in the first half and also 30 bps lower than the trailing 12 months are you expecting to give up some occupancy in the back half of the year to push rates or do you think that occupancy guidance could end up proven to be conservative?","Jerry Davis","Yeah it\u2019s going to be a - conservative we didn\u2019t think it was meaningful on that to change guidance but I do believe in the third quarter specially my occupancy would be less than it was last year as we drive to continue to push rate. But as I\u2019ve stated again at the end of my remarks we\u2019re at 96.5 today, I would expect for the next five months to run somewhere that 96.5 range which is probably a little bit of a decelerate or declined from last year but we\u2019re not going to drop off to the point well below 96 as we averaged 96.5 for the year.","Nick Joseph","Great thanks.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Haendel Juste from Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey I guess good morning out there.","Jerry Davis","Hi Haendel.","Haendel St. Juste","So a question here on pro-forma of the acquisition of the home assets in DC, DC will be about 18% of your NOI is that a level you\u2019re comfortable at? Are you inclined to add a bit more to region in covers or more inclined to call? And then second part of that question, it looks like the golden yield on the acquisition in some of the low fives. Just curious how you're underwriting NOI growth over the next couple of years as part of that acquisition.","Tom Toomey","Haendel this is Toomey, with respect to the comfort level around DC, we're comfortable with the 18% exposure I wouldn't see a climb to grow that above that level. Certainly we think the DC markets is obviously recovering values will continue to grow there. And at some point when look at calling some of the assets no particular time frame for that, but we're always looking to try to maximize the value and we think that market will rise DC probably '17, '18. Harry, you want to take the second question?","Harry Alcock","Sure in terms of underwriting assumptions, we property-by-property we assume revenue growth during the first year some more between 2% and 3% depending on the asset. One of the properties are at the park is completing lease up after their major redevelopment. That property we underwrote in the low-90s in the first year. It's currently around the mid-80s and push that up to 94% in the second year. So we have some second year upside on that asset in particular.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, appreciate that. Are you looking or plus as we considering starting development projects in DC today and not to tie too much the question before I'm saying are you comfortable at the level where you're at 18% NOI. But just curious on your level of comfort to potentially pursue development opportunity in DC today.","Harry Alcock","Haendel its Harry, we don't currently have any land assets that are available for development in the short term. It is however a market that we would developing, it's a recovering market as we mentioned we typically like to have one property in each of our core development markets at a construction at any given time. And we're just completing the lease up of the --. We're hoping expectation of - sometime in the next year or two we will have another land asset that - and new construction started.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay and just as a follow up I'll have on the line Harry. Just curious the conversations with potential sellers here over the last couple of months with vigorous on peoples' mind. Any change in the number of opportunities we think come to the market and any change that - interactions with sellers.","Harry Alcock","Haendel its Harry. We haven't seen any significant change in the volume of opportunities available. There continue to be a significant amount of transactions. 2014 as you know that we're well over $100 billion on transaction volume. We expect 2015 to be something similar. In terms of interactions with the sellers it's a there is a lot of capital chasing these assets. If you don't we haven't had any interaction that would be unusual not sure exactly the question you're asking. But it continues to be very active transaction market.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Tom Toomey","Thank you.","Operator","And we go now to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can talk about the idea of so the turnover. How much of that is being driven by just the upper view of front and just an ability to current resistance to handle that. You talked a lot recently about handlings of being happy with low conversion and pushing rents. Wondering overall that capital demand they're seeing in terms of the income qualifications for the residents.","Jerry Davis","Sure this is Jerry. I guess to start with we've seen move outs due to rent increase probably go 300 basis point over the last year or so from 6% of the reasons from new loan to little under 10%. So still with the level that we're comfortable with. And we look at total turnover in the quarter it was up 110 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. The majority of the reason for that is we had a higher number of lease explorations in the second quarter when we had back in 2014 second quarter of about 350 leases. Probably two or three years ago we started an effort to move more and more explorations from first and fourth quarter and to the middle two quarters primarily because new lease rate growth those high demand time is typically 200 to 300 basis points higher and that\u2019s what it was this year when second quarter the lease rate growth was 7.7% compared to 4.2% in the first quarter of this year.","So, we pushed it to that level, we also would expect third quarter which will have probably a 100 to 200 more exploration from we had last year to also have turnover at for higher than it was last year but then we\u2019ll get into the fourth quarter we would think turnover would be a little bit less than last year. So when you look at the entire year, turnover should roughly be flat with what it was last year. When you look at rent income, really have been seen much of the changes instruct a little towards in the high teens pushing 20%, I would tell you those. That is not as a soft number meaning. Half of my residents probably lived with on average three to five years our average ten year is something like 25 months.","We only qualify people at the time so we don\u2019t qualify them, so over that three to five year period they\u2019ve been getting salary increases so I think any time you hear any others talk about rent income levels, you should realize, we don\u2019t go back in recertify the never income. I tend to love more as my turnover going up when I am pushing right, when I am looking California in the West Coast when has been pushing right the most over the last year, year and half, turnover is actually down in places like San Francisco, Orange County and locations like that on the year-to-date basis.","And then the other thing I look at is if you\u2019re pushing too hard some people will be new when they turn into bad debt as they become a - infection. My bad debt has actually gone down year-over-year to the point this year it\u2019s at less than 0.2% of our gross potential rate so I look at those two metrics a little bit more because they are harder numbers and easier to measure and if we see a situation where either my bad debt starts to spike or my turnover starts grew up dramatically as in better indicator to me that I pushed too hard.","Dan Oppenheim","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good afternoon. It\u2019s Austin in for Jordon. Jerry you mentioned that you feel like you have a long runway for growth in New York I was wondering if you could just provide some additional detail and your comments and what really gives you the confidence that with supply increases in 2016 in the burn-off of 421","Jerry Davis","Well, the main thing as the 421 is not my same store those 421 is that our Columbus square property which is a joint venture. On the same store side, what really gives me the most confidence is when I look at the right growth that I\u2019ve been getting this year and in New York we got 8.4% in second quarter on new, 7% on renewals, in the month of July I knew as it 9.3% so we see strength and incoming traffic and incoming residence rather, the other thing is two more properties in financial districts or the World Trade Center starting to be occupied and retail coming down there it\u2019s becoming much more of available space. And I guess thirdly, when we look at our portfolio there it\u2019s a deep product to the properties in financial districts one in Chelsea and then - 34 or the former - will come into same store in the first quarter which is finishing redevelopment there.","Also our deep properties that none of them will compete the with the new supply that what we come into mid count of west, and there is going to be a different price points so we just have not seen the impact of new supply are feeling right now was will continue to not be directly affected. Our property of North Columbus square does feel a little bit of the effect of Herston Yards in Mid-Cont. West but it\u2019s still producing revenue growth in order to 4%. Now Harry do you want to talk about the supply in New York?","Harry Alcock","Well, there has been a lot of reports written that publicize the significant supply on number of permits pulled in May and June in New York City. The primary reason as developers will trying to get under the exploration of 421A program the program since is been extended but certainly not as developer friendly as with additional affordable housing units that some of them are going to be required. So we saw some more than close to 8000 units in Manhattan or - more than in the months of May and June. Even more and Brooklyn and somewhere in the neighborhood of 35,000 permits have been pulled in all the deferrals over the last couple of months.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for the detail there. And then just on the capital side, I was wondering looking at their source of funds outlined in guidance for $750 million to $900 million. Does that contemplate the potential units issued for the HMA transactions?","Tom Herzog","This is Herzog, no it does not. But the home transaction there would be units in addition to that's been described in the sources we spoken to you earlier.","Unidentified Analyst","So then how would you really think about the mix of capital raising throughout the balance of the year to the extent you feel comfortable that the HMA deal is going to go through is currently structured.","Tom Herzog","Well if the fact was that when we look at our sources who uses for the balance of the year, we've got about $200 million to $250 million left to fund in total. And that's really unchanged when we spoke to last quarter. It will be some combination of sales, or it could be stock or could be debt whatever we conclude at the time if provides the best pricing and it's the best outcome for our investors. So as far as home, again the majority of that come through OP units that depends on how many of the home OP unitholders convert to duty units, as to what will actually look like. And we'll have those numbers sometime in the next couple of weeks.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for the detail.","Tom Herzog","Yeah we've got some optionality obviously on whether we would kick from assets out of if we didn't have full conversion or do - ones or the - we're in good shape on that side.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","And we go now to Drew Bawin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew Bawin","Hi guys. Hoping you could talk through the unsecured debt market right now and what you're seeing in terms of spreads and what you should think about from modeling purposes in terms of the potential bond offering in the next couple quarters.","Tom Toomey","Yeah we day we raised the BBB plus by S&P and AA one by Moody's last year. The current spreads are probably in the range on a 10 year deal 160 to maybe upwards of 170 basis point all and spread including lesser concessions but probably closer to about 160 mark is my guess. So that's the spread what that - we're doing.","Drew Bawin","Okay, and just couple of guidance side. And certainly if you could talk through the increase in G&A expenses while as the large JV FFO guidance.","Tom Toomey","Yeah the increase in G&A is going to be just two things, we've had outperformance during the year against what we have set forth is our plan. And therefore the incentive programs payout at a higher rate. And that's what the increase in the guidance that we set forth on the cash run. 15 years for that. And then as far as the joint ventures that would then be the Wolff JV and then also the addition of Steele Creek some offset for the Texas JV and then there is a few other moving parts within that, but those are probably numbers.","Drew Bawin","Okay guys, that's helpful. Thank you.","Tom Toomey","Thank you.","Operator","And we're going now to Dave Brad [ph] with Greenstreet Advisors.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Couple of questions on dispositions, first can you remind us what level of CapEx is reserved for in your cash flow cap rate?","Harry Alcock","Of the cash flow cap rate Dave this is Harry includes $11.50 per unit in CapEx.","Unidentified Analyst","Is that a consistent assumption anytime we see that from UDR is that the right number to apply?","Harry Alcock","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thank you. And what's the disposition pipeline working like from here?","Jerry Davis","Well Dave it depends. We've got maybe another I guess I would back up. We put it into that tool we\u2019ve got 250 million left of fund at home and that\u2019s going to be some combination of sales debt inside. So again the funding means are not great, I hate to put a number on it because it could change during the year based on conditions.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and you have been planning on a bond offering earlier in the year what\u2019s the latest on that front?","Jerry Davis","We\u2019ve been looking at ten year deal towards the end of last quarter and we\u2019ve got about two-thirds hedge rates now from a treasury perspective so we\u2019re looking on massive hurry on that. We bumped into the Greece and Chinese prices which has the market - that\u2019s choppy and too critical so probably better off to look to sometimes probably in the early parts of the third quarter so that\u2019s still part of the plan but we decided to push that again.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and the last question is there anything qualitative you can share with us regarding the solicitation of home OPU in the quarters?","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey Dave, to compare the question this time we\u2019ll have an answer a couple of weeks and so we probably just be able to come out with a press release shortly thereafter with the facts and so speculating between now and then clearly doesn\u2019t reflects our focus.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood can you just explain to us how the process works?","Tom Toomey","I'm sorry David in terms of what?","Unidentified Analyst","Communication? Yeah the communication between UDR and OPU in orders?","Tom Toomey","We\u2019ve been working in conjunction with the Cape Of Home, and have been having the conversations meetings and dialog with the whole OPU dealers, unit holders both come and explain the trends actually among the home people as well as explain the options and have received a 700 page offering document so as you mind that it\u2019s clearly complex so we our day-to-day dialogue with them.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon guys, Jerry in terms of the increase in the same store revenue guidance was there one or two particular markets that were releasing the back half of the year or thus far this year where it\u2019s really surprise versus where you started the quarter with progress?","Tom Toomey","Yeah that\u2019s a great question and really the bulk of the increase well let me put it this way, we only have one market that is not hitting the original business plan and that\u2019s not a material market its\u2019 Michigan Virginia, every one of my other markets is above plan and they vary to some degree. I would state the biggest surprises to original guidance have come West Coast, going from and mostly from Northern California up through the Pacific Northwest have helped perform by quite a bit to our original expectations.","Also a following that the two Texas markets both Dallas and Houston are holding a better in the faith of new supply than we originally expected and when we get beyond that where there is so caliber rest of the some belt through the Mid Atlantic they are all doing better than original plan but the biggest drivers were Northwest.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then Harry would you think today in terms of construction cost you guys are starting with new developments I mean it\u2019s where, where the goods cost have been sort of six, 12 months ago on these projects versus today and where are you seeing the biggest upward push?","Harry Alcock","So from over the last couple of years we consistently saw double-digit cost increases I can tell you today as because we\u2019re looking to start new projects and are looking forward to the next four, six, eight, 10 months. The cost increases have moderated in fact we\u2019re starting to see decreases in certain materials, steel has come down 10% plus over the past years, lumber has come down 0.56% over the past year so as we look forward as cost increases have moderated we\u2019re now looking at sort of a mid-single-digit type cost increases, the labor market in certain locations continues to be challenging and is pushing back in some of these material declines. Though we've gone from kind of mid-double digit type increases mid-teens down to mid-single digits.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then just lastly in your urban core, what do you think these days in terms of both ground up condo development as well as condo conversions?","Harry Alcock","Rob this is Harry. So that really was the first market where that materialized the condo boom. It's manifested itself in land prices which has gone up significantly and so far few were apartment, projects will pent up projects will pencil now is for multi-family use. It's migrated a little bit to say Francisco where you are seeing for example a project right across from our 399 Fremont deal has been sold to a condo converter. The project has completed a lease up and now - so we are seeing that a little bit in San Francisco. In other markets we're not seeing it to California a little bit in Boston. But really a lot in New York. Some in San Francisco and then just small number in another markets.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys.","Tom Toomey","Thanks Rob.","Operator","And we go now to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Just one quick question, Tom. What's the actual Treasury lock rate that you have for the debt deal?","Tom Toomey","We came in at about let me check back on it. There is about 245 and there was like 20 basis points of forward carry.","Steve Sakwa","So kind of a Treasury and 265 plus the spread of 160 you talked about?","Tom Toomey","Yeah.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, great. Thanks.","Tom Toomey","Yeah.","Operator","And now we go to Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Ian Weissman","Just two questions and maybe you can give us an update on that potential 6th acquisition from Wolff and what sort of been the issue with finalizing that transaction.","Warren Troupe","Sure, this is Warren. We are currently negotiation on the sixth asset. We are hopeful that we will be able to consummate that within near future. The issue is that there is an already partner on the both side and we've also had to include them in negotiation which have been - over the last couple of weeks.","Ian Weissman","Alright. Okay and finally just it has been focused on DC in New York just turn to LA for a second both of you and Avalon reported a pretty nice jump in revenue growth in that market. It's only been a long time coming. Maybe you can just talk about some of the drivers in LA today and what you think sustainable growth is in that market?","Jerry Davis","Yeah, this is Jerry and you are right. We are excited to actually participate in some of the higher revenue growth this quarter after having a discipline 3.8% growth in its fourth quarter. We turned it rather 6%. This quarter our expectation full year revenue growth in Los Angeles for us will be more than 6% and really what's driven if we're UDR, I would remind you talk of our same-store portfolio and then we're going to double rate and there has been quite a bit of the new tech job coming in Playa Vista. Over the last two years we've had new equipment supply come to Playa. So it came the proceeded the job growth. But the jobs are finally starting to come.","I think in addition to that what goes from Santa Monica into the down town area is helping dry grades in the West side. As another benefit we more recently seen in Marian Del Ray portfolio is rental rates in Santa Monica has been driving people just throughout head down the coast 5 or 6 miles to us. New supply is coming in LA right now. It's kind of shifted from that West side. It taking down town right now and we're seeing a little bit of pressure down there. But we're still optimistic about down town as this is becoming much more of a believable city with retail and night life and some job through. But again as I stated earlier, our same-store pool is heavily concentrated among the area and we're finally starting to see the job growth in some of our apartments.","Ian Weissman","And is there been a shift in cap rates in that market just now that the momentum is building.","Tom Toomey","Cap rates have been low in that market for some time. We haven't seen any noticeable decline in the cap rates today. They have been and continue to be very, very low the good product in Los Angeles area.","Ian Weissman","Okay I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","And we go now to Brian Peterson with Sandler O'Neill Investments.","Brian Peterson","Thanks hey guys. Just a quick question back to unsecured, you guys even though given a consideration to shorter terms and then 10 years. Just start some peers speak about that and the relative pricing attractiveness and wondering whether you would have ever consider.","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey, yeah when we look at our debt maturity schedule, we've got a pretty good open slot with very little maturing and 10 years out. So we probably pick that window. And that being said we're looking at the price differential of really our overall governing element is to try to keep that level later maturity schedule.","Brian Peterson","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And now we go to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. I had a question on your same-store expenses in your MetLife joint venture. They increased significantly during the quarter and much higher than your balance sheet assets. Was there a specific reason for this and is there something that may translate into your own portfolio given there is been overlap in geography.","Tom Toomey","No those are typically just related to real-estate taxes either increase this year or refunds last year. I can remember specifically on those what drove it to that level. But I'm pretty sure we did recognize some real-estate tax refund to some of the California assets last year. We may have got and hit with an increase in one of our Texas markets this year. So it\u2019s purely real-estate taxes.","John Kim","Okay. And then on the turnaround that you've had in DC on new leases. Can you elaborate if there is particular price point only this sub market that you're finding more success in recently?","Tom Toomey","Really it's interesting that are doing better than they did last year. A year ago the spread between - was probably 500 to 600 basis point is compressed in the point today. Where it's closer to what it is in our total company which is somewhere in the 100 to 150 basis point differential. As I stated earlier, we're finding some of that urban core A product downtown in Logan circle, Thomas circle and New Street which are right in the same general area are very strong. Our property in Arlington village is probably almost struggling property today because of their supply. And the B assets outside the beltway are continuing to do fairly well but I would say our strongest sub-market inside that way is that - corridor.","John Kim","Okay. And then finally on dispositions have you disclosed with your IRRs or economic gains are on the asset sales that you've completed this quarter.","Tom Toomey","We have not but we can now take it Harry.","Harry Alcock","It's Harry the three assets we sold this quarter those the weighted average IRR was around 11%. So we had kind of a 12% or 9% and then 11% for the three assets that sold. We're probably sold the Texas JV in the first quarter and about 14% so for the year we're at about 12% unlevered IRR for the asset base.","John Kim","All of those numbers you mentioned unlevered IRRs?","Harry Alcock","Yes.","John Kim","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go now to West Causley [ph] with RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hello everyone with the labor market tightening are you seen any turnover at the property level and also at the construction level.","Jerry Davis","I'll start with the property this is Jerry and then Harry can take construction. Turnout was up by here year-over-year and it's predominantly in the high apartment supply markets. So when look at DC Seattle places like that we feel depth of bit of pressure but nothing significant. I do think as we look into 2016, we're going to see a little bit more wage pressure. Whereas year-to-date our personnel expenses up about 3.5%, I'm guessing it's going to be about 100 basis points higher than that in 2016. Harry?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. On the construction side, it's a very high labor market for construction management personnel. We've lost one person this year and they're in the process of replacing him we've added a couple of others as new projects have started. But it's a very competitive labor market.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks a lot for taking the questions.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Tom Toomey for closing remarks.","Tom Toomey","Thank you operator and thank all of you for your time and interest in UDR. As we've gotten two quarters down in the year it's very good year for us. We looking forward to the second half with this continued strength and our performance. And certainly the team is remains focused on the strategic plan the execution of it and building to the strength of 2016 and then we think that's going to be a good year as well.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Chris Van Ens, Vice President. Thank you Mr. Van Ens, you may begin.","Chris Van Ens","Welcome to UDR\u2019s first quarter financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements.

The discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC We do not undertake a duty to update any forward looking statements. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to UDR\u2019s first quarter 2017 conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe, Harry Alcock and Shawn Johnston, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. My comments today will be brief. UDR\u2019s business performed well in the first quarter. With our diversified portfolio and best in class operating platform continuing to deliver results and enhance our status as a full-cycle investment. The macro and demographic tailwind underpinning our strategic outlook presented in January remain in place and in line with expectations. As I look at the first quarter results, there are three key takeaways investors should be aware of; our continued operational success, the status of our developer capital program, and our path forward. ","First, operation, in the first quarter, we produced a solid same-store revenue and NOI growth in the 4.5% to 5%. A level we expect again to be near the top of the peer group. Personal tip of the hat to our team in the field for a great execution. Blended lease rate growth in market that comprise 55% of our same-store NOI improved in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, supportive of our view that operations are stabilizing. And for our community and lease up, we continue to see strong leasing velocity and rental rates.","Next our developer capital program, which includes the participating loan investment in feel Steele Creek and the West Coast development joint venture. This program is a key differentiator for UDR and demonstrates our ability to create value for shareholders and pivot our investment strategy as markets present opportunities. Specific to our option assets as you recall, a couple years ago we identified these types of investments as a good use of capital given their strong risk adjusted returns in conjunction with the value creation potential embedded in their fixed price option. The options provide us with the opportunity potentially by a high-quality new development at a discount to market or sell to third-party and realize upside first cost or employ some combination of buy\/sell in effect self funding. As option windows open on the current pipeline of community over the coming quarters and years, we will be sure to keep you informed of our plan and we remain confident that Harry and team will be able to reload our developer capital program in the future given the financial constraints developers are facing today.","Last, looking at the path ahead. It is still early in the year with prime leasing season just beginning. But we are running slightly ahead of expectations as of quarter-end and we like where our current momentum is trending. Our positive outlook for full-year 2017 is unchanged, which should put us in advantageous position going into 2018. Despite the uncertainties around governmental policies, we remain confident that we have the right portfolio platform and team in place to continue to effectively execute our strategic outlook which will generate strong earnings, NAV and dividend per share growth over the long term.","With that I will turn it over to Jerry to address our operational success.","Jerry Davis","Thanks Tom and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. Year-over-year first quarter same-store revenue and NOI growth were 4.6%and 4.9% respectively. After including our JV communities that satisfy our same-store definition, revenue and NOI growth would have been 4.3% and 4.5% respectively, both relatively similar to our wholly owned results. As our MetLife and KFH joint venture properties represent only about 10% of our total NOI, their influence on all-in same-store growth whether positive or negative is relatively minimal. Our operating strategy during the quarter continue to focus on building and maintaining portfolio level occupancy. As a result, same-store occupancy increased by 50 basis points year-over-year to 96.8%, while annualized turnover declined by 100 basis points.","Concessions for the first quarter as well as gift cards were flat compared to first quarter of 2016. New lease rate growth of 0.3% incrementally improved each month during the quarter and stabilized versus the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect to see typical seasonal improvement during the spring and summer leasing season. On the renewal front, rate growth remained strong at 4.9% as we continue to see minimal pressure from home purchase and affordability related move outs, which totaled 13% and 7% respectively during the first quarter. Net bad debt remains low and at levels consistent with previous quarters.","Next, our other income which represents just over 9% of revenue grew 11% or $2 million year-over-year during the first quarter significantly higher than same-store revenue growth. Why does this matter, because the majority of the incremental income came directly from ongoing multi-year revenue generating operating initiatives that were implemented over the past year or two such as the suburban resident parking and package lockers installations. We often ask how we consistently generate strong same-store results and win our markets. Our initiates are a major reason why and will continue to be as we innovate and implement further improvements in the years ahead.","Onto expenses, expense growth often plays second fiddle to revenue growth. But both contributes meaningful to NOI growth and drive our best in class operating platform. Today, I would like to highlight our success in containing controllable expenses. Controllable expenses include personnel costs, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and administrative and marketing cost. Over the five-year period from 2011 to 2016, our annual same-store expense growth averaged 2.9% versus only 1.0% for controllable expenses. Much of this 190 basis point annual difference is attributable to a multitude of operating efficiency initiatives we have implemented. This includes programs that reduce repairs and maintenance cost of technological solutions and moving the majority of our leasing online. I would like to thank all of our operating associates for continuing the focus on these line items as they create meaningful value over time.","Onto a brief market update, making up 33% of our same-store NOI in the quarter, strong blended lease rate growth was evident in Dallas, Seattle, Orange County, Los Angeles, Monterey Peninsula and Orlando. While Baltimore, Richmond, San Francisco, Austin and Portland which comprised about 19% of our same-store NOI were challenged. While we have yet to enter the prime leasing season and the first quarter represents a relatively small sample of leases, we are encouraged to see stabilization in New York and San Francisco quarterly new lease growth rates, which combined represent 24% of our same-store NOI. Occupancy averaged 97.1% and 98.0% in San Francisco and New York in the first quarter, up 110 and 70 basis points year over year. Should the prime leasing season come out of the gate strong in these markets we are in an advantageous position to drive great growth.","Lease rate growth in Washington DC which accounts for nearly 20% of our same-store NOI was a little wider than expected in the first quarter, but reasonable given our occupancy pick up of 110 basis points year-over-year year to 97.0%. We expect leasing to pick up as we head into May and June. Last, Seattle which accounts for 6% of our same store NOI has come on strong as of late. We realized incremental improvement and rate growth in each month during the first quarter and this is continued into April. We continue to believe that Seattle will produce above average results in 2017 despite elevated deliveries in the city proper. Finally, our development lease ups continue to perform well achieving rates in aggregate above original expectations and with leasing velocities generally ahead of the original forecast. The average value creation spread expected on our pipeline is at the top end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range.","Highlighting Pacific City, our 516 home, $342 million development in Huntington Beach briefly, as of April 20, the community was 17% leased, 2% occupied at an average rate per square foot 12% above underwriting expectation despite units and amenities not even being opened in the first quarter. We are very excited about this asset and its prospects in the years ahead. Other community specific quarter-end lease up statistics are available on attachment nine of our supplement. Summing it up, first quarter was another good quarter for the company. We remain focused on maximizing revenue growth and constraining expense growth. Most importantly, we remain highly confident in our ability to execute in 2017.","With that I'll turn it over to Joe.","Joe Fisher","Thanks Jerry, the topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, a transactions update, a balance sheet and capital Markets update, and our second quarter and full-year 2017 guidance. our first quarter earnings results came in at the midpoint of our previously provided guidance. FFO and FFO as adjusted were $0.45 and AFFO was $0.43, all of which were up approximately 5% year over year, driven by solid same-store growth. Next, transactions, as previously reported, in January we closed on our acquisition of CityLine, a 244 home West Coast development joint venture community located in Suburban Seattle. As a refresher, we purchased this community at roughly 10% to 15% discount to market value which equated to a 5.3% cash flow cap rate at the time of acquisition.","In addition, during the first quarter, we invested 15.5 million into CityLine too, a development project adjacent to CityLine, with our partners in the West Coast development joint venture. CityLine too will contain one 155 homes as they go in valuation of 58.3 million, a fixed price purchase option and will earn a 6.5% preferred return on our investment. As it relates to future options on West Coast development joint venture communities or Steele Creek, current market pricing expectations tilt these towards being a source of capital. Some of the proceeds of which may be reinvested into similar types of value accretive structures within our developer capital program. For an overview of other transactions consummated during the quarter, please see attachment 13 of our 1Q supplement.","Next balance sheet and capital markets, late in the quarter, we prepaid $98 million of L plus 190 debt, the majority of which was scheduled to mature in 2023, as the spread on this debt was well in excess of current market levels. The prepayment inclusive of 1% penalty was temporarily funded with a commercial paper facility priced at L plus 33 basis points as we continue to evaluate permanent funding options at a lower spread. With regard to our $500 million commercial paper facility, $220 million of debt was outstanding as of the end of the first quarter at a weighted average rate of 1.24%. We are pleased with the pricing we have garnered thus far on this facility. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, net of the commercial paper balance was $920 million. Our financial leverage was 32.9% on an underappreciated book value, 24.7% on enterprise value and 29.5% inclusive of joint ventures. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4 times and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.5 times.","Timing will drive some variability in our quarterly credit metrics, but in total, they are tracking in line with our strategic outlook. I would now like to direct your attention to attachment 15 of our supplement where we have reaffirmed full year and provided second quarter guidance. Our full-year guidance ranges remain at $1.83 to $1.87 for FFO and FFO as adjusted and $1.68 to $1.72 for AFFO. Our full-year same-store guidance is unchanged at revenue growth of 3% to 4% and expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 3.25% to 4.25% with average 2017 forecasted occupancy at 96.7%. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are running slightly ahead of plan thus far, but it is still too early in the year. While we have yet to see how the primary leasing season will unfold, our current read is that it will be difficult to reach the bottom end of our same-store guidance ranges. For the second quarter, our guidance ranges are $0.45 to $0.47 per FFO and FFO as adjusted and $0.41 to $0.43 for AFFO. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.31 in the first quarter or a $1.24 when annualized representing a yield of approximately 3.4% as of quarter end.","With that I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi Group. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Thanks and appreciate the color of how you're trending relative to expectations. Just wondering from a market perspective at 30 markets that are either outperforming or underperforming materially where you thought they would be at this point in the year. And then if there's any markets where you're seeing concessions increased.","Jerry Davis","Hey Nick, this is Jerry, there's a couple of markets that are probably doing a bit better than we would have expected. I\u2019ll tell you San Francisco probably is the first one that comes to mind. We have revenue growth that was comparable to what we reported in the fourth quarter. And as you look at really the trending if you will of new lease rate growth, it was negative I think five in the fourth quarter, it closed to negative one in the first quarter. And right now, through the first 24 days of April, it's positive 2.2%. When I was in San Francisco last week, we're feeling better across all of our sub markets there, we don't have any direct competition currently. So write now, San Francisco feels good and in addition to those rents that picked up, we had also seen in San Francisco about an 80 basis points improvement in occupancy year-over-year. So San Francisco is probably one of the ones. Dallas has performed well through the first quarter even though there is quite a bit a new supply hitting Dallas, most of our portfolio is up in Plano. Plano does not have a ton of new supply directly hitting it right now, but what it does have is about probably 8,000 to 15,000 jobs coming up to that sub market whether it's Toyota, Liberty Mutual, few other companies over the next three to six months. We feel good about that market.","And then New York obviously when you look at it we put up a 4% revenue growth. We're very pleased with that. I think our team did exceptional work back in the fourth quarter to set us up for this kind of performance. We drove occupancy significantly up to about 98% as we entered the year and because we had such high occupancy, we didn't have to be as aggressive on competing for residents and lowering rate. And that allowed new lease rate growth in New York to be just a negative 0.4 in the first quarter. I would tell you that is one of the only properties that as we go from first quarter into April that shows a worsening of new lease rate growth is that negative 0.4%. And the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to see through the 4% that we reported in the first quarter, we don't expect that to trend for the remainder of the year, a large portion of that 4% again was made up of a pick-up in occupancy year over year that contributed about 70 basis points of the revenue growth. And we also had a good comp for bad debt that helped by about 40 basis points. So New York we still feel is going to come in probably below the bottom end of our full-year guidance. We give our two-year outlook, we state which markets are going to come in where, so we still don't see New York coming in above a 3% right now. But we're very happy with the work our team did in the first quarter there.","Nick Joseph","Are there any markets right now that you're seeing concessions increase?","Jerry Davis","I don't think they're going up much. New York has continued to be probably in most of the lease up properties they're given away two months in our particular properties. I mean stabilized properties, we saw concessions first quarter versus first quarter of last year remain fairly flat as did gift cards. But again on the lease up side, you're really seeing between four and eight weeks in a variety of markets, New York is probably the most concessionary market along with Austin that we're in and those are both probably pushing close to the two months free. Orange County where there is some new supply hitting in Huntington Beach as well as Irvine. We're only seen a month in those markets. Downtown LA is somewhere between one and two months. San Francisco seems to be fairly stable with lease up, so at about six weeks. And then when you get into Seattle, it's still about a month free there. And then I guess the last one I would close with or last two. Boston is right around a month and in DC it's probably right around a month, most of the new lease there in a either NoMa or the ballpark area.","Nick Joseph","And then just in terms of the West Coast JV, you expanded that relationship. Is there an opportunity to further expand that relationship? And then more broadly, are there - are you seeing additional opportunities to monitor Steele Creek or the West Coast JV for these kind of more creative structures.","Jerry Davis","Hey Nick, it\u2019s Jerry. It terms of back billing, we did close another Phase II in CityLine and Seattle with Wolff. As you can imagine, we continue to have dialogue with Wolff on other similar deals which may or may not happen. In general in the market, with the reduction in their change in sort of lending guidelines, reduction in proceeds, increase in pricing. This type of opportunity is going to continue to be available for us to build a small piece in the capital stack for developers. So we're continuing to have dialog and will let you know how those play out as the year goes on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","I noticed you guys included blended lease rate detail from last year in the [indiscernible] and it seems like that spread has narrowed in the last couple quarters after peaking out in the third quarter. And so I'm just wondering if you would expect the spread between blended lease rates versus a year ago continue to narrow over the next several quarters?","Jerry Davis","Yeah, and this is Jerry. We absolutely do expect that to happen. In fact, when you look at where April is today, it's narrowed from the blend down to about 1.8%. So it is a negative 1.8. So it\u2019s continued to get better. I think in the first quarter it was at negative 2.7 on a blended basis. As we look out, our expectation was you probably get to the point where it actually flips to positive sometime later this year, not sure on the timing at this point, it's really dependent on the continuation of job growth and new lease-ups having rational pricing. But we do see a point of time later this year where we would expect the blend and especially on the new side to be better than it was at same time last year.","Austin Wurschmidt","So it's fair to say I think last quarter you said you expected blended lease rate growth of 3% to 4%, you guys put up 2.5 in the first quarter, so that as well should accelerate through the year or I guess the spread between new and renewal lease rate should converge?","Jerry Davis","Absolutely, when you look at April for example and this is through the first 24 days. Our new lease rate growth was up to 2.2% compared to the 0.3 that we had for the first quarter and that's normal seasonality that's in play. And we would expect that 2.2 to continue to grow through at least the next four to six months. And then once we get to 4Q, you will have the seasonality kick in and take it back down a bit. Our renewal growth so far in April for the total same-store pool is it 5.3% compared to the 4.9% in the first quarter. You won't see a continuation most likely of renewal growth continuing to rise. Our expectation would be for the next three to six months that it's probably going to be in that five range, maybe high fours, but you should see the new continue to come up and if typical seasonality happens and I'm not saying it will because it definitely didn\u2019t last year, you typically get to a point, call it July and August where new comes fairly close to renewal.","Austin Wurschmidt","Could use round out and go ahead and give us occupancy I guess for April and then what you're asking for May on renewals.","Jerry Davis","Occupancy today is just under 97% call it 96.95 as a company and what we're sending out for May again is right around that but what we're achieving now is right around that 5 to 5.3 range, non-renewals.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then last one from me, you mentioned some starting to see stabilization in San Francisco. And I was wondering if you could just marry the recent slowdown we've seen in job growth across several of the West Coast markets with the demand or traffic that you're seeing across the market and in your property specifically?","Jerry Davis","Yeah, traffic has continued to be good in all of the West Coast markets. [indiscernible] right now is probably a bit slower and just a hair weaker than we would have hoped for especially down in Orange County, we're feeling it, I think that's more in the job side than the supply side. LA, where our same-store pool is, out Marina del Rey is doing fine, there's a lot of job growth out there on limited new supply downtown, is very difficult though. San Francisco, I\u2019ll tell you what I heard last week is, you're starting to see a few more - a little more activity from the start ups with some job growth, which is helping to stabilize Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley also this year is expected to have less new supply in most of it is going to hit in the first half, but today it doesn't feel that bad.","And then the one I did mention it earlier when Nick asked, but the one that\u2019s really come on and I know it\u2019s a concern for a lot of people when we put out our update a few months ago is Seattle. Seattle is very strong today for us. We had new lease rate growth of 0.9% in the first quarter. So far in April it's over 6%. So you seen that market really accelerated throughout the first quarter especially starting in March and then it really jumped up this past month. So, I think Seattle is one that, while you have to keep your eye on new supply specially downtown, most of our portfolio is out in Bellevue, we actually have no same-store properties in Downtown Seattle, but we're pretty encouraged over there. And you're seeing job relocations going out to Bellevue whether it's Salesforce, Amazon, Apple has been looking out there. So we're pretty pumped on the east side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Babin","A question for Jerry, you mentioned that in San Francisco and New York you are not seeing much direct competition in your property so far this year. Do you anticipate that there will any at any point, any properties kind of delivering as the year goes on that might impact this?","Jerry Davis","Yeah, we actually, you know, we've really started looking at how much traffic is going to come out at us within a mile of our properties. And when you look at it you're going to have about 3,500 units that are within a mile of us in New York City. So a lot of that about half of it's going to hit us in the first half, half in the second half, but it's typically at a higher rent and higher price point for example in New York, you've got the Copper Building right next to View 34, but the rest they're asking are quite a bit higher than us and the size of the units it's quite a bit smaller. So while there is supply and we think it will affect us that's probably the most direct, they just started to lease up that property, gosh probably about three or four weeks ago. So we're going to have to see how that one plays out, but it probably won't help us. I think long term it will because it's going to bring more detail. And then in San Francisco, direct supply coming at us within a mile of our location is about 1,500 units this year. The good part about San Jose is most of it is going to deliver in the first half of the year and San Francisco about 40% comes in the first half of the year. So won't feel a little bit and again I just remember on both of those markets about 20% of our units reprice and while we're encouraged with how we\u2019ve done. There's still they can move quickly, but right now from what we're seeing, I probably feel more optimistic on San Francisco and a little more cautious on New York.","Drew Babin","And then on the MetLife JV, I was just curious, the year-over-year NOI growth of 60 bps in 1Q, is that sort of a rate that we should model consistently for the rest of year or do you expect that pick up some?","Jerry Davis","I think it\u2019s going to pick up some. I think if I remember correctly on the expense side, we have some real estate tax issues that hurt us on the expense side. But when you look at the revenue, which was up 1.7, it's quite a bit below our same-store 4.6 and that one it's probably going to improve somewhat but you do have very high end assets in a couple of sub-markets that are significantly impacted by new supply, whether it's the Upper West side of New York, Downtown Austin, places like that are helping to suppress that. So I think the revenue growth will improve and I think the expense growth will improve, but it's still going to have NOI growth that's less than our same store.","Drew Babin","And then finally, with the debt paydown in 1Q, I noticed kind of a proportionate pickup in your expectations for capital markets activity I think including dispositions. If you were to sell more properties, kind of what is that next tranche properties that you may look to sell, whether it would be by market or type of asset anyway which are classified.","Jerry Davis","Yeah Drew, just to clarify in terms of the increase in sources, so you're right we did pay down 98 million of secured debt. The increase in sources is not necessarily specifically related to dispositions, it's additional debt issuance dispositions and\/or equity. So just to clarify on that and then Harry will take the rest of that in terms of where we'd be looking to sell from.","Harry Alcock","This is Harry, as Joe mentioned in this prepared remarks we've got three of these - three of these assets that are coming up for a capital event, one is Steele Creek in Denver, one is [indiscernible] Seattle which is a Wolff portfolio deal and one is property LA in Anaheim which is another Wolff deal. It's conceivable that will be and that source as Joe mentioned so that could potentially increase our sales for the year. In terms of other sales we haven't changed, our expectations for the amount of sales for the balance of the year normally, we sort of changed nor finalized really our other properties we intend to sell for the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower from Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hightower","So I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions pertaining to the west coast, it doesn't really apply the whole portfolio. Just wondering if you materially any of the direction changed your assumptions on job growth or perhaps the cadence of supply growth and when deliveries happen across the different markets maybe that don't evidently show up in the fact that guidance wasn\u2019t changed.","Jerry Davis","Yeah. I don't think it's material. I think one thing we\u2019ve seen is from our third party data providers is a little bit of slippage from 1Q to 2Q on some of the deliveries. So it's a little more back half loaded than front half loaded. When you look at the job growth, we've built our forecast assuming between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs per month. Today, we're at about 180,000 so that seems to be fairly inline. But no, I think other than a little bit of slippage from 1Q to 2Q, that's about it.","Rich Hightower","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just a little bit bigger picture question here, I mean as you look at multifamily NOI trend across different cycles, I think that the trough in many cases were lower than where it appears that the industry is going today, I mean, would you say that the industry generally or at least with the market that you guys are invested in, I mean would you say that the glide path is a lot smoother in terms of what the downturn could look like, just given that supply dynamic, that demand dynamic that you're currently forecasting, how do you think about it relative to history?","Tom Toomey","Rich, this is Toomey. From a lens perspective of time, I'd say, I've been at it since the 80s and the number one thing that usually kills off our revenue growth is supply. And even in a recessions, the Bs generally hold up in the face of economic downturn. So on the supply picture, what I've seen over the last decade is more transparency on information about individual markets, individual price points, lenders using that data and turning their spigot on and off and shutting off supply pretty darn quickly as well as the Fannie and Freddie shops looking at those same numbers and adjusting their spreads with respect to permanent financing. ","So I think what's happened is we've finally moved to enough transparency that the threat of oversupply seems to be quickly shut down before it gained so much momentum that we go negative. And there's just recent example in DC, 09-010, it was a market that was, everybody was piling in to build on, it was generating jobs, it got oversupply. It never went negative and that's because they were able to cut it off quick enough on new supply to shut that down. So I would always think about this transparency has probably provided us and taken out a lot of those high volatile years that we've had in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Juan Sanabria","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just a quick question with regards to supply to Rich\u2019s question, you mentioned some slippage from the first to the second quarter, could you give us any color as to what markets those are and does that change anything in terms of the trajectory of the better than expected results to date?","Joe Fisher","Yeah. Hey Juan, this is Joe. So just to clarify, first quarter to second quarter is actually first half to second half. So when we\u2019re originally looking at supply coming through this year, we had deliveries penciling in at about, call it 52%, 53% of full year coming in the first half. That's closer to about 46% on the numbers that we're seeing today. So you have seen a shift over to the second half, most of that being due to labor and I would say that the labor issue that we're seeing is really throughout the country. It is not necessarily market specific. So in terms of market specifics, as to where we're seeing that shift take place, there isn't one market that sticks out as being a more first half, more second half in terms of what our original expectations were. So no clear trend there.","Juan Sanabria","And just following up on that supply question, we've seen the national kind of permit numbers continue to be up 20 plus percent on a trailing 12-month basis, I mean, how should investors get comfort that supply isn\u2019t going to continue to be pretty elevated, just given the permitting data, is it just a question of just the buildings won\u2019t get built, because it won\u2019t get the financing necessary or how are you guys thinking about that?","Joe Fisher","Yeah. I think we've taken a look at it from two different perspectives. There's the quantitative aspect, some of what you alluded to and then the qualitative aspect. So from a quantitative perspective, you're correct that permits have remained stubbornly higher over the last six months. That said when we've gone back and looked at what the typical ratio is of deliveries to permits on a lag basis, it's about 85% and when we overlaid that with the availability of credit, that does oscillate a little bit. ","So to Harry's comments earlier in terms of seeing credit become more constrained for developers, seeing proceeds come down, seeing cost go up and then difficulty in terms of getting labor in the market, we do think that there's going to be a reduction in that ratio from a historical perspective. The qualitative aspect comes into discussions that we're having with private developers in terms of the amount of sights that they're sitting on today, what their starts were last year versus their starts that they expect this year. That continues to tilt us towards the belief that starts activity will come down and not necessarily mirror the permit activity, but you're correct it has remained high and we're going to continue to keep an eye on it.","Juan Sanabria","Great. And just one last question for me. In terms of turnover, you guys have done a great job reducing that and kind of boosting occupancy, any ability to kind of maybe not be quite as conservative and pushing and not pushing rate and letting turnover climb up and driving pricing more aggressively or still kind of too tenuous to do that at this point in time.","Jerry Davis","This is Jerry. I guess I\u2019d start with, I think while our turnover come down and our occupancy has gone up, I don't think [indiscernible] I would just ask you as our competitors report just do a comparison. What we've done is create some teams here in our corporate office that have worked very hard over the last year to reach out to residents that have given notice to try to save them frequently, you have to -- you don\u2019t have to give them a reduced rate. Sometimes, you have to come down a little bit, but they've helped drive that turnover rate down more than anything. ","And I think when you look at it too, when you look at the delta between when a renewal comes in at and a new lease comes in at, over a year, it's probably going to be at least 200 basis points if this year holds true for what's happened over the last five or six years. If you look at the first quarter, the delta was more like 500 basis point. So it's definitely advantageous on the revenue side plus on the NOI and AFFO because you're not having to turn the unit, you're not having to come up with recurring CapEx to save as many residents as you can. ","And in addition to that, I can tell you we've put much more of a focus over the last two to three years on our customer satisfaction ratings and I think that's helped also. So I think it's a combination of all those things, but again I do not think we're sitting here making the trade of late for occupancy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good afternoon. Just two questions. First, Joe, now that you\u2019ve been there for a few months, what are the things that\u2019s interesting about UDR as you guys have some top same-store metrics and yet, your earnings growth is sort of in line with peers? So to that end, do you think that you'll start to combine and just publish one same store metric that includes both the wholly owned and share of JVs, so that way, we get a better sense to a line the same store metrics with earnings growth. Or is there something now that you've been there for a few months that you see that in the P&L or somewhere that\u2019s causing that slippage between same store and earnings growth.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Alex. So in response I guess to the JV, same store and whether or not we\u2019ll do a full pro forma same store, I think the approach that we've taken in the past is that we do not have complete operational control of those joint venture assets. We operate those in conjunction with MetLife. So until we have 100% control of those assets, the intent is not to put them in to same store. Clearly back in attachment 12a, we provide the detail as to what the same store impact is for those specific pools and then Jerry mentioned in his script in terms of what the impact overall is to the portfolio. ","So I think we're providing quite a bit of transparency on that front. In terms of the translation of same store NOI down to the bottom line, there really hasn't been anything that I can speak to specifically. In the quarter, I think we had a couple of questions as to you guys looked pretty good on the same store rev and NOI line. We ended up at $0.45, in line with the midpoint of what we\u2019ve guided to in first quarter. It was really just due to a couple of things. ","As you mentioned, the JV piece of the portfolio, Met coming in maybe a little bit below expectations. From a G&A perspective, it ran a little bit heavier than we expected, really just due to timing issues as it relates to payroll taxes and healthcare. And then the other piece probably, just from a development redev and earn-in, we would expect that to ramp throughout the year. So now what we did do very well on the same store side coming to the midpoint of FFO, I think I walked you through the disconnect there.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then on the development side, there is the regulators came down in December 15 to say, hey, thanks to appearing back on multi-family and then we heard recently from speaking to some private developers that it really didn't have an impact until last summer, given deals that were already in the pipeline. Again as one of the earlier questions alluded to or said, we haven't really seen a drop in supply. So for all the talk that we give to banks curtailing construction lending and hasn\u2019t really seem to have an impact, so what do you think is the disconnect there? Do you think that banks aren\u2019t dialing back on their construction lending and therefore that\u2019s why supply hasn\u2019t come down or do you think that is just taking an incredibly long time and therefore now it\u2019s taking a hit where we will start to see supply come down?","Harry Alcock","Alex, this is Harry. I'll start and then Joe may want to fill in. He talked about this just a few minutes ago in the last answer that we're still seeing elevated permit activity. Well first of all, the deliveries that we're seeing in \u201918 are projects started at \u201916. So that has -- the sort of current financing environment was not in place two years ago when those assets started. Second as we look forward, while we see elevated permit activity with not just the sort of financing market that has become more difficult, but also these deals are getting a little bit harder to pencil. ","We have decelerating revenue growth, you have increasing costs, you're just not -- you're simply not going to see as many deals penciled as you would have two or three or four years ago. So all of that leads us to believe that permit activity appears to be high today that the likely number of starts is going to tilt towards the lower end of the range relative to historical levels. So we do expect development pipelines to shrink and starts in 2017 to flow from levels of last two to three years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Hey, guys. Congrats on a good start to the year. Just had a couple of questions, at the outset of the Q&A, there was some discussion about jobs and specifically I think there was an example given how there has been some decent job growth in [indiscernible] which helped drive some of the performance in the Dallas area. Curious how are you thinking about job growth now, obviously I think job growth caught some people off-guard, heading into this time last year. Could you just give us some comments on job growth overall and maybe some markets where you're seeing more job growth more than others? I know you mentioned a couple previously.","Joe Fisher","Yeah. Hey, Rich. This is Joe. So I wouldn't say that our expectations or forecast for job growth has materially changed from what we put out when we put out the three year plan a couple of months ago. At that point in time, we were looking for that 150,000 to 200,000 type of range. In terms of the segmentation of that, the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic were going to be a little bit lower. So there's a little bit more de-sell there. Sunbelt, both Southeast and Southwest were expected to be higher, however, I\u2019d say the deceleration there is probably a little bit more on a relative basis than what we've seen, but they're coming off a very high March, meaning the Orlandos, Tampas, Dallass, up in the high threes, low fours, on year-over-year growth. ","They're coming off of very high levels at this point. So I don't think there's really been a material change in expectations. We continue to be positively biased towards taking place from a tax reform deregulation perspective, but we haven't taken that into our underwriting. We don't see it on the ground necessarily today, but the improved consumer confidence, business confidence, CEO confidence gives us some positive bias towards the future in terms of sustaining job growth.","Tom Toomey","Rich, I might add. You've got to stop from a length of time and think that we've gone through eight plus years of kind of a heavy regulatory environment that really if you will, business was retarded and developing and expanding and now you're arriving at, you had an incomplete legislative agenda around taxes, infrastructure and pulling back that regulatory envelope. And so the question you've got to just ask is we did pretty damn good in eight years of good steady growth, and yet, it was done in the face of those challenges, what will the next four plus years hold if you start pulling back some of those type of [Technical Difficulty]. ","So while the numbers are averaging out right in our range, I'm kind of optimistic, but I do live with kind of a glass half full and believe that when we finally get some legislative action, we'll see some more robust numbers starting to be produced across the entire spectrum, but what matters to us is our markets, our price point of our individual communities and how they interact with that job number. So the global -- overall US number is one thing, the global number is another. But we're really trying to run our business community by community and look at the impact and we feel pretty damn good about it.","Rich Hill","Yeah. Of course. And what I was trying to get at really for the most part was what's driving what seems to be some pretty impressive growth in the fourth and the first quarter and what seems to be some optimism, whether it's shops or supply and it seems like jobs are remaining steady and it\u2019s really just the supply coming down, which I think we've all been expecting. Is that fair?","Joe Fisher","Yeah. I think that's a good summary.","Rich Hill","Good. And then going hand-in-hand with that, I'm just curious, obviously first quarter was good and your commentary seems to be pretty optimistic. What would give you guys the comfort to actually take that formal step and maybe increase guidance. Is it really getting through the spring and summer time and making sure that the strong leasing seasons aren\u2019t back strong.","Joe Fisher","Absolutely. In our prepared remarks, we said we had good momentum. We were just looking for a little bit more progress into the prime leasing season to see some traction.","Rich Hill","Got it. Helpful. And then one final thing from me. On the lenders side, are you seeing any of alternative lenders, especially finance companies become more active in the multi-family space. I obviously keep hearing about banks crawling back, but I am hearing more and more about alternative lenders getting involved. So I was curious if you're seeing that on the ground.","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey. Certainly, we are, Rich. When there is a need there, market price is that opportunity, but what we're finding is that's pricing pretty expensively compared to traditional normal lending patterns. And as a result as Harry alluded to, that's causing everybody to have to repent so their deals and it's scraping some of them off the to-do list and they're not going to get done. But there is capital out there at the price. There always will be. The price is so deep that it's really putting a lid on it and I always expect the markets to work that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Malkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, Jerry, you talked about the blended spread kind of getting back in line or even possibly above last year's numbers later in the year. I guess, what gives you confidence in that, because the numbers we\u2019re looking at for supply actually, we see it accelerating into the back half of the year and then still remaining elevated in to the first half of next year. So I mean is it, are you thinking deliveries will keep getting pushed off or jobs will start to pick up once more regulatory legislation is enacted. What gives you confidence in that?","Joe Fisher","Well, I think it is the expectation that job growth continues to come in at the levels, well, I just think it's naturally going to grow to that level. I don't see people pointing to single family home. But yeah, I think it is predominately what you said. You really just have easy comps as you get to the back half of this year that I think are very beatable and when we look at inflate rates today and the expectation of where we're going to reprice unit the year progresses, it just looks to us like that's the direction it's going.","Tom Toomey","Neil, this is Toomey. I\u2019d also add, you have to look at where that aggregate number of supply is coming. It's shifted out of the urban corridors and has moved more predominately to the Sunbelt markets where the number of doors built for the relative cost per home can be expanded, but you're going to see markets like Phoenix, Dallas, Austin, Florida markets start to elevate their supply pictures and that's away from the urban cores that we have a lot of exposure to today. So we're getting talking about the supply picture as it relates to our portfolio and not so much on the aggregates because that\u2019s shifting away from our competitive set.","Neil Malkin","Okay. Thanks for the color guys. And then also next would be LA. I know that you guys last year had a large development leasing that was hindering your performance there and I guess the first quarter started off I guess a little bit weaker than I thought, just given that competition. Is that something that\u2019s really going to pick up more in the second half of the year or I guess we\u2019ll see more in the peak leasing season of 2Q and 3Q, how should we kind of look at that?","Tom Toomey","Yeah. That\u2019s a good point. You\u2019re right. We did it by competition in play of Vista last year, because most of our portfolio was in Marina Del Rey. It kind of subsided, but when you really look at it, my new lease rate growth in the first quarter was 2.1% in LA compared to 0.3% for the entire company. So it was way above the company average. When you look at the revenue growth, I just remember revenue growth is based on the rate growth you\u2019ve got over the past four quarters as well as any change in occupancy and when I look back to the first, second and third quarter of last year, I was going to head to head against that lease up and I had pretty minimal new and renewal rate growth. ","So now that that's behind me, you should see an acceleration of new and renewal rate growth and I can tell you, even as I look in the month of April, we're at 2.8% on new compared to 2.1 and my renewal growth in April is 5.6 and it was 4.6 in the first quarter. But you should see as each quarter marches on this year that my year-over-year revenue growth should continue to improve from where it is today.","Neil Malkin","Okay, great. I appreciate that. And then I guess last from me is, can you guys quantify the remaining amount of 421a tax abatement burnoff left to go?","Joe Fisher","Hey, Neil. This is Joe. So as we footnote on attachment 6, you can see down there at the bottom in the first quarter, we had $233,000 impact on a year-over-year basis. It\u2019s about 130 basis point impact on real estate taxes. Overall, the expense impact around 40 basis points in terms of NOI impact fairly de minimis, I\u2019d call 15 to 20 basis points. For all of 2017, we think the impact is going to be about 1.2 million or 160 basis points of real estate tax increase. If you look at NOI, again it's only about 20 basis points impact for the full year. ","So fairly de minimis, we continue to provide the disclosure on it just because we get questions on it, but as when we went through the two year outlook, we then provide the guidance on that, given the size and nature of it and so probably don't intend to provide any additional guidance in terms of 18 and beyond at this point, but it is a fairly minimal amount overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. A follow up on the developer capital program. Between preferred equity and participating loans, the total portfolio size and total pipeline size is just under 700 million. Over the next two years, is that number, does the size of that portfolio go down meaningfully stable or trend higher?","Joe Fisher","Hey, John. It\u2019s Joe. Developer capital program, we kind of look at it in conjunction with overall capital uses. So there's a couple of constraints that we place on ourselves related to that. One is we and the board take a look at three year capital plans in terms of as worst case scenario, what's going to happen if capital sources drive completely, do we have the ability to fund the committed development pipeline, committed developer capital program and debt maturities. So we have that constraint. ","In terms of annual usage of capital, we\u2019ve typically talked to $300 million to $400 million per year of development spend. That's what we think we can efficiently raise through free cash flow and dispositions. So we have that constraint as well and then developer capital could basically end up competing with development. Harry\u2019s team takes a look at where they can find the best the best risk adjusted returns and they\u2019ll place the capital there. So it's not a goal of increasing developer capital program, it's really having two different pieces of the business compete with each other. ","We're going to continue to look for developments going forward, but it does look like that pipeline is going to be reduced slightly over the near term. And then you look at developer capital, we mentioned that we are going to tilt toward sources in terms of the upcoming options that we have. I think you should expect that we're going to continue to look for ways to reinvest that into similar types of structures. So the goal is not to necessarily grow that pipeline to a certain size or to have too much earnings exposure to one piece of the business, but I think that piece of the business today probably is an outsized returns relative to the risk. So it probably grows incrementally over the next couple of quarters.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thanks. And then Harry, it's been about a year or so after you've closed on the Home DC acquisition and I believe you underwrote a 5.2% year one cap rate. Can you give some color on how revenue and expenses have trended on the acquired properties and how actual performance compares as a 5.2% underwritten?","Jerry Davis","Yeah, John. This is Jerry. I'll go and answer that. We came in very close to that 5.3, I think we're in a 5.25, 5.3, so it\u2019s right about there. Probably, we\u2019re a bit behind on the revenue, but we were ahead on the expenses. Really we found more efficiency on the operating side.","John Pawlowski","Okay. As you\u2019re said the miss or the slight miss on the revenue was market rent growth or just less juice to squeeze on the home properties?","Jerry Davis","It was probably a bit on the market rent growth. I don't think it was the juice and the other thing is when you take over a portfolio of that size, you've got to culturally get that entire team to buy into your way of doing things and over that first year, we probably transitioned out 50% to 60% of the associates there. So there was a bit of a churn on the people side. So I would expect you'll continue to see some of the juice come from that deal over the next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the disparity between your owned and JV same store growth. I think Joe alluded to not having full control of the MetLife JV. And I'm just wondering if you actually manage the leasing process differently in the joint venture, for instance on your own assets that you trade wafer occupancy and I\u2019m wondering if you do the same for the MetLife JV?","Jerry Davis","Yeah. This is Jerry. We actually manage them very similarly. It's really -- we do get input from our partners on it, but when you look at the occupancy rate on the Met deals versus the whole-owned, they run probably 50 basis points lower than the wholly-owned and when you look at the delta between what occupancy was same time this year versus last year, that is actually up 80 bps year over year compared to 50 bps for the same store. The biggest difference in addition to having some input on whether it's revenue enhancing spend or a few other operational thing, it's really the quality and the location of those assets. ","Those are A plus deals typically. Very frequently in urban locations that are competing more head to head against new supply and again when I think about where they\u2019re at, it\u2019s downtown LA, it\u2019s downtown Seattle, it's downtown Austin, it\u2019s Upper West Side of New York. So it's really more of a competition versus new supply and it's all a product. When you look at our same store pool, our same store is 50-50 AB, Bs continue to outperform As. It\u2019s compressing, right now but it's still probably 80 basis points. So I would say it's more those factors.","Joe Fisher","John, this is Joe. Maybe just one follow-up related to that just to kind of put our same store in perspective because we do get some question on this. Same store overall for us represents about 80% of our total NOI and so we took a look at where we kind of stacked up versus peers and we actually found as of 4Q, the peers on averaged at about 79%. So while we get questions on what's in same store, what's not in same store as well as the MetLife is we do have a same store pool that is very commensurate with the peers at today.","John Kim","Thanks. Can you remind us how often your future same store pool?","Jerry Davis","We do it quarterly. Property has to have been in the same store or we've got a definition of it in supplement, on page 16 of our supplement, but we do update it quarterly, but the guidance we give is based on the properties that are in the same store pool as of the first quarter of each year. And the only addition to the same store pool throughout the year, so you\u2019ll have a different pool in quarterly metrics versus full year. We have one addition that\u2019s coming in in the second quarter and that is the sixth asset of the home portfolio that we bought.","John Kim","Okay. And then can I ask what your official view is on Airbnb. I know how some of your competitors feel about it, but as far as whether or not you encourage within your portfolio.","Jerry Davis","We do not encourage it. We attempt to deter it when we find out Airbnb is happening in our properties, we serve the resident notice, it is a lease violation. We feel strongly that the majority of residents want full time renters as their neighbors and they'd like that we do a criminal background check on everybody that lives in our properties.","John Kim","Do you have an estimate as to what percentage of your residents use Airbnb?","Jerry Davis","No. I mean it's very minimal and again when we find out about it, whether it's from us looking or their neighbors telling them, it's minimal.

(Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, Sir.","Chris Van Ens","","Thank you for joining us for UDR's fourth quarter financial results conference call.  Our fourth quarter press release supplemental disclosure package and three-year strategy overview document were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.UDR.com.  In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial Reg G. requirements.  ","Prior to reading our Safe Harbor disclosure, I would like to direct you to the webcast of this call located in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.UDR.com.  The webcast includes a slide presentation that will accompany our three-year strategic outlook commentary.  ","Onto our Safe Harbor. I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.  A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC.  We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups.  Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.  ","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.  Welcome to UDR's fourth quarter conference call.  On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations who will discuss our results as well as our senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.  ","To start, I would like to officially welcome Tom Herzog to UDR's senior management team.  Many of you listening to the call know Tom.  He is a well-respected CFO who possesses a strong analytical skill set and valuable public REIT experience with two S&P 500 REITs.  I am confident that his experience will be beneficial to the company over the coming years.  ","My prepared remarks today will be brief as the majority of my comments will be included in our overview of our three-year strategic outlook, which will directly follow senior management's quarterly and full-year prepared remarks.  ","2012 was another strong year of operating results and we are encouraged by the early trends that we see in 2013.  Let me quickly review why the company is well-positioned and how we will continue to capitalize on good multi-family fundamentals over the years ahead.","First, the heavy lifting with regards to our large-scale portfolio repositioning is complete.  Like most every public REIT, we will continue to see some level of capital recycling completed on an annual basis.  But any such actions will be conducted through normal business activities.  ","Second, our balance sheet is much improved.  But we will continue to manage the lower leverage over time.  In our three-year strategic outlook, we will speak to leverage targets.  ","Third, we have a topnotch operational platform and a team that we believe will continue to take full advantage of the positive multi-family fundamentals currently available to us.  ","Finally, we have $1.3 billion of NAV accretive development and redevelopment underway.  50% of this pipeline is currently funded.  And 49% will be delivered by the year-end, 2013.  These activities are expected to begin contributing to our bottom line later this year.  And will generate stronger cash flow growth in 2014 and '15.  ","In the fourth quarter, we were presented with a challenge related to Hurricane Sandy.  However, we were able to successfully navigate these difficulties thanks to the hard work and professionalism of our New York team.  We do not believe the storm will have any long-term negative impact on the demand for our Manhattan communities or their valuations.  Tom Herzog will delve into more detail in the accounting treatment of Sandy.  While Jerry will discuss the pre and post Sandy New York operating trends in the respective prepared remarks.","Overall, we were pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results.  ","Finally, with the closing of 2012, the entire management team would like to thank our 1,600 associates for another outstanding year.  The outlook for UDR remains bright.  And we look forward to continued success.  ","With that, I will pass the call over to Tom Herzog.","Tom Herzog","","Thanks, Tom.  ","Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to express how good it is to be back in the public REIT world and specifically here at UDR.  For those of you I have not yet had the opportunity to reconnect or meet, I look forward to interacting with you in the near future.  ","There are several topics I will cover today.  First, changes we have made to our presentation of FFO.  Second, our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 FFO results.  Third, our transactions and balance sheet update.  Fourth, details regarding the accounting treatment of Hurricane Sandy.  Fifth, our first quarter and full-year 2013 guidance.  And lastly, enhancements we made to our quarterly supplemental package.  ","Let me begin with the changes we have made to our presentation of FFO.  Effective this quarter and going forward, we will be presenting FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO.  We will also be guiding the all three of these earnings metrics on a quarterly basis.  Unlike our historical presentation, FFO as defined by NAREIT will now be our lead-in metric.  And will reconcile the FFO as adjusted, which is equivalent to our previous core FFO.  The adjustments for reconcile from FFO to FFO as adjusted will clearly set forth the fully set forth in each of our quarterly releases.  ","In addition, we have commenced reporting AFFO, which reflects our maintenance CapEx reported on attachment 14 or page 25 of our supplement.  ","There are three primary reasons for these changes.  First was to lead with NAREIT FFO and then reconcile through FFO as adjusted and AFFO for full clarity of the components and adjustments to each of these measurements.  ","Second, to provide guidance to each of these three measurements to eliminate confusion as to what is included and excluded from our earnings guidance.  ","Finally, despite inconsistency within the industry, we believe our new presentation more closely reflects that of many of our REIT peers.  ","Turning now to our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results, fourth quarter FFO per share was $0.31.  Excluding Hurricane Sandy charges, which totaled $0.04, FFO as adjusted was $0.35.  And AFFO was $0.31 per share.  Full-year 2012 AFFO was $1.32 per share.  Excluding the adjustment outlined on attachment two or page two of our supplement, FFO as adjusted was $1.35 per share, 5.5% higher than in 2011.  Full year AFFO was $1.18 per share, 10% higher than in 2011.  ","Third, our transactions and balance sheet.  As previously discussed, we completed a swap of ownership interests in certain UDR MetLife I JV operating assets and land parcels in the fourth quarter.  Details are included in our quarterly press release.  ","At year end, our financial leverage on a historical cost basis was 39%.  On a market value basis, it was approximately 32%.  Our net debt to EBITDA was 7.0 times.  And we are comfortably inside of all of our credit agreements and note covenants.  We ended the quarter with $913 million of available liquidity per combination of cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facilities.  ","Next, I will address the accounting treatment around Hurricane Sandy.  In the fourth quarter, we recognized a $0.04 charge for Sandy related damages.  As I mentioned earlier, this charge was included in FFO, but excluded from FFO as adjusted.  ","As to the GAAP accounting for Sandy, first, physical damage is accrued in the period event occurred.  Second, cleanup costs are expensed as incurred.  The recognized loss for both of these items is reduced by the estimated insurance reimbursement.  Third, business interruption losses are recognized as they occur.  Whereas the recovery of business interruption losses are recognized when repayment is received or assured.  ","Due to the inherent uncertainty in the recovery of any natural disaster claims, we conservatively accrued a charge of $0.04.  $0.02 of which is equivalent to 25% of the physical damage and cleanup costs.  And $0.02 attributable to business interruptions.  Any subsequent insurance recoveries from this fourth quarter 2012 charges that differ from the accrual will continue to be excluded from FFO as adjusted. ","Business interruption losses incurred in 2013 will inherently have less certainty of measurement.  Accordingly, we will not add back such losses to FFO as adjusted.  And subsequent business interruption recoveries will be included in FFO as adjusted when received to offset prior business interruption losses recognized in the run-rate.  ","So how does all this affect same-store results?  Business interruption losses that consist of rent rebates to reimburse residents during the period the buildings were uninhabitable will be reported within hurricane related charges in the income statement.  The related rents were contractually receivable and will remain in rental income so that same-store sales will not be disrupted by this item.  This treatment has no net impact to our P&L or FFO.  As a result of lower occupancy due to the inability to lease apartments when the building was down, we have decided to delay 95 Wall's entry into our same-store pool until the second quarter of 2014 so as not to distort our New York same-store 2013 results.  ","Onto 2013 guidance, our 2013 FFO guidance is $1.35 to $1.41 per share.  We're expecting $0.02 of our (RA-3) gains from property sales, which results in FFO as adjusted of $1.33 to $1.39 per share, or an increase of 1% at the midpoint versus 2012.  ","Our 2013 AFFO guidance is $1.17 to $1.23 per share.  This includes $1,020 per door of maintenance CapEx per stabilized home.  We anticipate same-store revenue growth of 4% to 5%, same-store expense growth of 2.75% to 3.25%, and same-store growth of 4.25% to 6%.  Other primary assumptions can be found on attachment 15 or page 26 of our supplement.  ","You will also notice we now provide quarterly guidance.  In the first quarter of 2013, both FFO and AFFO as adjusted guidance are at $0.31 to $0.33 per share.  Our AFFO guidance is $0.27 to $0.29 per share.  Our 2013 FFO as adjusted guidance is only $0.01 higher than last year.  The primary drivers of this low FFO growth includes several items that offset our forecasted 2013 organic [inaudible] growth, which is expected to provide $0.10 contribution to FFO.  The offsetting items include $0.035 increase in FFO drag related to our expanded development and redevelopment pipeline, $0.03 from the 2012 and projected 2013 sales of high cap rate properties in non-core markets, $0.01 of dilution in 2013 from our May, 2012 repayment of debt with equity proceeds, as well as a net $0.01 related to miscellaneous other items.  ","Finally, we made numerous enhancements to our quarterly supplemental document, including how we categorize our NOI, additional data on our redevelopments, development and joint venture platforms, and additional same-store operating metrics, such as turnover and lease related growth by market.  ","We recognize that our revised supplement in conjunction with our three year strategy document will likely lead to in-depth modeling questions.  We ask that you hold these questions until after the call when we can walk them through with you individually in greater detail.  We believe you will find our re-tooled supplemental package provides greater transparency and will prove helpful and informative.  ","We have noted that our guidance is lower than many analysts had projected.  In examining these variances as best we can, we observe several drivers to these differences, which include lower interest expense perhaps due to differences in capitalized interest in our development and redevelopment projects and lower G&A perhaps due to confusion relative to the tax provision as presented in our historical financial statements.  We believe our improved supplementals will help reduce confusion in the future.  ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","","Thanks, Tom.  Good morning everyone.  ","In my remarks, I will cover the following topics.  Fourth quarter and full year 2012 operating results, an update on our non-mature pool of assets, and lastly, an update on our New York operations.  ","We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results.  In the fourth quarter, same-store net operating income grew 7.3% driven by a 5.7% year-over-year increase in revenue and only a 2.3% increase in expenses.  A quite note, on attachment six or page eight, our revised quarterly supplemental package, you will find a breakout of same-store operating expenses with year-over-year sequential and year-to-date comparisons by expense component.  ","Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 5% year-over-year to $1,420.  While same-store occupancy increased by 60 basis points to 95.8%.  ","On a total portfolio basis including our pro-rata share of JVs, our revenue per occupied home was $1,558.  ","Sequentially, fourth quarter net operating income increased 3.3% driven by a 0.7% increase in revenue and expense growth of -4.7%.  ","Before I discuss new and renewal lease growth trends, I would like to direct everyone to attachment 8G on page 19, a new addition to our supplemental quarterly package.  8G provides new and renewal lease growth as well as turnover by market.  In the fourth quarter, effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities increased by 1.7% on average.  And renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.6%.  ","Full year turnover in 2012 increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 55%.  This was a function of our ongoing push to optimize revenue growth through the seasonally stronger demand periods earlier in the year.  ","In the fourth quarter, annualized turnover reverse course declined by 40 basis points year-over-year.  We elected to hold occupancy higher during this seasonally slower period by pricing our renewal increase slightly less aggressively, which yielded dividends and positioned us for strong lease growth in 2013.  ","Attachment five or page seven of our quarterly supplemental package has some changes that I would like to briefly review.  You will notice that we have added an NOI bucket title stabilized non-mature.  Only non-stabilized communities are now included in our acquisition, development, and redevelopment NOI buckets.  We also broke out our non-residential and other, which includes commercial NOI.  For more information on how we define our respective NOI buckets and what types of communities are included in each, I will refer you to attachment 16 on pages 27 to 29 of our quarterly supplemental package.  ","Our stabilized non-mature communities account for 47% of our total non-same-store NOI excluding JVs. And are primarily located in our core markets.  These communities posted sequential revenue growth of 0.8%, ten basis points better than our same-store portfolio.  And NOI growth was 5.1%, which was 180 basis points better.  ","Moving onto New York and the effects of Hurricane Sandy, as Tom Herzog indicated in his remarks, we have decided to delay 95 Wall's entry into our same-store pool until the second quarter of 2014 as a result of the hurricane.  ","21Chelsea will still enter our same-store results in the first quarter of 2013 as it was only minimally affected.  10 Hanover Square, our other downtown Manhattan community will remain in our same-store pool as it was also minimally affected aside from the rent rebates we gave while it was uninhabitable for two to three weeks.  ","Before I review fourth quarter leasing trends in New York, I would like to address any potential long-term negative ramifications to downtown property values.  It is still early in the process.  But we do not see any long term value impairment.  Our resident's property was not damaged by the storm.  And leasing activity is following the normal seasonal patterns.  People still want to live in lower Manhattan.  ","Let me address where we stand today versus before Sandy from an occupancy and lease rate perspectives at our New York properties.  First 10 Hanover with 493 homes, our pre-Sandy occupancy was 98%.  And our current occupancy is comparable.  Blended lease rate growth is also comparable to pre-Sandy levels.  ","Second, 95 Wall with 508 homes, our pre-Sandy occupancy was 96%.  And our current occupancy is 92%.  95 Wall was the community most affected by Sandy.  Blended lease rate growth still has some room to run before it returns to pre-Sandy levels.  However, we are making progress on refilling the building.  And would expect business as usual by the end of the second quarter.  ","Third, Rivergate with 706 homes, our pre-Sandy occupancy was 93%.  And our current occupancy is 88%.  This decline was partially driven by our redevelopment program.  When Sandy hit, we had a certain number of units being redeveloped.  Our crews could not work on these units for the weeks when Rivergate was uninhabitable.  In the meantime, we had already sent out notices prior to Sandy to free up the next batch of homes to be redeveloped.  Those residents vacated when Rivergate became habitable again.  This gave us an abnormally large number of homes in redevelopment, which negatively affected occupancy.  Blended lease rate growth has not yet returned to pre-hurricane levels at Rivergate.  But we have also not had many redeveloped homes come back online since the storm hit.  We expect improved lease rate growth by the end of the first quarter.  To reiterate, we believe that we will be back to pre-hurricane occupancy and lease rate levels by the end of the second quarter in New York.  ","I'll not turn the call back over to Tom Toomey.  ","Tom Toomey \u2013 President and CEO","","Thanks Jerry, and let\u2019s move into the strategic portion of the call, and with that I\u2019d asked that you pull up the link either in the press release, and\/or from our web site as we\u2019re going to go through a PowerPoint presentation page by page with you.","Since announcing our attention to present a three year strategic outlook, we have fielded a number of inquiries as to why. UDR is a very different company than it was three years ago. Our portfolio and balance sheet have undergone major renovations, now that these activities are largely complete, it is prudent to explain where we intend to take the company over the next three years, and why our stock is, and will continue to be a great investment.  With that, let\u2019s begin on page three of the presentation, and quickly review our 2012 highlights.","The large scale aspect for portfolio repositioning are complete. We dramatically reduced our leverage, our balance sheet is in good order, and we remain committed to lower leverage model. We successfully navigated the aftermath of Sandy.  Tom Herzog joined us as our new CFO.  ","Jerry\u2019s operating platform and team continue to post strong results. Our consensus NAV per share was up 4% year-over-year, and our annual dividend per share increased 10%. And we expanded our JV platform and grew our development and redevelopment pipeline.","On page four you will see our strategic priorities. In short, we are focused on allocating capital creatively, further reducing our financial leverage over-time. Growing cash flows to support dividend growth, and incrementally improving the quality and market mix of our portfolio.","As we successfully execute on these strategic items, NAV and dividend growth will follow. Which we expect will drive strong long-term total shareholder return.  ","Let\u2019s first look at capital allocation on page five. At the top of the page you will note our pillars of capital allocation. First; Invest in NAV accretive opportunities, and second; weigh investment opportunities against our leverage metrics and funding alternatives.  ","We have created a significant amount of value, or approximately 450 million through our investments since 2010.  As you can see from the graph in the middle on this page, this is true for your New York City communities as well. ","In addition to the NAV generated by our higher growth portfolio, we anticipate creating roughly 450 million in value through our development and redevelopment growth efforts over the coming years.","Next Tom Herzog, will take you through our view on the balance sheet management on page six.","Tom Herzog \u2013 CFO","","Thank, Tom. As indicated at the top of page six, we look to a wide range of balance sheet metrics, as well as our maturity schedule when considering how to best manage our balance sheet. We are comfortable with the current state of our balance sheet, but importantly we are establishing targets for a balance sheet metrics. ","We tend to manage to leverage of 35 to 40% and target the lower end of this range over time.  However, we will not engage in diluted activities to accomplish our subjective.  On the net debt-to-EBITA basis, we\u2019re managing to 6.0x to 6.5x over time. [Inaudible] for these goals will not be linear.  ","Looking further down the page, you can see how we have dramatically strengthened our balance sheet over the past three years. We remain committed to a lower leverage model, and further improvement in our balance sheet metrics as anticipated by year-end 2015.","One note with regard to our balance sheet metrics this year; it is likely that our metrics will increase in the first half of the year, as we continue to fund our development and redevelopment pipeline.  We anticipate that net debt-to-EBITA will be near 7.5x, and leverage near 40% during the first half of 2013.  After that, our metrics will trend lower at 700 million of current (NOI) below income producing assets begin to cash flow in the second half of 2013, and accelerate in 2014.","Onto page seven, where Jerry will comment on our operations.","Jerry Davis \u2013 SVP, Operations","","Thanks, Tom.  We as a company remain intensely focused on operations.  This is critical because operations drive cash flow, which allows dividend growth.  As you can see, we have generated operating results stack of well versus our multi-family peer group over the past five years.","Some of our out-performances resulted from our first [inaudible] manage with regard to technology initiatives.  Examples include our electronic resident platform, our online portal, and online renewal leasing.  We continue to be big believers in technologies that increase our portfolio efficiencies, and more importantly enhance customer satisfaction. We will continue to invest in this area.","Looking ahead, we expect the top and bottom-line growth will remain robust and drive cash flow through 2015.  Some of this will be the result of new technology, such as online new leasing, as well as advancements that derive greater efficiencies throughout our cost structure.","Turning to page eight, I will discuss our improvement portfolio.  At Toomey spoke to earlier, the heavy lifting with regard to our portfolio repositioning is complete. However, like every [inaudible], we will continue to recycle capital into NAV-accretive opportunities through normal business activities. ","But some level of capital recycling will always be going on. A majority of our current NOI is generated by our target markets in our West, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic Regions. These regions will continue to grow as we deliver our development and redevelopment projects.","Please note, that our expectations for our year-end 2015 NOI concentrations, do not include any capital recycling between now and then, or any further development or redevelopment beyond what is currently started.  As such, these estimates could prove conservative, as any capital allocation activities will target our core markets.","Turning to page nine, Tom Toomey, will comment on our thoughts concerning value creation.","Tom Toomey \u2013 President and CEO","","Thanks, Jerry. Generating strong total shareholder return over the long-term remains our primary goal. To achieve this, we focus on growing our NAV per share, expanding our stock price premium, and\/or reducing our stock price discount to NAV, and growing our dividend.","One of the primary metrics we focus on to assess whether we are creating value is CVNI growth, which calculates all-in NAV per share growth, after our dividends are theoretically reinvested at our NAV per share at the time of payment.  This metric is highly correlated with long-term total shareholder return.","On page ten, we\u2019ll address our development and redevelopment pipeline, an important component of value creation in the coming years. ","As you can see, we have a 1.3 billion pipeline concentrated in our core markets. A majority of that will come online by the second half of 2013, and begin to cash flow at that point.  Currently, however, hour pipeline represents a drag on our FFO per share growth. I will let Tom Herzog address this.","Tom Herzog \u2013 CFO","","We have mild development and redevelopment projects and quantify the expected FFO accretion, NAV creation, and FFO drag.   Assuming we maintain our pipeline at 1.0 to 1.5 billion, deliver 500 million of new product annually on average, in current development\/redevelopment economics hold, our pipeline should be approximately $0.03 to $0.04 accretive annually, the FFO and AFFO per share. ","Under the same assumptions, we anticipate that our pipeline will contribute $0.60 to $0.85 of NAV annually moving forward.  Assuming no additional starts are in process development or redevelopment creates a drag on our FFO per share of $0.055 in 2013, $0.4 in 2014 and $0.1 in 2015.  As we have been fully [inaudible] pipeline for the last few years with harvesting little to no cash flow during this development period.","Turning to page eleven, and our joint ventures. We like our joint venture partnerships and platforms. They represent a stable source of long-term capital, and can enhance economics.  As you can see, our joint venture relationships are extensive, and we have created significant value through our joint venture investments.  JVs will remain a part of a long-term value creation strategy.","Turning to page twelve, we provide an overview of our 2013 to 2015 expectations. We are not economists; therefore we look to our third party research providers from Macro Economic Expectations such as job growth, household formations, and multi-family specific data.  These assumptions are available at the top of the page.  ","We outlined our 2013 guidance earlier in the call. Our cumulative primary growth expectations for the 2014 through 2015 period are as follows:  The FFO per share growth of 12 to 15%. FFO has adjusted per share growth of 14 to 18%.  AFFO per share growth of 16 to 20%. Same-Store revenue growth of 7 to 9%.  Same-Store expense growth of 5 to 7% and Same-Store NOI growth of 7 to 11%.  Again, over cumulative metrics.","Additional details can be found on this page, as well as in the appendix of this document beginning on page sixteen.","Before moving on, I would like to provide some observations regarding out 2013 FFO per share guidance.  During the three year period from 2010 to 2012, we purchased 1.97 billion of assets and an average Cap rate of 4.7%.  We sold 1.22 billion of assets and an average Cap rate of 6.9%. We grew our development and redevelopment programs to 1.3 billion 50% of which has been funded and deleveraged for a balance sheet by fully funding all external growth activities of equity.  Note that this 2.21 billion of equity was issued at a slight premium to NAV per share over this time period. And at our 3.4 billion of on balance sheet debt at year-end 2012, was very similar to our end-of-year debt balance in 2009.","In total, these activities will be roughly $0.14 diluted to our 2013 FFO, and AFFO per share, which is clearly impactful when compared against our $1.20 of expected AFFO in 2013 at the mid-point.","Let me provide you some context as to how we arrived at the $0.14. Matching our three year acquisition against deposition yielded $0.10 of dilution.  And ramping our development and redevelopment pipeline contributed another $ 0.055 of total dilution in 2013. This was offset somewhat by a portion of a new equity we issued, that was used to fund part of our fully owned joint venture and land acquisitions. This created $0.02 of accretion.  ","The team was fully cognizant of this tradeoff between short-term dilution and long-term value creation when we undertook these activities.  ","With these now behind us, our already superior operating platform, has been successfully augmented with a much improved portfolio that has built for the long-term. A four to five balance sheet and a accretive development and redevelopment program that are well positioned in all areas for growth in 2014 and 2015. ","Turning to page thirteen, Toomey will address what makes UDR unique.","Tom Toomey \u2013 President and CEO","","First we are large enough to enjoy cost of capital and G&A economies to scale. But still nimble enough that moderately sized value creative opportunities moved the needle.","Second, we have a good market mix and range of asset quality that does well in a variety of economic scenarios.","Third, our operating platform is second to none.  Timely, we have an extensive long-lived and stable joint venture relationship with high quality dedicated partners.  These serve to lower our effective cost-to-capital and boost our returns.","Lastly, please turn to page fourteen.  So why invest in UDR? As you can see, we believe that there\u2019s plenty of reasons starting with multi-family fundamentals continue to look robust.  We have a strong three year growth profile, which is driven by our efficient operating platform, and our repositioned portfolio.  The heavy lifting is completed with regard to our portfolio and balance sheet repositioning, as well at the ramp up of our development and redevelopment programs.","And lastly, tax flow and NAV per share growth from our external growth efforts will begin to come online towards the end of 2013, and accelerate over the next few years.","As Herzog mentioned earlier, our FFO and AFFO per share growth, would be rather marginal in 2013.  However, in 2014 and \u201915 cash flow growth is expected to improve markedly to roughly 9% annually.  ","Quickly, here are the primary big picture assumptions that support these growth expectations during this time period given the current economic conditions. Our projected Same-Store NOI growth of roughly 4.25 per year would result in additional FFO and AFFO growth of 5 to 6% per year.  Development\/redevelopment coming online during this period are forecast to add another 3 to 5% growth. And remaining non-Same-Stores is anticipated to add approximately 1% per year.  When combined, and set against our current leverage, our average 2014 and \u201915 FFO and AFFO growth per share of 8 and 9% respectively look very reasonable. These growth levels would result in 2015 FFO and AFFO of $1.57 and $1.41 respectively.  Applying these same forecast to UDRs consensus NAV of $26.50 per share yield annual NAV growth of roughly 9% in 2014 and \u201915, and would result in NAV per share north of $32.00 by the end of 2015.","This projected NAV increase when coupled with dividends expected to be paid in 2014 and \u201915, would generate CVNI growth of roughly 12% annually.","We will continue to work hard and execute on all the strategic priorities that we have reviewed with you today.  ","Finally, and most importantly, we remain focused on managing our business every day to drive total shareholder return for investors and believe that we have the right team and plan in place to do so.  ","With that, operator, we\u2019ll turn the call over to Q&A session. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  Our first question comes from the line of Derek Brower at UBS Bank.  Please go ahead.  ","Derek Brower \u2013 UBS Bank","Hi, thanks, guys.  Good afternoon.  I was wondering if you could just give us a better handle on the timing of store uses for 2013, and more specifically, the thought behind issuing 100 million of equity below NAV as compared to selling some more non-core assets?  ","Tom Toomey","","Well, the sources and uses, just if you were to take them and run them down.  So we\u2019ve got \u2013 I\u2019ll just give you the [inaudible] real quick like.  We\u2019ve got the surplus of FFO versus dividends of 68 million, the dead issuances, equity issuances that you can see from the guidance, the wholly-owned disposition; it comes up to about $700 million in sources just roughly.  We\u2019ve got some debt maturities; we listed development and re-development spending, about $750 million, that\u2019s how it balances out.  ","When we think about the equity issuance, I would describe it this way.  We\u2019ve got a number of different sources of capital so we could employ.  It could be \u2013 it could be dead, it could be equity, it could be joint venture, proceeds, et cetera.  So whether we choose to issue that 100 million of equity or not is yet to be determined.  So I would say that it\u2019s very possible that we could, it could be a bigger number, it could be a smaller number depending on market circumstances.  ","Derek Brower \u2013 UBS Bank","","Okay, thanks.  And on the capital recycling front, can you describe what the appetite from that life is to do more asset-swap transitions such as the Olivian and do you think it could be possible we\u2019ll see another one of those transactions this year? ","Warren Troupe","","Hi, this is Warren Troupe.  We\u2019re always in discussion with Met Life and we\u2019ve said from the beginning, we like that joint venture, it\u2019s a way for us to increase our ownership interest in those existing assets and I think as you see us go along, you\u2019ll see us continue to execute those transactions with Met Life and also increase the size of Joint Venture II.  ","Derek Brower \u2013 UBS Bank","Okay, thanks.  And then I guess, just lastly, big-picture question and just going back to your Page 12 macro assumptions.  At the top, you know, you have job formation growing in 2013, 2014, income growing, household formations growing, but it claims that your assumptions assume homeownership rate actually declines from 2013.  I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve done any sensitivities on your 2014 to 2015 outlook based on a growth homeownership rate?  ","Tom Toomey","","This is Toomey.  With respect to the assumptions on \u201912, those are national assumptions and we\u2019ve looked at our individual markets when we\u2019ve thought about \u201914 and \u201915 and believe that the homeownership rate in those markets unappreciablely moved more than where it is today.  ","Derek Brower \u2013 UBS Bank","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup.  Please go ahead.  ","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Hey, guys.  The topic of stock repurchases came up on the call earlier today.  And obviously on a lot of calls over the last week or two, there\u2019s been some discussion about the property REIT trading at large discounts to NAV.  So my question is, is whether you think there\u2019s anything UDR can do to be more active about trying to close out this discount?  Obviously, part of the strategic outlook, which seemed to be part of that, but are there other things that you can do in the short term or medium term to help close out the discount?  ","Tom Toomey","","This is Toomey.  I think you\u2019re right.  One of the first things is provide a strategic outlook and this document does a fine job on that.  The second aspect is the enhancements of our disclosure in the quarterly package so that people can drill down to the value of the enterprise more easily.  And I think the third is just execution on our part and that we\u2019ve got a good experienced team.  We feel like we\u2019ve got the right assets, the right balance sheet, the right growth opportunities.  It\u2019s just time to execute.  And so I think we\u2019re going to focus on those three and see how far they take us and then we\u2019ll evaluate it at that point and see where we move.  ","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, that\u2019s fair.  And then I think Michael had a follow up. ","Michael (Unidentified Analyst)","","Yes.  Tom, just thinking about how you ended your comments, thinking about the growth in NAV and technically the growth in NOI getting to a $32 stock price, or $30 NAV I should say.  I guess underlying that is an expectation of flat cap rates, right?  ","Tom Herzog","","Well, no, not necessarily.  Let me just give you the pieces, Michael.  How we looked at that \u2013 this is Herzog, by the way.  How we looked at that analysis is we took the same store growth to get the \u2013 the NOI will be created from the guidance that we put in the document.  We also looked at the non-same-store and then we picked up our development REIT development value creation from an NOI perspective that would be created from the program that\u2019s in place and projected that over about three years in a pretty in-depth model.  We took that NOI and we capped it out at \u2013 you\u2019re correct, at today\u2019s CAP rate so we could get a sense for it and then incorporated that into our NAV creation to get the growth that would just mathematically come to something north of $32 a share.  ","And the while we were at it, we did then pick up the dividend yield off the consensus NAV and created the CVNI that we spoke to of about 12.2%.  The CAP rate that we used was the \u2013 it was 5 1\/8% and we picked that up from looking to the consensus NAV that The Street had put out and kind of the average CAP rate that was within that mix to utilize the 5 1\/8th.  ","Michael (Unidentified Analyst)","And so effectively, you know, flat CAP rates and growing NOI, you know, getting to that NAV, obviously, is predicated on CAP rates staying relatively stagnant?  ","Tom Herzog","You\u2019re correct.  And in addition to that, the growth from the development and re-development program. ","Michael (Unidentified Analyst)","And then at least in the \u201914 to \u201915 timeframe, you have this \u2013 call it 500 million of equity being issued.  This is on Page 12 of the presentation.  I guess, is that a similar answer thinking about the 100 that\u2019s embedded in guidance for \u201913, that the 500 in \u201914 and \u201915 is predicated on the stock because you\u2019ve now put yourself, I guess, out there saying you will not issue equity below NAV and given the stocks at $23, you\u2019ve got a far way to move up, especially with an outlook that the NAV is going to grow significantly in the next couple of years, that that 500 million has got to come from other things, or you don\u2019t spend the money, right?  You either don\u2019t do the acquisitions or you don\u2019t do the development or re-development because you\u2019ve got to come up with $500 million of cash? ","Tom Herzog","","That\u2019s correct.  It would be \u2013 the activity that would take place will be, in part, dictated by access to various sources of capital.  So depending on what those look like, obviously, that can impact the plan. ","Michael (Unidentified Analyst)","All right, and you\u2019ve embedded in your forward plan issuing equity at NAV, in that timeframe to grow NAV per share? ","Tom Herzog","","Right.  ","Michael (Unidentified Analyst)","Okay.  All right, thank you.  ","Operator","","And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.  Please go ahead. ","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Thanks.  Good afternoon and welcome, Tom Herzog. ","Tom Herzog","","Thank you, Rich.  ","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Does your balance sheet management slide on Page 6 of the 2015 Outlook include newly-started development activity? ","Tom Herzog","","No.  The balance sheet that we put in place, the balance sheet management as well as the development, redevelopment, value creation, drag, et cetera do not assume new development projects put into play. ","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","And yet on the summary page on Page 12, you do assume incremental development spending.  So like isn\u2019t there like a kind of disconnect between your balance sheet and your 2014 expectations without that missing variable? ","Tom Herzog","","I would say that the balance sheet, just looking at where those metrics fall out to at least freeze that as to what the portfolio looks like today.  It gives us a good feel for what those metrics will look like.  And then again, depending on what circumstances look like if we go to the development or re-development program.  Those sources of funding will need to come from somewhere, which we\u2019ve set forth.  And with that, it would keep the metrics, I think, in line based on the mix that we would use.  That would be the intent.  ","As you noted, we set up a target of 35 to 40% leverage, which drives a certain net-debt to EBITDA with the intent of managing toward the lower end of that range, but without doing so on a diluted basis.  So that all comes into play in the way that we think about how the model comes together. ","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay.  Turning to more current things, on the current list of joint ventures that you have outstanding \u2013 this question is for anybody.  What\u2019s the lifetime of these joint ventures in your mind?  Like when do you think there will have to be some type of event for them to demonetize one way or the other?  ","Tom Toomey","","This is Toomey, Rich.  Good morning.  With respect to the lifecycle of the joint ventures, obviously, the Met platform, you\u2019re talking about a generational Fortune 50 company that looks at real estate as a long-term hold and a key part of their overall management of their portfolio and our desire is to grow that real estate holding.  ","With respect to KFH, certainly it is an investor who has come in and out of the United States from time to time and probably at this point in time would still be looking to grow its platform in the U.S.  So I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any finite date that that would terminate.  ","And lastly is the Texas joint venture.  I think their key date will be when the debt, which is slightly above market at 5.5 today burns off in \u201915, 2015.  That, most likely, would be a date that we\u2019ll make a decision with our partner about those particular assets. ","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, last question for me on the same-store NOI outlook of 4 \u00bc to 6, you\u2019re pretty wide, I guess, but you know, maybe not so much for the start of the year.  But what factors would have to happen for you to be closer to the low end?  And what are some of the catalyst for you to get at or above the high end of that range? ","Jerry Davis","","Rich, it\u2019s Jerry.  I would say it\u2019s all really dependent mostly on job growth.  I think the expenses for the most part, we know what real estate taxes are going to be and I think the rest of our expenses we\u2019re typically good a locking down so I feel good about the expense growth guidance we gave.  ","On the revenue side, like I said, I think it\u2019s totally dependent on job growth or job loss.  If I had to pick two markets that could shift on me quickly, one would be Washington D.C. could probably get worse given the Pentagon\u2019s announcement last week about eliminating 46,000 jobs and furloughing for one day a week a couple 100,000 more.  And then on the positive, you know, I could see a place like San Diego having an uptick if some military rotations go towards the West Coast.  But that\u2019s really the biggest factor.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great.  That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. ","Operator","","And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.  Please go ahead. ","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Yes, hi.  Good afternoon, or good morning out there.  Jerry, the first question just picks up on the expense side.  Your guys\u2019 expense guidance is meaningfully lower than peers.  It\u2019s also quite a tight range.  I understand that over the past several years you guys have been good about keeping expense growth low, but, you know, what do you think is different about, you know, some of the things that you guys have in your numbers that some of the other guys maybe don\u2019t?  Is it literally that just the way the properties lay out you\u2019re not seeing the same real estate tax structure or just maybe better on the insurance front?  It\u2019s just strickenly a lot lower. ","Jerry Davis","","Yeah, I can\u2019t really speak to anyone else.  I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s behind their numbers.  I can tell you though, we are feeling real estate tax pressure, maybe not as much as the Sunbelt-dominating guys, but you know, our taxes \u2013 we\u2019re expecting to be north of 8% growth.  But when you really look back, like you said, over the last five years, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of keeping expense growth at sub-1%.  So migrating it up to that mid-point of 3% is predominately driven by taxes.  We think turnover this year will probably be roughly even where it was in 2012.  And you know, we\u2019re really \u2013 we spend the last four to five years making our sales force and administrative functions more efficient.  And over the next couple of years, we think there\u2019s ways to realize efficiencies in our service functions of our business.  So we\u2019re going to be hitting that hard over the next 2 to 3 years.  ","But yeah, I think when you look at it, it\u2019s really maintaining control and driving down the cost of doing our service side of the business will help keep us at the low end.  ","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","","Okay. So if I understand you, I mean, in addition, presumably, Warren\u2019s doing a good job on negotiating with the insurance companies to keep premiums low, but essentially whatever costs you\u2019re seeing rise on property tax, you\u2019re sort of taking it out on the other side by keeping expenses down?  That\u2019s the takeaway?  ","Jerry Davis","","Yes, I think that accurate.  ","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","","Okay.  Second question is for Toomey.  Obviously, you know, Tom Herzog doesn\u2019t need an introduction, you know, we all know him.  But just sort of curious given it was a lengthy process, it was one that you guys weren\u2019t under pressure to have to fill right away, you know, given the existing CFO bench strength there. What was the Board\u2019s take in view as far as succession planning?  I mean, if we think about it, succession planning is something that can take four or five-plus years.  You know, I know that you comment that you\u2019re not ready to hang up the spurs anytime in the near term, but these things do take time.  So just sort of curious what the Board thought as you went about filling that role? ","Tom Toomey","","Well, the Board was part of the process, obviously.  And with respect to the subject of succession, you\u2019re right, Alex.  First, I\u2019m 52 years old.  I like what I\u2019m doing.  I like the team I\u2019ve assembled.  I enjoy what I\u2019m doing so annually we review a succession plan, the Board approves it and we march forward with that plan every year and evaluate it every year.  ","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","","Okay, so nothing changed when you sent about doing the search?  It was \u2013 that didn\u2019t prompt a further review of anything as far as succession goes? ","Tom Toomey","","It was part of the evaluation process and we reached the conclusion that Mr. Herzog was the best candidate today and for the future.  ","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","","Okay, perfect.  Thank you.  ","Operator","","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.  Please go ahead.  ","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon, guys.  I also appreciate the disclosure there in the three-year plan.  Just a couple quick bookkeeping questions.  First, you gave what you expect to spend in 2013.  What\u2019s kind of the outlook for development starts and redevelopment starts in \u201913? ","Harry Alcock","","Mike, this is Harry.  We didn\u2019t give any guidance as to starts in 2013.  In \u201914 and \u201915 we have to start another \u2013 call it 500, 550 million to sort of reach the guidance that we\u2019ve given and so 2014, 2015 spend.  I can tell you that our existing pipeline, both in our owned land assets and our JV assets with Met Life, the total spend in that portfolio could be in excess of $1 billion.  We\u2019ve got additional redevelopment projects we\u2019re looking at.  So we certainly have a sufficient pipeline to backfill the existing projects.  ","In terms of 2013, we didn\u2019t give any guidance.  I\u2019d be surprised if we started a lot, although we\u2019re working on a number of projects and the exact timing depends on when we complete the entitlements and permitting process with the various cities.  ","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay.  Jerry, in your prepared comments, did you give January trends? ","Jerry Davis","","I didn\u2019t, but I will.  January, our new least rates were up \u2013 or rates on new leases were up about 2.5%, that compares to 1.7% last January.  And then our renewals were up 5.9% in January and that\u2019s down from last year when it was pushing 7.  ","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay.  And the occupancy on the year-review basis? ","Jerry Davis","","Occupancy is up slightly in January.  Today, I think it averaged out 95.5 in January and today we\u2019re at 95.4%.  I would expect for the first quarter it will end up in that 95.5% range. ","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s helpful.  And just finally, the G&A increase looked a bit large.  Tom could you walk through the components of what drilled the increase there in G&A? ","Tom Herzog","","Yeah, Mike, Tom Herzog here.  The G&A, first of all, I don\u2019t want you to be confused by the G&A.  We have said in the past that some of that occurred.  The tax number used to be met into that and then in the beginning of last quarter when people realized there was confusion here, that was discontinued.  So now the G&A and the tax benefit are broken out separately, which you\u2019ve probably seen.  So when we look at the 2012 G&A relative to the guidance that was given at the beginning of the year, you\u2019ll find that the tax number is broken out, that we\u2019re pretty much right on in that number.  ","As we look to 2013, we\u2019re up \u2013 call it 2, $2.5 million, this is the basic stuff.  We\u2019ve got normal personnel increases.  We had certain comp items for folks in the field that had a great job in 2012 and then miscellaneous and technology type items make up  the rest.  So no big [inaudible] and line item made up that change, but it comes to about a penny.  ","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay.  I\u2019ll take a look at that.  The tax benefit then, I just \u2013 it\u2019s been elevated the last couple of years.  Is the \u2013 looking forward over the next couple of years given your outlook, should we expect that to come down pretty substantially as you kind of move out of that business? ","Tom Herzog","","Well, I would put it this way; in 2012, the first quarter of \u201912, there wasn\u2019t a benefit recorded because the sales hadn\u2019t been made and it was being backed off against the valuation allowance adjustment that took place.  In 2013, so it was running about $3 million a quarter in \u201912 with nothing in Q1.  In 2013, that number is going to be more in the vicinity of \u201911 to \u201913 million.  And then as we go forward from there as some of the development projects start to stabilize and some of the additional sales start to earn in, you\u2019re going to see that tax benefit structure decline and that\u2019s what you see in that guidance on Page \u2013 whatever it is, 16 or 17 of the three-year strategy package, you see a decline for those reasons as development starts to earn in.  ","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Appreciate the color.  Thank you. ","Tom Herzog","","I should just note one thing though so that we don\u2019t have confusion, we\u2019re not intending to move out of that business in the TRS.  We\u2019ll continue to own assets in there, develop assets so that tax benefit is an ongoing item and you can see the that [inaudible].  ","Operator","","Mr. Toomey, there are no further questions at this time. ","Tom Toomey","","Well, thank you, all, for your time today. I know it was a lengthy prepared remarks, but I think we have a lot to give you today and certainly the team\u2019s going to be available for follow-up calls.  But as you can see today, what we have accomplished is we provided a three-year road amp.  We\u2019ve enhanced our disclosures.  We restated our strategic priorities.  We certainly gave you a case of why UDR is a good investment today and in the future.  And lastly, I add, I think we have the right team to execute this.  So with that, thank you for your time today and we wish you the best.  "],"20756":["UDR, Inc.

This call is being recorded. And now, I'll turn the call over to your host Chris Van Ens. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher Van Ens","Thank you for joining us for UDR's second quarter financial results conference call. Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I'd like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although, we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC.

Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas Toomey","Thank you, Chris. And good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","First, all aspects of our business continue to perform well in the second quarter. Operations are strong throughout our portfolio, our aggregate development pipeline is meeting or exceeding expectations, and our balance sheet is solid. In short, we continue to check all the boxes with regard to the key components of our current three-year strategic plan published last February.","We are just over halfway through 2014 and the macro environment for apartment demand in our markets has been slightly better than we initially expected. These markets continue to generate superior fundamentals relative to the national average. Against this backdrop and in conjunction with our strong 2014 results to date, we raised our full year earnings and same-store forecast in today's release. Tom will discuss details in his prepared remarks.","While it is too early to comment on 2015, we will re-price approximately 30% of our apartment homes in the third quarter. And if current trends hold true, we expect another strong year for apartments and UDR. Jerry will provide further details on our forward operating strategy in his prepared remarks.","Second, we closed on $81 million of dispositions during the quarter, had better pricing than originally contemplated. Additional sales have closed in the third quarter. Tom, will provide further details.","From a big picture perspective, continuing to fund our accretive development pipeline with non-core dispositions is a trade off and is working. Later this year, we plan to market additional assets and anticipate strong demand, given the depth of acquisition capital in the marketplace. We are confident in our ability to execute upon our disposition guidance of $350 million to $450 million in 2014.","Third, we are forecasting two or three additional development starts during the remainder of 2014, with anticipated cost to construct of $200 million to $325 million, depending on actual starts activity. The starts will be in our core markets and may include Orange County, San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. At least two are anticipated to be with MetLife in a 50-50 ownership structure. Like our current pipeline, these new projects will help drive strong NAV and cash flow growth for UDR and its shareholders.","Fourth, we successfully issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured debt during the quarter at an attractive 3.75% coupon. This issuance points to the strength of our balance sheet, which continues to improve. And finally, I'd like to thank all my fellow associates for their hard work in producing another strong quarter for UDR. We look forward to the remainder of 2014.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: first, our second quarter 2014 results; second, our balance sheet and debt maturity update and additional details on our $300 million unsecured offerings; third, a development update; fourth, an overview of second quarter and post-quarter transactions; and last, our third quarter and full year 2014 guidance.","First, our second quarter results came in better than expected on both earnings and same-store sales growth. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.39, $0.39 and $0.34, respectively. Quarterly same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 4.4%, 1.7% and 5.5%, respectively.","Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 40.5%. On a fair value basis, it was approximately 32%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.9x and is forecast to trend to the mid-6s by yearend. We will continue to manage our balance sheet to BBB+ credit metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $650 million of cash and credit facility capacity at quarter end.","In the first half of 2014, $312 million of UDR debt matured at an average rate of 5.3%. We refinanced this debt in June with a $300 million 10-year unsecured offering, priced at an attractive yield to maturity of 3.79%. We have no remaining debt maturing in 2014 that cannot be extended at our option.","Turning to development. Our under construction pipeline totaled $671 million at the end of the second quarter. For these developments we are projecting approximately 170 basis point weighted average spread between expected trend of yields and current market GAAP rates. When including our $416 million of development that was completed in a lease up at quarter end, our pipeline totaled $1.1 billion and had an expected spread of approximately 180 basis points.","Both of these measurements point to the accretive nature of our pipeline and the strong cash flow generation we expect, as income comes online. In the fourth quarter, our 173 home Beach & Ocean development in Huntington Beach, California, and our 332 home DelRay Tower project in Alexandria, Virginia, will each completion at a combined budgeted cost of approximately $183 million.","Preleasing at these two assets is on plan and both will enhance the quality of our existing portfolio. In total, our $1.1 billion development pipeline were 72% funded at quarter end, with the balance continuing to be funded through non-core assets sales. As for future development projects, we continue to carefully underrate opportunities and look for new land sites.","As Tom indicated, we expect to start an additional two to three developments in the second half of 2014 with MetLife, all in our core markets and with trended spreads in our targeted range of a 150 basis point to 200 basis points.","Next, our assets sales. In late June, we closed on the sale of two communities in Tampa for approximately $81 million. On July 1, we sold one community in Orlando for approximately $50 million. Combined these sales were transacted at a 5.6% cash flow cap rate. By the end of day tomorrow, July 30, we expect that the sale of two Norfolk Virginia area communities will be completed for approximately $47 million at a 7.5% cash flow cap rate.","With these dispositions, we will have sold approximately $225 million of non-core assets in 2014 thus far at a blended cash flow cap rate of 6.1%. Combined, these assets had an average revenue for occupied home of approximately $1,120 and averaged 25 years old.","Our 2014 guidance currently contemplates an additional $125 million to $225 million in dispositions by yearend as well as $100 million to $150 million of 1031 acquisitions. We are making progress with these transactions, and we'll provide further details, as they become available.","Additionally, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the company received proceeds totaling $36 million from the prepayment of a B note it held. The note was secured by class A property in Los Angeles, with a maturity date in 2022.","The prepayment of this note resulted in a net gain of approximately $8.4 million or $0.03 of FFO per share, which will be recognized in the third quarter. The gain positively impacted the company's full year 2014 FFO per share guidance, but will have no affect on FFO as adjusted or AFFO per share.","On to third quarter and full year 2014 guidance. Second quarter earnings and same-store sales growth remained strong. As a result of our positive first half 2014 and third quarter to date operating results and income related to the prepayment of the B note, I referenced earlier, we are increasing our full year 2014 FFO per share guidance at the midpoint by $0.04 to $1.52 to $1.56 from $1.47 to $1.53. We are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted per share guidance by $0.01 at the midpoint to $1.49 to $1.53 from $1.47 to $1.53, and AFFO per share guidance by $0.01 at the midpoint to $1.32 to $1.36 from $1.30 to $1.36.","Regarding same-store expectations, we are increasing our full year 2014 same-store revenue growth guidance to 3.75% to 4.25%, up 12.5 basis points at the midpoint, reducing our expense growth guidance to 1.75% to 2.25%, down a 100 basis points at the midpoint and raising our NOI growth guidance to 4.5% to 5.5%, up 62.5 basis points at the midpoint. We also increased our full year same-store occupancy guidance by 50 basis points to 96.5%.","Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.","Third quarter 2014 FFO per share guidance is $0.39 to $0.41, inclusive of the additional income from the prepayment of the B note on July 16. FFO as adjusted per share guidance is $0.36 to $0.38, and AFFO per share guidance is $0.31 to $0.33.","Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.26 in the second quarter for $1.04 per share when annualized. This represents a yield of approximately 3.6% and will be our 167th straight quarter of paying the dividend.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: first, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and an overview of our current operating strategy; second, the performance of our primary core markets during the quarter; and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups.","We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 3.8% year-over-year to $1,586 per month. Our same-store occupancy of 96.8% was 60 basis points higher on year-over-year and sequential basis.","Our total portfolio revenue per occupied home at quarter end was $1,733 per month, including pro rata JVs. Our revenue growth during the first half of the year has been 4.5%, as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 3.9% increase in the rent per occupied home.","As Tom stated earlier, our revised full year revenue guidance is 3.75% to 4.25%, which implies a second half deceleration. Let me be clear that while we do expect lower revenue growth in the back half of the year, it is the result of two factors.","First, we had exceptionally strong occupancy in the second half of 2013 that averaged 96.3%. Therefore, we do not expect the same level of occupancy pickup in 3Q and 4Q of 2014 that we have benefited from in the first half of this year.","Second, today we are pushing rents harder than we normally would at this time of year, because of our very high occupancy levels, which today are close to 97%. While this will result in a slightly lower closing ratio on perspective residents and may cause some existing residents to move out, we are willing to sacrifice some near-term occupancy to strengthen our rent growth in 2015. Through our many strategic initiatives implemented over the past several years, we have the necessary platform to efficiently manage our portfolio moving forward.","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, detailed on Attachment 8G our supplement. Second quarter effective new lease rents increased by 3.6%. Renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.5%. San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and Nashville performed well, while the Mid-Atlantic region continued to struggle.","As a quick reminder, our realized renewal rent growth in a quarter typically is slightly higher than the rate we initially send out to our residents. For July, renewal rate growth is currently 5.1%, and I would expect third quarter renewal growth will be in the 5% range.","In the first quarter of 2015, we believe likely that our revenue growth will stop decelerating. We base this on supply and demand projections in our submarkets, the strong occupancy trends we are currently seeing and the rate level at which we are currently able to sign and renew residents.","Regionally, the Mid-Atlantic with the exception of Metro D.C. is beginning to improve modestly. We expect our southeastern markets to remain stable, as new supply is offset by strong job growth. The same hope is true for our Texas markets.","We are confident that the northeast will hold up well, but certain submarkets may face some supply issues moving forward. The west should remain strong, as job growth, especially in the tech sector, continues to enable us to drive rent growth.","Next, annualized turnover in the second quarter increased slightly by 20 basis points year-over-year. The increase was partially attributable to our ongoing focus on lease exploration management.","Over the past couple of years, we have concentrated more leases in the high demand second and third quarters. This active management should continue to benefit our current and future year results. Further details for these metrics can be found on Attachment 8G or Page 20 of our supplement.","Rent as a percentage of our residents' income held steady at roughly 19%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 50 basis points year-over-year at 13.9%, still below our long-term average of approximately 15%.","Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary core markets. These markets represent 65% of our same-store NOI and 70% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles, which combined represent 16.5% of our total NOI, continue to slowly improve.","As many of you are aware, we are lengthening the average term at 1,447 home Newport Beach community, the Coronado's. This will better position the community long-term, as it will stabilize year round pricing and mitigate seasonal occupancy and rent growth fluctuations.","However, short-term, this change hurt our second quarter new lease rate growth in Orange County as the Coronado's account for roughly half of our same-store units in the market. We will benefit later in 2014 and in 2015 for this strategic move.","New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI improved sequentially as new lease and renewal rates averaged 3.3% and 6.2% growth, respectively. And occupancy averaged 97.1% in the second quarter. New York remains a good market. With occupancy above 98% currently, we have positioned ourselves well for a strong third quarter. As a reminder, 95 Wall, which we had excluded from same-store results due to Hurricane Sandy, was included in the second quarter same-store home account.","Metro DC, which represents 13% of our total NOI had occupancy of 97.4% and effective rent growth of 90 basis points in the second quarter. A strong result considering the ongoing concerns many have for this market. The encouraging results is attributable to our mix of approximately 40% A and 60% B product, as well as less direct submarket exposure to new supply.","We believe these factors will continue to help us fare better than many of our peers in 2014. Our B assets in the market experienced revenue growth of 1.4% in 2Q, outperforming our A assets by 30 basis points. We are still expecting positive full year revenue growth of approximately 1% in DC.","San Francisco, which represents 11% of our total NOI, continues to generate extremely strong results due to high quality employment growth and a general housing shortage in the city proper. In June, new lease rate growth reached to 11% with renewals up 8%. Our July numbers are just as strong.","Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI, is another market that has thus far more than adequately absorbed additional multi-family supply. New lease rate growth reached nearly 10% in June and renewal growth continues to be at the top-end of our portfolio. For July renewals are been achieved at 7%.","Boston, which represents 6% of our total NOI, accelerated throughout the quarter and for a tough winter with new lease and renewal rate growth of 8.1% and 6.9%, respectively. We expect our suburban locations will continue to outperform as they are less directly impacted by the new supply has being delivered into the downtown core.","Lastly, Dallas, which represents 5% of our NOI, is performing in line with our initial budgeted expectation. Uptown continues to perform well, even with significant new supply coming on line. Our North Dallas has begun to see some new supply pressures. Fortunately, Dallas continues to enjoy very strong job growth.","Turning to our developments. First, our projects that were stabilized for full quarter. Demand at our 467 home, $150 million Bella Terra community in Huntington Beach remains fantastic. The property hit 90% leased in only six months and is currently 97% occupied with rents well ahead of pro forma estimates at $2.55 a square foot.","Next, our projects recently stabilized or in lease up. Channel at Mission Bay, our 315 home, $145 million development in San Francisco and 13th & market, our 264 home, $73 million development in San Diego continue to perform well.","Weighted average effective rents are 10% above plan. Channel, in particular, is outpacing initial expectations after hitting 90% occupancy in June, just six months after opening its doors and effective rent, 18% above budget. The property is currently 97% leased and 95% physically occupied.","Los Alisos at Mission Viejo, California; Domain College Park across the street from the University of Maryland Business School and Fiori at our Vitruvian Park joint venture in Addison, Texas comprised $199 million in aggregate estimated cost. Weighted average effective rents are approximately on plan. Currently Fiori is 92% leased, Domain College Park is 99% leased and Los Alisos is 79% leased. Domain College Park and Los Alisos should both hit 90% physical occupancy within 13 months of opening. All in, we remain very positive on how our recently completed and end lease up developments are progressing in aggregate.","Finally, a quick update on our development communities that are not yet open. It's still very early, but pre-leasing at Beach & Ocean, our 173 home, $51 million development in Huntington Beach and DelRay Tower, our 332 home, $132 million project in Alexandria, Virginia is progressing well. Beach & Ocean will open in October and it is currently 16% pre-leased. DelRay will welcome its first residents in August and it is currently 19% pre-leased.","With that I'll open the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll hear first from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph - Citi","In terms of funding the remainder of the development spend, how do you internally weigh decision between selling additional assets and issuing equity at this price?","Thomas Herzog","Nick, this is Tom Herzog. We still have a view that funding the remaining development through sale of non-core assets is how we would intend to fund that. As it pertains to issuance of equity, as we've been saying since the beginning of the year, trading at a premium and having accretive use for the funds that we will consider as an option, but as far funding development it is intended through the sale of non-core assets.","Nick Joseph - Citi","So when you say accretive use of funds, so you're putting development aside, is that really only acquisitions?","Thomas Herzog","It would be acquisitions or other, but excluding development.","Nick Joseph - Citi","And then could you talk about what has driven the increased occupancy? And if that was an active decision that you targeted within your revenue management system?","Jerry Davis","Nick, this is Jerry Davis. We really started driving occupancy up probably about nine months ago. And it's really a couple of factors. We really didn't do any of it within the pricing system. I think when you look our rent growth and renewal growth, it's comparable to most of our peers, but we have seen a pickup in occupancy.","And there is really a two or three primary drivers of that. One, starting in fourth quarter of last year, we brought in-house, what we call an outbound call center, and all that is, is a small group of people that go through a discarded leads from our sites, that our sites folks have just determined that they are not hot leads, and we try to resurrect those.","And even though the hit ratio on those is relatively small, we found we've been able to pick up over 250 incremental leases, so far in the first seven months of this year. And when you look at that over the entire portfolio not just the same-store, that's probably at least a 40 basis points or 50 basis points pop to occupancy that was done with nothing to do with pricing.","The other factor and we've been working on this for a couple of years is continuously driving to reduce the number of days an apartments sits vacant between when the prior resident moves out and the current resident moves in. Two years ago, we were about 26 days to reoccupy unit, our goal this year is to get it to 22 days. We hit 24 days last year.","And we think we can continue to drive that down further by becoming more efficient on turning apartments, as well as putting more of an emphasis on pre-leasing, notice to vacate units instead of just vacant units. And I would remind you, everyday we can cut off of our average days vacant about $1.05 million of additional revenue drops to our bottomline.","Nick Joseph - Citi","Where do you think that 22 days could eventually get to?","Jerry Davis","I think we can get it probably to the mid-to-high teens. We're currently, when you break it down between turn time and time to reoccupy after the unit is made ready, we've gotten turn time down to a little under seven days. And the amount of time to get it occupied after its ready is about 15 days. Those numbers fluctuate and there's some seasonality this time of the year.","My goal for the month of August is to get to 15 days of total vacant days. But when you get to the winter months, they can get up to the mid-to-high 20s. And I do have some tight markets that I typically can run at about 10 days such as San Francisco and pockets in New York.","Operator","And next you will hear from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Tom Herzog, a question for you. So I guess some clarity on the FFO per share guidance here. Curious on, it looks like you were raising the full year as adjusted guidance by just $0.02 here when you're already $0.04 ahead on the first half so far year-to-date. So curious on perhaps what's holding you back from a slightly larger increase here? Is it fairly down to conservatism or is it perhaps something that we're not fully appreciating like, well, anything that we're not fully appreciating?","Thomas Herzog","When we look at the first half, we came in at about $0.75 of FFO as adjusted and we have $0.76 in the second half. The reason that the growth is in a little bit bigger in the second half, well, there is a couple of things you probably expect. We issued that unsecured debt in June and then we've got the dispositions in the second half of the year. So it's kind of in line with what we expected.","As to the beat that we had in Q1 and then Q2, just a little bit of conservatism, probably both into the guidance for the first two quarters, as each of those quarters came up, as they were both early in the year and a little bit of uncertainty. So there is really nothing beyond that.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","And a follow up. So it sounds like, well, your recent dispositions have been in your call it warehouse markets, where you've capitalized on what looks like to be pretty good pricing for those assets. I'm curious as you look ahead, when you talked about some thoughts on near-term asset sales. Would you consider perhaps broadening your perspective and selling some assets, some of your better quality assets in your core urban coastal markets, given what seemed to be pretty full asset pricing here? And we're starting to see some condo converted stock get back into the marketplace.","Harry Alcock","I think as Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks today, including the B note payoff, we closed about $225 million year-to-date. We've got another $47 million scheduled to close this week. A couple of properties in non-core capital warehouse markets in Virginia Beach that will get us to a little over $270 million. That leads in order to hit midpoint of our guidance another $125 million or so.","We will at times consider selling properties in core markets, particularly non-core properties in core markets. We're aware that condo pricing is starting to manifest itself a bit in certain markets in New York City and San Francisco, we're not looking to do anything specifically today, but that potentially is an opportunity in the future.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","And Harry, while you're on, just one more follow-up on that front. The B assets you sold, curious as to the type of buyer that showed up, were there more institutional buyers? Were there just a greater number of buyers? I'm just curious if there was any retrading or you're effectively getting your full price?","Harry Alcock","The three Florida assets, where we received 20-plus bids on each of those. It's just a very broad buyer base, mostly kind of local and regional syndicators. But there is a lot of folks that are selling for those types of assets, they're leverage buyers. It's a very deep and liquid market right now. There were no retrades on those three.","The two Hampton Roads assets, the buyer base is a little bit different. It's more of a local type buyer typically. We get several bids, but we're not going to reach the 20-type buyer range. But again, it's going to be a leverage buyer, and there was no retrade of any kind on those either.","Operator","We now move to a question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Two questions. First, did you say the rents on the Beach & Ocean deal are $2.55 a foot?","Thomas Toomey","I did -- No. Alex, the $2.55 a foot was actually on the Bella Terra deal.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","If you could just comment on the rents that you're getting at Beach & Ocean, and then what you expect for the Pacific City site?","Jerry Davis","Sure. I'll start with the Beach & Ocean. We're currently getting $2.69 market rents per square foot at Beach & Ocean. And I would tell you, we'll accept our first units their in October, and we've already pre-leased 16% of the property. We're still in design for the Pacific City deal. So we haven't finalized rent levels at that property at this point.","Harry Alcock","Alex, if I can jump in a little, I can tell you, this is Harry, with certainty we're going to get well above $3 a foot rents at that project. It really is a unique piece of dirt in Huntington Beach adjacent to 200,000 square foot retail center that will open in about a year. Tenants include Apple Store, Equinox, really unique type of project.","Next to it, the hotel site has started construction. The hotel operator will be a resort-boutique type operator that operates the properties like the Bacara in Santa Barbara. So we're really going to have a very, very unique product offering there.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","And then on the B note, do you guys have other of these B note investments out there? Do you see this as a business line the way you guys used to look at the RE3, the merch business? Do you see this as a way to put capital out to try and get accretive returns or was this a one-off?","Thomas Herzog","It was a one-off. It was class A asset in L.A. that over time it would have been a nice asset to own. So it was a one-off. We don't have any further assets like that in our portfolio at the current date.","Operator","And Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch has the next question.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","For Jerry, I am sorry if I missed, can you give us an update on rent as a percent of income? And then maybe give a little bit more color on how much this number ranges within your portfolio and how that compares to prior peaks or your historical average?","Jerry Davis","The percent in second quarter in total was 19%. It's actually a hair under. That's up a little bit over the last year or so, when we were more in the 17% to 18% range. And I can tell you, I don't have good information on historical numbers related to this, and I don't know if they would be valid anyways, given how much UDR's portfolio has changed over the last seven years, the totally different type of product and resident base. It ranges from mid-teens to mid-20s, but the majority really do come in between that 18% and 22%.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just following up, I heard your As versus Bs performance in D.C., but do you have that for the portfolio?","Jerry Davis","I sure do. For the last couple of months on new leases, Bs have outperformed to As, somewhere in the 40 basis point to 50 basis point range. And on renewals Bs are getting about 20 basis points to 30 basis points better. So call it a blended 30.","Operator","And our next question will come from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS","First question on the development pipeline. You talk about, I think you said it was 170 basis points is the spread right now between the yield and cap rates. I think that was for the projects that were completed, but not stabilized. Is that right?","Thomas Herzog","That's actually for the ones that are under construction, that are in the pipeline. The 180 basis point is for the entire $1.1 billion pipeline, including those that are completed.","Nick Yulico - UBS","So for the ones that were completed, I think you guys are saying something similar as far as the spread in the first quarter. So the ones that are completed, are they sort of performing the same way that they were you thought in the first quarter or have you got any uplift in yield from any of those projects that have been completed now?","Harry Alcock","I'll start and Herzog and Jerry can chime in, if they have any additional input. But remember, these are stabilized yields that we're calculating. So mostly those stabilized yields are calculated one year after completion. So these are sort of 2015 and into 2016 are the measurement periods. So in the last quarter we for the most part have not updated any forecast associated with those dates. But the assets are continuing to lease up as expected and that the forecast have remained largely unchanged over the last quarter.","Jerry Davis","I would agree with that. Lease up velocity over the last 30 days has been strong throughout the development portfolio. On Page 21 of the supplement, we show leased occupancies at these properties and they continue to strengthen. I can tell you for example, Channel Mission Bay, a San Francisco property today is 97% leased, and I'd remind you that we expected our first residents just seven months ago in December.","Bella Terra is 99% leased. Domain College Park, which has been a little slow to lease up, because it caters to the Smith Business School at the University Maryland, it's 99 % leased today, and 30 days from now once school returns, it will be at about 98%. So we'll have achieved over 90% occupancy in about 13 months, because we accepted our first building last year in June or July.","And then when you get down to 13th & market, which is our property in the East Village, downtown San Diego, leased occupancy today is 81%. We accepted our first units there last fall and that's another property that we fully expect to hit stabilized occupancy over 90% within 12 months.","And I stated earlier to Alex that Beach & Ocean are property that will open its doors in October in Huntington Beach. We've already pre-leased 16% of the units there. And the DelRay Tower, our property in the DC area, where we renovated and added density to existing property, we opened that property later this week and we've already pre-leased 21% of the units there.","So leasing velocity is good. And I would tell you, the ones that's been a little bit slower than normal, we tend to lease up in 12 months or less on average, but Fiori, our property in Vitruvian Park, which at about month 14 -- I mean 18 right now, is 92% leased. So we're about to hit stabilized occupancy there.","Nick Yulico - UBS","And then I know you guys like to quote these projects in relation to where the yield is versus market cap rates, but it would pretty helpful to get a sense for where you think the absolute stabilized yield is for this pipeline right now. And then if you could talk about then as well, since it sounds like the new starts are to mostly be in California, what the yield would be on those projects?","Harry Alcock","Nick, its Harry Alcock. The yields for the pipeline, the 180 basis points are about 6.1%. And then the future projects in California, again, we'll announce those once we start the project. But I think you could assume something relatively similar.","Operator","And we'll get the question from Rich Anderson from Mizuho.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho","So Tom, I don't know if you mentioned this, but how did you -- I kind of got on a little bit late, how do you feel about floating rate debt at 17% and maturing debt in 2015 at 14%? Are you comfortable within prospect of higher interest rates or just if you could comment on your strategy?","Thomas Herzog","Well, let me hit the floating rate debt first, I didn't hear the second part. So floating rate debt, we're somewhere between, call it, 10% and 20% or even 15% to 20%, we're comfortable in that range, especially multi-family where you've got a lot of resets or quicker reset on rents. So there's some correlation in that respect. So we're comfortable with that range. What was the second part of your question?","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Maturing debt in 2015?","Thomas Herzog","Again, we're comfortable with the -- we've got about $500 million maturing. Its $300 million or so in January, and then the balance of that I think is in December. It comes in at a rate of somewhere around 5.6%. And as that refinances, it probably comes in a lower rate. So it's a pickup in our model depending on how that plays out. But we're comfortable with that.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","And then the second question, I don't know if this was brought up either, but Tom Toomey in the beginning said you're doing a better job in dispositions and getting a better rate than you thought going in. Can you quantify what that is and what the driving factors are you think are behind that lower or that better cap rate, disposition cap rate?","Harry Alcock","Rich, this is Harry. I mean couple of things. One, demand for these assets have been very strong, as I mentioned earlier in the call. And there really, given the demand and the competitive environment for these assets, there simply are no retrade, which there haven't been in our experience this year, which candidly is a bit unusual.","Remember, we expose a number of assets to market, the mix of assets sometimes impacts cap rates, but primarily it's just a very favorable sales environment. And an environment in which interest rates, if you recall, have actually floated down, which also impacts pricing.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","I guess, my question is you mentioned in New York and San Francisco starting to see some condo pricing, but that has not played a role yet in that number. Is that correct?","Harry Alcock","Correct. There is condo interest whatsoever for the assets that we're marketing.","Operator","We'll now move to a question from Derek Bower with ISI Group.","Derek Bower - ISI Group","Jerry, I had a follow-up on the call center. Do you think this program can maintain that 40% to 50% lease per month hit rate that it seems to be having this year? And if so do you think that means occupancy can sort of normalize in a mid-96% range going forward?","Jerry Davis","I don't see why it cannot continue at that rate, Derek. The only thing I could see changing, but I think we would still be able to keep that occupancy, if my people on the ground maybe keep these leads alive a little bit longer. I think they have a lot of things to work on and some times you do just have some traffic that falls off the radar that these people pick up.","But yes, I think the new norm, especially given the portfolio that UDR has today and the markets it has today and the quality it has today, it's probably going to continue to run 50 basis points higher than we did a year ago. I think this is a new norm.","And the good thing, I would tell you because of the boost in occupancy that that team gave us, is it's put us in a position about three months earlier to have very high occupancy. This morning, when I was looking to my dashboard, I'm between 96.8% and 96.9% physical occupancy at my same-store portfolio. When you have that kind of occupancy at this time of the year, it gives you the ability to push rate a little bit harder.","I'll give you a quick example. I look back last year, and when I looked at my June market rents and my July market rents, I had started decelerating by about $10 per unit from June to July last year. When I look at June to July this year, my market rents per unit accelerated $10. That's about a $20 or a little over probably 120 basis point increase in what I'm going to be able to push rents at.","And we're willing to let occupancy slide down a bit. Its still be in that mid-96 level to set ourselves up for higher rent growth today than we normally would have been able to get. And the reason we did that as we think it's going to help propel us in not just fourth quarter, but it set us up at least through the first two to three quarters of 2015 with strong revenue growth.","Derek Bower - ISI Group","And are there any markets where it sounds like you might be more aggressive with rate later this year? Are there any concentration in your portfolio?","Thomas Toomey","I think San Francisco and Seattle and Portland, the Pacific Northwest as you can see on Page 20 of our supplement, we're already getting very high-single digit new lease rate growth. I tell you what's been encouraging, I had in my prepared remarks, and a lot of people have asked about Orange County, because Orange County when you look at my supplement, we had new lease rate growth that was a negative 0.5% in the quarter and our revenue growth was up 4%, which was pretty disappointing in my expectation as it's going to be at the low end of my peers.","What we were doing there was fixing the Coronado's where we had really catered over the last five to 10 years to a lot of short-term leases. What that created was a lumpiness in my revenue stream where I would peak in the spring and summer, but then fall down drastically in 4Q and 1Q. We've been pushing more for longer-term leases, which hurt our occupancy a bit and also took down our new lease rate growth. We think it's going to pay dividends, not just into this year, but also going into '15.","But what's really encouraging is when I do go back and I look at how much my market rents have gone up from June to July. They've gone up $25 per unit in just the last month, which is over 2%, and my occupancy today in Orange County is 95.9%. So I think it was a painful strategy that we had to go through in the first half of the year to restabilize Orange County, but I think it really will set us up for a good end of this year and a strong 2015.","Derek Bower - ISI Group","And then, just the last one, on Fiori, obviously that seems like velocity has picked up there on leasing. I know you guys cut rate back in April, have you had a cut rate again over the last three or four months or is that from the seasonality and you cut rate once and now you're just starting to see a pick up in demand?","Jerry Davis","No, it's really more of a one-time cut. Effective rates today are about $1.80, that's about where it was when we did the original cut. What you're really seeing is just a normal seasonal pickup that occurs in Dallas. The last two to three months we've been grossing 40 to 45 leases per month there and netting somewhere in the 35 range.","And so Dallas is a tough market, especially at the end level. You've got new supply that's coming in both [Technical Difficulty] Plano area. So we're kind of getting squeezed on both side as we introduce this new price point in that Addison market.","One thing we're encouraged by and this won't help us all at once, but we think it will over time, is the Toyota headquarters building that moved from Torrance, California is up in Plano, which is probably only a 10 or 15 minute drive from Fiori, and we think we're going to be able to capture some residents from that relocation.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Jerry, did you say earlier that D.C. is improving modestly? And if so, can you elaborate on that?","Jerry Davis","D.C. is stable. I wouldn't say it's necessarily improving and I think we're really going to have challenges over the next nine to 12 month as is new supply continues to come and job growth continues to be moderate. We've been stable. We had 1.3% revenue growth in 1Q, it was 1.2% growth in 2Q.","What I can tell you is the differential that we have experienced between our best performers and worst performers has tightened. In the first quarter my best performing property was a deal out in Fairfax County. It was a B quality asset that had 5% revenue growth. And my worst performer was a stabilized property in the U Street corridor, that's right across the street from our Capital View development. And now it had about a negative 4% revenue growth.","This quarter my best performing property was that same Fairfax County property and it had positive revenue growth of 3%, but my worst performing property was a property inside the beltway on Columbia Pike that was at negative 2%. So it still is a submarket-by-submarket deal, but I think D.C. is going to continue to be the struggling market for another nine to 12 months.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","And also, I think you said earlier that you expect a pause in the deceleration of revenue growth to occur in the first quarter of '15, is that right?","Jerry Davis","Yes.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","And what type of economic environment does that assume? Does that assume a continuation of the type of job growth that we've seen so far this year?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I think if things continue as they are today, Dave, adding 200,000, 250,000 jobs a month, when that supply continues to come where we're seeing from AXIO that it's going to hit our submarkets. We're comfortable that things next year probably going to look kind of similar to what they are right now, and the deceleration will probably continue through the back half of this year for us. That is going to be predominantly due to us not being able to pick up any gains in occupancy, because we hit high occupancy late last year, and today we're trying to push rents. But we think it's really a continuation of what we're seeing today.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","And two more quick ones for Tom Herzog. First, Tom, on Attachment 5, there a really high margin is implied within your stabilized non-mature pool. I realized that's small, but want to ask you, what's driving that?","Thomas Herzog","Dave, let me look at the details of that, we could take that offline. Let me call you back after the call. There is nothing down there, but I do want to take a look at that and answer it after the call.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","And last one for you is, can you please just explain your cash flow cap rate methodology? Walk us through management fee, CapEx, what NOI we're talking about and is that consistent across the Florida sales and the Virginia sales?","Jerry Davis","We're taking a full cash flow cap rate approach. We take 2014 NOI. We're using real CapEx not the $300 to $500 dual version of it. So $1,200 a door and then 3% management fee, so very much of a straight on cash flow cap rate approach.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","And that's consistent across all of the dispositions you've talked about today, Virginia, Florida, anything else. Okay, thank you.","Operator","And now moving to the next question, that will come from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Jerry, did you actually give what the July new lease number was? And then also you broke it out between A and B, could you talk about what you're seeing urban versus maybe some of the suburban assets there?","Jerry Davis","Sure. I'll give you the first one. July new lease rate growth in total was 4.1%, which is up a bit from May and June. Both May and June were 4%. So it's continued to accelerate. And as we look out into the month of August we have visibility of what market rents are on those units that either have not been leased yet or have been pre-leased. I would expect August to be roughly in that range too. And then, renewals in the month of July came down a bit, they were 5.1%, and I would expect renewals over the next quarter or so to be in the lows.","And then, you asked about urban and suburban, we typically track it more A, B and things like that. I will tell you, we look at urban and suburban, I'm going to let Thomas Toomey address this in a second, but just when do you look at the growth rates, urban As and suburban As for us, they are both right about 4.1%. This is more on the revenue growth for the second quarter, not new lease rate growth. And then, our best performing segment was really the suburban Bs, which came in the 4.7% range. But I'm going let Tom a minute about how we look at urban and suburban and our view on that.","Thomas Toomey","Yes, Mike. One thing we found and we keep reading through everybody's research is there's lines between urban and suburban seem to be blurred in our view, because you're seeing a lot of these cities are really connecting both of those areas of their communities through enhancements in their transportation systems and jobs are moving around that transportation hubs. And so it's hard for us even when we look at particular cities to draw a distinction between urban product and suburban product.","What we're really more focused on as a company and where we allocate our capital is really kind of get more focused on our submarkets and where we think rent to income levels are supported, supply constraints might be greater, and the prospects out into the future.","And so you take Manhattan, which we've stepped into probably four years ago, we really looked at the market and said, we wanted it would be a B product in Manhattan. And then we thought over the long-term, that's where the greatest potential for either redevelopments or steady cash flow growth over time. And always felt that an A in Manhattan would be a tough deal, because that's a renter by unique standards and would be very frugal in terms of where they always move to the next new great deal.","And you contrast that where Bella Terra in Huntington Beach, the submarket to us was really attractive, because nothing had been built in 20 years. And it's very clear after putting up a 500 unit community, and Jerry leases it practically out in eight months that that was a good identified opportunity.","And so you will find us going forward and probably doing a better job of communicating it, is trying to articulate clearly why we think the submarkets that we're building in and the product that we'll have in that market, where it's positioned, and why we think over the long-term it creates greater value.","And so we're not trying to marry ourselves to an A product or B product or an urban or suburban, we're really trying to throw a very careful dart around a particular submarket and a particular product that we think over the long-term really generates the right returns. And I think that's what we are challenged to do and communicate in the future and you will see us do a better job of that.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Just as my follow-up then, probably for either Tom there. Given the pricing we're seeing in the market, we've seen a decent amount of compression in some of the B markets there, some of the B or secondary markets. And also, just given the appreciation in shares today, realize you guys put out the three-year plan. But is there any thought to potentially accelerating that especially with $553 million of debt maturing. Is there any thoughts rather to maybe accelerating some of that deleveraging? I know you had set out a gradual deleveraging plan, but just in light of the current capital environment.","Thomas Toomey","Tom will add some, but I would tell you this. I think asset pricing had some to room to run. The capital is stacked pretty darn deep, cash flows are growing, availability for leverage is still out in the marketplace at very attractive prices. So we think there is some room to run these asset prices, and by no measure calling a top on pricing. So I think we're going to continue to just expose assets, see where pricing comes in. If we feel like we're reaching a toping mechanism, we'll certainly revisit our strategy and our plan.","Thomas Herzog","I think Tom covered it. As it currently stands, Mike, we still do think that that matching the sales of non-core against development is the right approach. But certainly as conditions change, we'll revisit that. But that's currently where we stand.","Operator","And now we'll here from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Thanks guys, and Jerry, thanks for your remarks on the D.C. market. I know that you think there is going to be some more choppiness there for another nine to 12 months, but are there submarkets within D.C. that you feel might have already seen the worst?","Jerry Davis","Well, it's hard to tell. There is still more supply coming. I can tell you I'm a little encouraged for example at U Street. Again, we have Capital View and a property called View 14 that is in my same-store pool, that when I compare to last year, it's a bit better. I can also tell you it's interesting when I look at D.C. and I look at market rents compared to what they were a year ago. We're about within 1% of where they were a year ago, and they're actually 4% higher than they were at year end.","So there are some submarkets that I think have been fairly stable, when we look out it Woodbridge, when you look at some of our properties in the district around Logan Circle and places like that, things feel fairly stable. But again, wherever the new supply is going to continue to come out of the ground, I think you're still in for tough sledding.","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Any discernible change in how buyers in that market are underwriting assets there?","Harry Alcock","The truth is there is still a lot of demand for apartments in the good D.C. locations and pricing of recent trades reflects that. Buyers inevitably here are going to contemplate that the next year or two is going to be, call it, flat in terms of revenue growth. But the good product still has a plenty of buyer demand.","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","I guess maybe switching to Boston, if I could. Jerry, how are you thinking about Boston as supply comes into the market in the next two or three years? And then how would you compare that outlook for the market compared to what we've already seen in D.C., do you think it's going to be a similar impact or better or worse?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I'll start, and then I'll probably throw it over to Harry, since he looks more out in the future of the pipeline. I think what you're going see is this first wave of new supply, and what we show is it's going to grow by about 7,000 units in 2014, quite a bit in the CBD. Yes, that's about a 1.7% increase in supply.","And we felt over the last couple of years that the downtown area was actually slightly under supplied and could absorb quite a bit. And we're actually seeing that. We're holding up fairly well throughout Boston. Even our one property in the Back Bay I think had revenue growth of about 5%. So it's holding up.","I think it's definitely going to get choppy in some of the submarkets as they come. We have a property that we're pretty excited about down in the Seaport area. We love our location. It's going to be delivering in later in the first quarter. But there is going to be other supply that comes in proximate too and it's probably going to be to some degree a competitive world with some of the other new product coming.","But we like the job market in Boston, whether it's education, tech, financial. We think Boston can probably act more like Seattle, which had a lot of new supply as well as in Austin that had a lot of new supply, because you have high-quality jobs that are there to absorb it.","And I think that's one of the big differences when you compare to D.C. is, you had a situation where D.C. had excessive new supply, where you're adding 3% to 4% over the last couple of years of new product, and you had job growth that was basically zero. So I look at it with that kind of a difference. So we're a little more optimistic about Boston being more similar to Seattle and Austin than it is to a D.C. But Harry, anything you'd add?","Harry Alcock","I think you hit it. The main point is that there is a lot of good jobs being created in Boston, whereas in D.C. job growth is largely flattened out. If you just look at the jobs coming into the submarket adjacent to our Pier 4 project, in Seaport, that we'll begin delivering early next year, we spend over 2 million square feet of office that has either been delivered in the last year or is under construction, 70% or 75% of that is already leased.","Companies like Vertex relocating into the Seaport, taking 1.1 million square feet, which is 3,000 or 4,000 jobs. Goodwin Procter is taking 4,000 square feet in an office building right next to our Pier 4 project. So you do have an unusual amount of job growth that we expect will fuel demand for the apartments that are being delivered over the next couple of years.","Operator","And now we'll hear from William Kuo with Cowen and Company.","William Kuo - Cowen and Company","Just a point of clarification. As I look at the full-year guidance, it looked like at the midpoint revenue growth was revised up 12 bps. Occupancy was revised up 50 basis points. Does that imply that rent growth expectations came down a bit?","Jerry Davis","Not really. This is Jerry. The occupancy increase in guidance was really much more related to how well we've done in the first half of this year. We were able to hit 96.8% this quarter. I think year-to-date occupancy is 96.5%. Our expectation was really that the first half of the year we would probably be in the low 96%. We weren't as confident at that time that this outbound call center would be so successful. So it's really a continuation of the same occupancy we've had.","And I would tell you the increase in occupancy that we had in the first half of the year really was able to help fuel the revenue growth, because we actually came in a little bit under in the first half of this year in rent growth based on our original plan. So basically what I'm saying, I think occupancy continues roughly where it is. And you probably see a slight deceleration or flatness, if you will, in rent growth.","William Kuo - Cowen and Company","And then secondly, again, with the guidance, G&A went up about $1 million at the midpoint, and it looked like $0.6 million of that was from the long-term incentive plan. Is there something else making up that difference or is it more just a rounding thing?","Thomas Herzog","We had a couple of things going on in the G&A. There was about a $1 million of timing in the first half. We just had an acceleration of about a $1 million from what we would have in the second half. And the second thing is we did bump the guidance up at the midpoint, [Technical Difficulty]. You're correct, part of this is just delta based on performance. The other small amount is just miscellaneous other items.","Operator","And we'll hear from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS","Just a follow-up on the G&A question. Can you just quantify, I mean, if it is going up by whatever it was one at the midpoint. I mean was the savings in the same-store property operating expenses an offset to that?","Thomas Herzog","The G&A up by $1 million, it has no connection really with the same-store operating expenses at all. It's just two totally separate things.","Nick Yulico - UBS","And I'm just still a bit confused as to I mean the same-store NOI is better, the bond deal you got execution like you thought you would, the asset sales sounds like it have been a little better, the G&A is kind of an offset to that. And as it seems like again your FFO going up $0.01 and your adjusted FFO, it just seems like there will be more of a benefit from how the same-store did?","Thomas Herzog","Well, we said a couple of things. So same-store has improved with better results on the development as far as timing, the lease up on that. G&A is an offset. We did have some timing on the interest expense, where we've got the bond offering that occurred late in the June timeframe, we've got some timing on the sales. So when you factor all those components in, that's what's driving the $0.01 improvement.","Operator","And this will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll turn the call back over to Tom Toomey for closing remarks.","Thomas Toomey","Thank you for all of you, for your time and the comprehensive dialogue on the call. In summary, it was a very good quarter. We started out that way. We feel great about the quarter. It's a great time to be in the apartments business again.","And lastly, I'd say, we're very focused on our plan and in particular about building a strong 2015. We feel like we got a lot of right momentum, a lot of right operating strategies, execution on the development activity, the financing front. So we feel really great about the business and are looking forward to getting this year behind us and getting into '15.","With that, we'll sign off. And wish you to have a good happy summer.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation."],"20876":["UDR, Inc.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Vice President, Chris Van Ens. Thank you. Mr. Van Ens, you may now begin.","Chris Van Ens","Welcome to UDR's quarterly financial results conference call. A press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we've reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","Statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although, we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question and answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to UDR's Chairman and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Chris. And welcome to UDR's third quarter 2019 conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","Our robust third quarter results highlighted by same-store NOI growth of 3.9% and FFO as adjusted per share growth of 6% continue to demonstrate strong execution across all aspects of our business. 2019 has been a very active and productive year for UDR.","First, we accretively grew our business through $1.8 billion and completed our announced acquisitions that have significant operational and investment upsides in markets targeted for expansion. These were funded with premium priced equity and low cost debt.","Second, we continue to make great progress implementing our next generation operation platform that has and will continue to drive controllable margin expansion by fundamentally changing how we interact with our current and prospective residents while also creating efficiencies throughout our cost structure.","Third, we simplified our business by winding down the KFH JV and announced an agreement to have our relationship with MetLife via an [ph] accretive asset swap.","And fourth, we de-risked our enterprise by proactively taking advantage of low interest rate environment to repay high cost debt, extend our consolidated pro forma durations to over eight years, and reduce aggregate maturities to just 5% of our total debt over the next three years.","In short, the team has done a great job in 2019 of executing on all aspects of our value creation capabilities, which will set up 2020 for continued strong NOI and cash flow growth, all of which fits into our strategic objective of being a full cycle investment.","Last, we received good news on the ESG front with our public GRESB disclosure score improving to an A. This compares favorably versus our comp set and further exhibits our commitment to consistently improve our ESG framework.","With that senior management team would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all UDR associates for our continued hard work and for making 2019 a very special year.","I will now turn over the call to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results with the same-store revenue and expense and NOI growth of 3.7%, 3.1%. and 3.9%, respectively. Before delving into the quarterly details, let me take a moment to comment on how we view operations from 10,000 feet.","We prioritized cash flow growth, which is primarily driven by sustainable and consistent operating margin expansion and accretive capital allocation. Over the coming years, we expect that the ongoing implementation of our next-gen operating platform will not only satisfy our customers' desire for self-service, but will also drive the majority of our margin expansion by limiting controllable expense growth through a variety of efficiency initiatives and technological solutions.","To sum up, we are somewhat agnostic as to how margin expansion is achieved, given the drivers of that expansion will oscillate over time but we care deeply about achieving it. We think about revenue growth similarly, lease rates, occupancy and other income are the primary variables in our revenue growth equation.","At different points throughout the year and the real estate cycle, the importance of each variables contribution to our revenue growth fluctuates. As such our goal each and every quarter is to optimally manage these variables to maximize revenue growth, not fixate on a specific component of revenue growth.","In the third quarter, we continued to run an occupancy first strategy and harvest above trend other income growth, both of which offset new lease rate growth that was impacted by tough year-over-year comps, and elevated supply levels in some of our high rent markets such as the San Francisco Bay Area.","2019 deliveries have been back half loaded across the majority of our markets, and we saw some impact during the third quarter. For at least the next couple of quarters, we expect that this dynamic will continue to play out. Positively, we have not seen widespread irrational pricing on this new supply. Absorption has remained strong, up 5.3% renewal growth during the quarter was just 30 basis points below that of the second quarter. And third quarter resident turnover would have declined by 60 basis points after excluding the impact of move-outs from our short-term furnished home program, all of which reinforced that the lower-than-expected new lease rate growth was not a demand issue.","At the market level, the Monterey Peninsula, Seattle, and the San Francisco Bay Area, which represent 26% of our same-store NOI performed well, generating weighted average revenue growth of 5.9% in the quarter. Demand, occupancy, and other income contribution from items such as parking, short-term furnished rentals, and rentals of common area spaces generally remained strong in these markets. Although as previously referenced supply did impact new lease rate growth in the Bay Area.","Conversely, New York, Orange County and Dallas, which comprise 23% of our same-store NOI, continued to lag our portfolio growth with weighted average revenue growth of 1.7% primarily due to competitive supply. Although, New York continues to incrementally improve versus the past couple of years.","Moving on, the ongoing implementation and execution of our next-gen operating platform continues to drive the expansion of our controllable margin through initiatives that are and will reduce expense growth, thereby dropping more dollars to our bottom line. Year-over-year our same-store controllable margin grew 40 basis point due to controllable expense growth of just 1.2% in the third quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. On a normalized basis, we would expect these costs to be growing at an inflationary rate somewhere in the 3% range.","More specifically, the combined growth rate of personnel and repairs and maintenance expenses during the quarter was negative 0.1%, a solid achievement and representative of how limiting controllable expense growth will continue to expand our operating margin.","As a reminder, once fully implemented, our Next Gen Platform will fundamentally change how we interact with our customer and operate our portfolio. This will occur in stages and includes or will include, first gaining efficiencies through process improvement, outsourcing of certain non-customer facing tasks, and the centralization of sales operation.","Second, the installation of SmartHome Tech. We are currently over 27,000 homes into this program.","Third, a push towards self service via smart devices. This will include self-touring of our properties as well as a wide variety of other tasks, the residents used to have to visit our site office for, such as adding a pet to lease [ph].","And fourth, using big data and machine learning to drive revenue growth and greater efficiencies throughout our operating structure.","Finally, with regard to this topic, to achieve our goal of expanding controllable margin by 150 basis points to 200 basis points by year-end 2022 or $15 million to $20 million in incremental run rate NOI, we need the right team and the right culture in place. Over the years, our operating teams have accepted and supported the wide variety of other income initiatives we have implemented and our strong same-store growth results have reflected that.","While advancements like SmartHome Tech are fully replicable by any multifamily competitor willing to spend the necessary capital and operating team that embraces consistent evolution and a culture that thrives on it or not. We have both. Taken together, we tightened our full-year same-store revenue growth guidance range and reduced our same-store expense growth guidance by 15 basis points at the midpoint. Combined, these increased our full-year same-store NOI growth guidance range by 7.5 basis points at the midpoint.","Last, our $1.8 billion in year-to-date completed or announced acquisitions are performing in line with underwritten expectations. Nuts and bolts operating improvements, CapEx investment, and historical operating initiatives are all in the initial phases of implementation. While this level of growth has at times stretched our teams in the field and at the corporate office, we have a deep bench at UDR, which allowed many of our outstanding associates to advance their careers, by way of our expansion.","We are excited to overlay UDR's best-in-class operating platform onto these acquired properties and look forward to creating value over the next several years through the implementation of our next-gen platform.","In closing, I would like to thank all of our associates in the field and at corporate for producing another quarter of robust operating growth, while also continuing to embrace the future by our Next Gen Operating Platform. It has been an extremely eventful year, and I'm immensely proud of all of you.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.","Joe Fisher","Thank you, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results and updated full-year guidance, a transactions and capital markets update, and a balance sheet update.","Our third quarter earnings results came in at the midpoint to above the high-ends of previously provided guidance ranges. FFO adjusted per share was $0.52, approximately 6% higher year-over-year and driven by strong same-store and lease-up performance, accretive capital deployment, and lower interest rates.","Next, our full year guidance update. We raised our full-year FFO as adjusted guidance range by $0.005 at the midpoint to $2.07 to $2.09, driven by solid operations, interest expense savings, and capital deployment. A full guidance update including sources and uses expectations, the same-store updates Jerry referenced, and fourth quarter guidance ranges, is available on Attachment 15 of our supplement.","Moving on to transactions in capital markets. We have continued to drive long-term value creation and FFO accretion by remaining disciplined in our capital deployment and simultaneously match funding with low-cost equity and debt capital, all while pivoting to the best available risk-adjusted returns.","During the quarter, we acquired three apartment communities located at Norwood, Massachusetts; Englewood, New Jersey and Washington DC. The closing of the latter, 1301 Thomas Circle fully wound down our JV relationship with KFH. The three communities were acquired at an all-in valuation of $541 million and a weighted average year one NOI yield of 4.9% moving to the low-5s in year two.","In August, we announced a $1.8 billion transaction with our JV partner MetLife that further simplified UDR structure, will cut in half our JV exposure to just 5% of total NOI, will be accretive to future cash flow growth, increased exposure to target markets, and replaced lower multiple management fee income with higher multiple real estate income, all while minimizing cash needs.","As structured, we are under contract to acquire the approximately 50% interest, we did not previously own in 10 UDR\/MetLife JV operating communities, one community under development, and four development land sites, cumulatively valued at $1.1 billion or $557 million at UDR's share.","And we will sell approximately 50% interest in five JV communities valued at $645 million or $323 million at UDR's share to MetLife. After accounting for the assumption of in-place debt, our net cash outflow to complete the asset swap is expected to be approximately $105 million. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter subject to customary closing conditions and closing price adjustments.","Our year-to-date completed and announced acquisition activity now totals one $1.8 billion, including land for future development. These transactions are NAV accretive, have IRRs that exceed our weighted average cost of capital, were partially funded with the $962 million of equity issued in the last year at a weighted average 6% premium to consensus NAV and will be accretive to FFO per share growth rate in 2020 and beyond.","In addition, the acquired communities all have significant operational and investment upside, are primarily located in targeted expansion markets, and fit well with our Next Gen Operating Platform.","In September, we entered into a forward sales agreement under our ATM program for approximately 1.3 million common shares during the quarter. Expected proceeds are earmarked for another transaction, which we will provide additional information on at a future date. The final date by which shares sold under the forward sales agreement need to be settled is March 31st, 2020 as currently structured.","Moving on to debt, where we continue to take advantage of the low rate environment. During the quarter and subsequent to quarter end, we issued $800 million of long duration unsecured debt at a weighted average effective rate of 3.1%, $300 million of this debt qualified as a Green Bond and represented our first use of this ESG friendly product.","Proceeds have been or will be used to prepay $700 million of higher cost debt with a weighted average effective rate of 4.23%. Once completed, we will have only 5% of our debt coming due over the next three years, and our consolidated weighted average years to maturity will be eight years versus the 6.9 years reported at the end of the third quarter. Please see our third quarter earnings press release and supplement for further details on our transactional and capital markets activity.","Last the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, net of the commercial paper balance was $1.1 billion. Our consolidated financial leverage was 31% on undepreciated book value, and 24% on enterprise value inclusive of joint ventures. Our consolidated net debt to EBITDA ROE was 5.5 times and inclusive of joint ventures was 5.8 times.","We remain comfortable with our credit metrics and don't plan to actively lever up or down.","With that I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. So that we may address questions to as many participants as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. If you've additional question, you may wait in queue, and time permitting, those questions will be addressed. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Jerry. I appreciate the operating strategy color, which I guess helps to explain why blended lease rate growth was flat year-over-year versus positive the first two quarters. When you compare the current environment, I think your comments on supply, do you expect it to remain roughly flat going forward for the next few quarters or is there anything indicating an acceleration or deceleration from here?","Jerry Davis","I think it's going to be dependent, market by market. We do have several markets specifically San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County, and Orlando, where new supply has driven down new lease rate growth compared to where it was last year where we had strength in those markets.","On the opposite side you've got strength in New York City, Orange -- I mean the Inland Empire and Seattle. So it's all going to be dependent on the effects of that new supply. Currently, we see in the fourth quarter, new lease rate growth is probably going to be down compared to where it was last year. But when we look at renewal rate growth, which this quarter was at 5.3% that's the highest level, these past couple of quarters since it's been in 2016, I think it's going to continue to be strong.","The other thing we looked at, Nick, is when you look at the next quarter. Over the last four years it averaged probably about 0.3%; 2016, it was very low single digits; 2017, the fourth quarter was actually negative 0.5%. It rebounded the following year in 2018 to a 1.1% and this year, we expect it to be somewhere closer to the average. So it will be less than it was last year. But I think that's more indicative of the effects supply had back in '17, which kept new lease rate growth down. So when you anniversary, 2018 it was elevated, and now we are seeing that supply hit us in a couple of markets. And we're also comping against tougher numbers from last year.","Nick Joseph","That's helpful, thanks. And then you've been active on the capital raising front and in terms of equity doing a handful different ways. So assuming you have a use, how do you think about executing going forward between marketed deals, the ATM, and then on a forward basis?","Joe Fisher","Yes. Hi, Nick, this is Joe. I think the critical part of that that you referenced there is assuming that we have limited [ph] use, we've endeavored over the last 12 months to make sure that when we do raise capital on the equity side, we do have a match funded use teed up for it. So we haven't done any special lot [ph] of equity that we sit on and then force our transaction team to go out there and execute upon. So I think you'll continue to see that from that front. From a pipeline standpoint, Harry may have some comments here, but I think our pipeline today is probably a little bit lighter than we've seen at any point in the last 12 months, but if we do go out there again, we're going to make sure that we have premium cost of capital relative to NAV from a used standpoint, make sure it's in our target markets, make sure that we can deploy it accretively year one, and on a forward basis, and make sure that the assets have either operational investments or a platform story with them to keep driving 2020 growth and beyond. So if we have more to talk about on that front, we'll obviously come back to the market.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","John Kim","Thank you. Just a follow-up on the leasing spreads, which were healthy but down sequentially and then also it sounds like the fourth quarter will be down year-over-year, how should we think about the translation of that into same-store revenue next year and then also were the leasing spreads this quarter in line with your projections?","Jerry Davis","Leasing spreads in third quarter were down a bit from the original projections, mainly because we didn't fully anticipate the effect that new supply specifically in places like San Francisco. We're going to have on our new lease rates, on a blended basis again, they were down a bit, not as much as on the new because the renewals were higher, but we're not currently ready to give any indication or any numbers on 2020, we're in the midst of the budget process right now. I can tell you, when we look at supply next year, it's probably going to be slightly higher than it was this year, specific to a few markets that we operate in, we think Boston will be a bit more impacted by supply, you're going to have Los Angeles continuing to be affected by supply, I think the San Francisco supply issues that I've talked about earlier on this call, I think they probably persist through the first half of next year, but I think you see a little bit of relief in New York as well as in Orange County next year. And I think Seattle will feel some supply, I think the demand side of the equation should stay strong there.","Joe Fisher","Yes, I think, John, this is Joe, just beyond as you asked about 2020, obviously going through the fundamental side of the equation, but what we've really been focused on this year, when you look at activities that were taken for '19 to try to impact '20, what we've been doing on the balance sheet front to improve quality of the balance sheet and also drive accretion, all the transactional activity trying to drive accretion there and then all the platform work that Jerry talked about in his opening remarks trying to drop more cash to the bottom line next year and on a go-forward basis. So we're still working through on the fundamental side, but I think, on a relative basis, we're doing everything we can to set up the portfolio and platform to be in a better position next year.","John Kim","Okay. And then, Joe, with your cost of new debt declining by 140 basis points over the past year, can you quantify how much that changed the yields you're willing to take on investments, including both acquisitions and Mezz debt?","Joe Fisher","Yes. I think on the Mezz debt side, I think the compression and yields that you've seen out there actually to some degree have worked against us, meaning that developers and other capital constituents have either more access to capital at lower rates or the competition for deploying that capital gets a little bit more difficult, so you've seen us do a little bit less on the DCP side. That said, you do see guidance on Attachment 15, we did take up our guidance range for Developer Capital Program. I do want to point out, however, at this point, that is a speculative transaction, nothing has been signed, so there is no guarantees that gets to the finish line nor any guarantees on the exact timing, but I do think it's important to note that that is not a typical DCP deal for us, meaning it's more of a bridge loan with the ability to access to the asset in about 12 months upon stabilization.","So the yield we will receive on that if in fact we get that done, it's going to be decidedly lower than what we've done on other DCP deal. So just from a modeling standpoint, keep that in mind. Aside from that, the cost of capital coming down and improving on both the debt and equity side, clearly has allowed us to be more competitive and be out there with an external growth signal that we've received. And so, we're still trying to make sure we make good deals, we don't pay beyond market, and every deal has a story to it whether it's the target markets or the operational upside that go with it. So I wouldn't say it's given us just a free pass to go out there and be overly aggressive just because our cost of capital has come down. We still got to be disciplined on that front.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Well, this is actually [indiscernible] with Shirley. I was just wondering if you guys could give us a little bit more color on any of the rent regulation. So particularly on California, how is that going to impact and what you're thinking about that new regulatory environment with the talks of Prop 10 2.0 coming back, are you reconsidering your exposure to California at all?","Jerry Davis","I'll start with the effect of maybe 1482, we went back and looked at it, and I think everybody's familiar with it, but it said four properties over 15 years old, that renewal rates will be, increases will be capped at 5% plus CPI. So when we went back and looked at the effect to next year, it's probably somewhere in that $250,000 to $350,000 range which for our California portfolio would impact 2020 same-store revenue growth by, call it 7 or 8 basis points, so not overly material. Can you repeat what your second question was?","Unidentified Analyst","We heard there is\u2026","Joe Fisher","Prop 10.","Unidentified Analyst","About bringing Prop 10 back. So does that, have you guys talked about it, are you reconsidering exposure to California?","Joe Fisher","Yes. Hello, it's Joe. Yes, just from an overall portfolio standpoint, I think it's fair to assume that all markets are going to go through their micro cycles, whether it's demand, supply, or regulatory environments. So it's clearly going to be something that we take into effect when we think about transactions in California. We continue to believe that anything that restricts economic or rent growth or economic value creation, it's probably not the right solution to affordability. But it's a qualitative factor that plays into our process, and some of the benefits of having the diversified portfolio that we do that we don't end up overexposed to any one regulatory environment, and gives Harry and team more degrees of freedom from which to transact over time, but I would say it's not as simplistic and binary as blue states bad, red states good. Given that there is a second derivative impact on capital flows and capital formation, so if capital does shift from, say California to a red state or non-rent controlled state, you may see more development in those states, and therefore less rent growth, and so we're trying to factor all those pieces together, but it's not quite as easy of a binary decision as some may think. So it's something we're contemplating and thinking about.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.","Rich Hightower","Good morning out there, guys. So, Joe, I want to dig in a little bit to these, the two big JV deals during the quarter, so it's pretty clear from a strategic and a financial perspective why these are beneficial, just maybe walk us through the genesis of the transactions, unwinding one, and significantly reducing the involvement of the other, is there anything related to the partnership or to the timing of sort of a finite life sort of agreement, just walk us through maybe some of those other elements as to why this happened at this moment in time.","Tom Toomey","Hi, Rich, this is Tom Toomey. Let me try to address those questions. With respect to the KFH, the JV had run 10 years and KFH wanted to explore what the market value of it was and we expose the assets to the market and as you can see over this year two of them were sold, and one of them we purchased, and on a net cash basis, not a lot of capital and. And so I think it's not more complicated than that with KFH. On Met, we're 10 years as partners, and we've done a lot of business with Met over the years, and it's a constant dialog about how we create win-win situations whether at the development, acquisition, or swapping assets, or selling them, and that dialog started up probably late in 2018 and it just takes time. No strategic rationale other than a constant dialog with a good capital partner and one that we hope will continue to do a lot of business with in the future. So very grateful for them as a partner. And I think we've always done win-win transactions with them, they think a lot about real estate the same way we do, a long-term operating business that creates a lot of wealth and value over time. So good group of people.","Rich Hightower","Okay. And that's helpful. So there is nothing specifically related to sort of simplicity as a strategy for UDR, in that sense, I mean there is an equal chance another round of JVs could form at some point in the future. Is that what you're also hinting at there?","Tom Toomey","No, I'm not hinting at anything. I'm giving you kind of the facts as we see them with respect to our JV footprint and the future of it. And I think JVs are always what problem are you trying to solve or what skill does someone bring to the enterprise or to the relationship that can help you grow UDR. And we've got a good cost of capital. We've got a growing capable enterprise that has a lot of different ways to add value, if we felt that someone could help us enhance that, certainly, we would be back into a joint venture. Right now, don't see any needs. Don't see any part of the organization that we would like to grow faster or more. So I think we're right now probably not overly engaged by joint venture activity as much as you can tell from the activity of this year. Got a lot of value creation mechanisms in the enterprise, we're playing them all, they're all doing well. I'm really looking forward to 2020 and the continued growth of the Ops platform.","Rich Hightower","Got it. Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next call is from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, good morning, everyone. Jerry, I guess with some of the softening in market rent growth hitting your markets and some new lease rates pulling back, have you guys pulled back at all in the SmartHome spend a revenue enhancing CapEx? And would you consider pulling back I guess next year because maybe the returns aren't as attractive today in light of some of the supply, near term supply headwinds?","Jerry Davis","Yes, I guess, starting with the SmartHome spend. As we said, we're about 27,000 units in, and just to remind you, we're doing the SmartHome for few reasons, we're not doing it purely to get rent growth out of the residents. We do think they value it. We think it's part of what's helped drive our outsized renewal growth, so far this year. But the primary purpose of doing it is some of the expense reduction capabilities it gives us.","First of all, it has benefits on leak detection, it also makes our maintenance guys much more efficient. But one of the big things it does, it sets up this operating platform that we're building to allow us to more actively and efficiently do self-guided tours which we plan to roll out more through automation. This year, we've been doing self-guided tours, but it's an old school. we've paper maps, we see throughout next year and we'll get much more automated, and we think the ability for prospective residents to be able to access units through a SmartHome rather than through a hard physical key is going to be beneficial. So while we underwrote it based on rents, there was plenty of extra juice on the expense side and what we expect to get on the operating platform that would enhance that. So I would tell you, we haven't finalized our budgets for next year of how many SmartHomes we will continue to add, but I would expect that you will see a continuation of the program into 2020.","As far as revenue enhancing spend, which over the last couple of years has been at that $40 million range. Yes, we still think you get paid for that. On incremental dollars, it really isn't overly affected by market rents. We underwrite these things to get an IRR that's at least 150 basis points of our WACC. There is a discipline to doing this, we look to do it in markets that show strength over the next 4 to 10 years not just over the next year. So for long-term, looking at ways to increase the value of our real estate by deploying this capital. And I wouldn't expect next year for the total spend to change much.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great, appreciate your thoughts. And then Joe, just curious why include the speculative DCP investment in guidance today if conditions are more competitive. I think you referenced, returns aren't quite as attractive. And why not just use that available dry powder to fund the transaction that you reference, that you have good line of sight on, that you intend to fund with kind of the forward equity?","Joe Fisher","Yes, the transaction that I referenced in my opening remarks is in fact that DCP transaction. So the forward equity commitment that we made there of $64 million, we raised that with the intention and desire and hope that we get that transaction to the finish line on the DCP side and that ultimately takes care of the majority of that funding and our capital plan. So those are one and the same. So don't consider the DCP as a speculative unknown transaction. It's known, we're working towards getting that papered and hopefully have some to talk about in the coming months.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay, got it. That's kind of what I was looking for. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your questions.","Trent Trujillo","Hi, good morning. Jerry, one of your peers spoke about piloting an amenity light model, is that something you'd consider particularly in the context of your recent commentary of renting out common area and some amenity spaces?","Jerry Davis","Yes, I'll start and I'll let Harry or Tom jump in. We haven't talked definitively about any of this, but we have looked at what amenities do residents value, and we've actually gone out in the last year or two and looked at our properties that we felt were somewhat over amenitized, and we've been able to convert some of those amenities into apartment homes, and one of the Vitruvian Park assets, Savoye and Savoye II, we converted three common areas into five or six rentable units, and we do look for those types of opportunities. But I think at the high end of the market, you do get paid for amenities, but I do think in some places people are just looking for an inexpensive place to live, and there probably is a product that fits that, Harry, you can talk to whether you've really been looking at that for future development opportunities?","Harry Alcock","Yes, I think, I mean it really gets into sort of a return on investment type analysis where whatever the customer will pay in rents is determined by the location of the product, the quality of the finishes, and the quality of the amenities. So when we look to buy an asset, when we look to develop an asset or when we look to convert these types of amenity spaces into units, we're entirely rational in our approach. I think for certain assets and certain locations that gets an interesting model, but again we look at each asset on its own merits.","Trent Trujillo","Okay, that's fair. So I guess for those Vitruvian assets, the Savoye, what are you underwriting for those redevelopments?","Jerry Davis","It's, again it's 5 or 6 units, and I think we underwrote those at about a, I think 7% to 8% return cash on cash.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. And just maybe one quick follow-up on that same similar subject. Under the current operating model, how would you characterize the resident perceptions having the current space utilized by non-residents, have there been any complaints or disruptions or is it fair to say that you can continue to generate incremental income from renting out that space?","Jerry Davis","I guess I'd start with saying, have there been any complaints? Yes, there have been a few. I think percentage wise to the number of actual rentals we get on these third-party common area rentals, it's de minimis. We are very cognizant that the predominant use of those amenities as for our residents, so we do not over book them. A lot of the bookings happen during the day for businesses when most of our residents aren't at home. But they're probably have been a few times where we've over utilized a rooftop type of amenity or a large common areas space and we've heard back from the residents and we've ratcheted it back down.","That being said, do I think it can grow? Yes, I definitely do, I think it has a lot of prominence in urban areas. We've seen a high take rate on the West Coast. I think it's migrating slowly to some of the East Coast markets, and I think over time, you'll probably see the West Coast grow at a moderate rate, and I would expect to see -- I mean the West Coast grow at a more moderate rate and probably more of the growth on the common are rentals happen in the East Coast as it becomes much more known in the marketplace that you can come and rent those common area spaces from multifamily operators.","Trent Trujillo","Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your questions.","Rob Stevenson","Hi guys. Jerry, the Dallas weakness you alluded to the fact it's supply driven, is that weakness across basically all the sub-markets or is it submarket specific and how does it sort of trend by price point?","Jerry Davis","I would tell you it obviously is not as weak at the lower price points, we have some old legacy assets in our Vitruvian Park location that are doing well, our product up in Legacy Village, though Plano is badly new supply, both in North Plano, but probably a little bit more in Frisco, so while there's good job growth up there, it's been going head to head with new supply. You also have supply pressures, they're one property down in Uptown that's feeling that [ph]. Our newer assets that are in the Met JV and Vitruvian Park, they're doing better, the net same-store average, but they are still also battling new supply. So I would tell you supply tends to be occurring or being delivered up and down at the Tollway, and our entire portfolio is up and down the Tollway. So we may be feeling that more than some of our peers, but it's definitely more at the high end, the B, B minus properties that we have in Addison though are doing much better than the A product, it's probably a couple, several hundred basis point differential in revenue growth.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then, Joe, given all the capital raises, factoring in the MetLife settlements, the other obligations on this potentially new DCP deal that you want to do, how much capital do you have available to invest today in properties, other DCP deals, etc., and stay comfortably within your target leverage levels without having to raise incremental equity, I mean if Harry comes to you with the $500 million portfolio or a $1 billion portfolio, do you have to issue equity for that at this point or where is that sort of threshold today for you after all of the capital raises and various other things are set and done?","Joe Fisher","Yes. Hi, thanks, Rob. Throughout the year, we've done a lot of activity that's going to incrementally improve balance sheet in terms of extending weighted average duration, continue to improve the three-year liquidity profile where we have minimal debt maturities coming during next couple of years, and then trying to stay relatively stable on things like debt to EBITDA, fixed charge, debt to enterprise, and all those have improved slightly relative to 2018 levels keeping us at a very solid BBB plus, so we probably have a little bit of capacity today. I wouldn't say nearly on the magnitude of you referenced even a $0.5 billion, $100 million, $200 million if we want to utilize it, but it's also good to have that for a rainy day and keep that capacity in the back pocket. So we'll continue to evaluate, do we want to utilize it for additional acquisitions, DCP, etc., or do we utilize dispositions, free cash flow, or equity. So we'll keep looking at it.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Anderson","Thanks, good afternoon. So, Jerry, on the margin expansion initiatives, looks like you can get to controllable margin of 85-ish percent in a couple of years. I'm curious if there is any incremental more or less impact on the total margin in the kind of 70% range, does that go up at a faster rate, because of all this effort or slower rate versus controllable?","Jerry Davis","I think it's probably going to go up at roughly the same rate with the changes -- maybe a little more elevated, but you're really doing -- taking effect to everything except real estate taxes and insurance. So I guess it would be slightly more elevated than it would be on the controllable side.","Rich Anderson","Yes, okay. I was just thinking about the math. On the flyer, and then maybe for Joe on the DCP side, and it's kind of going back and forth, Chris [ph] on this while we're talking, but you have $264 million of investment in the DCP program, I know you can't really have a pinpointed number, but what does that represent roughly in terms if you were to take out everything and own it all 100%, what is $264 million mean in terms of incremental spend to get them all in in-house?","Joe Fisher","Yes, if we want to bring all of those in-house, you're looking at an asset value clearing to $1 billion, we already have $260 plus million of that stack, if you think about what our typical leverage profile would be, the $260 million [ph] would be a portion of our equity stack, so you're probably looking at a $400 million - $500 million check, you also have participation on three of those transactions, which depending on if we buy or if we sell, either way, we're going to participate in the upside on those. So the good thing is though, we stack those up as a typical debt maturity profile. So some come into 20, 21, 22, 23 so you don't have a whole series of decisions coming at you at one point in time by design, so that we aren't in a box in terms of not having a cost of capital, but wanted to own all of those assets. So we'll make the decisions over time.","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Jerry Davis","Yes, go ahead Tom.","Tom Toomey","I'd just add one, thanks for hanging on for the hour and 10 minutes. Second part of that is clearly, anything that we would look at, a 1031 option would be one avenue to pursue within a marketplace. And all of the DCPs have always been entered under the premise of an asset that we would like to own at the right price at the right time. So it's a very good question, and I think we'll play them out as Joe has highlighted, they come to every year one or two deals, and we'll look at them at that time.","Rich Anderson","Right. But is DCP is your sort of development avenue of choice now, just looking at the disclosure, I guess, is that correct?","Tom Toomey","I don't know if it's over choice. I think we always look at the rainbow of complete opportunities, and you can see from the acquisition opportunities, we took advantage of this year, they were clearly assets that we thought were next door down the street, under-managed, there were some value add, beyond just our current operating platform but the platform of the future or a CapEx infusion that could ride the ship. I think as we look down the road towards development, we're going to stay disciplined about our underwriting aspect of that. It's been hard in the last three plus years to make things penciled the right way and you've seen it shrink. This quarter we announced one deal. We've been working on it for three years to get it to that point. Finally, the numbers came in, it's something that worked, and we announced it. I'm not sure that I could say, development is going to expand or shrink, I think we just stay disciplined across all spectrums whether it's DCP, acquisitions, or development, and the fact that we can do all three doesn't put us pressure to only grow one channel.","Rich Anderson","Yes. Okay, got you. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Hi guys, just taking a step back, high-level question for me. I'm thinking about some of the commentary you've said in the past about predictive analytics and focusing on underserved markets, I was struck by how well Baltimore did in this quarter, but I'm wondering if you could maybe just expound upon your predictive analytics and what that's telling you about what markets you should be in and maybe what markets you shouldn't be in?","Joe Fisher","Yes. Thanks, Rich. Baltimore obviously is not a large market for us today, so it's not a high number of properties, so predictive analytics is really intended to drive decisions over the next 4 to 10 years, i.e., longer duration hold periods. So the fact that it's working this quarter may not mean it works again next quarter. But what we're trying to do is be -- to some degree, can turn [ph] from the herd in terms of following what the underlying demographics and economic drivers are telling us relative to rents or affordability in those markets, many markets tend to get overheated and capital tends to follow that excitement. We're trying to go a little bit of a different route with that and go more contrarian as you've seen that through our actions. Baltimore been an example, we've been active there active in Philly, New York, very active up in Boston and down in Tampa. So, some markets that, but I don't see a lot of the private and public capital flowing into as aggressively, we also like Southern California though, so it's not purely an East Coast bias that we're looking at. But hopefully that gives us a little bit of a leg up in addition to the transaction team that really has to find the right sub-markets and assets and the operation team that once, given the asset, can outperform with everything they're doing on the initiatives on platform side.","Rich Hill","Okay, that's helpful. I think that's all for me. I'm sure we'll follow up soon.","Joe Fisher","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a more general like operations based question, I guess. We've seen turnover go down year-over-year for a while now, I think it's been a trend, the cycle pretty much. Will you have your turnover basically stable this quarter? Do you think that's just an aberration or it's just a shift in trend, obviously overall an LTM basis is still very low, but just wondering how you see that change, or are you seeing something in the market that is different from the rest of the cycle?","Jerry Davis","No, I don't think we're seeing anything different. I think what you're seeing with all of this, seeing, turnover go down, it's a few things, one, I think all of the REIT peers are listening to the residents better, doing a better job on customer service and resident ratings. Second, I think you've seen predominantly rational pricing of lease-ups over the last couple of years. So it's not enticing people to leave multi-family and jump ship for two months free. One thing that makes us a bit different than the peers is we've got this short-term furnished rental program that has grown quite a bit year-over-year. And this year it's up about 50%. So if you backed the effect of short-term furnished rental move-outs, and these things usually stay occupied for 80 or so days. So it elevates your turnover rate, but if you back it out of both years, we would have actually been down 60 basis points.","And then, I guess the third point when people say, how low can it go? I think part of it is, what level of renewal increase are you going to send out, and I think when you look at the renewals, we've been sending out in 2Q and 3Q, both north of 5%. We look to maximize revenue. We're doing that, while still maintaining occupancy at that 96.9% level, which was 10 bps higher than it was last year's third quarter. So, I think you got to look at it at the entire revenue stream and not just what's turnover, what's rate growth, and we try to balance all of those factors.","Tom Toomey","Hardik, this is Toomey. Just to add a couple of things that come to mind from me. When I look at the last decade and our average resident has gone from 28 years of age to 38. People in their 30s, 40s, not inclined to just move at a high turnover rate, they're pretty established and stay. Second, you look at their income levels. And third, I think about the product that we're offering them and the variety of amenities, lifestyle, service levels that have grown over the last decade. And I think that combination of just a better place to live, the stage in life, and higher service levels have combined to drive that number down, and I don't see a particular reason why I would see it revert back to the norm or the past, if you will.","So, I think we're just doing a better job and we've got demographics and our customer on our side.","Hardik Goel","Thanks. That's a really thoughtful response. Jerry, just one quick follow-up. You mentioned, excluding furnished housing, it's down 60 basis points. What percentage of the leases that turn, percentage of turnover is furnished housing? Just so I have a rough sense.","Tom Toomey","Why don't you get back to him?","Jerry Davis","Yes, let me get back to you on that. I don't have that, I don't want to make a guess, we'll get back to you with that number.","Hardik Goel","No worries. All right.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Babin","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to touch on the acquisitions during the quarter briefly, I think it was mentioned that there is some CapEx opportunity or some under management at these properties. I was just curious, looks like the Windsor Gardens, 50 years old, obviously CapEx probably part of that story. Do those amounts in the release include the potential CapEx going into them to get the yields that were discussed or I think just in a general sense it might be helpful if you elaborate on them, how you view those acquisitions from a core value add standpoint, kind of what the unique opportunity is?","Joe Fisher","Hi Drew, this is Joe. I'll take it really quick and then kick it over to Jerry and Harry to talk a little bit more about the dynamics of the transactions. But the number that's referenced in the release on Attachment 13 and within our guidance, are not inclusive of any initial capital expenditure budgets that we intend to put in place over the next year or two to improve properties or KMBs or smart homes or anything of that nature. So you'll see that spend come through over time. What you see on there -- on the Attachment 13, it's just simply the price that we paid for that acquisition.","Jerry Davis","And I guess I'll give you a little bit of insight on Commons at Windsor Gardens, Drew. First, it's a 30-minute train ride into Boston's Back Bay and the train stop is on our property. Rents are 50% or less of what Boston, rents are, so I'd say it's a good price point for a short commute. On the CapEx spend, there are about 200 of the 914 units that have never had their interiors renovated, meaning it has original kitchens and baths. We see opportunity to invest some money in those and get a rent increase somewhere in the $250 to $300 range. The property has not been sub-metered, so we are going through the process of scoping that out and ideally we'll get sub-meters installed over the next several months and be able to start recouping some of the cost of our water sewer utilities.","We expect to put SmartHomes into this property, which will make it much more efficient to manage plus give the property more of an update. And then we're going to spend some money, just getting some of the systems back up to speed and upgraded, so that R&M spend that's been occurring over the last 5 to 10 years is reduced. After you do that, I think the entire UDR operating platform that you've heard us talk quite a bit about fits perfectly with the property like this. It's sort of a good size at 900 units to probably gain even more efficiency than we would on a typical 300 unit deal. So this one definitely have some capital upgrades.","And then on the operating side, we think there's a lot of pricing opportunities where the prior owner did not give any locational premiums. So being close to the train versus being a 15-minute walk from the train stop, price was the same. No pricing differential between being on the third floor and the first floor or near the amenity buildings. So I think there's a lot we can also accomplish there. Currently there are no charges for parking spaces there, and as you know, over the last several years, we've been able to implement that and see good growth. So a lot of things we've done over the last five years, I think we'll be able to lay over onto this property. And then I think again, when you look at the operating platform as it gets rolled out throughout UDR over the next couple of years, Windsor Gardens will participate in that also.","Harry Alcock","And Drew, this is Harry. I guess I'd just layer on and I'd probably step back from the more macro standpoint. As we've talked about most of our acquisitions this year have had some sort of operation or capital upside, I think Joe mentioned that the first year cap rate for this year's portfolio of acquisitions is somewhere around 4.9%. However, year two, 7.5% or 8% higher than that, and we're talking about something around 5.25 to 5.3, then the third year is incrementally better than that as the sort of operational platform initiatives and the capital spend that starts to manifest itself in the yield.","Andrew Babin","That's great detail. Thank you. And just one follow-on for Jerry. As you look at the MetLife assets that are being bought in wholly owned, I presume that your ability to asset manage those increases with full ownership, and I guess what do you find kind of most opportune or most excited about being able to kind of fully control those assets and get in there and apply the strength of the platform?","Jerry Davis","I think some of it is going to be in revenue enhancing CapEx spend, several of these assets are hitting that 10 to 12 years old level, and we think a refresh will help them better compete against new supply, and on that incremental spend, we still think we can get a return in excess of our WACC. So I think that's one of the components. I think some of these properties are very approximate to existing UDR product, for example, the one in Towson is directly across the street from a wholly-owned property and to be able to manage those somewhat together and share staffing and other cost, I think will make both properties more efficient.","Some of the other things we've done historically whether it's common area rentals or short-term furnished, I think given more leeway, we may be able to garner more benefit there too. So I think it's a little bit on the capital side, a little bit on the operational side, and with initiatives and some on the efficiencies of sharing team members.","Andrew Babin","Great, thank you. That's all for me.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your questions.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hi, good morning out there. I'll be quick, it's been a long call. So two quick ones. First for Joe. The ESG bonds that you referenced before, did you guys get any pricing advantage with those or is it more just sort of check the box and for marketing purposes to have sort of an ESG issuance out there?","Joe Fisher","It's hard to tell whether or not we got an explicit pricing advantage. I will say when you look at the composition of the investors on that offering, about 25% of them did come in from an ESG focused fund. And so having obviously a bigger order book helps drive pricing at the end of the day. I'd like to believe that there was some benefit, although it's very hard to quantify, what is that clear benefit is.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second one is for Jerry, on the mobile initiatives that -- the self-help initiatives that you guys are rolling out. Do you think that you'll still be able to get sort of the rent premiums that you expect for your properties or as Avalon noted on their call, there may be properties where you get a lower rent, but the trade-off is that you have less operating expense and net you're better.","Jerry Davis","I will tell you the things we're doing, it's more on the service side. It's not that we're taking away an amenity. So we believe our residents prefer self-service, I think it's enhanced service. So when you look at, you look at what we've done so far this year, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, if you look at our repairs and maintenance and personnel cost combined, year-over-year growth was slightly negative. It should be growing at probably at least 3%. So a lot of people would say, well, that's a reduction in service. No, it was just a reallocation of how we provide service, and it was predominantly done through outsourcing and centralization.","At that same time as we drove those costs down, our NPS scores went up 10% to 34%. As we noted earlier, our turnover, if you back out the effective short-term furnished rentals, was down 60 basis points, we're running at 96.9%, which is 10 basis points higher than last year, and I think if you look at the revenue growth that we put up to 3.7%, it's sector-leading. So I think when you factor all of those in, it's clear that when we're doing this, the intention is to improve customer service, not take it down, but to make a more efficiently run organization through this, either through outsourcing, centralization or automation. So our intent is, it will not be a reduction in service and it will not drive rents lower.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Malkin","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. A couple of years ago, the Bay Area saw some significant supply that caused market rents to go down quickly pretty significantly. I'm just wondering kind of alluding to your supply comments, I think San Jose has a fair amount of supply coming. Are you doing certain things to sort of get ahead of that in terms of increasing occupancy, anything with rents to sort of derisk that as the supply rolls into those markets?","Jerry Davis","Hi, Neil. This is Jerry. I wouldn't say we're doing thing explicit on the pricing side. I mean, we definitely believe at this time in the cycle, we want to keep occupancy high. So we're not being excessively aggressive pushing occupancy down. So we are in an occupancy first mode today. I think you're right. Several years ago, San Francisco or the Bay Area supply came in hard whether it was down in San Jose, Santa Clara, or in Soma, it did heavily impact market rates as concessionary levels got elevated. We're not seeing quite as much of a concessionary effect today, we are seeing supply comp. As we look at supply next year, it is going to come down and effect San Jose. It's also going to affect Mountain View a little bit more than it did this year, but I think it's predominantly back half of this year and first half of next year loaded.","I think when you look at job growth that's happening, especially in that Soma, as well as Mission Bay area, I think it should absorb fairly well. And I think when you look at what new lease rate growth is today, a lot of that is based on how strong the market was a year ago, because there was limited supply coming in, and there was great job growth. So I don't see it quite being or being what it was several years ago, I just think we're having to work our way through some supply pressures over the next 9 to 12 months. But on the demand side, I think things still look strong.","Neil Malkin","All right\u2026","Tom Toomey","Neil, this is Toomey. I would to add a little bit to that. One thing, Mike and Jerry are always focused on, is the concessionary level in the marketplace because at one month free rent on a lease-up that generally gets the new customer in the marketplace and doesn't impact our renewal environment. And you can see that in the numbers today and you heard it in our commentary earlier. And though you alluded to San Francisco, and as I recall that market went to two months to three months free rent and that really upsets the cart on the renewal process, and we lose a lot of pricing power on that side of the equation. So as long as we're in one-month free kind of concessionary market and that's what we anticipate is coming at us in some of these markets, I think our revenue streams will hold up pretty strong because of the low turnover and we're not enticing that long term resident to just move out. So, the one thing I wish the sell side would track more of is the concessionary market because it's probably a precursor to real pricing power or pricing exposure.","Neil Malkin","Okay, that's helpful I appreciate that, Tom. Other one for me is, I was reading that you guys are participating in a program called Rhino, a service called Rhino, it's basically to forego a security deposit, the tenant would pay for some sort of insurance program. Is that something that has been successful? Are you planning on rolling that out more? And any color on that would be helpful.","Jerry Davis","Yes. This is Jerry. I will tell you, we are talking to Rhino, we have not engaged. We think their product may have legs, it's something that we're trying to compare with some programs that have some similarities that we've used in the past and we're trying to get more comfortable that some of the negatives of the prior program don't replicate themselves. But it's something we're looking at. I think anytime you can look at opportunities that can help your resident which this product seems like it could because it's less cash upfront to move into an apartment, and protect us on the collection side. If it's a win-win, just like a lot of initiatives we rolled out in the past, we would probably be in favor of it, but we're still in -- the exploration stage have not piloted any of it yet, but it's something we're looking at.","Neil Malkin","All right. Thanks Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Haendel [ph] with Mizuho, please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","So it's 1 hour and 10 minutes into this call. I'm just kidding. So -- out there; first question for me is on margin. I guess I'm curious, I know you talked about it before, but what type of margin improvement or expansion, do you think you can generate on the assets you're buying in from MetLife, now that you completely own and control them ballpark-ish?","Jerry Davis","When you look at those, it's probably a couple, it's 100 to 150 basis points, most likely, higher than we're at. We've looked at it more on the next couple of years. So we haven't gotten excessively specific. There are multiple programs that we had on the cost structure that we had already rolled into the UDR wholly owned platform previously. And in addition to that, when you look at what we've indicated, we expect to get from the Next Gen Operating Platform of 150 to 200 basis points, I think you get a little bit more juice out of those.","And then you know the second part is, on some of this CapEx spend we're going to have, we should be able to drive revenue up, but probably, we've looked at it more on a return basis, but I don't have the exact margin expansion of top of my head.","Tom Toomey","But Haendel, this is Toomey. What I would add, as you look at the, the acquisitions that we've done, in particular the Boston one, where we might look at it today, and we think somewhere 600 to 700 basis point expansion, when that fully implemented in the Ops platform is available. And so the key is, it is not going to be what we to be what can do to our portfolio, well, excuse me, it is going to be a key, but what we can do with the potential acquisitions from private market operators who won't have the platform or the technology and then that leads to a real lift in our growth rate when we can buy at market or below market and then overlay the platform on top of it and get that type of margin expansion. So the story is not just what we can do to ours, but what we can do to the industry and the potentials that it leads to.","Unidentified Analyst","Helpful. Thanks Tom. And while I have you, I guess, understand you make long-term investment decisions that your -- and also that your market predictive model also helps you make capital or portfolio strategy decision over a longer term period, but I want to go back to Dallas, once again, 3.5% of NOI in the market that just seems to have been a regular under performer here over the last couple plus years, and so understand supply in Uptown, some other challenges that you have in [indiscernible] but I guess I'm curious if you are or should you be considering calling your exposure there or are you pretty happy in playing the long, long-term debt.","Joe Fisher","Haendel, overall we're fairly happy with the portfolio there. Obviously, we increased it within the MetLife JV, and so I'd say two-thirds of the MetLife JV that we acquired, we feel very good about and assets that we let go, were not necessarily in target markets, so net-net, we came out ahead in terms of target markets. The good thing we get with control of Vitruvian in addition to everything Jerry said from existing operations is, if you look at Vitruvian West 1 and the lease-up in the yield that took place there, relatively quickly set up for [ph] 400 units and yield in the Mid-6s, we're in Vitruvian West 2 right now, and 3, will be on the docket next, those will be 6% plus yield. So, getting access to land that allows us to go out there and accretively develop, is one of the things we liked about the value creation, access to Vitruvian -- that transaction.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue, and I'd like to hand the call back over to Chairman and CEO, Mr. Toomey for closing comments.","Tom Toomey","Well, thank you. And first let me thank all of you for your time and interest in UDR. Second, as you heard throughout the call today, during 2019, the team has executed on all aspects of our value creation capabilities, which I think will set up 2020 for continued strong NOI growth and cash flow growth. And again, lastly these results are really achieved through the efforts of our exceptional associates and their continued effort every day, as well as our culture of constantly trying to find a way to do it better every day. So with that we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to UDR's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","My comments will be brief.","First, all aspects of our business continued to perform well in the fourth quarter, which concluded in outstanding 2013. Apartment fundamentals in the majority of our markets remained favorable and we have strong momentum going into 2014, as is reflected in our guidance, which is above Street estimates.","Second, we met or exceeded all first year objectives as presented in our initial Three-Year Plan that was introduced last February. Following Tom's and Jerry's remarks, we will update you on a new Three-Year Plan, which covers the period from 2014 through 2016.","Finally, I'd like to thank all my fellow associates for their hard work in producing a great year for UDR. We look forward to 2014.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: first, our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results; second, a balance sheet and debt maturity update; third, a development and redevelopment update; fourth, an overview of fourth quarter and post year-end transaction; and last, a first quarter and full year 2014 guidance.","I'll begin with our fourth quarter results. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.36, $0.35 and $0.30, respectively. Full year 2013 FFO per share was $1.44, inclusive of $0.05 of Hurricane Sandy insurance recovery. Our 2013 FFO as adjusted per share was $1.39, inclusive of $0.01 of Hurricane Sandy business interruption recoveries relative to lost rental revenues in 2013. And full year AFFO per share was $1.23.","Moving onto the balance sheet. At year end, our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 39%; on a fair value basis, it was 32%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.0x, consistent with our expectation at the beginning of 2013.","Moving ahead, we will continue to manage to BBB+ credit metric while gradually deleveraging our balance sheet through nondilutive actions.","From a liquidity perspective, our balance sheet remains in good shape with $930 million of available funds at the end of the fourth quarter, consisting of cash and credit facility capacity. Including extensions, we have $312 million of maturing debt in 2014 at a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. 140 -- $184 million of this was paid off by the revolver on January 15. We intend to refinance these obligations in the unsecured markets during the second quarter of 2014.","Turning to development. Before I provide an update, I would like to remind everyone how we define our pipeline. Our development pipeline includes all projects that are pro-rata ownership share outlined on Attachment 9 or Page 21 of our quarterly supplement. This equates to a $1.2 billion pipeline at year end, 64% of which has been funded.","We completed 3 projects at $275 million of development during the fourth quarter at a weighted average spread between expected trended yield and current market cap rates of approximately 185 basis points. Of these completions, Bella Terra in Huntington Beach and 13th and Market in San Diego are estimated to perform at or above the upper end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point trended range. Fiori, a Vitruvian Park community in Addison, Texas is coming in below our targeted range, though will still be accretive to earnings and NAV.","Our remaining pipeline, $300 million of which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014, is trending as a whole within our targeted range.","During the quarter, we announced 2 new projects, both in core markets. The first, 399 Fremont, a $318 million development in San Francisco, broke ground in mid-January. 399 Fremont is a 51-49 development partnership with MetLife. UDR's share of the project equates to $162 million. The second is Steele Creek, a $108 million development in Denver, which broke ground in the fourth quarter. Steele Creek is being constructed under a participating debt structure, which is a new structure for UDR, but the economics are advantageous. There's a substantial equity piece in front of our participating loan, we are paid 6.5% current and we'll receive 50% of the upside upon subsequent purchase of the asset by UDR or sale to a third party.","As to future development projects, we are carefully underwriting opportunities. In addition to our land bank outlined on Attachment 11 or Page 23, we recently acquired for $78 million the land for the development of Pacific City, a fully entitled 516-home community located in Huntington Beach, California. The site has immediate access to the Pacific Coast Highway and is only 3 blocks from the Huntington Beach pier. Looking ahead, we expect to announce a couple of new starts in the second half of 2014.","On to redevelopment. We increased the scope and budget of our Rivergate redevelopment in Manhattan. The revised budget is $98 million and includes limited scope renovations on additional units, the addition of 33 homes as some large floor plans are split into 2 homes, upgraded corridors as well as other revenue-generating opportunities.","At 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde in Orange County, we are choosing to table for the foreseeable future the redevelopment of 216 homes that were in the original scope of the project given current demand trends in that particular submarket.","Next, we sold $132 million in noncore assets in the fourth quarter. We exited the Sacramento market and disposed of a noncore asset in the Boston metro area. The average age of the Sacramento assets was 31 years and the 3 communities were sold at a weighted average cap rate of approximately 6%.","In addition to the sale, we consolidated our 13th and Market and Domain College Park joint venture development as we assumed the role of managing partner in both ventures during the quarter.","Following year end, we closed on the sale of Presidio for approximately $49 million, a noncore community located in North County, San Diego. The 27-year-old property had an average revenue per occupied home of $1,485 in the fourth quarter and was sold at a 5.4% cap rate.","On to 2014 guidance. Our 2014 FFO and FFO as adjusted guidance per share are $1.47 to $1.53. Our 2014 AFFO guidance is $1.30 to $1.36 per share, an 8% increase at the midpoint over 2013 and includes $1,100 of maintenance CapEx per stabilized home.","There are a number of moving parts, but the primary drivers of our expected AFFO growth from 2013 to 2014 of $1.23 to $1.33 at the midpoint includes mature and nonmature NOI growth of $0.08; development and redevelopment earn-in, net of funding costs of $0.03; and a reduction in development and redevelopment [indiscernible] of $0.01. These benefits are offset by $0.01 in dilution from expected recycling of noncore assets via 1031 transactions and $0.01 from higher CapEx.","In 2014, we anticipate same-store revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.25%, same-store expense growth of 2.75% to 3.25% and same-store NOI growth of 3.75% to 5.0%.","Other primary assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.","First quarter 2014 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance are $0.34 to $0.36, $0.33 to $0.35 and $0.30 to $0.32, respectively.","Finally, we are increasing our 2014 declared dividend by 11% year-over-year to an annualized $1.04 per share from $0.94 per share in 2013.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry A. Davis","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: first, fourth quarter and full year 2013 operating results; second, the performance of our core markets during the fourth quarter; third, a brief update on our development lease-ups; and lastly, market performance expectations for 2014.","We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the fourth quarter, same-store net operating income grew 5.4%, driven by a 4.5% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.4% increase in expenses.","Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 4.2% year-over-year to $1,509 per month. Our same-store occupancy is 96.2%, was 30 basis points higher year-over-year.","For the full year 2013, same-store revenue grew to 4.9%, expenses increased 2.6% and NOI grew by 6%, all exceeding our original forecast at the midpoint from last February.","Turning to new and renewal lease rates. Fourth quarter effective rental rates on new leases increased by 1.3%. Renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.2%. San Francisco, Seattle and Portland performed well, while the Mid-Atlantic region struggled. Further details can be found on Attachment 8(NYSE:G) or Page 20 of our supplement.","Annualized turnover in the fourth quarter decreased by 220 basis points year-over-year and was 80 basis points lower on a full year basis. Lower turnover for the fourth quarter was the result of our efforts in 2012 to move lease expirations out of the fourth quarter and into the second and third quarters. This was done because new lease rate growth is typically more than 200 basis points higher in those quarters than in the fourth quarter.","Rent, as a percentage of our residents' income, held steady at roughly 17%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 50 basis points year-over-year at 13.9% in the fourth quarter.","Next, we'll talk about quarterly performance in our primary core markets. New supply in metro D.C. continues to be an issue with significant deliveries expected in 2014. While we are not immune to the negative effects of new supply, we continue to believe our diverse mix of A and B product, as well as less direct submarket exposure to new supply, will help us fare better than many of our peers in 2014.","New York City experienced some pricing pressure in late 4Q 2013 through mid-January of 2014 as we anniversaried off of Hurricane Sandy. With many units out of service throughout Lower Manhattan and Zone A during late 2012 and early 2013, pricing was abnormally strong in unaffected properties on the island. In the fourth quarter of 2013, all of these apartments that were off-line last year were fully recovered. So 12-month leases commanded less pricing power throughout the city. We have cycled through this issue and expect to see normalized demand over the remainder of 2014.","Orange County and Los Angeles employment growth is improving, and with limited new supply, both markets are expected to perform well in 2014.","We achieved 90% stabilized occupancy at our 467-home Bella Terra development in Huntington Beach in December and we're currently 96% leased. This is just 7 months after accepting our first unit, which means we averaged 60 move-ins per month and have yet to offer a concession.","San Francisco remains very strong with expected 2014 job growth of more than 3%, primarily consisting of higher-paying professional jobs. We're seeing good demand throughout the city, the Peninsula and Silicon Valley with some moderate pricing pressure in North San Jose where new supply is more prominent.","Channel, our new development in Mission Bay, is 43% leased just one month after opening its doors at higher rates than initially expected. New supply is coming to downtown Seattle. The job growth is expected to absorb it. Our A and B properties in metro Seattle continue to perform well.","Boston was one of our better markets in 2013. Currently, it is at an unseasonally slower period of the year and it has been negatively affected by abnormally poor weather over the past 45 days.","Lastly, Dallas is generating a significant number of jobs right now, but is also facing heavy new supply. We are feeling some effects from supply in Uptown and Plano, but believe Dallas will be an above average market for us in 2014.","Turning to development. During the quarter, we completed 725 homes and spent approximately $76 million. As of the end of 2013, we had spent $800 million on our $1.2 billion development pipeline.","Bella Terra in Huntington Beach, Channel at Mission Bay in San Francisco and 13th and Market in San Diego comprised $371 million in aggregate estimated cost. Weighted average effective rents are currently 10% above plan and leasing velocity is 16%, ahead of expectations. Each of these lease-ups continues to go well.","Los Alisos in Mission Viejo, Domain College Park across the street from the University of Maryland Business School and Fiori at our Vitruvian Park JV in Addison, Texas comprised $201 million in aggregate estimated cost. Weighted average effective rents are 3% below plan, while leasing velocity is 19% below where we would have expected at this point. As the spring leasing season arrives, we expect these -- that leasing at these projects will pick up.","Still, all in, we're comfortable with how the lease-ups are progressing in aggregate.","Finally, I have a couple of comments regarding market revenue growth expectations in 2014. We expect San Francisco and Seattle to be among our best-performing markets. Southern California, Texas and the Northeast are expected to grow in excess of the 4.25% top end of our portfolio same-store guidance. These markets comprise over 50% of our total NOI. The Mid-Atlantic region is expected to be our weakest region once again. Page 13 of our updated Three-Year Strategic outlook has additional information on our market growth expectations.","With that, I will remind those listening that there is a link to our updated Three-Year Strategic document on the Investor Relations page of our website. We'll pause for a moment so that everyone can gather the Three-Year Plan materials.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom Toomey to present our updated Three-Year Plan.","Thomas W. Toomey","Thanks, Jerry. Let's move on to our 2014 to 2016 Strategic Plan. Last February, we communicated that the heavy lifting of our portfolio and balance sheet repositioning was largely completed. At that time, we rolled out our 2013 to 2015 strategic plan. As we measure our actual 2013 results against the plan, I'm pleased to tell you that we met or exceeded each of our 2013 goals. We view our updated plan merely as an extension of last year's plan, given that strategic priorities are unchanged.","We have 4 primary strategic priorities, which you will find on Page 3. These are: one, investing our shareholders' capital in accretive growth opportunities that improve our portfolio; second, continuing to generate best-in-class operating results; third, drive cash flow, dividend and NAV growth; and fourth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We believe successful execution of these priorities will optimize total shareholder return for our investors over time.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss the details of the plan.","Thomas M. Herzog","Thanks, Tom. Please turn to Page 4 of the strategic outlook presentation. As Tom mentioned, we met or exceeded all 2013 primary objectives in our original plan. First, we completed approximately $400 million of accretive development in 2013 and expect that our remaining pipeline will continue to create value. Second, we ended 2013 ahead of all original annual guidance expectations for same-store and cash flow growth. In addition, during 2013, we raised our dividend by 7% and we'll raise it an additional 11% in 2014. Third, all of our primary year-end balance sheet metrics were in line with our expectations set forth at the outset of 2013. We continue to manage the BBB+, Baa1 metrics.","Please turn to Page 5. Development remains accretive and will continue to be a primary mean to which we improve our portfolio and grow our company. Our primarily coastal and urban pipeline of $1.2 billion will be completed over the next 3 years, yet sized less than 10% of our enterprise value and at 64% funded. The remaining spend of $440 million will come from either equity issuance or sale of assets.","We continue to target annual spend in the range of $400 million to $600 million per year and a trended spread versus cap rates of 150 to 200 basis points. Recently, we have tightened our underwriting standards to reflect rising costs and less robust forward rent growth assumptions. Fewer deals will pencil in today's environment, but we are still finding accretive opportunities.","Please turn to Page 6. On this page, we provide Seattle pipeline statistics. Our pipeline is primarily coastal and urban. Including our land with MetLife, our Seattle pipeline totals $1 billion to $1.3 billion at 100% ownership. 85% of this potential pipeline is owned in partnership with MetLife. Our current ownership share in 7 UDR\/MetLife I JV land parcels is just 4%. This provides optionality at the conclusion of the entitlement processes for these parcels. When assessing the optimal size of our development pipeline, we weighed balance sheet risk, drag to our earnings stream and AFFO and NAV accretion from the successful completion of current and potential projects.","Please turn to Page 7. In 2014, we anticipate our development projects will generate $0.05 of FFO per share drag and $0.025 of accretion. Upon stabilization of each project at our targeted trended spread, we expect annual FFO accretion of $0.06 per share and continued growth thereafter. Cumulative NAV accretion is estimated at $2.10 per share during the construction and lease-up phases of our development.","Please turn to Page 8. Our operations remains strong as exhibited by the chart in the middle of the page. We have consistently produced better top line growth over an extended time period than the multi-family average. Though we are not sitting idle. Jerry and his team continue to improve our operations. Our focus on technology, and more recently, our emphasis on driving repair and maintenance efficiencies are 2 examples. These investments are enhancing our margins and continue to improve our residents' experience. Moving forward, we expect to generate strong operating results as evidenced by the same-store growth assumptions presented over the life of the plan in the chart at the bottom of the page.","Please turn to Page 9. A primary tenet of our Three-Year Plan is to drive AFFO, NAV and CVNI growth. We anticipate 2014 and 2015 being good years. Looking at the chart -- at the top chart, AFFO per share growth is forecasted at 7% to 9% in 2014. I discussed the 2014 drivers in my earlier remarks.","Growth in 2015 is expected to be similar to 2014. Our 2016 expectations are negatively affected by fewer development starts in 2013 and higher interest rate assumptions. However, our crystal ball gets hazier the further out we look.","The bottom 2 charts show expected NAV per share growth and CVNI, both assuming a flat cap rate environment. Applying our next 3 years' expected growth to our 2013 NAV per share implies an NAV of approximately $36 in 2016, a 30% increase over 2013. We anticipate annual CVNI of approximately 12% through 2016. This is consistent with our long-term average historical growth. However, historical cap rate compression contributed significantly to CVNI whereas, going forward, accretive development returns are expected to help drive CVNI.","Please turn to Page 10. We continue to focus on net debt-to-EBITDA, leverage and fixed charge coverage when evaluating the strength of our balance sheet and anticipate our metrics will further improve over the life of the plan. Same-store growth and development earn-in are the primary drivers of our forecasted improvement in net debt-to-EBITDA and fixed charge coverage.","Please turn to Page 11. Pages 11 and 12 provide our 2014 guidance and 2015\/2016 cumulative expectations.","Please turn to Page 13. Our 2014 growth assumptions for our markets are presented on the map. The West Coast and Northeast are expected to grow at above -- at an above average rate in 2014, while the Mid-Atlantic is likely to continue to struggle, but is still expected to perform better than our peers due to our 50-50 mix of As and Bs in D.C. and less direct exposure to new supply.","Please turn to Page 14. As Tom indicated earlier, we view this update as a continuation of our previous Strategic Plan. In the charts, the midpoints of our cumulative Three-Year expectations for the 2013 to '15 time period are relatively similar or improved when compared to our updated plan for these years to our previous plan.","I'll now turn it back over to Tom for final remarks.","Thomas W. Toomey","Thank you, Tom. I've had the pleasure of being UDR's CEO for 13 years now. Our mission over the first decade was to reposition the portfolio and the balance sheet. The last couple of years we have spent finalizing the transition of the previous decade, as well as positioning the company for strong cash flow growth.","The next decade will continue to focus on long-term cash flow growth, which is the focus of this plan. In our view, this plan remains the best avenue for creating value for our shareholders. Our team remains highly focused everyday on executing it.","From time-to-time, during discussions with our investors and analysts, we were asked, what differentiates UDR from our peers? I believe there are several value-creation drivers that are applicable to the multifamily space, and currently, UDR is uniquely positioned to take advantage of each of them.","First, we have the necessary skill to garner cost of capital and G&A efficiencies, but are small enough that moderately-sized transactions still move the value-creation needle.","Second, we have a best-in-class operating platform.","Third, we have substantially and accretive development program.","Fourth, our portfolio is primarily bicoastal, but diverse enough to generate strong results in a variety of economic environments.","And lastly, we have a unique relationship with a Fortune 50 company in MetLife that affords us favorable capital along with opportunities unavailable to many others.","I will conclude my remarks by observing that the most vital component of successful execution of our plan is our people. I'm fortunate to have in place an experienced and dedicated team, of customer-focused associates and believe we will achieve outstanding results against each of our priorities we have set forth today.","With that, I'll open up the call to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of the equity issuance assumed in 2014 guidance and the Three-Year Plan, if your stock continues to trade at discount, will you forego that equity? And if so, how do you expect to replace that capital?","Thomas M. Herzog","Nick, Tom Herzog. Yes, if we're not trading at or above NAV, we will forego that equity issuance and would replace it with additional asset sales from our capital warehouse or noncore markets.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jerry, can you give the new and renewal rate growth by month for January than where renewals are going out for February and March?","Jerry A. Davis","By every market?","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, no. Total, total portfolio.","Jerry A. Davis","Oh, sure. January, new rent growth was 0.1%. The lows were once again the Mid-Atlantic where it was in the 4s, down 4%. We did have some strength in the Pacific Northwest, as well as San Francisco where it was up around 5% to 6%. Then renewals in January were signed at 4.9%. We're sending out 5% to 5.2% for the remainder of this quarter. I would add, we do expect new lease growth for the quarter to average out to about 1.3%. It does look like it's going to accelerate the following 2 months and that compares to about 2.2% in the first quarter of last year. We think renewals will average for the first quarter of this year 5% and that's down from about 5.8% last year.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then where's occupancy at the end of January?","Jerry A. Davis","At the end of January, it was about 96.1%, 96.2%. As of yesterday, after we had some month in move-outs, it was 95.9% and that's 20 basis points higher than the same time last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","The first question is on slide -- I just turned it, on Slide 7, Tom. You guys talk about $1.2 billion development pipeline that should be about $0.06 accretive. If my quick math, which is always a dangerous thing, is right, that seems to imply about a 1.3% spread. Last week, Avalon talked about a 250 basis point spread on their development program verse [ph] funding source. So can you just comment a little bit more? Is this just adding in cushion just because it's a forward projection and therefore you have no way of knowing where disposition pricing may be or equity pricing may be? Or is this just -- or is there something else going on here?","Thomas M. Herzog","No, Alex, as we look at the development program, that $0.06 is based on our current portfolio, which we'd call it, it's in the middle of the range, between the 150 to 200 basis point spread. And if you run that math, you'll see the drag that results from it. You'll see the accretion that builds in that, at the point of stabilization, it will produce that $0.06. So that is based on pretty much right down the middle at 175 basis point spread from the cap rates in those corresponding markets. That's how the math will work.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So it's 175?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then...","Thomas M. Herzog","It's actually just -- it's slightly -- it's just slightly higher than 175. I think we're running more like just maybe 10 basis points higher than that on average across the modeling that we've done on our portfolio currently, but just call it in that range. It will be about $0.06.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So the $0.06 is not the 175, the $0.06 more reflects the impact of timing?","Thomas M. Herzog","Timing, but probably call it 180 to 185 basis point spread.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Next question is for Mr. Toomey. Putting on your big picture hat, if you took a read of the Essex-BRE proxy, it looks like there were only 4 companies that were sort of interested in BRE and only 1 bid. In your view, looking over the history of M&A in REIT land, is it your view that it's typical that M&A only comes down to maybe 1, maybe 2 people who actually throw in bids? Or you think it's a reflection of where pricing is today or companies' hesitancy to engage in deals because of where stock prices are?","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, Alex, I've been at it a long time even through the '94 window where we started out with 36 public companies. And there, it was a race to get larger and it was a cost of capital multiple game. I think what you have today is 10 companies that are very well run, they're very efficient, there's not a lot of upside in the companies and so that brings down how we can create value for the future investor to really cause capital advantage and that shrinks the pool of potential buyers. I think there's probably more value to be brought in the private space and that's where people are headed today and you can see it in their accumulation of portfolios. So I think these are just well-run companies, hard to see a lot of upside in it and that just shrinks the pool of buyers. That's all I observe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of just quick modeling questions. One, could you give the capitalized interest estimate for 2014?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes. We've got that. I think that's something that we normally don't lay out in detail, but you can take what we had last year and then we speak to the change in cap interest from 1 year to the next. So I think you can back into it.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Sorry, what was the change in cap interest this year versus last year you said, you talked about that?","Thomas M. Herzog","It's $0.01 on the development and redevelopment projects.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then on D.C., I was hoping to get a little bit more detail on what your same-store revenue expectation is for the market this year?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. This is Jerry. Our expectation is in 2014, we, like everyone else, will see a deceleration in D.C. due to new supply. We do continue to believe D.C. will be positive, albeit a low positive revenue growth, probably call it in the 1% to 2% range. What we think we have that some of our peers don't is locations that are less indirect path of new supply, as well as a portfolio that is a little over half of B quality rather than A and those definitely don't go head-to-head as much. We have 2 or 3 markets where new supply is coming at us, one's out in Manassas, one is the U Street Corridor and the third one is in Woodbridge. But many of our properties that are within true Washington D.C. are not in the same neighborhoods as the new supply. But I can tell you, you see it in the supplement where we show what new rents were in fourth quarter, we have seen a deceleration in what we can get on new rents, but we are continuing to see renewals go out in the 3% to 4% range and we are holding occupancy.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question on the Three-Year Plan. It looks like, based on some of the development spend projections, that you're going to start -- I guess, target to start roughly $1 billion of additional development. And what I'm wondering is going back to that $0.06 FFO benefit once stabilized on the current $1.2 billion development pipeline, I mean, is that going to be a similar type of FFO benefit if you do, in fact, start $1 billion -- a little over $1 billion of development?","Thomas M. Herzog","You've got to remember that if we take the $1.2 billion pipeline, that's completed over a period of about 3 years, 2.5 to 3 years, let's say. So we assume $400 million to $600 million of spend per year. You're correct that the $0.06 is the completion of the existing $1.2 billion development. We had starts at the end of 2013 of about $250 million. We expect a couple more projects to be announced probably the latter half of 2014, but we haven't announced a specific dollar amount of new development starts in 2014 at this date yet. But we're still underwriting to the 150 to 200 basis point trended spread over cap rates, so the kind of accretion that you would see for the types of projects that we're approving on a relative size basis would be similar.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess I was just trying to figure out. I mean, if the development spending is supposed to total $1.5 billion from 2014 to 2016, you have about $450 million left on the existing pipeline. That seems to imply about $1 billion of incremental starts.","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, you guys go to our Seattle pipeline page and you'll find in...","Unknown Executive","Page 6.","Thomas M. Herzog","Page 6. Yes, Page 6. If you took the ownership effective numbers and assume that the UDR\/MetLife numbers were at 50-50 by the time we [indiscernible] development, along with our 100% owned stuff, you get an ownership effective number in the $600 million to $750 million range, plus you've got Pacific City on top of that. So those -- we do have already a Seattle pipeline in place on top of what's already under development. So for the time frame that we're looking at, I think, we're in good shape for what we're speaking to of $400 million to $600 million per year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just looking at Page 8 of the slides. It looks like your '15, '16 same-store revenue growth expectations are roughly in line just a little bit below what you're expecting for '14. Can you just talk about what fundamental underpinning gives you the confidence that revenue growth will stay steady here for 3 years and what you think the biggest risk to that are?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes. Again, this is Tom and I'm going to -- Herzog and I'm going to pass it to Jerry. But Karin, a variety of different things. And the further out we go, of course, the harder it is to make these estimates. But we've looked at the AXIO data, the Moody's data, all the different pieces that you guys write and have put our own views toward that, we've got an improved job market that should more than offset the new supply estimates in our -- the vast majority of our markets over the next 2 to 3 years. In the markets that are being hit harder, like a D.C., a Seattle and a Austin, our specific locations within each of these markets has sheltered us from the rent deceleration experienced by some of our peers. We see supply flattening out in the latter half of '14 and first half of '15 due to the higher construction costs, interest rate, the less explosive rate growth. And another point that I think is worth making is just take a look at what's happened with single-family housing. If you took a home 12 months ago and then looked at the year-over-year increase in value, it's about 12%, higher in some of our markets, but 12% across all markets. And if you took mortgage rates, it's up -- they're up 120 basis points from a 3.5 base. Add that together, do the math, that's about a 30% increase in mortgage payments. That, along with social patterns that continue to favor rent-in, we're just seeing that the growth is going to continue to be favorable. So when we look at a 3.9% 2014 growth, kind of flattening out to 3.75% in '15. '16 is kind of a long ways to look out, but we're not seeing anything that looks different than that, but again it's hazier, we feel pretty good about it. But Jerry, maybe more on some specifics as to how you see it?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. Hi Karin, just a few things I would add to what Tom Herzog said. First, when we look out into '15 and '16 and what's projected for job growth, we look in our core markets and we see that job growth is projected to be 20 to 30 basis points higher in our core markets. In addition to that, we see that new supply growth is probably going to be a little below average in '15 and '16 after being above the national average in '13 and '14. Also, when we go back and look at what percentage of households are renters, in our core market, it's 42% compared to 35% as a national average. So we see those stats and it's encouraging. One other thing is, when you look at an urban platform that we've really moved towards, many of our residents don't own cars. They rely on public transportation. And one interesting tidbit I picked up a few weeks ago at the National Multi-Housing Conference was that transportation costs are the second largest cost component of these households. So when I look at a suburban household of renters that have 2 drivers, you're probably talking transportation cost when you include car payment, insurance, gas, repairs, tolls, parking, things like that, are well over $1,000 a month. Most of my residents don't have that cost. And in addition, when I look at my percentage of rent to income across all of my markets, it typically is falling out anywhere between 15% and 20% regardless of the market. So we do feel that those urban renters, if you're getting normal pay increases, let's say 2% to 3% across-the-board, will better be able to handle increases over time than our suburban peers.","Thomas M. Herzog","Tom, anything you'd add?","Thomas W. Toomey","Yes. Karin, I think it's a very good question. And when I back up and look through all the detail that Tom and Jerry go through to build this up, what you realize about our '14, '15 and '16 outlook, I'd throw this observation at it. '14 and '15 are going to look very much alike, in our view. Well then why do we have a lot of high comfort around that aspect of it, it's clearly that we have high visibility on new supply, we have a very good feel about employment picture about our individual markets. And so, we feel very good about the '14, '15 aspects of it. And as you get out to '16, it's very hard to ask our site teams to build up a projection, to understand supply, growth dynamics. And so we ended up defaulting to a lot of third-party analysis to arrive at '16. And I think that's a relatively conservative view, but one that is easily explained. And as I would take it away from your chair, I'd say, these guys feel very confident about their '14, '15 forecast and they're going to look a lot alike at this point in time. And '16 is just a wildcard that's a long time off into the future and certainly, as we get closer, we'll have a better visibility and, we hope, a more optimistic view of it.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My second question just on guidance, question for Jerry. On Page 13, you give a lot of nice market-specific information. Are there any of your markets that you're expecting to accelerate from a same-store revenue growth perspective versus 2013?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes. I'd tell you, there's a few that could accelerate slightly. Right now, Orlando is very strong as we enter this year. I could see it holding up well. I'm hopeful, although I say this every year about Orange County and L.A., we've had modest results there the last year or so. We've had a good start in January of this year, and I think those potentially could be a little bit better. And the other one that just continues to chug, even though it's a very small market for us, is Portland.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And would Boston potentially be in that category as well, or because you had a good year in '13, maybe not?","Jerry A. Davis","No. It will not be. I'll tell you, we killed it in 2013. I want to say our total full year revenue growth was upwards of 8%, if I remember correctly. And to replicate -- it was 7.7%. To replicate this year, things would have to turn around quite a bit. It's going to be a good market, but it won't be as great as it was last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on Nick's earlier question, and I'm hoping that you can point us in the right direction as it relates to the equity issuance assumptions that you have in '15, '16. If it's an unfortunate circumstance that the stock is not there for you over that time period, can you just walk us through what the alternatives are, whether it's significantly more dispositions than you plan here or higher leverage?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes. Dave, thanks for that. It definitely is not higher leverage. That's not the direction we're going. We have the benefit of having a $1.2 billion capital warehouse portfolio that we're in no rush to sell, but yet, those are assets over time that we'll prune in a $300 million non-core portfolio. When I think about equity issuance, of course, we think about it on a cost of equity. But when you look at it on an annual cost, as it might apply to this plan, it's probably right around a 5% cost of -- an annual cost of funds on an AFFO yield basis. You compare that to sales and assume that we've got a fixed cap NOI cap rate, and that would include some sprinkling too, of some non-core assets in core markets. That equates to about a 5.5% cash flow cap rate, so not terribly different than what the equity would look like to the bottom line of our plan in that particular year. So it comes down to this. We've got $1.5 billion of stuff that over some period of time, we intend to prune and put into more higher-growth assets, development assets, the type of assets that Harry's producing. And so if we're not able to issue the equity, that's fine, we will sell assets. But I will remind you guys one thing -- or at least express to you one thing, we've done studies. In 63% of the time over the last decade we've traded at a premium to NAV, and there's only been 1 year in the last decade that we have not, that was 2013. So we do expect that sometime during the period of the plan, we probably will trade above NAV and we'll utilize that opportunity to continue to grow the company, which is something that we would intend to do over time as well.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my second question is on Rivergate. How do the changes there affect your -- the yield that you expect to achieve on -- or that you are achieving on that asset?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes. Let's take Rivergate for a minute, Dave. Rivergate was acquired as an acquisition rehab asset. And with that, as we think about that, we target a stabilized yield in excess of what we could acquire a similar asset for that didn't require the rehab in that same market. Inclusive of this expanded budget, we believe we'll trend to about a 5% yield on a fully-stabilized basis some time in 2016, which we feel really good about. So that's just kind of the background. Harry, what might you add to that?","Harry G. Alcock","Dave, this is Harry. So just to speak specifically about the rehab. Our initial budget was $60 million. That was to rehab about 400 of the units that the prior owner hadn't touched; cure a lot of exterior items, the full exterior of the building; all new windows; a brand-new lobby, which we finished; all new AC and heating systems, that type of thing. We finished that, and in the course of [indiscernible] having the property and operating it for the past 2.5 years, we found a number of additional opportunities to generate additional revenue and enhance our return. So this really is a phase 2, and sort examples of those items are create a second floor amenity area in space that was previously unused, we're going to split an entire stack of large 1-bedrooms, 950-square foot 1-bedrooms, and split them into a combination of a 450-square foot studio and a 500 square-foot junior 1-bedroom, which gives us a new entry point in the building. We have 11 homes with very large terraces which is a unique amenity in this market that we're going to increase the rehab scope. We're going to add washers and dryers to 194 units. So the point is, we think we're going to add, for that $38 million, get another $375 or so in additional rent and generate about an 8% return on that incremental $38 million in spend. I'll remind you that in the 2.5 years we've owned it, the average rents at acquisition were about 3250. We've increased rents nearly 30% at that building. The rehab units are generating rents in excess of 4,300 today and we've got another 375 to go as a result of the Phase 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Just wanted to go back to the Shadow development pipeline for a second. I was just wondering if you had any color regarding your land parcels in California and Seattle in terms of the submarkets where those land parcels are located versus the new supply that's coming online now? And as the markets, as well as what's planned over the next couple of years and the level of competition you might be expecting within those submarkets?","Harry G. Alcock","Sure. This is Harry. I'll go ahead and sort of walk through those in general and, I guess, there's a number of different answers. But to walk through, we've got 4 properties -- 5 properties, actually. On Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles from Santa Monica to Koreatown, which represent a big chunk of it. An awful lot of the new supply in the L.A. area is downtown. None of these are downtown. So these happen to be in submarkets that are not experiencing the rate of supply you're seeing in Los Angeles on the whole. We've got 1 of the land parcels in Bellevue, Washington that is -- again, Bellevue is, I think, there's 2 projects under construction now. There's a couple more on the drawing board. Bellevue, again, is not getting nearly the same level of new supply as downtown Seattle is. We do have 1 property in Irvine that we could start later this year. The City of Irvine does have a fair amount of new supply. We think we'll be kind of right in the middle, perhaps slightly ahead of the overall supply in that marketplace. But that is going to be something that we will deal with when we're releasing those projects up. We've got 1 property on El Camino in Mountain View. Again, the City of Mountain View has just delivered 2 brand-new product -- projects. Those are the first new projects that have been delivered in that city in a long time. There's a couple of others that are coming online. The point is, we're -- this is not an area where we expect a tremendous amount of new supply. It's just very difficult to get these types of sites and title that takes a long time. And we feel very good about the types of assets that we'll be starting over the next 2 or 3 years.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And just one more. Jerry, in terms of your expense growth guidance over the next few years, it's ranging around about 3%. I'm just curious, given the expense savings programs that you put in place for the past few years, if you quantified what sort of savings that you're generating in the next 3 years?","Jerry A. Davis","Well, we continue to find new opportunities to save money, especially on the repairs and maintenance side. As we make our service associates more efficient, it will enable us to continue to bring third-party cost in-house, as well as we think, by doing more preventive maintenance and doing a better job at move-in and during the residents' time period with us, we're hopeful, although I can't back this up yet, that we'll be able to drive resident turnover down. But as I look at 2014, like you stated, we have expense growth projected at 3%. And if I had to break that down, we're looking at about 6% for tax increases next year. While 35% of our company is in California or Oregon where you have caps on valuation increases, those will come in somewhere in the 2% to 3% range. We're going to feel some pressure, again, next year in Washington, D.C., where taxes are projected, currently, to be going up close to double digits. It's high single digits, and D.C. is about 14% of my total same-store pool. And then when you look at the rest of the company, which is about half of it, they kind of all blend in to about a 6% growth. So we're seeing taxes going up, based on valuations, about 5%. And then, we did receive some refunds last year that translate to the total expense going up about 6%. As you look into the other components, we think insurance is going to be roughly flat with last year. We're seeing utilities probably coming in about 4%. We're keeping our eye on the State of California for future years with severe multiyear drought conditions that have been happening. That could, in the future, have an impact on water rates. To date, we really haven't seen that in any of our markets. But 2014, our expectation is, our repairs and maintenance expense will be negative growth once again. This past year, it was down about 4%. As we were able to bring more work in-house, we think it will be down 2%. In '14, we see personnel going up in that 3%, 3.5% range. And we still think we can become a little more efficient in the office, as well as on the marketing side and drive down our administrative and marketing cost about 2%. And I really don't see anything as we go out further years, and I think our '15, '16 projection is to be in that 3% range. I would say, upside risk is probably more in the utility side. I think taxes will start to moderate as valuations are fully built in. We think some municipalities may start looking to raise levy rates in the future if they can't get on valuation. Nobody in 2014 that we're looking at do we see expectations that rates will go up. But I do think this efficiency in repairs and maintenance has another year or so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I'd like to go back to Boston for a minute. We're seeing a meaningful amount of supply specs to come online over the next year or 2 there, particularly in the city core. And given your more urban footprint in Boston, can you talk a bit more about your expectations for your Boston portfolio, specifically in 2014? And can you give us some broad color on proportionately what proportion of your portfolio there is urban versus suburban and then A versus B?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure, Haendel. This is Jerry. We really don't have that much urban. We have 1 property, several hundred units in the Back Bay, Garrison Square, that we've owned for several years. We have 2 same store Properties up in the North Shore that are more B quality. And then as you go down to Braintree in the South Shore, we have 1 same-store property. We have various properties that we own with MetLife that are scattered around the suburbs, but we really have only 1 that's in urban core. And it is interesting. For the first time since we purchased that 3, 3.5 years ago, it's having a bit of a struggle right now. I think some of it is due to new supply. I think the other part of it that we've experienced sort of last 45 to 60 days is pretty bad weather in that New England area that's made it difficult for people to get out and shop for apartments. But the new supply is coming in that downtown area. Predominately, we think our 1 core asset, which is more of a brownstone 4-story property, will be fine. But it's been hurt a little bit. And right now, I would tell you, the strongest submarket that we see in Boston and it's been this way for the last 6 to 9 months has been down on the South Shore.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Appreciate that. So looking at the Northeast forecast here where you have Boston and New York effectively a similar forecast, can you perhaps give us a sense as to -- well, scratch that, scratch that. I want to go to D.C. for a second. I think that's more important here for me. Can you give the same relative assessment of D.C.? Your portfolio -- you mentioned earlier about your D.C. portfolio benefiting from some of these. Can you talk a bit more about your relative urban, suburban, A versus B? And then any sense of delta in revenue growth expectations there that you are forecasting for this year?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. Some of this will be kind of off the cuff, but the B portfolio is probably about 60% or so of our total D.C. holdings when you look the Metro D.C. area. If I was doing the math in my head, I would say probably 50% to 60% is outside of the Beltway, or in the suburban portions of D.C. We have a couple of deals that are wholly-owned, our A product that are in the line of new supply. Most of that is in the U Street Corridor. The Bs, projected, will go up in that 3, probably 3% revenue growth. And this is with the exception of Manassas. That's a B product that we are getting dinged up pretty good from new supply out there. And I would say the As that are within the Beltway are probably flat to negative 1% as far as revenue growth projections.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just one last one if I may. Can you guys talk a bit about the near-term opportunity for redevelopment within the portfolio? The numbers in the book are grouped with development. Can you parse out the redev and your sort of opportunity in the portfolio today for redev and any type of commentary on returns, et cetera?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, Haendel, again, what we do is we look at redevs 2 different ways. We've got the acquisition rehabs, where we seek a yield, and then we have the redevelopment of an asset that's on book. So we'll seek 7% to 9%. We've probably got, out of the, call it, $400 million, $600 million that we're doing per year, maybe 10% of that is redev. We've got on the books right now or on the pipeline right now, Rivergate is the only one that has any substantial spend left and 27 Seventy Five winding down. So it's not going to be a big number to us. And as far as what's in our portfolio right now, we're looking at a couple of opportunities. But it's not going to be a huge part of our pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Going back to the 4 tenets of the updated strategic plan, accretive capital allocation, operational excellence, cash flow growth and balance sheet health. I must confess it sounds more to me like a mission statement that really any REIT ought to be guided by as opposed to a strategic plan for a finite period of time. So I was wondering if you could provide more specificity on some of the execution elements of each of those tenets? For example, what might be an example of a continued enhancement to the best-in-class operating platform?","Jerry A. Davis","I'll take that -- oh, sorry, Tom.","Thomas W. Toomey","Yes, Paula, I think it's a very fair question. And I would agree with your initial assessment that these should be the 4 tenets of any strategic plan and direction. And clearly, you can see we build our plan around supporting those, we measure them, we report to our board and discuss them constantly. As I think about it, what doesn't get discussed when strategic plans are put forth is the prioritization and the trade-offs. And hopefully, from this Three-Year Strategic Plan, you can see that the trade-offs that we're making are -- portfolio improvement is important, but cash flow growth, NAV growth is our paramount driver and focus of this Three-Year Plan. And I would tell you, the last decade, the strategic priorities probably started with capital -- really started with portfolio. I mean, we just did not have the right assets in the right markets and we had to move all of that out and away, and that took a decade. I'll tell you, it took a lot longer than I thought, but I'm glad where we're at. So I would agree that we've toggled between those 2, and now are focused really on the cash flow and dividend per share growth, as well as the NAV per share. The other aspects, operational excellence, Jerry will give you some more specific. But it's always been a strong tenet of the company. You look year-in and year-out, we're always in the top part of the pack and we measure it by market and how we perform, and that's how our site teams are compensated, is how they perform head-to-head in markets. So I feel like there's a lot of still potential there. This industry continues to grow and do well. But there's more room in that area and Jerry give you spec. On the balance sheet, it's hard to put the balance sheet in the last decade as the first priority when we had so much work to be done on the portfolio. And you can see the last couple of years, it's come into focus. We think we're on the right path. And it would be a derivative of growing the cash flow and the NAV and the balance sheet will improve as time occurs. So that's -- the trade-off of the 4 are always critical in what we discuss about which lever to pull over what period of time and constant measure and monitoring of it. And so, I hope that helps a little bit. Jerry?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes. There's been quite a few things over the last 4 or 5 years that we've done on operational excellence that we'll continue. And I will tell you, we never stop looking at ways to grow our margin and to provide a better customer experience. And it goes back years ago when we first started doing electronic marketing, then we moved to electronic payments. We just made our office staff much more efficient. And then we looked more at the direct resident. We got online renewals, online leasing going. Then really about 2 years ago, we started looking at our maintenance teams and determined we were still doing things old-school, the way we've done them since the 1980s. And in addition to technology, we've put up performance standards for our teams and expectations. We've rolled out better ways to order parts, to transport parts and have mobile shops that go with our guys so they can become more efficient. And it's allowed us, really, if you would assume that our NIM cost should be going up 3%, we were down 4% this past year. It's enabled us to cut those costs by about 7%. We expect this year to have comparable-type results with a downward expectation of repairs and maintenance, and we think we can play this out for a few more years, with probably the final piece of this coming still a couple of years down the road with electronic locks, and we think will be an amenity to our resident as well as make our people more efficient. And on the expense side, over the last, really, last 1.5 years, we started looking at other opportunities to generate revenue out of our existing resident base. And some of that was on things, we call them rentable items, storage, parking, garages, things like that, that we looked, we only had occupancy in those types of places of 40% to 45% to 50%. We drove that occupancy up to 70%. We think we can continue to drive it over the next couple of years. And lastly, we're looking at other opportunities that will help our residents get by. Some of that is flexible payment plans or biweekly payments. Things like that, that we've realized that a portion of our residents struggle to budget their own income and they would just like a lot of people to pay their mortgages biweekly, people would like to be able to pay their rent biweekly, and we've rolled that out this year. And so far, in the states where it's allowable, we've seen pretty good acceptance of this and people do see it as a benefit that, I think, will help us not only stay in good graces with our residents, but I think it's also going to help them manage their money better and we're hopeful that it will help drive down our bad debt. But it's things like that, that we're just keeping our eyes open, watching competitors, watching other industries, listening to our customers. And I think the next step that we are really going to look at is what do our customers, how do they feel about us, ratings and things like that, and be able to respond more quickly and provide better customer service.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That is very insightful.","Thomas M. Herzog","And I might add one thing, Paula is when think about the other 2 pieces of this that haven't been spoken of, Harry's side of the business, where we're developing assets, providing accretive returns, driving additional CVNI and growth for our shareholders, we think is important -- very important, but there's -- and you're seeing the results of that now as the deliveries are starting to occur. But if you play that through for the balance of the $1.2 billion pipeline, we had a couple of questions earlier about equity issuance and what happens if we don't issue equity. Well, you'll see on this balance sheet page that we have on Page 10, we speak to different metrics. And if we issued no equity, all we did was stay -- or at least we just stayed at a leverage-neutral basis, we would still drive our net debt to EBITDA down to a 6.2x, just with the delivery of Harry's development projects, which, again, we've spoken to wanting to delivered to BBB+ or operate to BBB+, Baa1 metrics. And so, that all ties into the plan mechanically as we speak to each of the 4 tenets that you alluded to.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And my second question is just on the assets that are being marketed for sale in Tampa and Orlando. Can you just talk what was it about those specific assets versus the others you have in the market that teed those up for sale? And on a housekeeping perspective, have those already been classified as discontinued ops?","Harry G. Alcock","Paula, this is Harry. I'll answer the first part of the question. Tampa and Orlando are both within our capital warehouse. Our universe will also sell a few non-core assets this year for a number of reasons. As we go through and rate the assets having to do with expected cash flow growth, having to do with future capital needs, having to do with expected buyer response, having to do with a number of sort of operational issues, those are the 4 assets that rose to the top of the heap and the assets are of a size that will satisfy our necessary sales volume for the year, combined with a few others that we'll put in the market later this year.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And are those in discontinuum?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, the second part of your question, no, they have not been included in discontinued ops. Until we get hard dollars down, our policy has been not to do that, which I think is fairly consistent with the way a lot of other REITs handle that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow -- I think you mentioned a couple of development starts. Can you give the dollar volume that you're looking for in terms of starts so we can kind of see the [indiscernible] out of the pipeline? And then a question just as it relates to leverage. The leverage, just as you provided on 10, look like they don't include the JVs. If you look at going for -- as you look at the business plan for '14, then going forward to '16, can you talk about leverage in the context of how you're looking at managing the -- your holding on balance sheet versus the JV and whether you see leverage come down the same amount for the total entity on a proportionate basis?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, Herzog here. I'll start with this and then Harry will jump in on the developments. But the development starts for 2013, $250 million ownership effect at between Steele Creek and 399 Fremont. A couple of more starts in the second half of 2014 because Harry's working on a variety of different entitlements and we're doing a lot of underwriting right now to make sure we meet the return hurdles that we have in place. We have not yet set forth a number as to what that might look like for the balance of 2014. Anything you'd add to that, Harry?","Harry G. Alcock","Yes, I mean, we do have 3 assets that, depending on the timing of the completion of the design and various reconstruction activities that we think we could start this year, those types of numbers could be another couple hundred million in UDR's share of incremental development starts this year. And again, as you know, we just started 399 Fremont in San Francisco.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The one you bought in the first quarter, would that be a '14 start, and would that be a wholly-owned, just given the size?","Harry G. Alcock","It is wholly-owned, and it -- I think it's unlikely that it's a '14 start.","Thomas W. Toomey","Mike, this is Toomey. We won't start a deal until we have a GMAX in hand and 100% drawings. In that timeframe, on most deals, if you even have entitlements, is still a year.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You had mentioned...","Thomas W. Toomey","If we don't have entitlements it could string out for many. So we're just trying to be thoughtful in making sure we can nail the returns and price it against cost of capital with the right fact patterns. So we're in no hurry to start putting things into the ground that we don't have all the facts on-hand.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I appreciate that. And then Tom, could you address the JV leverage versus on balance sheet?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes. I don't think the numbers, Mike, will be too different than what some of you guys have published. But looking forward, so if we were, let's just say, fixed charge, we're in the mid-3s in 2014, net debt to EBITDA in the mid-6s, debt-to-asset cost of, call it, the high-38s, probably 39%. If we take the pro rata joint venture debt and assets, we're looking more like the very low 3s for fixed charge, net debt-to-EBITDA is about a 7, so it still looks pretty good, inclusive of pro rata debt, and then the debt to asset cost [indiscernible] probably about a 42 [ph] or something like that. Those are the rough numbers that we put together based on the joint venture activity.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I appreciate that. Then just as a follow-up. Can you just give us a sense? In your guidance, you've identified a decent amount of acquisition volume. Is any of that identified? And in the same sense in terms of dispositions, should we think about that kind of going throughout the year match funding or would you expect that to be all lumped together at one point?","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, I would say that we certainly, internally, have looked at a pool of assets that we would seek to liquidate. Harry is going through that now, testing the market. So we wouldn't seek to individual assets at this point. But Harry, maybe you can give a little bit more color on how you're are looking at that.","Harry G. Alcock","Yes, we -- I mean, on the acquisition side, we did -- we acquired the land parcel. And then in Orange County in January, in terms of other acquisitions that fall within our guidance, as always, we'll speak to those once we have something to talk about, meaning the hard contract and a deal that's ready to close. On the sale side, we have the 4 in the market I talked about and others will come in the market throughout the year. This continues to be a very liquid disposition environment, transaction environment. This is a year, if you look at 2013, there's over $100 billion in trade. So the disposition environment continues to be very liquid.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","First, public service announcement. CVNI is NAV plus dividend. I did not know that. Many thanks to Chris. I doubt many people on the call knew that. How do you get NAV equal CVNI, Tom? What is...","Thomas M. Herzog","How do I get NAV equal CVNI, is that what you're saying?","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","No, NAV plus dividend is CVNI?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, it's NAV is -- it's actually not that. It's the change in NAV plus dividends reinvested at the then NAV, creates CVNI.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, got you.","Thomas M. Herzog","It's kind of the old Warren Buffet tick changes in NAV plus dividends is just -- is reinvested back in at NAV.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. The mention of issuing stock once you get over NAV, why does that not put a ceiling on the stock if you're basically going to say you're going to raise equity since you're above NAV?","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, it doesn't necessarily mean we will raise equity above NAV, but we certainly might. So I wouldn't say that as putting a ceiling on a stock.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then, the last question, maybe big picture, for Toomey. It was brought up a while ago about M&A. What do you think about with all this work you've done to put yourselves in high-barrier markets, you probably don't feel like you get properly valued for all the work that you've done to put 80% of your portfolio on coastal high-barrier markets. What about UDR as a seller, if the right price came along. Is that in the mindset there?","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, I think we can't control that and the market will be what it's going to be. And what we can do is grow our business, grow our cash flow, grow our NAV. And if the chips fall and there's an offer, that's what you have a Board of Directors for and a management team that has an alignment of interest with the shareholders. And we'll conduct ourselves accordingly. So we don't seek it out. I think it's a consequence. And for us, we can only put forth our plan, execute on it. We think it's the right plan and are excited about the plan.","Operator","I would like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead.","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, a brief closing. First, thank you for your time today and, certainly, for the -- a very good set of questions. Clearly, we have put forth an updated Three-Year Plan. We feel good about that plan. You can see through the transparency of it, what we expect to do. Like '13, we feel good about that execution, have the right resources in the room, the right environment. And are excited about not just performing at it, but exceeding it.

With these sales, we continue to process the cycling out of lower rent properties. Income per occupied home for this disposition averaged roughly $950 per month as of March 31, significantly below our portfolio average of $1,435 per home. ","Pricing on the sales met expectations with an average four and 12-month economic cap rate of roughly 6.25%. Once all the transactions are completed, our average portfolio income per occupied home is projected to increase to nearly $1,500 per month. In addition, we will have exceeded our previously announced disposition guidance for the year and we will have exited Fredericksburg, Virginia, Phoenix, Arizona, and Jacksonville, Florida markets. ","Our ongoing portfolio repositioning involves two components, improving our market mix and urbanizing our portfolio in our core markets. When our planned dispositions close in the second quarter, we will have sold roughly 35% to 40% of our non-core communities necessary to complete our portfolio repositioning effort. Urbanizing our portfolio in our core markets will take place through normal capital recycling. ","Our development and redevelopment pipeline totaled $1.2 billion that at the end of the quarter, a third of which has been funded to date. These communities are primarily located in urban areas of gateway markets that we expect to generate better long-term growth. ","With the majority of our current development and redevelopment pipeline reaching completion in 2012 or 2013, we are well positioned to capitalize on the strong multi-family demand fundamentals and limited new supply, evident in our target core markets. Regarding the overall acquisition environment, we continue to underwrite opportunities in our core markets, but the landscape remains highly competitive. ","With that said, we formed our second joint venture with MetLife in early January. The $1.3 billion venture consists of 12 operating communities, which is owned 50% by each partner. Seven of the 12 communities were contributed from our first joint venture with MetLife, while the remaining five collectively known as Columbus Square were purchased for $630 million when the JV was formed. We will continue to explore how best to expand this relationship over time. ","Finally, as I mentioned on previous calls, we remain committed to deleveraging over time, but our leverage has potential to be volatile over the short term, especially when a disconnect exits between capital outlays and our ability to source attractively priced equity. The funding of MetLife II JV with the first quarter, equity issuance, was a good example of such a mismatch. ","We continue to view ATM equity as a cost-efficient way to slowly deleverage, and therefore we instituted a new 20 million share plan after our previous program was exhausted, following the end of the first quarter. ","To summarize, all aspects of our business continue to perform well and as such, we reiterate that 2012 is expected to be a better year for UDR than 2011. Our dispositions and external growth efforts continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and transform our footprint and deleveraging our asset base over time remains a priority. ","With that, I will pass the call over to David.","David Messenger","Thanks Tom. My comments this morning will focus on our recent capital market activities, progress of our 2012 capital plans, our intent to further reduce leverage over time and an update on our year-to-date activities that affect our 2012 guidance. ","We were active in both the equity and debt capital markets during the first quarter. First, through our at the market equity-offering program, we raised $201 million of net proceeds during the first quarter from the sale of eight million shares at an average net price of $25.18. ","Following the first quarter end, we completed our previous ATM equity-offering program through the sale of an additional $50 million or 595,000 shares at an average net price of $25.21. A new ATM equity-offering program, whereby we can offer up to 20 million shares was initiated in early April. No shares have been sold via this program to-date. ","As a result of these actions, we had 241.2 million common share equivalent outstanding at March 31. Assuming no further equity raises for the balance of the year, the 2012 fully diluted share count would be 240.3 million common shares, inclusive of the ATM shares issued in April. ","Second, as previously announced, we completed a $400 million offering of 10-year unsecured notes at 4.625% in January. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay $100 million of 5% unsecured notes originally due in January. We will continue to access the unsecured debt market as the opportunities and needs arise. ","Turning to the balance sheet and an updated 2012 capital plan; as of March 31, we have nearly $1 billion of cash and credit capacity available to fund our business and external growth opportunities. With $194 million of debt coming due to the end of 2012, we expect to refinance these obligations as they come due at attractive rates compared to the maturing rates. ","Our year-to-date capital markets activity and the $610 million of completed and pending non-core community dispositions announced in early April had helped solidify our 2012 capital plan. Accordingly, an update to our anticipated capital activities this year would be helpful in illustrating the progress we\u2019ve made. ","Beginning with a $197 million line of credit balance at March 31, capital sources through the remainder of 2012 include the April ATM equity sales of $15 million and a community disposition proceed of approximately $477 million in the second quarter. Then uses include anticipated development spend of $315 million through the balance of the year, anticipated redevelopment spend of $85 million through the balance of the year and a redemption of $82 million of preferred G stock currently outstanding, which was announced last Friday. ","Combined, these sources and uses point to a line balance of roughly $187 million by year-end. Assuming no other capital market activities are undertaken during the remainder of 2012, we expect to be in a strong position to fully fund our 2013 operations developments and redevelopment obligations by year-end. ","Regarding leverage, on our fourth quarter 2011 earnings call, I outlined the tremendous progress we have made in deleveraging the enterprise since 2009. We remain committed to this strategy and moving forward, deleveraging will likely occur opportunistically and concurrently with the growth of the enterprise. ","And lastly, a quick word on our 2012 guidance. The timing of $610 million of completed and pending community dispositions in 2012 was contemplated in our original FFO per share guidance of $1.37 to $1.43 provided on our fourth quarter 2011 earnings call. ","We have been more successful in issuing equity from our ATM program than originally anticipated, but we are still within our original FFO per share guidance range, as the dilution from the shares issued was offset by the 8.1% same-store NOI growth and strong results from a non same store portfolio. We will review and if necessary, update guidance on our second quarter 2012 earnings call or if a material event warrants such an update during the interim. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store NOI grew 8.1%, driven by a 5.3% increase in revenue, and a better than expected expense growth of negative 0.2%. The lack of snow, relatively mild winter conditions in many of our cold weather markets, provided most of the expense related upside. ","Much like the fourth quarter of 2011, the first quarter 2012 progressed as we expected. Effective rental rate increased on new leases and our same-store communities accelerated towards the end of the first quarter, while renewal lease rates remained steady with an average increase of roughly 7% across our portfolio. San Francisco, Boston and Dallas were our best performing markets. ","During the first quarter we built same-store occupancy to roughly 96% by the end of March. Since then our occupancy has proven sticky and new lease rate growth has accelerated as we anticipated it would. This when combined with the current loss to lease of 4% in our same-store portfolio, gives us confidence that there\u2019s ample room to further push rents as we enter the peak leasing season. ","Our non same store wholly owned portfolio continues to perform well and now comprises 33% of NOI. This percentage will trend downwards as we advance through 2012. Four communities were added to our quarterly same-store pool in the first quarter, including two of our 2010 Boston acquisition. ","By the end of 2012, we expect our non-same-store pool to account for less than 20% of NOI. Specifically, our 2011 New York acquisitions are still generating above market rate rent growth, with blended new and renewal lease growth of 8% to 12%, and little to no occupancy loss. This is in line with what we\u2019ve reported on previous earnings calls. ","Moving on, two factors that directly affect our business are causing growing consternations for the investment community, our new multifamily supply and the affordability of single-family housing. First, supply; nationally multifamily permitting has rebounded from its great recession lows. The monthly reports indicate that there is still room to run until long-term supply and equilibrium is achieved. ","Digging deeper to the market level, Washington DC, Seattle, Austin, San Jose will all face a greater than average level of new supply pressure over the next couple of years. Now coincidentally these are the same markets where apartment fundamentals either held up well during the recession or where job creations coming out of the recession far outpaces the national average. ","Regarding the threat of new supply, I want to stress the key attribute of how we operate our business. We are a long-term holder of apartment communities and while we are very cognizant of short-term supply demand imbalances in our markets, our buy, hold, sell decision is predicated on a much longer time horizon than just the next two to three years. ","Now, single-family housing; since September 2008, single-family affordability has outpaced its long-term average according to the National Association of Realtors. So the fact that homes are cheap when measured by monthly mortgage payments to take home income, it\u2019s not a recent development. However, affordability should not be examined in the back end, as it differs significantly by market. ","It does not account for negative buyer\u2019s psychology or the access to capital and disregards potential buyer\u2019s ability to produce down payment. At some point we will see a more consequential number of our residents move out to by homes, but at less than 12% in the first quarter, we are flat with fourth quarter and only 100 basis points above our historical low. ","Lastly, when move outs to homes purchased do return to a more normalized level, the ultimate effect on our business will be somewhat dependent on how the macro economy is performing at that time. If a more vibrating recovery accompanies rising home purchases, then that\u2019s not a bad operating environment for us. ","Annualized turnover during the first quarter increased by 310 basis points year-over-year to 46.6%. We are having no trouble releasing our apartments to better credit residents with higher incomes. ","Turning to more recent results; through the majority of April, new lease rates have increased by 2.8% year-over-year, similar to the prior year period and renewals continue to trend well, up 6.7% or 120 basis points above last April\u2019s results. ","Renewal increases sent out for the remainder of the second quarter have averaged 6.5% to 7% and we expect to capture close to all of this increase as is generally the case. With occupancy holding in excess of 96%, we are primed for the peak-leasing season. ","With that operator, I would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin the question-and-answer session at this time. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates","Hi, good morning. Maybe just touching on that last point made by Jerry, could you talk a little bit more about comparing this year to last year. It looks like when we think about sequential same-store revenue growth, you were the same in the first quarter of this year as last year, but to get to your year-over-year revenue growth guidance, it seems as though you need to outperform the sequential numbers that you achieved in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q of last year. Is that the plan?","Jerry Davis","Yes Dave. I think we\u2019ll definitely do that in 2Q and 3Q. I mean, we see the revenue growth rate increasing in both second quarter and probably in third quarter, maybe leveling off in third, but then by the time we get to fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth will be comparable to what it was this quarter. ","But yes, we feel good about the business. We are looking at renewals in April that were at about 6.7%. We expect the next two months to come out right around 6.5% and we\u2019re optimistic about where we are at. Also today, our occupancy is at 96.1% and we spent a good portion of the first quarter firming up that occupancy, so we would really be in place to drive rents in this peak season.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates","Okay, thanks. And the other question is on the land parcel purchased in San Francisco. Could you provide some more details on that number of units, total cost expected, yield on today\u2019s rents, potential start date?","Harry Alcock","Yes, this is Harry. It\u2019s a fully entitled land site that\u2019s adjacent to a property that we own in a very good area in San Francisco, in Rincon Hill. It\u2019s a fully entitled site. Once we get through the city and have more details, we will report on it at that time.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates","Okay, and one last question if I may. Could you just revisit the expected needs for equity over the balance of the year? I seemed to pick up in your intro comments that you might use ATM further for additional deleveraging, but then there was a comment about tying it to acquisitions, so assuming no acquisitions over the balance of the year, should we expect any equity issuance?","David Messenger","Dave, this is Dave, and I\u2019ll let Tom follow-up, but if you go through my script, when we look at our capital sources and uses through the balance of the year, we don\u2019t have any additional equity in place, but with the share price increasing, it has throughout the year, we have an ATM in place, we are always looking at opportunistically issuing equity under that program. We used it in the first quarter and paid off some debt. I think that we would continue to look at that as an opportunity and an alternative for us as we go through the balance of the year.","Thomas Toomey","Mr. Bragg, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to add to that.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi Financial. Please go ahead.","Eric (ph) - Citi","Yes, this is Eric (ph) here with Michael. I just want to make sure I understood that your comments on guidance you said that the timing in the asset sales were contemplated in guidance, but you\u2019re already above the top end in terms of the level of dispositions. I\u2019m just trying to put those two together and understand whether there\u2019s going to be more dilution from asset sales than was originally in your guidance?","David Messenger","This is Dave. The asset sales that we had in guidance, $400 million to $600 million and obviously we have $610 million in there today, those are the sales that we are looking to have closed. We\u2019ll always have sub-listed in the marketplace. ","But I think if you go back to our four quarter call, we had talked about getting those sale down in the first half of the year, and so that timing was contemplated when we put out our guidance of $1.37 to $1.43 for 2012 and so right now, yes, we are $10 million over the guidance range, but that $10 million is not enough to reconfigure the guidance range at this point.","Eric (ph) - Citi","Got you. And then also you talked about the accelerating activity you are seeing in new lease rates. I was just wondering if you could provide some detail on how things trended from January all the way through April, just so we can get a sense for how those rates are coming in and going in the peak leasing season?","Jerry Davis","Sure, this is Jerry. In January and February, they both months new leases were coming in at about 1.7%; in March it jumped up to 2.6%; in April it was right around 3%. But one thing I would add though is when you look at that 3%, that\u2019s for our same-store. If you blended in our wholly owned, non-stabilized, non-same-stores, which is predominantly our New York portfolio, as well as a few others, those new leases would have been up 3.7% in April, which should be on my same-store.","Eric (ph) - Citi","Yes, and then I guess just based on guidance you\u2019d expect that this sort of trend up into the fours through the peak leasing season, just given where your numbers are in terms of same-store revenue?","Jerry Davis","Yes, I think, it could go fours. We are hopeful with if traffic continues to be strong and if there\u2019s some job gain in our market that it may get a hair above that, but I think fours are pretty reasonable.","Eric (ph) - Citi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and we have a question from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jana Galan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if we could get a little bit more detail on some of your completed developments of how the pre-leasing was for Savoye2 and maybe it looked like you pushed back the Huntington Beach and San Francisco Mission Bay project back a couple of quarters?","Thomas Toomey","Sure, I\u2019ll start with Savoye and then I\u2019ll probably turn it over to Harry. Savoye has been leasing great. We really look at Savoye1 and Savoye2 as one project, but I can tell you, in the last two weeks we leased about 60 apartments at the Savoyes and for the entire month of April it was 102 gross applications at the Savoye. ","So velocity\u2019s been great. We\u2019ve been able to hold our effective rents where we had planned, so things are going great there. The other active lease-up that we have underway right now is the Lodge at Stoughton up in the suburb of Boston and that project is also doing extremely well. We had 40 gross applications there in the month of April and in the past week we had 10.","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. In terms of the two projects you mentioned; first of all, in general, it\u2019s common for these schedules to change a little bit as we move from pre-construction to sort of the active development phase, once we get through drawing, locking our general contractor and getting all city approvals, it\u2019s common for the schedules to change a little bit. ","But with Huntington Beach, this is actually the first project developed in the city in 30 years, so the city is actually setting policy as to how and when they are going to allow us to occupy these buildings. Our preference has always been to phase occupancy, but the city initially told us that we had to wait till we get that final CL and would have to occupy all building and all units at one time. ","Through negotiation, the city now has allowed us to take initial occupancy at TCO, which is the timing we had showed previously, but allow us to phase in the occupancy over four or five months. The initial occupancy in our development schedule is unchanged, but how and when the city is going to require us to put our certificate of occupancy in place has changed a little bit.","Jana Galan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derek Bower with UBS Investment Bank. Please go ahead.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank","Very good morning. Can you provide some color on your recent conversations with your joint venture partner, specific to their appetite for future acquisitions, and we just say they are generally more or less eager to acquire assets compared to last year?","Thomas Toomey","This is Tom. With respect to our conversations on the joint venture front, first up all three are going very well, being Fannie, KFH and Met and all of them see the fundamentals of the business and the strengthening of it and have an appetite to expand their interest in multifamily. So we are out there shopping for our own book and we are also out there shopping for joint venture opportunities as well.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, thanks. And then just given that you\u2019ve already pre-funded your development spend for the year through dispositions, now can you just help us prioritize what use of proceeds for future asset sales maybe, whether it would be development or development pipeline recycling to new acquisitions or further de-levering?","Thomas Toomey","This is Tom again. I think all capital activity is weighed in its totality and fundability. The focus we have is continuing to deleverage our balance sheet and improve the quality of it and laddering of the maturity. So I think we weigh all of those aspects when we are weighing capital and the price of capital.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank","Yes, and I might have missed this, but what was the move-out for financial reasons and can you perhaps quantify the changed level of income per unit for your new move-ins versus move-outs. Thanks.","Jerry Davis Sure. ","Sure. Move-outs for financial reasons was about, I think 15% or 16%. I can tell you, we said home purchase was 12%, move-outs for rent increase were 7%. For financial reasons whether we pushed the rents too high \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m sorry, skips in evictions or other financial job loss was about 15% or 16%. And what was your second part, I\u2019m sorry?","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank","Just help quantify the change in level of income per unit between new move-ins and move-outs?","Jerry Davis","Yes. It\u2019s difficult to track on a same-store basis, just because our same-store pool has been changing with assets being sold, as well as the Boston assets moving in. I think it\u2019s gone up about 5% or 6% in general, and when you look at places especially like Boston. ","In Boston, we saw our move-outs to rent increase go up to 18% of the reasons for move-out, and that compares to about 6% last year. What\u2019s really happening there is two years ago people were able to move in, because the peak to trough drop was so great they got a deal basically, and they\u2019ve been moving back out and going back down to B product instead of living in our A communities. ","Now when you look at that increase in turnover, which is up 17% year-over-year, which is dramatic, you\u2019d see a reason for concern, except we have been able to reload at those higher income residents. We\u2019ve been able to keep occupancy levels in that metro, San Francisco area well above 96% and as you see in our supplement, we had revenue growth in San Francisco of over 12% this quarter, so that kind of a churn doesn\u2019t bother us when you can reload quickly.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and we have a question from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask on the expense decline in the quarter, you noted it was somewhat due to the mild winter. Is there going to be a timing reversal on any expense savings you had this quarter and is the 3% to 3.5% guidance range still reasonable?","Jerry Davis","Okay, this is Jerry. I\u2019d say our expense growth definitely came in well below our expectations in the quarter. As I said in my remarks, a lot of that was from a little snow removal, as well as mild winter conditions, which depressed gas expense. Right now we are running ahead of guidance, but there is a lot of unknown throughout the year with regard to expense growth and we\u2019ll update guidance at the end of the second quarter. ","As far as a reversal or is anything that will flow from first quarter to second quarter, I don\u2019t think so. A few other things that happened last year where we were hit with, pretty heavy healthcare claims in the first quarter and we do self-insure and that didn\u2019t repeat itself. We\u2019ve continued to streamline our staffing at the site level and realized efficiency. ","Now, the one thing that could start to pop, but this was really contemplated in our guidance earlier, was a lot of our turnover cost will end up hitting us in the second quarter, because the turns happened in the second half of the first quarter, so we turned most of those units in March, and you\u2019ll start seeing some of those expenses come, but that was really built into the guidance.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Next question is just on the development pipeline. Tom, I think you said in your comments that most of the current pipeline, all the current pipeline actually is currently going to be completed by the end of 2013. ","From a strategic standpoint, would you like to backfill the pipeline to be just as big in 2014 or does some of the uncertainty regarding the supply and just the fundamental picture make you want to possibly start to scale back development as you look ahead?","Jerry Davis","Okay, that\u2019s a very good question. With respect to the size and scope of the pipeline, we are certainly looking at backfilling the 14, 15 deliveries and we are looking at a $10 billion to $11 billion enterprise. Our view is to try to have 3% to 5% of deliveries on an annual basis, and so we\u2019ll scope the size and scope of our development pipeline around those percentages in the size of the enterprise as it continues to grow. ","So that\u2019s part of the downtown San Francisco dirt acquisition and you\u2019ll probably see us continue to look for urban setting type dirt, where we think the supply equation has a long run at it in our favor and we will continue to fill in those blanks and keep you informed as we progress.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. Just one more if I may. On the disposition front, do you have anything beyond the $610 million under contract today?","David Messenger","No, we don\u2019t.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew McCulloch with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors","Good morning. On the $600 million dispositions that you achieved, a 6.25 economic cap rate on, can you tell us what the CapEx reserve is in that number and if you can, what the cap rates were for the different markets?","David Messenger","In general, the cap rates are based on 2012 budgeted NOI with 3% management fees and 600 per unit in CapEx. I don\u2019t have the exact cap rates; it\u2019s little lower in Phoenix and a little higher in Jacksonville, but there\u2019s a little bit of variability around that. We can talk about it in detail offline if you want to. I just don\u2019t have that in front of me.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then in your non same store pool is it possible for you to tell us what the year-over-year revenue and NOI growth is for that portfolio on an isolated basis and maybe just have to look at the acquired properties and not the (stabs), but is there any way you could give us those numbers?","Jerry Davis","I\u2019ll tell you Andy, this is Jerry, there is a few properties that you potentially could that for, but most of the properties in our non same store, we didn\u2019t own it the same time last year, so you can\u2019t or it was in the first couple of months in the ownership when you anniversary off it and there are some things that can fluctuate those first couple of months. It wouldn\u2019t really make the numbers meaningful.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors","In the broad comment you are saying they are running a little bit better than the same store pool district where they are located?","Jerry Davis","Yes, and I can tell you that\u2019s true and I can tell you they are running better than my same store pool, because I look at when I\u2019m getting in new lease rates. I can tell you what I\u2019m getting in renewal growth and I can tell you that I\u2019ve been able to typically shave off some expenses from what we inherited those assets at.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning guys. Jerry, just going back to operations, you usually give a loss to lease statistic, how is that compared right now and then, as you saw the 300 basis point pick up in turnover, were there any particular markets where you noted there\u2019s a spike?","Jerry Davis","Sure. Yes, loss to lease right now, they were right around 4%, so still in good shape, plenty of room to run with that and we do expect market rents to grow throughout the leasing season and then they tend to slowdown or actually go backwards as far as you get into the winter months. ","On the turnover, and I did misspeak earlier, I apologize if I said San Francisco\u2019s turnover was up 17%, I was looking through online. Actually, my heaviest increases in turnover, the top one was in San Diego, which was up 20%, most of that\u2019s military deployments. We only have 300 units there that are heavily dependent on Camp Pendleton. ","Boston as said was up about 17%. I can tell, you we have been pushing rents there heavily since we bought those two deals at the end of 2010. San Francisco was up 5%, Dallas was up 5%, we have been pushing rent growth in Dallas and San Francisco very heavily. Then Monterey County portfolio was up 12%. A few of the ones that are low or below my average are my Orange County portfolio is actually down 1%; Austin is down 8%; Nashville which has been a really strong market for us this year is down 3%, Seattle is up 2%, and Washington DC is up 2%.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s such great detail. Second question; I think this comment is a follow-up to Karin\u2019s. Should we look for additional development starts in the year or redevelopment starts if there would be \u2013 and as you think about development yields, how are those trending relative to underwriting at this point?","Thomas Toomey","This is Tom. More increase in development starts. Certainly as we are able to fill in the \u201814 and \u201815 delivery calendar we\u2019ll announce those and you would work backwards and say, if you\u2019re here in the middle of \u201812, then looking out two years, three years, so I would expect to see some of that expand as the year progresses. ","With respect to development yields, they are holding steady. You\u2019ve got a combination of the market rents that are moving, and in particular the spikes in activities that we are undertaking, very strong rent numbers for that urban product, that A product, and offsetting that is a slight increase in the cost structure and land values. So overall I\u2019d say yields are still at about 6, 6.5 type range on trending, on in-place, most of them are starting out at a 6.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s good. So there\u2019s an unrelated follow-up on the capital markets front. As you look at the price of the equity today, you also look at disposition, and disposition pricing. Are you more inclined to sell more assets or continue raising money at the ATM as a means of deleveraging as you kind of talked about there?","Jerry Davis","Well, I think it\u2019s important to try to do both. I think you expose your lower quality assets that are non-core, you anticipate ultimately selling some day and you see what price they fetch and you also look at the share price, and this management team will freely admit we look at the share price every day and with the ATM it represents a great way for us to continue to deleverage, and we continue look at asset sales.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning. You\u2019d mentioned \u2013 I think you said that household income in your portfolio was up maybe 5%, 6%. Can you give us a sense of what rent as a percent of income is now versus a year ago?","Jerry Davis","Sure Alex, this is Jerry. It\u2019s still right around 18%. I think a year ago it was roughly 17%, so it\u2019s just gone up very modestly.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And then going to the capital markets side, you guys just took out your \u2013 I think it was your last public preferred, the Series G. I think you guys still have some OP preferred, but just want to get your sense given \u2013 do you think that public preferreds have a place in your capital structure or based on where you want to go with your fixed charge coverage or just maybe more using straight common and straight unsecured that preferreds for your perspective really don\u2019t have a place in the current rate environment?","David Messenger","I think that the preferreds today, given that they are at 6.75% and new issue preferreds, well maybe a little bit less, when you compare that against unsecured rates, asset sales, common equity and all the other alternatives to capital we have, I don\u2019t think the preferreds have a place in the capital stack today. So that\u2019s you saw us making an announcement on Friday that we are going to redeem the $82 million of preferred Gs outstanding and then we\u2019ll continue to source and review all the other alternatives available to us.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And then just a final question, did you guys comment on the $23 million of the tax benefit in the TRS?","David Messenger","No, we didn\u2019t. We recorded a very significant tax benefit in the TRS and we did not include it in FFO. We didn\u2019t include it, we didn\u2019t feel that it truly fits the intention of the FFO definition. The adjustment was due to sales. We\u2019ve completed those that are pending. Those sales allowed us to reverse the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and the related non-net operating loss items. That\u2019s kind of it in a nutshell. If you want to discuss it further, go into greater detail, give me a call later today.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Yes, I had a question about Mission Bay. I mean it\u2019s been in the news recently because of \u2013 well, not very recently, but the sales force decided to suspend its campus there. Can you talk about how does that change your underwriting on your project, maybe from a demand perspective, but also from relative to your land cost?","Harry Alcock","Well, this is Harry. I\u2019ll start \u2013 we saw the announcement as well and we are aware of it, but the sales force did not actually leave the city. So they did not relocate to the Mission Bay area, but those employees remained in the city and I can tell you rents in the city have continued to increase. We feel very good about our land bases and ultimately the development yields we expect on that project.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","","Great.","","Jerry Davis","I would add to that Swaroop. Harry is right. When you look at our rents in the city, when I look at my property Edgewater, which is right across the canal from Mission Bay and then our 388 deal, our new lease rates there are 20% higher than what the departing resident was paying, and those are maybe, gosh, a mile from the Mission Bay site at the most. So it\u2019s still generally in the neighborhood, but just not right across the street. But I do think we feel over time other employers are going to come into that Mission Bay area. It\u2019s not going to be vacant.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And Jerry, just to pick up on markets again, can you tell us any markets which you were surprised by this quarter and maybe even heading into the peak leasing season, either on a positive or negative perspective?","Jerry Davis","Sure, probably my biggest positive surprise right now, Orange County, it\u2019s very strong. We had revenue growth of 6.8%. My sequential was well over 2%. We are running that with good occupancy right now. We are getting great rent growth. We do feel like the renters are coming back to those locations, west of the 405, so I would tell you probably my biggest positive surprise is OC. ","Finally, our Florida markets in Orlando and Tampa are starting to contribute. They are north of 4% revenue growth. They\u2019ve been a positive surprise. My negative surprises have been really located more in my tertiary markets, those non-core, Sacramento, Monterey, Portland, my other Mid-Atlantic have not performed well, and then probably my last disappointment would be down in San Diego, where I had very marginal revenue growth of less than 0.5%, really due to military rotations. ","I would tell you, in San Diego, I expect my second half to be much better, because we really saw a downtrend in revenue growth there, starting in the second half of last year. When the rotations started we were anniversarying our strong first half numbers, but we are going be going against weak second half numbers and we are hopeful that some of the military comes back.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Richard Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks everybody. So I\u2019m looking back in your disposition, the $1.7 billion in 2008, which I think you described as the lower echelon of your portfolio at the time. I\u2019m curious, is there any connection, was there a feeling then that there was more to do beyond that or was there something that happened from \u201808 to now that triggered a greater urbanization of the company?","Thomas Toomey","This is Toomey. At the time we sold that portfolio, you know eight, our felling was is that it didn\u2019t make sense to buy. The prices that were being paid for assets were above replacement costs and so we look at our portfolio and said, if asset pricing is in that structure, how much of it does it make sense to sell, and we knew we were going to go more towards the coastal urbanization product, and as we tried to decipher how much, it came in a combination of factors. ","First, our effort to preserve our dividend at that time, second was an element of 1031 in the tax structuring or how big of a special dividend we would have, and we felt comfortable settling in on that $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion at that time, and I think we\u2019ve been rewarded. ","The assets that we held through the financial crisis have come back strong. Jerry\u2019s done a good job in running them, and we probably got better pricing on this group than we would have had we sold them back in \u201808. So I think that\u2019s been done. ","Your question kind of moves towards the next, which is how much is left, and as you can see, we\u2019ve got $600 million that will close by the second quarter, and that\u2019s about 40%. So you can do the math that really we are setting at probably $600 million to $800 million more to go and no particular hurry. ","You can look at the markets and see what they are, and feel like the NOI growth is picking up steam and in some of those locations we\u2019d like to garner that and then sell them in the next window of time, and I think that\u2019s going to be driven by both the NOI growth, by capital flows, and certainly the debt markets and the rate environment, but we feel no pressure and probably we\u2019ll be rewarded for big issues, steadily exposing to the market and see what prices we get and when we hit our targets, they\u2019ll be gone.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","So you don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s kind of like this kind of lingering overhang of another potentially dilutive large transaction. You think it will be a low and steady process at this point forward?","Thomas Toomey","Yes, I think it\u2019s just really an insignificant amount in relationship to the enterprise. I mean you are at a $10 billion, $11 billion enterprise. You are always going to have some portion of it that you should be examining, whether you\u2019ve optimized the value or the markets over paying for it, and then you should always try to be thinking about selling 3% to 5% of your portfolio on an annual basis. Our hope is that the use of proceeds will be able to redeploy back into higher yielding, higher quality, urban products that we are developing or redeveloping.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","All right. And then my follow-up question is you talked a lot about your average rent is up and you are selling lower rents. I guess the question is, is it absolutely better to be at a higher versus lower rent scenario and isn\u2019t it the case that the higher income people are more in the crosshairs of a housing reversal in terms of home buying and the rest more wealthy people, can you comment on that?","Thomas Toomey","Yes Rich, there\u2019s a couple of things that come to mind for us as the management group and the first is the slide of homeownership. Today the tick up and the data points to a drop to 64.5%, and it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s probably going to continue to fall. ","Primarily what I think people are messing out of the news and the settlement of the mortgage with the banks, is that now they are free to start exposing more and more assets to foreclosure sales and that\u2019s going to drive down the appraised values and going to make people have to come out with larger equity check and that process is at least in our mind, a two to five year process for Americans to heal their balance sheet, to be able to save enough, to be able to afford homes and I don\u2019t think home appreciation is going to be anywhere near the picture, because of this foreclosure sale type environment. ","On the long term basis, I guess, I\u2019m starting to see it, not been at it a long time. America is turning into a have and a have not and the people at the high-caliber income, urban settings are where the jobs are going to be. ","They are going to have higher income, elasticity, wealth elasticity, and the people that are kind of wage earners if you will, are going to be more exposed to shocks in fuels, the utility, insurance, healthcare, all of those are going to weigh on their ability to pay higher rent and we feel like the balance in the right place to be on a long-term basis is that urban, more income elasticity type resident, and we recognize that they had a choice. But if you take Manhattan, for example, 70% of the population rent. They have had choices for decades and have chosen to rent for decades.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with the Macquarie Group Services. Please go ahead.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie","Good morning guys. Dave or maybe Jerry, can you guys \u2013 you guys talked about expenses before, but can you give us an idea of what 300 or 500 basis points of turnover impact is on the same-store expense line in terms of growth there and then how property taxes are coming in a third into the year?","David Messenger","This is Dave, I\u2019ll take the second half of your question here on the property taxes. So far we haven\u2019t had any surprises either to the positive or the negative. We really start seeing those second, third quarter. We\u2019ve been talking with our consultants, and speaking with some of the jurisdictions, where we have information how \u2013 and we\u2019re able to have some preliminary conversations, so right now I think we\u2019re okay on the real estate tax front, we\u2019ll have some more color to update you at the time of the second quarter call, which will be midway through the summer, we\u2019ll have some more valuations out.","David Messenger","Rob, on your turnover question, I\u2019m going to have to either get back to you or ask Chris to \u2013 I\u2019m going to have to run the numbers to really come up with a good number.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie","Okay. And then one question for you Tom; with the exit of Phoenix market, what characteristics does Dallas have, the key to their longer term that Phoenix didn\u2019t?","Thomas Toomey","Well I think the Dallas suburban portfolio is probably one that will continue to liquidate over time. I think the Dallas urban portfolio has many of the characteristics we are seeking, an elastic type resident and supply constrained and the caliber of product we want to deliver. So we\u2019ll probably shrink our Dallas exposure more to that urban product, and that would probably include the Vitruvian, and as you can see from Jerry, when you call a 122 acres and almost a submarket, you\u2019re able to garner better traffic and higher rents, and so I think that would be our long-term focus in the Dallas market.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","","Good morning guys. I\u2019m curious, maybe for Tom, are there markets that are attractive to you today, where say development doesn\u2019t pencil right now, but it might take two to three years to get there or even longer?","Thomas Toomey","Well, I think the markets that we\u2019ve studied over time that we don\u2019t have a foothold in today would probably be Miami. It is probably the glaring hole in the portfolio in terms of that urban\/product that would fit. Outside of that, I think the rest, there is long development cycles in all of those urban products and we wouldn\u2019t exclude land. We\u2019re not trying to time the market if you will as much as we\u2019re trying to look at sub-neighborhoods and get ahead of where we think they are growing and where the employment base is growing.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","I\u2019m curious, maybe I\u2019ll switch gears a little bit. Now that you guys have made something about, I\u2019m going to say a splash in the New York City market, I guess on the operating side, what do you think has gone better or worse than your expectations, and secondarily, have you found or maybe you\u2019ve shaken loose some interest from maybe assets that have been owned somewhat generationally, by family that you might be looking to sell?","Jerry Davis","I guess I\u2019ll start with what\u2019s gone better. Obviously, the expenses came in better than expected. Some of that was outside of our control, the weather and some of it was definitely within our control, such as streamlining our offices better, as well as our maintenance to garner a little bit of expense savings there. ","Probably the biggest I\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve continued to find more opportunities in this good economy to pass through higher fees or increase our reimbursement percentages, but there really haven\u2019t been too many surprises, and then on the negative, I\u2019d tell you there\u2019s very little that surprised me.","Harry Alcock","I guess the second half of the question, I\u2019ll answer, this is Harry. In terms of finding opportunities from families, I mean as you probably know that tends to be a fairly sticky group. They tend to make these decisions for often reasons other than pure economics. ","I think at this point it\u2019s worth noting that the product deals we\u2019ve done have all been from families and from five separate families. So without question, we are a group that has performed, that is in that conversation, and we continue to have discussions with other families in New York City. It becomes very difficult to predict if and when we will get additional acquisition opportunities in New York City, but we do continue to have those conversations.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","And just one last question, one of your competitors has gone a long way in a big deal by branding their product and recently announced brands, kind of three distinct brands that have cut their portfolio up a little bit differently, may be if we can positioning it differently for different types of consumers. What\u2019s your thinking about that level of branding and do you ever foresee yourself going down that road.","Thomas Toomey","Well, I think we are intrigued to see yes, they are successful and I think we continue to watch how it\u2019s been executed, and if it in fact garners a benefit to them. My experience in this business has been individual communities find their own way into the market mix and residents are able to select what fits them best and you just need to do a better job of marketing to people and protect your segments, and I think some of that\u2019s come in about Jerry and his technology advancements and certainly in the social media front here. ","On of our greatest assets for marketing is our own existing residents and to keep them happy, and so we think that\u2019s where we are going to focus. A lot is on resident satisfaction, resident marketing and the amenity and the staff itself delivering. So, we\u2019ll watch it and see how it performs.","Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi Financials. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman - Citi Financials","Yes, I just had a question on the assets that were sold or that are pending to be sold; the 15 communities, and maybe weave in a little bit about the six that were sold in the first quarter. How many different buyers was that and sort of what type were they, were they just local, were they financial buyers and just give a little bit more color around that?","Harry Alcock","Sure, this is Harry. So there are three separate buyers. We had two buyers on the transactions that closed in the first quarter. One was a local buyer that was backed by a private equity firm; the second was a syndicator, sort of mostly a regional syndicator that owns sort of B quality apartments around the country, that was a fairly significant management company; and the third was a buyer that had just raised a new fund, that they are a fairly significant buyer to not operate their own property, so they are purely a financial buyer, because there is a little bit of each.","Jerry Davis","To add some color, I mean you are finding all aspects of the buyers of real estate out there today. The levered buyer, the pure capital low leverage player, the local player is out there. I mean it\u2019s a great time to expose assets, because you\u2019re finding a lot of traction and a lot of different veins for capital.","Michael Bilerman - Citi Financials","And so one of the assets that\u2019s being sold is a development. What\u2019s the basis in the development in Phoenix, Stadium Village?","Harry Alcock","What\u2019s our cost basis?","Michael Bilerman - Citi Financials","Well yes, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile a little bit of what you have held for, at least on the balance sheet, you got held for disposition, call it un-depreciative of $455 million. Does that include Stadium Village or exclude it?","David Messenger","Stadium Village \u2013 this is Dave. Cost basis is around $50 million.","Michael Bilerman - Citi Financials","Is that held for disposition or that\u2019s still in development?","David Messenger","No, that\u2019s in held for disposition. Anything that we have that was moved into held for disposition, you\u2019d see on the balance sheet we took out. There is a held for disposition asset line item and also for the liabilities, so we took that out.","Michael Bilerman - Citi Financials","Right, and so looking at attachment six, so you have your NOI, you break it out very nicely between all the different components, your held for dispositions is $8.7 million in the quarter, call it about $35 million annualized over $477 million, that\u2019s a 7.3% cap rate. What am I doing wrong? I guess your development has low income that would only raise it even more?","Thomas Toomey","I think you have to look at it in more detail.","David Messenger","Yes, Michael, this is Dave. We\u2019ll take a look at that, and we\u2019ll talk to you and Eric offline and give some additional information for you.","Michael Bilerman - Citi Financials","Okay, and then just the last question, in terms of the move-ins, the technology initiatives, was that initiated via an internet source of 56%. I guess it surprised me that 44% of people are still not using the internet to shop for where they want to live? I guess, how accurate do you think that survey is, that you\u2019re tracking when they come in and where are these other 44% of people coming from; these are drive bys?","Jerry Davis","I think it\u2019s drive-bys, I think it\u2019s walk bys as you\u2019ve gotten more urban. I also think like Tom said earlier, we are getting a lot more coming in from resident referrals. I can tell you, we are not in the rental publications and for the most part we don\u2019t use brokers, except in some situations in Dallas and in Houston. So it predominantly has gone down as we\u2019ve gone a little more urban. And you\u2019re relying to some degree on what the incoming person tells either our call center or the people at the site, if they give us a different answer, we are not going to wrestle them down.","Michael Bilerman - Citi Financials","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Taylor Schimkat with KBW. Please go ahead.","Taylor Schimkat - KBW","Hey, good morning guys. My first question is probably for Jerry. Just on the dispositions portfolio, could you tell us what the operating guidance assumptions were for 2012? I guess I\u2019m curious on the margin whether the assets sales would push 2012 operating guidance assumptions higher or lower or else equal?","Jerry Davis","I don\u2019t have that in front of me, but I would tell you, they were probably generally about in line with what we would have expected on average. Phoenix, we expected to do right about average with what our full company guidance was, and Jacksonville was probably just a hair under. So I think the impact was probably negligible.","Taylor Schimkat - KBW","Okay. And then my second question is probably for Harry or Tom. Could you talk about the opportunity set today for sourcing new JV development deals as compared to acquiring wholly owned entitled land for development?","Thomas Toomey","This is Tom. I would tell you that Warren and Harry are entertaining numerous opportunities, where our developers have entitled sites locked up and are seeking a capital partner, and I think that trend is worth noting, is that while we are enjoying a great run in the apartment business, the developers and the merchant builders are increasing their backlog, but they are not finding the capital to go at it full force (ph) if you will or full force, and so they are turning to REITs and obviously we\u2019ve got a couple of pre-development programs with Hanover and others that we are looking at. ","So I think it\u2019s a good thing for REITs to mine, if they wanted to wrap up their development pipeline in high quality and really, if you will, the strength of the trade is in our side of the equation right now.","Taylor Schimkat - KBW","So, would you say then that there is a premium return to UDR for doing JV development deals as opposed to wholly owned land and if so, what you think that yield premium would be?","Thomas Toomey","Well, I think you have to look at the quality and caliber of each individual opportunity, and so if undertaking a Boston development can yield us a 6, 6.5 and we have to joint venture as a partner to do that, we probably would undertake that effort. ","Could we do that on our own? It\u2019s a question of how much G&A you want to carry, how much pursuit time and what happens if you decide your full in Boston in that case and you don\u2019t want to, what you do with your team. So we like the template, because it exposes us to a lot of different opportunities and we can pick and choose through them and right now, as I said earlier, I think it\u2019s in our favor to go through those opportunities and pick the best one for ourselves.","Taylor Schimkat - KBW","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","The team and infrastructure is adequate to support the growth you\u2019re planning over the next several years or do you think you\u2019re going to have to add some bandwidth?","Thomas Toomey","Paula, this Tom. Certainly this group that\u2019s sitting around the table today has on average about a $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in acquisition sales activity for the better part of a decade, and that we\u2019ve averaged $400 million of development. So I think if we stay in that bandwidth this group\u2019s quite capable. ","On the operating platform, a point that didn\u2019t go noticed is we managed about 60,000 doors today and we sold about 10% of them by the end of June and so Jerry has capacity on Harry\u2019s platform to certainly do more than what we are doing today and what we are turning our attention to do is not more, but doing a better job and I think he\u2019s going to do that.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Gentlemen please continue.","Thomas Toomey","Well, first let me thank all of you for your conversations and questions today, we appreciate that. I think May is a important month for UDR. We celebrate two major milestones; first, it will be our 40th year as a REIT, and it will be our 160th quarterly dividend paid and I thank all the people that have over the years made that possible, but it is a milestone for the company and one we are very proud of. ","Second, 2012 is off to a great start. It\u2019s certainly going to be a better year than 2011, and we see no threats to that in the horizon. And lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you in June at NAREIT, and certainly at our Investor Tour of Columbus Square on Monday, June 11. With that, take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for this afternoon. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"20761":["UDR, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.","Shelby Noble","Welcome to UDR's third quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, www.UDR.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirement.","I would like to note that the statements made during this call which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. When we get to the question-and-answer portion we ask you that you be respectable to everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-up. Management will be available after the call for your questions that do not get answered. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Shelby and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","Let me start by saying the third quarter was fantastic on all metrics. With 10 months of 2015 complete, four things stand out to me. First, we set out a strategic plan in February and have exceeded it on all fronts. Second, we surpassed our expectations with exceptional operating results which Jerry will outline in his remarks.","Third, we were presented with a couple of strategic problem-solving opportunities that we were able to take advantage of. Namely, the $559 million West Coast development joint venture and the $901 million Washington, DC acquisition. These both fell in line with our long-term goals.","As they both were accretive to cash flow growth, we were able to issue equity at or above NAV and they were lowered our overall leverage metrics. And lastly, we sold or have under contract $800 million in gross assets, our share of which is $480 million. Let's turn to 2016 and the long-term outlook. As you know, the macro numbers around jobs, household formation, supply, et cetera, look very favorable for the foreseeable future. When we further analyze our specific submarkets and individual community dynamics, we believe that our portfolio of mix of A and B communities in our urban and suburban locations will continue to perform well throughout the cycles.","I know the question on your mind of how 2016 looks. Jerry and the entire operating team have been working hard to position UDR for a strong result in 2016. Without giving forward guidance at this point, we expect 2016 revenue growth to be at least as good as 2015, but after eight years of sub-3% expense growth, we do expect pressure from payroll and taxes to lead to expense increases of just over 3%.","All-in, with strong operating fundamentals and over $500 million of development in lease-up, we're in good shape to drive cash flow and NAV growth for 2016 and into the future. As promised, we will publish another two-year strategic plan in February 2016 that will outline what we can expect for our shareholders.","With that, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all my fellow UDR associates for an extraordinary work in producing another strong quarter of results. We look forward to the remainder of 2015 and to a great 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include third quarter results, balance sheet and capital markets update, recent transactions, casualty loss incurred during the quarter, 421-a and -g impact on New York property taxes and revised full-year 2015 guidance. Our third quarter earnings results were above the upper end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.42, $0.42 and $0.37, respectively. This was primarily driven by better-than-expected year-over-year third quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth which were strong at 5.9%, 2.7% and 7.3% respectively. Jerry will provide additional color in his prepared remarks.","Next, balance sheet and capital markets activity, in August, we issued $102 million of common equity at a net price of $35 per share. In September, we issued $300 million of 10-year, 4% senior unsecured notes with a yield to maturity of 4.03%. Inclusive of swap breakage fees, our all-in rate was approximately 4.5%.","Subsequent to quarter-end, we amended and recasted our unsecured revolving credit facility which increased the size from $900 million to $1.1 billion, extended the maturity to January 2021 inclusive of the extensions and reduced our interest rate spread by 10 basis points to LIBOR plus 90 basis points. We also amended and consolidated our $350 million of term loans under the same facility, repriced the loan to LIBOR plus 95 basis points, a reduction of 20 basis points and extended the maturity date to January 2021.","These transactions completed our debt and equity needs for the year. At quarter-end, our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 36.7% and on a fair value basis, it was 26%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6 times and inclusive of pro-rata JVs, it was 7 times. All metrics have continued to improve during the year as we had anticipated in our two-year outlook. At the current date, our liquidity is measured by cash and credit facility capacity is $991 million.","On to recent transactions, as previously announced in our October 7 press release, subsequent to quarter-end, we closed our Washington, DC acquisition. With this transaction, we purchased six communities valued at $901 million in a recovering Washington, DC market. The transaction was funded through a combination of $565 million of common OP units issued at $35 per unit, the assumption of $89 million of mortgage debt, $221 million of Section 1031 exchanges which are under contract and $26 million in cash. Additionally, we have another $66 million of communities under contract to sell. We expect to close these transactions in December and upon completion, will have exited the Norfolk market.","Next, casualty loss incurred during the quarter. In late September, 717 Olympic, a 151-home community located in Los Angeles, California which we have a 50% interest through our MetLife II joint venture, experienced extensive water damage due to a sand pipe rupture. As a result, we had to fully evacuate the building. Until clean-up is completed and all safety measures are met, residents will not be allowed to reoccupy the building. We have arranged for them to live in furnished apartments in Downtown LA. The full extent of the damage is still being quantified and will be updated in our fourth quarter earnings release.","As a result of the casualty, we expect to incur a $0.01 charge to FFO, of which is only $256,000 has been incurred as of September 30. While the joint venture's insurance policy has a $25,000 deductible, the $0.01 charge is attributable to business interruption and temporary housing for our residents which GAAP requires that we recognize as incurred.","As this charge is expensed, it will be deducted from FFO, but added back to FFO as adjusted. We expect to recover a significant portion of this charge from the insurance providers and any subsequent recoveries will be included in FFO, but deducted from FFO as adjusted. Since 717 Olympic is owned by MetLife II JV, it has no impact on our same-store results.","Next, I will provide an update on the tax impact of the 421-a and -g real estate tax programs which impact three of our New York City assets, 95 Wall, 10 Hanover and Columbus Square. Individual programs by property burn off in varying amounts over the next 15 years and the impact is based on future assessed values and levy rates which for the out years we cannot fully estimate.","However, I will provide the impact for 2015 and projected impact for 2016 and 2017 and we will continue to update you over time as the valuation of levy rates become known and we determine the projected impact. For 2015, 2016 and 2017, 421-a and -g in New York City is expected to negatively impact our same-store expenses by 25 basis points, 45 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively and impacts the year-over-year AFFO by $240,000, $670,000 and $1.3 million, respectively.","As a reminder, when we acquired these buildings, the 421 property tax impact was included in our underwriting assumptions. Notably, the rent growth for these properties has surpassed even our underwriting and all-in IRRs to-date in these investments are in the low to mid-teens. On to fourth quarter and full-year 2015 updated guidance.","We increased our full-year FFO as adjusted and AFFO guidance ranges for the third time this year, primarily due to stronger-than-expected operations. Our FFO as adjusted per share and AFFO per share guidance ranges increased by $0.01 and $0.02 at the mid-points, respectively. Full-year 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share are now forecasted at $1.65 to $1.67, $1.65 to $1.67 and $1.49 to $1.51, respectively.","For same-store, we have increased our full-year 2015 revenue growth guidance by 12.5 basis points at the mid-point to 5.25% to 5.5%. Expense growth increased by 12.5 basis points at the mid-point to 2.75% to 3% and our NOI growth forecast increased by 25 basis points at the mid-point to 6.25% to 6.75%. The revenue increase was driven by strong new and renewal rate growth.","Fourth quarter 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.40 to $0.42, $0.41 to $0.43 and $0.36 to $0.38, respectively. Other primary full-year guidance assumptions can be found on attachment 15 or page 28 of our supplement. Finally, in the third quarter we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.2775 per share or $1.11 per share when annualized, representing a yield of approximately 3.1%. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I will cover the following topics. First, our third quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and an overview of our current operating strategy. Second, the performance of our core markets during the quarter. And last, a brief update on our development lease-ups.","We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the third quarter, our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 6.2% year-over-year to $1,792, while occupancy declined 30 basis points to 96.6%. This led to third quarter revenue growth of 5.9%. Our revenue growth for the first nine months of the year was 5.4% year-over-year.","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth which is detailed on attachment 8-G of our supplement, our ability to push new lease rate growth continued to outpace historical precedent during the third quarter by a wide margin. We grew new lease rates by 7.6% in the third quarter, a full 310 basis points ahead of the third quarter of 2014. Renewal growth also remained robust, at 7.3% in the third quarter or 220 basis points ahead of last year. This strength in pricing and demand served as the primary driver of our sizable 12.5-basis point increase in same-store revenue guidance at the midpoint or 137.5 basis points from our initial guidance provided in February.","As Tom mentioned earlier, we increased our full-year revenue growth guidance range to 5.25% to 5.5%. Although we expect a normal seasonal slowdown to occur starting soon, we continue to see strong fundamentals and our strategy continues to be driving rate growth in order to help build in our 2016 revenue.","Third quarter expense growth was 2.7% and brings our year-to-date growth to 2.3%. We increased the mid-point of full-year expense guidance by 1\/8 of a point to 2.875%, due to increased insurance premiums and higher sight-level incentive compensation due to outperformance of property-level budgets.","Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary markets, these markets represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 74% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 17% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 6.4% and continues to outperform versus our initial budgeted expectations.","Our LA portfolio posted strong third quarter revenue growth of 8.2%, an acceleration over the 3.8% revenue growth reported in first quarter and 6% in the second quarter. The job growth we have spoken to in the west LA coastal communities from Santa Monica to Playa Vista is continuing to arrive and we continue see the Marina Del Rey submarket as a primary beneficiary of these new jobs. We expect full-year revenue growth of nearly 7% in 2015, quite an acceleration from what we had forecasted earlier in the year.","New York City which represents 13% of our total NOI, saw revenue growth of 5.8% year-over-year. Continued investment and retail interest at the World Trade Center site supports our long-term view that there is a long runway of growth potential for our New York City portfolio. Metro DC which represents 13% of our total NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.6%.","As I stated on the second quarter call, job growth is returning and in some submarkets, supply is easing. Importantly, we have continued to focus on growing market rent via new lease rate, pricing, when possible, as it translates into renewal pricing power as well. We still anticipate full-year revenue growth in DC of just under 2%.","San Francisco which represents over 12% of our total NOI, continues to show no signs of slowing down, as seen by revenue growth of 9.2% in the quarter. Our Santa Clara properties continued to be the strongest with revenue growth of 12%, while our San Jose properties which are competing with new supply pressure, posted revenue growth of 6.2%. Our downtown San Francisco properties have strengthened to revenue growth of 7.9%.","Seattle which represents almost 7% of our total NOI, posted 8.3% revenue growth in the quarter. Our portfolio continued to benefit from the strong growth inherent in our suburban B assets, primarily those located in Renton and North Seattle which are submarkets that are less exposed to new supply. We currently see full-year Seattle revenue growth coming in around 7.5% to 8%. Boston which represents over 6% of our total NOI, posted 5.7% revenue growth in the third quarter, despite new supply pressure downtown.","Our best performance is in our suburban product, but our Back Bay property had strong revenue growth also, at 5.3%. I'll now turn to our in lease-up developments which you can find on attachments 9-A and -B or pages 21 and 22 of our supplement. Our pro-rata share of these properties represent over $400 million spent. 100 Pier 4, our 369-home, $218 million development project in Boston Seaport district was 92% leased and 90% occupied at quarter-end and today, is 95% leased and 93% occupied. With first move-ins in mid-March, we stabilized in seven months and asking rents today of $4.78 per square foot are ahead of our original underwriting of $4.30 a foot.","Steele Creek, our 218-home participating loan investment in the Cherry Creek submarket of Denver is currently 86% leased and 75% physically occupied. The property is achieving rents in the $3.30 per square foot range versus initial underwriting of $3.10 per square foot. We have two West Coast development JV properties that began leasing during the third quarter. Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million development project located in Orange County, is currently 12% leased, with move-ins scheduled to start in December and CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million development project in Seattle, is currently 6% leased and we expect first move-ins there in November, as well.","We expect October new lease rate growth to come in between 5.25%, 5.5% and renewals to come in a bit over 7%. Same-store occupancy today is 96.5%. We see continued pricing power and stable occupancies in almost all of our markets. In fact, no market has physical occupancy today less than 95%. These factors leave us confident for the remainder of 2015.","Given the impressive strength we have seen year-to-date, we will have approximately 2.75% of 2016 revenue growth [indiscernible] by year-end. In addition, we're working on a number of initiatives that are both good for residents and for UDR, including parking solutions and solar solutions. The impact of strong rate increases for the second half of 2015 will be the catalyst for what we believe will be another strong year in 2016. With that, I'll open up the call to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Appreciate the commentary on 2016 same-store revenue growth being at least as good as 2015. What job growth and supply assumptions are baked into that outlook?","Jerry Davis","Nick, this is Jerry. It's basically similar job growth to this year. Call it 200,000 to 250,000 jobs per month. Nationally, when we look at how that affects our core markets, it would be down just modestly from about 870,000 jobs to 856,000 jobs in our markets. When you look at supply, it's looking for deliveries in 2016, 320,00, 325,000 jobs next year. But once again, when you look at our core markets, it's coming down about 20,000 -- I'm sorry -- not jobs, deliveries. It's coming down about 20,000 from what we experienced in 2015.","Nick Joseph","And then in terms of operational efficiencies, you guys have talked about a lot in the past. I wanted to get your take on the impact of package deliveries on the business and how you're dealing with it at your garden-style communities?","Jerry Davis","Sure. We've been looking at package deliveries, honestly, for a couple of years and been trying to find a solution that the carriers will be accepting of, as well as what will be best for our residents. And we think we found a few package locker systems that seem to work for us. To date, we've tested between eight and 10. Just about a month ago we ordered an additional 20 package locker systems.","When we look at it and there have been studies done on this, a person can handle about 15 packages per hour, so the way we've looked at it, our average resident probably gets between four and six packages a month. You're going to save, 300 to, call it, 500 hours on average at a property per year in efficiency. We think our people are going to be able to take that time and either do a better job performing services or they will be able to tend to prospective residents better because the time that current residents were coming in to get their packages which are after work and weekends, is the same time our leasing office is most busy with prospective residents. The other thing we see is a huge benefit, especially in our garden communities that we don't have a front door, is our residents are going to have 24\/7 access.","Nick Joseph","Then finally, can you give us an update on the potential sixth acquisition as part of the Wolff deal?","Warren Troupe","This is Warren. The sixth asset was held in a partnership with a third party and the structure has turned out to be too complicated so we've decided not to pursue it any further.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just had a question on thinking about portfolio allocation going forward. You guys have a sizable chunk of the development pipeline in Southern California. As you start to think about the Wolff JV assets stabilizing late next year and into 2017, how are you thinking about your exposure to that market?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. Our portfolio allocation in terms of development, our general plan is to have a diversified portfolio. So we have an asset in Boston that we're just stabilizing. We expect to start our 345 Harrison land site that we acquired last year for $32 million and that will be nearly 600 units and upwards of $300 million-plus.","We have an asset in DC that we're just completing and so we generally would expect to start another project in DC sometime in the relatively near future. In terms of California, we're relatively heavily weighted in California from a development perspective. We're going to have several of these assets running through the completion and lease-up phase in 2016 and into 2017 and so naturally our development exposure to Southern California will lighten up and then we'll look to backfill in the ordinary course.","Tom Toomey","Jordan, Austin, this is Toomey. What I would add to it is my recollection is SoCal was one of the last areas to enter the recession and one of the last to come out. And so if you look at the recent job growth and supply dynamics, we think it's got a long runway to deliver and we're excited about the Wolff transaction, in particular, because we accelerated a lot of communities and development into lease-up to take advantage of what we think is a very strong market in 2016 and 2017. So we're well-positioned in that marketplace.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then just turning to DC, DC decelerated a little bit this quarter. I was just curious if there's anything submarket-specific and then what your outlook is for that market going forward?","Jerry Davis","This is Jerry. You're right. DC did decelerate slightly to 1.6% growth. Overall, though, we feel DC is stable and this year it will come in about a 1.5% to 2% revenue growth. As I look in the current -- as of today, my market rents are up 2.7% from where they were last October, so that's encouraging for growth in the future.","A couple other things that I would think are worth noting. A few years ago, we talked about the differential between A and B product. In DC and probably two years ago, that difference was 600 to 700 basis points, where Bs were probably producing 3%, 3.5% revenue growth and As were negative 3.5%. Today, that has compressed down to about 50 basis points. So As are just 50 basis points behind B.","A lot of our inside the Beltway is doing as well as outside the Beltway. Areas of new supply that have affected us, particularly at our Arlington properties are the new supplies happening in Crystal City, Rosslyn-Ballston and Potomac Yard. When I look at the 14th Street Corridor and we've got four assets in that Thomas Circle, Logan Circle area, we're seeing revenue growth that's approaching 3% there, so that is strengthening. But overall, DC feels pretty stable.","The last thing I would add that probably had a modest effect on our deceleration this year is our DC team was spending quite a bit of time over the summer preparing to ensure a smooth transition of the six Home properties. That transition has paid off, as we took over those assets about three weeks ago and things are going well. And then as we look into 2015, again, our expectation is revenue growth at UDR for the DC portfolio will be just under 2% and as we look further out to 2016, it's going to go up modestly, call it mid-2%s.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Ian Weissman","Just two questions, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more granularity on resurgence in Southern California, specifically Los Angeles which beat our forecast by at least 150 basis points and you were up 260 basis points sequentially. Can you talk about some of the drivers in LA today and how sustainable that growth rate is?","Jerry Davis","Sure, Ian. This is Jerry again. First thing, I would start off is remind you our LA portfolio is almost entirely concentrated in Marina Del Rey. We only have four assets in our same-store pool. One is in La Mirada, but the other three are in Marina Del Rey. What's really driving it is two things.","About two years ago, up through about a year ago, you had a surge of new supply that was hitting Playa Vista and that was putting supply pressure on our Marina product. And that was being built really in anticipation of all the tech jobs that were coming to Silicon Beach, the area between Santa Monica and Playa Vista. Those jobs are now coming in and it's companies like Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Snapchat, YouTube, Twitter, Uber.","So as these jobs come in, it's really driving demand extraordinarily in that Los Angeles submarket of Marina Del Rey and that's what's really propelling our growth. You look back to first quarter of this year, our growth was only 3.8%. In second quarter, it got up to 6%. In this quarter, it was well over 8%. Our expectation is it's going to go a bit higher than even what we did in third quarter, in fourth quarter. LA, honestly, for our same-store portfolio is one of the markets I'm most excited about for 2016 and it's being driven by that job creation in Playa Vista, Venice and that submarket.","As you get more into Downtown LA, we have the one asset that we owned with MetLife. That area is feeling quite a bit of new supply and the growth there is not nearly at the level that our portfolio is. So I wouldn't read into LA in general, based on what our results are, because ours are focused on that one submarket.","Ian Weissman","And finally, just thinking about the Equity Residential deal who sold assets in South Florida, Denver, DC, Seattle and Inland Empire, you guys are the only other apartment REIT to hold assets in each of those markets. The market liked the deal. The stock was up on the news.","It wasn't about G&A savings or even higher growth. It was all about the bid for B-quality assets in B markets. How should we think about your plans moving forward, just given what the capital that sits on the sideline and how aggressive it's getting in these markets? And what are your thoughts about accelerating sales in some of these non-core markets?","Tom Toomey","I would make four or five points on the subject. Just as a reminder, in 2008, we did sell one-third of the company as part of a larger portfolio repositioning because primarily we thought at the time assets were trading well above their replacement cost and as part of that transaction, we declared a special dividend. So we're not afraid of that type of transaction and have executed on it in the past, but today, we don't see that type of repositioning necessary.","We've still got very good strong growth from our assets in those marketplaces. Second, I would add that we have a prudent capital allocation process in place. By using asset sales to fund development, we're largely removing any dependency on capital markets for our future growth. And as a reminder, our strategic plan which we continue to outline and update, is focusing on consistent cash flow growth. After you look at these transactions and realize the amount of dilution and how much growth you would have to compensate for in the future, they don't seem to be as penciling out at this time.","But we'll continue to monitor the market and see what happens with respect to asset pricing and we're aware of a good action on Bs right now. You can see this last year we sold $800 million, our share, $480 million of them. Then we used those proceeds very accretively to fund our development pipeline. So we've got a good plan, we've outlined it and we'll do it again and we'll see how the market unfolds.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste","So Mr. Toomey or maybe Jerry, I would like to get some more color on a comment, I think it was you, Tom, who made it earlier on the call, that your revenue growth for next year can be on par with this year's but from a different angle. I look across the various key regions in your portfolio and expect another solid year, next year for sure, but expect to see some slight deceleration on the revenue side in New York City, Boston.","There has been a bit of concern around San Francisco, not only with the recent Wall Street Journal article about the tech ideal slowdown, but also a little supply-related concerns in Bellevue, up in Seattle. Are you effectively counting on Southern California, Denver and perhaps DC to accelerate a bit from here, a bit more from here, make up for those decelerating trends in the other markets here?","Jerry Davis","First I would say, in Denver, we don't have any same-store properties, so we're not counting on anything from there. When we look at the entire portfolio, we see a few things happening. Probably there are two or three markets that we're penciling in that will most likely decelerate next year.","First is NorCal, that's probably based more on our aversion to [indiscernible] than anything else. If I had to guess on any one market that I would presume would beat -- could beat my plan next year, it would probably be NorCal, because I don't see the fundamentals really coming down. You just don't think it can continue to pop at 10% growth.","And I'll give you an example. Last year we thought the same thing. In the month of October, my in-place rents are 4% higher than I budgeted a year ago, so I thought it was going to happen last year. It didn't. It surprised. But we're counting on it to come down a bit, but it would still be our best market next year. The other markets that I see probably decelerating some next year are the two Texas markets, Dallas and Austin and that's really just supply-driven. We're starting to feel it already in Austin, especially our A product is starting to feel it more than it has because job growth was keeping up. Right now, job growth is still good, but the supply is hitting us.","Dallas, pressures in uptown, as well as up in Plano-Frisco, are hitting us in some of our assets. Our B product, especially in the Addison area, are doing phenomenally well, very high single digits. But when you get down to Uptown, currently we're seeing about 3% growth. Don't see that improving a lot next year because of new supply.","SoCal, as I stated earlier, very bullish on LA, at least our portfolio there. Orange County's going to hang in there and probably be slightly above average and do at least as well as it did this year. When I look at Seattle, you brought up Bellevue. There is new apartment supply coming there.","There have been some jobs that have, like Expedia, that have gone over to the west side in Seattle, but an article came out yesterday about Salesforce just rented 75,000 square foot of office space that they will put 500 people in. That office location is directly across from our Met JV and it's about two blocks from our Elements communities.","So we're feeling a little better today than we probably were a week ago about Bellevue. But the B product in Seattle is going to hold up very well. We're probably about 30% to 40% of the properties we have in Seattle are B. So we're optimistic about that. Boston, you brought that one up. Honestly, we've been pleasantly surprised this year. As I look at which one of our markets today is doing, again, better than I would have expected, Boston's picking up steam. We usually see a turndown. We moved some lease expirations from fourth quarter into third quarter, but it's allowed us to maintain occupancy where today it's 97%.","My year-over-year market rent growth in my four same-store Boston properties is up 8.4% October versus October. And today, I've got a loss-to-lease of 3.1% in Boston. That compares to 0.3% last year. So Boston honestly doesn't feel that bad to me. So I look at those and the other two that honestly are probably going to do as well, if not a bit better next year, are the two Florida markets.","Orlando has been surging and Tampa is not far behind it. The Mid-Atlantic, it's still going to be tough. It will be our worst performers, as I said earlier. DC is going to perk up a hair to mid-2%s. Baltimore, Richmond, we're not quite as optimistic there. It will stay below average. But overall, again, the Texases and NorCal would be the ones that I see coming down a bit, SoCal is going up, Florida's probably going up and the rest of them are about the same.","Tom Toomey","Haendel, this is Toomey. I would add this. My quote is revenue for 2016 is at least as good as 2015. And what I would point to, is Jerry and team have been really focused a lot about middle of this year on 2016, by pushing the rents which give us that carry-through. He mentioned in his prepared remarks, 2.75% of revenue is already in the books for next year. We think that trend could continue, but we'll play it out. They have just done an exceptional job of positioning us for 2016, a good number.","Haendel St. Juste","And just so I'm clear, Jerry, what, if anything, enters the same-store pool next year?","Jerry Davis","Actually, in our supplement, on page 11, at the beginning of the year, it will be full-year, Los Alisos which is Mission Viejo, enters in first quarter; Waterscape; and then also View 34, the old Rivergate property in Manhattan.","Haendel St. Juste","And then one more, if I may, a line of questioning I've preceded in the past. Just curious, your exposure to DC and Seattle, we've seen your [indiscernible] in lighten up in suburban locations in both markets. I'm curious about your current portfolios in both markets. Are you looking to lighten up a bit here, especially following the closing of the Home and Wolff deals?","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey. With respect to DC, we fully expect DC to be slightly better in 2016, but really, the rebound in DC's going to come in 2017 and 2018. And that's what our positioning is. So eventually, we're a little overweight in that marketplace, but we would like to catch the rent trajectory up when we look at pruning that particular area. The other market that was--?","Jerry Davis","Seattle.","Tom Toomey","Seattle? We're happy with Seattle. We've got a good mix of A, B marketplace. We're always looking at shifting some, but it will be so thin on the margin, it probably wouldn't matter in our view.","Jerry Davis","Haendel, we sold two assets in Seattle at the end of last year that were more in the Tacoma market. I agree with Tooney. We like the portfolio. We've got a decent mix of a couple of Bs to go with some urban As that are both in Bellevue and we're going to increase our exposure with the Wolff transaction down in South Lake Union. But Seattle is a market we're all pretty optimistic about, mid- and long-term.","Haendel St. Juste","I'm clear on Seattle, but just want to make sure I'm clear on DC. Sounds like you're happy with your portfolio, would consider selling, but just not a good enough time to sell yet, but something you would monitor over the next year, year to two years for potential culling, is that fair?","Tom Toomey","That's a fair statement.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","You talked about expense growth next year likely going over 3% and you guys have had lower expense growth than that in the last couple years. Could you just talk a little bit more about what's driving the expense growth higher?","Jerry Davis","Nick, this is Jerry. I'll start and Herzog may jump in. He mentioned the 421-a real estate program that has started to affect us this year and it will affect us a little more next year. So a big part of it's real estate taxes. So when you look at what are the two components that we currently forecast would be north of the 3% growth rate, one's going to be real estate taxes which today our expectation, including the 421-as, is going to be north of 7%.","When you factor in the impact in the Sunbelt markets, the positive real estate tax refunds that we got this year in the 421 programs at 95 Wall and 10 Hanover, that's about where it gets to. The other one that we anticipate putting some pressure on us is wage growth. In our markets, we've currently penciled in for it to be 4% in personnel growth.","Nick Yulico","And then what about repairs and maintenance? That's a line item you guys have done a really good job controlling expenses on. How much are you still able to keep that in check?","Jerry Davis","We think there's still initiatives that we've been working on for the last few years, that there's still a ways to go. This year, it will probably be very slightly positive. Next year, I still think it will be under an inflationary range and we're going to continue to find efficiencies with our maintenance teams to bring even more work in-house. So I don't think we're quite done with those initiatives yet.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Was wondering -- you guys haven't been so active on the redevelopment, much more in terms of just the development, but wondering from the communities acquired from Home, what the thought is, where some of those can add some redevelopment, but could have more and just where those assets? How do you think about it?","Jerry Davis","This is Jerry again. Harry may jump in after me if I leave anything out. When you look at that portfolio, there's three assets that are newly developed, less than four to five years old, the two in Silver Springs, one in Alexandria that really need next to no work done on them. Home did a good job redeveloping Arbor Park. That one needs very little.","The other two, Newport Village and The Courts at Dulles, are probably where we'll focus most of our efforts over the next year or two. They both would benefit from some level of kitchen and bath upgrade. There's a bit of deferred maintenance and there's some touch-up we can do on the amenities at both of those properties.","Dan Oppenheim","And then as it relates to the expectations in terms of the expense side or in actually it also relates to revenue, how are you thinking about turnover as it's been fairly low as of late? What's the expectation in terms of what we're likely to see in 2016 for that?","Jerry Davis","It's going to go up 100 to 200 basis points from where it is this year. Last year, it was 51%. This year, it will probably be a hair over that. Next year, I got to believe it's going to go up another 100, 150 basis points, as we start hitting some people with affordability issues and they are going to move out because of rent increase. We've seen that inch up a bit. I don't see move-outs related to home purchase rising. We've seen move-outs because of money problems or skips and evictions, actually come down. So really the only category we've seen in some markets is some people are getting priced out of the community they live in today and they are having to move down a step.","As we've seen this happen, we've been able to maintain occupancy levels in that 96.5%, so reload period is short. We've been able to take the number of days a units sits vacant down between 20 and 21 days from -- when we started looking at that three years ago, it was at 26 days. So turnover is going to again go up 100 to 200 basis points.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","On the 1031 exchanges, could you share the cap rate on the four Virginia assets, as well as the Huntington Beach sale?","Harry Alcock","Sure. This is Harry. The cap rates on the four Virginia beach sales are going to be somewhere in the high 6%s, around 7%. That includes a 2.75% management fee and $1,100 per unit in CapEx. The Huntington Beach deal will be just under 5% and the fixed asset will be in the high 5%s, the Oxnard asset.","John Pawlowski","That's on forward NOI, correct?","Harry Alcock","It is.","John Pawlowski","And then just so I understand the new footnote on the 421 exemptions, the $70,000 higher New York real estate taxes, so this is the first quarter that those abatements started burning off or was the amount de minimis before 3Q?","Tom Herzog","This was the first year, this first quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Quick question on the abatement as a follow-up, what is the total dollar amount of abatements flowing through the expenses right now for 2015?","Tom Herzog","We've given the amount of the AFFO impact which is the change. For 2015, it was $240,000 is the AFFO impact. So that's the amount of change year-over-year.","Wes Golladay","Do you guys have maybe a dollar amount? Since it is a line item that will abate, I just wonder if you had the actual dollar amount, but we could follow up offline if that's fine?","Tom Herzog","Okay. If you guys want to call on that to get details on that, I'm glad to give them to you.","Wes Golladay","Yes, we'll do that. Okay. And then looking at the Playa Vista market, it seems quite strong for you. Would you happen to have the loss-to-lease on that market and where renewals are going out right now?","Jerry Davis","The loss-to-lease on that right now is 5%. The year-over-year market rent growth in that LA portfolio and it includes one small asset in La Mirada, but this is predominantly the Marina Del Rey, but year-over-year revenue, rent growth is 9.2%. And the most current new and renewal growth in LA is news, we've achieved in October 8.8% and renewals are in October 7.2%.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill.","Ryan Peterson","So we've seen recently some of your peers market New York high-rises as condo conversions because of the superior pricing there. Is that something you guys would consider with any of your New York assets?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. Like all of us, we're constantly in the market having general conversations about market pricing. If an opportunity arose where we could predictably capture that spread between a condo user in changing the use at an extraordinary low cap rate and reinvest those proceeds in a core market on an accretive basis, we would certainly consider that. Right now, we haven't seen any of those opportunities materialize.","Ryan Peterson","Okay. So, really only if you had a reinvestment opportunity?","Harry Alcock","In all likelihood, yes.","Ryan Peterson","Okay and then only other question for me is do you see any more opportunities for deals similar to your Steele Creek deal?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry again. Steele Creek and Wolff are two relatively similar transactions that we've completed over the past 12 months. We're in the market looking at those types of opportunities. We don't have anything specific to talk about, but if those same types of opportunities materialized, we certainly would be interested in doing another one.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Aaron Hecht with JMP Securities.","Aaron Hecht","It looks like household formations were released this quarter and renter households declined for the first time sequentially in eight quarters. How are you guys thinking about that because it doesn't look like there's any lack of demand in your core markets?","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey. I take all of these government statistics that come out and wait and see if there's a trend line to develop, if there's not a one-month blip. So you just have to step back and wait and see how that trend and that number gets revised. We took note of it, that we're not feeling it in the marketplace by any measure, don't see it as a trend line, but we'll be cognizant of it and keep it in our view going forward.","Aaron Hecht","Okay and then on your 399 Fremont development, can you give any color on just the Rincon Hill area, because it looks like there's a lot of high-end product that may come online pretty soon there?","Harry Alcock","I'll start and Jerry may add if I miss something, but in Rincon Hill, there's over 4 million square feet of office that's either active or under construction. There are some multi-family projects high end that are coming online, some of which are in lease-up now and others that will be in line over the course of the next 12 months. It's our expectation that, that is an extremely strong submarket within San Francisco for rental product, given the enormous amount of job growth in high-paying jobs, so at this point, we're not concerned about that submarket.","Jerry Davis","I would agree with Harry. As we've looked at that market and the product we're going to deliver, we think we compete well. Probably the most encouraging thing, you talked about the supply, but the jobs that are coming, that are within a 5 to 10 minute walk over the next several years, are going to provide plenty of residents for all of us to do well.","Aaron Hecht","Okay. And then on the 717 Olympic property, was that water issue just a freak accident or was there some property management that should have occurred to avoid that issue?","Jerry Davis","It was a freak accident. There was an automobile accident, if you will, in the garage structure that set off the sprinkler system that affected the pressure on the sand pipe. It wasn't maintenance. It was created due to an accident.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Tom Toomey, if you had 20\/20 foresight that San Francisco Bay area was about to really fall off the cliff and I know you don't have that, but let's just pretend you do because you have really super powers otherwise, what would you do? Would you sell immediately right now? Or would you muscle your way through it because you consider it a long-term hold regardless of what might happen over the course of a couple of years?","Tom Toomey","Rich, it's always a tough question when you look at falling off the cliff in San Francisco, is that the earthquake comes and gets it or just the marketplace.","Rich Anderson","The marketplace.","Tom Toomey","The marketplace, I believe it's a center for technology innovation. It's a gateway to Asia. It's a long-term dynamic city that has long-term growth prospects. And I'm prepared to weather the storm that inevitably will happen, that will cause it to take a turn-down and anticipate that through its innovation, its capital formation that it's a long-term vibrant mark and it's sure in heck hard to get real estate there, that's our overall portfolio strategy.","We understand that markets will come and go, that situations like oil and gas that are going through right now are not long-term enduring situations. They are short-term blips. And we want to have a portfolio that's diversified to weather those storms and we've done it both in market diversification and product diversification and we'll continue that path and think it's the right one for long-term cash flow growth.","Rich Anderson","Maybe for someone else in the room, what happened leading up to the DC falling off? Did you sell at all? I don't remember. Or did you just defend?","Tom Toomey","The posture in DC was to defend. We did take some assets that we thought would have a harder time in recovery and pulled those up and moved on. And again, as you outlined earlier in the call, we think we're a little overweight, DC, but we think the inevitable recovery that arrives probably in 2017, 2018 window will represent a good time to pull some capital out of that marketplace and there will be other opportunities and other markets for us to redeploy those or we'll just pull them up and use them for our development pipeline.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Tom Toomey, CEO, for any additional or closing remarks.","Tom Toomey","Well, thank you all for your interest in UDR and for your time on the call today. Just let me close by saying it was a fantastic quarter, that we're doing a very good job of executing on our strategic out plan. We've exceeded all of those metrics. We're certainly positioning ourselves for a strong 2016 and beyond. You'll see more of that plan come February and we'll be seeing most of you, I believe, at NAREIT in a couple of weeks and look forward to some more Q&A there. With that, take care.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to UDR's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only-mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator instructions)","This conference is being recorded today, Monday, October 29, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Chris Van Ens","Thank you for joining us for UDR's third quarter financial results conference call. Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake the duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","My comments today will focus on four topics; first, broad operating trends and quarterly results; second, an update on our external growth activities; third, an update on our CFO search; and finally, the expansion of our UDR MetLife II joint venture announced this morning. Following my comments Jerry will provide additional commentary on operating results and emerging operating trends.","During the third quarter our business continued to operate at an elevated level, driven by strong organic rent growth as well as slightly higher occupancy rates. With the fourth quarter upon us we have entered the seasonally slow time of year for the apartment demand. Nonetheless good multi-family fundamentals continued to generate tailwind for the industry and we expect will do so for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for UDR, which owns a portfolio increasingly concentrated in markets that exhibit above average job growth, low single family home affordability, a high propensity to rent and in general limited new multifamily supply pressures.","In the third quarter of 2012, core FFO per share of $0.33 increased by 3% year-over-year. Strong same-store revenue and net operating income growth of 5.5% and 6.4% respectively, as well as good execution in our non-same-store portfolio, drove the improvement.","Second an update on external growth activities. Green lighting opportunities that increase the company's net asset value per share remain a top priority, although we are cognizant of balancing this necessity against AFFO per share growth and our intent to operate the company at a lower leverage profile. The following is what we currently see in the marketplace.","First, acquisitions; we continue to look for opportunities to expand in our core markets, but pricing for the most well located assets is full right now. We will consider buying again when we find the right property in the right location at the right price and can fund the acquisition with appropriately priced capital in the context of our lower leverage profile.","Second, development; the weighted average spread between expected stabilized yields and spot cap rates; our in progress pipeline is roughly 150 to 200 basis points. Historically, the spread has been closer to 100 to 150 basis points. As such development remains as a source of significant value creation.","To be clear, we expect our developments to generate stabilized yields that are averaging 6% to 6.5%. These are not represented with the yields we expect upon delivery and lease up. With 51% of our $792 million development pipeline already funded, approximately 75% will be delivered by year-end 2013. We are actively evaluating new opportunities as well as those within our wholly owned and JV land bank.","We finally redevelopment, our pipeline encompasses five projects with a total anticipated spend of $279 million, 34% of which is expected to be completed by year end 2013 and 23% of which has already been funded. Redevelopment continues to offer superior risk reward paid off versus other external growth opportunity. But our opportunity set is limited as viable candidates are inherently tied to the size and scope of our existing portfolio.","We have identified several redevelopment candidates in our core markets that we believe can achieve our targeted 7% to 10% return on incremental capital invested. We will update you should these move beyond the drawing board. We continue to target annual development - redevelopment deliveries that total roughly 5% of the enterprise or $400 million to $600 million. Although our ability to make good on this goal can fluctuate from year-over-year depending on the cost and availability of capital.","Next, we are making progress in our search for a new CFO, a shortlist of candidates has been formed, which we are [waiting], as I indicated in last quarter we understand the importance of filling this key position, but UDR possesses the necessary skill set to wait for the right hire.","Finally, this morning we announced that the company its ownership interest in four operating communities and two land parcels in our UDR\/MetLife I joint venture in addition to $10 million in cash, for an increased ownership interest in The Olivian, an A-plus high-rise building located in downtown Seattle. UDR now owns 50% of The Olivian and the community has been contributed to the UDR\/MetLife II joint venture.","Importantly, this swap of ownership interest increased our presence in core market Seattle where long-term multi-family fundamentals appear advantageous, conversely it reduced our exposure in non-core markets such Tampa, Charlotte, Houston and Chicago. Additional details can be found in our third quarter press release.","With that I will pass the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the third quarter same-store net operating income grew 6.4%, driven by 5.5% year-over-year increase in revenue, same-store expenses increased by 3.6% year-over-year primarily driven by higher real-estate taxes, same-store income per occupied home increased by 5.3% year-over-year to $1402 or same-store occupancy increased by 10 basis points to 95.8%.","Sequentially, third quarter NOI increased 0.9%, driven by 1.8% increase in revenue against expense growth of 3.6%. Generally, our third quarter results followed the normal seasonal curve, we have become accustomed to over the years. We have reiterated throughout the year 2012 continues to unfold in line with our expectation. In the third quarter effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities increased by 4.3% on average.","Renewal rate growth remains comparable versus previous quarters averaging 6.5%. Accounting for approximately 25% of same-store NOI, New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Boston were our best performing markets during the quarter. These markets delivered weighted average revenue growth of 8.9% year-over-year. Non-core markets such as Sacramento, the Monterey Peninsula, other mid-Atlantic and Norfolk struggled and generated less than 8% of our same-store NOI in the third quarter.","Resident turnover moved up slightly to an annualized rate of 66% in the third quarter, 170 basis points higher than last year at this time. Importantly, turnover growth decelerated as the quarter progressed and it appears that this trend has continued into the fourth quarter. Additionally, the pace at which we have been able to refill move outs with high quality new tenants has now slowed.","Turning to the performance of our non-same-store wholly-owned communities 2236 homes or approximately 42% of our non-mature pool were stabilized in both the second and third quarters of 2012. These eight communities generated sequential revenue growth of 1.9% during the third quarter, slightly above our same-store sequential growth of 1.8%. The spread narrowed versus what we reported on the second quarter call as a result of high growth communities transitioning into our same-store portfolio this quarter.","Our non-same-store communities now contribute 17% of NOI, down from approximately 24% last quarter. By year-end we expect this to decline to roughly 15% of NOI.","Same-store [reported] 1,913 homes entered our quarterly same-store portfolio, including our initial New York acquisition 10 Hanover Square, as well as other high growth communities in San Francisco and Boston. Another 437 non-mature homes will enter our quarterly same-store portfolio in the fourth quarter. By year end 2012 these additions should increase our same-store income per occupied home to roughly $1,430 all else equal. Additional details can be found on our attachment 7B and 7C of our quarterly supplement.","Moving on I'd like to address some of the bigger picture questions we fielded during the September conference season regarding multi-family fundamentals. First new multi-family supply, nationally new multi-family supply still appears to be contained versus historical norms despite the most recent permitting data from the census bureau.","We gauge the potential impacts of new multi-family supply by how much product was expected to come online in our markets and more precisely our submarkets. If we include every submarket in our core capital warehouse markets where we have at least one community we find that our portfolio will compete with approximately 40% of the total new multifamily supply that is expected to be delivered into these markets over the next two years.","However, as we have different levels of exposure to each sub market, a more meaningful measure of the potential impact of new supply in our portfolio is to weight those submarkets we operate in by our respective unit counts in them. This analysis indicates that our portfolio will effectively compete with only 22% of the total new multi-family supply that is expected to be delivered into our core and capital warehouse markets over the next two years. This number is far less concerning than headline expectations would suggest.","Second, potential effect that a recovering single-family housing market may have on our business. Many believe that a continued recovery in the single-family housing market will translate into a difficult market for apartment. Two thoughts on them, first, increased housing demand will likely be driven by stronger economy, which suggests better employment growth, both of which are key drivers for continued growth in multi-family demand.","Second, while move outs for home purchase will likely increase in conjunction with the single-family recovery, return to the [expresses] of the mid-2000 appears remote. In addition UDR should be better protected against move outs to single-family home purchase and historically was the case as over the past 5 to 10 years the company has transitioned its portfolio into urban locations in coastal markets with low home affordability and a higher propensity to rent.","Turning to most - more recent trends, renewal increases spent out through December have averaged 5.7% and we expect to capture most of this increase as is generally the case. With occupancy holding near 96% we're expecting strong fourth quarter results.","Finally, I'd like to discuss the change we implemented and how we account from bad debt expense that aligned us more closely with our multi-family peers. Majority of our former residents that had an outstanding balance and less than $1,000 at move outs paid us with a 90 days after vacating. Under our previous policy, cash accounting demanded that we write these balances off immediately upon move out. To better reflect the economics of our collections we have switched to an accrual based method of accounting for bad debt, which resulted in a benefit of $1.9 million and NOI during the quarter. This NOI is not included in our same store results but is included in the development communities and other line item on Attachment 6 in our supplement.","Moving forward, we anticipate that an improved collections process will generate an additional $250,000 to $500,000 of NOI per year which will help our same store results.","With that I'd like to thank all of our dedicated associates in the field and at our corporate and regional offices for another good quarter. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup","Thanks, first question is just on the Olivian transaction, could you just walk us through how you thought about the valuation in terms of cap rate in growth prospects for Olivian, Seattle versus the other four assets in the non-core markets. Just trying to get a sense for what do you think the appropriate cap rate [expected] between those for core and or course non-core market?","Tom Toomey","Hey, Eric, good morning, this is Tom. With respect to the cap rate, we look at the transaction is more of a swap of interest. And the cap rate conversation is not as germane to it is as you would normally think is an acquisition because we're selling interest at the same time. And so I tend do not think if it is a cap rate as much as just the swap of interest and cash flow in market position, which [advances] our interest in owning more of Seattle if you will over the long term and little less of Charlotte, Tampa and Houston land et cetera.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup","Sure, I guess, just to put another way I guess do you say that you're willing to accept the - a little returning in Seattle because it's a core market and you elect that positioning versus those other markets or on a net neutral basis you're trying to swap out equal return assets in your non-core markets, the same return in your core markets.","Tom Toomey","Yeah, I think more of the latter Eric, our personal viewpoint over the long term would be that Seattle urban product at the high rise is probably a better long term assets than you would a Tampa or Charlotte suburban product and certainly and that's our view over the long term, so a more of the latter in your argument.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup","Okay, and then just question, it sounded like some of your remarks that you really haven't seen much rise in cap rates yet but in obviously as [rents] flow slows you'd expect that if you summarized and why don't you think you've seen it yet or is that more of like a 2013 event?","Tom Toomey","I'll let Harry, who's joining us from Boston today on the call to give you an update on cap rate.","Harry Alcock","Eric, this is Harry, you're right, cap rates have not moved buyers, it mean first of all our business fundamentally continues to be good. So buyers are still I think continue the NOI growth. Secondly, you still have a little bit of a balance between buyers and sellers and still a lot of capital space in these fields and third interest rates continue to be low and even lower. And there's no reason to expect a significant change in the future and obviously as you continue to look forward and you have more of this heavier NOI growth behind us and if there is a change in interest rate to put that time to see a change in cap rates, inevitably that's going to happen but we don't see it happening anytime in the - at least in the next few quarters.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jana Galan - Bank of America","Thank you, good morning. Jerry, can you provide the new lease semiannually increases for October?","Jerry Davis","Absolutely, so far in October new leases are up 2.6% and renewals are up 5.7%.","Jana Galan - Bank of America","Thank you. And then I guess even your renewal outlook through December for 5.7% increases. Do you have a sense of where you're starting 2013 from given the work that you've done in 2012 in terms of revenue growth?","Jerry Davis","You know, we're really not prepared at this point time to give guidance towards revenue growth in 2013.","Jana Galan - Bank of America","Okay. And then maybe just on - the expenses ticked up a bit in your western region, particularly in California which I don't think would be as impacted by real estate taxes, I was wondering if you could give a little bit color around expenses there?","Jerry Davis","Absolutely, yeah, what happened in California in great part last year's we've benefitted from profit adjustment down, where valuations were allowed to go down to - from where we had originally purchased the properties to where the actual values were. Now what happened as valuations have continued to go up over the last 12 to 15 months, you're not - you really don't have a [proper] 13 ceiling of the 2% on the real estate taxes, so what you're really seeing is benefits that we were able to achieve last year in third quarter and you can't replicate that.","Jana Galan - Bank of America","Thank you very much.","Tom Toomey","Jana, this is Tom Toomey, I have couple things to add Jerry's comment on October clearly performing right now inline with our expectations and that's a credit to really Jerry and his team and they've got a very strong occupancy as of this morning where at 96% and I think they'll be able to hold a pretty high occupancy coming into the first part of January of 2013 which should aid us on a number of fronts including pricing power.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dave Bragg - Zelman & Associates","Thank you, good morning. Jerry, can you talk about the performance of Orange County during the course of the quarter?","Jerry Davis","Absolutely, yeah, Orange County actually decelerated as far as year-over-year growth and through the first six months of the year, we were up about a 7% close to 7%. And in the third quarter I think we decelerated down to growth and revenue 4.9, anything can happen there Dave is we probably got too aggressive, when we did get too aggressive on renewal increases that we sent out beginning back in May. And it turned out that more of our residents were unwilling to accept that rate, resulted in turnover spiking up in Orange County was 11% higher than it was last year and it kept a lid on occupancy growth. So we ran it with a little lower occupancy at 94.8% than I would have liked and that brought it down [resets] going back adjusted some of our renewal increases got an occupancy backup into the mid 95 in Orange County, and we feel like we're back on pace.","Dave Bragg - Zelman & Associates","So, it seems like you must have add to have lowered your renewal increases in that market in the quarter pretty substantially or was it more so on new move-ins, just trying to think about the 0.2% sequential rent rate growth in that market for the quarter, I can see the occupancy change but on rent gains there was a pretty big drop off.","Jerry Davis","Yeah, a lot of it was in new lease rates, we were running throughout the second quarter at in the high fours to low fives even in July on new leases we were getting about six and then we've had to drop it down to the mid threes, then spent just to gain the occupancies and when I look at the renewals that we were spending now in our - or achieving in Orange County, throughout the quarter the two months we were getting about 6.5% and then we took it down in September to 4.9% and then October so far to 5%.","Dave Bragg - Zelman & Associates","And just a last question on Southern California as a whole, Jerry your peers have sounded a bit more optimistic on this region. The job growth has certainly picked up there and what's your view on your Southern California portfolio going forward relative to the rest of the portfolio?","Jerry Davis","I think it's locale for us we'll probably be on above average -- perform about in 4Q as well as when we got into next year. You know I think the job growth as well as the recovery of rents that are really lagging the rest of the country are going to help. There's limited new supply that's come in directly at us in any given market in Southern California. ","Like you said Orange County this past year in last 12 month had about 30,000 jobs added, which is very close to its long-term average. We think that could decelerate slightly next year but not much. LA, LA is picking up pretty well and even though got a little bit of supply coming at us in Marina del Rey and a little bit downturn we think demand is more than sufficient.","Now, one other thing I'll tell you, we're working on we've got rehabs that's going on in Southern California, both at in Orange County at Villa Venetia and Pine Brook where we've done a good job of pushing rates there. We're getting about $520 rehab premium on the 56 units we've turned down there. So there is definitely demand for a higher grade property there. At The Westerly which is formerly Marina Pointe up in Marina del Rey is completed about 315 of the unit interiors as well as the bulk of the amenities and units or building exteriors. We've able to get about $450 premium on those.","Dave Bragg - Zelman & Associates","That's helpful. Thank you.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Andrew Rosivach - Goldman Sachs","Good morning, guys. I'm just curious, Tom, you went through the discussion of development pipeline and the spread the spot cap rates when I look at your NAV or your applied cap rate, the spreads and it's good. And If I fund in my model year development pipeline with equity, it doesn't spruce the accretion and I guess I'm wondering on the back of that and as you thought about other ways of funding your development pipeline especially potentially asset [base].","Tom Toomey","Yeah. Andrew, certainly we've looked at it carefully and both in terms of sizing the development activities and redevelopment activities in and our conclusion is this is that during 2013 we have approximately $700 million in some phase of lease-up and clearly that won't deliver much NOI for '13 but will rebound substantially in '14 as those assets are leased up so.","I think what you're going to say as, pose a little tick up in our overall leverage in the first couple quarters of 2013 and then I think it comes substantially down as the NOI gets delivered on those assets. So we see it as both good long-term investments in the development activities and clearly for delivering that fixed or better compared just spot cap rates for lot of these assets be low 4s mid-4s that the NAV creation is there in a long-term and that in a short-term it may be dilutive to earnings and then that's part of a trade we're willing to make, but we do believe the long-term NAV accretion is there.","Andrew Rosivach - Goldman Sachs","And just to paraphrase it sounds like you may be comfortable funding with the remainder of your development pipeline with a combination of retained cash and debt and in the EBITDA would overtime such as that the EBITDA becomes more manageable.","Tom Toomey","Andrew, I think you have it correct there. Clearly we're not interested in issuing stock below NAV and we believe that's probably the right route for us just to grow into it. We'll continue to look at sales, and price it in the market and see what kicks up, but I think a lot of that is dependent on what happens, November fiscal policy all of those other factors and I'm not prepared to give you what the sales environment might be next year, but we feel comfortable absent sales being able to grow our enterprise and grow our NAV and what are the other sales part comes out.","Andrew Rosivach - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for that.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. Any changes to the guidance assumptions, I know you guys didn't provide an update there in the supplemental but just curious if what's your thinking in terms of same-store results there given the wide range?","Tom Toomey","Yeah, Mike this is Toomey and I'll let Jerry follow-up with it but our overall view is to update guidance at the midpoint of each year and on any material activity. And then our view from mid year is that we're still within the strike zone of all of the midpoint of our earlier guidance and feel good about those and until there is not much time, -- need for time to update those activities until pretty much in the strike zone, Jerry, on the same stores?","Jerry Davis","Yeah, Mike. And we read your note and pretty much agree with your math and the assumptions that you came up with, the thing to consider when you're looking at our fourth quarter especially on the revenue. Is it in 4Q11 we ran occupancy at our same store portfolio of 95.1%, because last year we had pushed the rents hard [fetching] turnover occurs and had difficulty reloading rates that we like. This year our expectation to run the fourth quarter in the high 95s like we have the last several quarters as though you're probably going to be looking at I would say 60 to 80 point increase year-over-year in occupancy that will help by get into that midpoint.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful then. Second, could you talk a little bit about LA in San Diego, and they give a lot of good color there, on Orange County, we did see a little bit deceleration there. And then I know you guys give turnover on a trailing 12 month basis, during the first half of the year was up and it seem like it dropped in the third quarter. Do you have what it was actually in the third quarter in terms of the decline?","Jerry Davis","Actually, in third quarter when I compare to the fourth quarter last year I'm not talking to trailing 12 which is an annualize quarter is that we typically give it. It was 170 basis point higher than it was in third quarter of last year at 66.4% then if you look at the nine month annualized, we're currently running about 270 basis points over the last year at 57.2 because 4Q is typically a very low turnover quarter because we have low number of lease exploration. I would think we're going to get down into that 54 or 55 range, which will be 200 to 300 basis point higher than it was to the full year of last year.","What we've really seen is probably from about March through July or August our turnover is running 300 to 400 basis points higher than it was last year. In the past few month, we've seen a normalize back down to the point it's virtually flat, with the based on the same properties we own last year so. We thank we've kind of gotten through that layer of residence that had moved in a few years ago. And we were at trough rates, and as we increased rents on them them 6% to 7% over the last couple years, they've gone back to the asset class they were used to living in. And we've reloaded with a higher caliber of residence that we're optimistic will be able to stay with us and we'll see flat turnover going forward.","Okay. I can tell you I had just couple of stats is typically asking our net income is still going to have 17% range in our average household income today is about $91,000 on our same store portfolio that's an indication I think. If the quality of the same store portfolio is much higher than it was in years past when that number was more in the 80 range. Then on LA and fairly year ago we have seen LA improved somewhat. In the last quarter again we did push rents there similar to what we did in the Orange County and you know we start turnover there actually go up about 10% also. So kind of the same issue that I said it Orange County we got little aggressive push too hard and it took us too late in the quarters to reestablished their occupancy.","Today LA is running about 95.5% is a cost and you know we are optimistic that we have the right things in place and the right strategy to push that forward.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","And finally did you mention what real estate taxes were during the quarter? I understand for the same store how much they were up?","Jerry Davis","I didn't, but I will. They were up 9%. Now we were hit by the prop 8 readjustment in California and then when you look in the some down market predominantly Texas as well as Florida evaluation this year turned and higher we had expected.","Operator","And your next question is from line of (inaudible). Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. On your same store performance in New York which is just essentially Hanover how did that 12% same store revenue growth at 10 Hanover compared to your initial expectation when you bought that asset.","","Tom Toomey","It's probably about in line. You know it may be don't want to hear better but you know we expected only to go and right after and give the increase from what private owner was charging we quite a bit of that as we have gone throughout the year and then there was some concessions that were recovering that have gone away. So there is a little bit I had but not markedly.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And on your development pipeline you guys added stabilization date, information, and it looks like most of the five quarters out usually when we look at year this quarter out, usually when we look at your disclosure for your peers it's two to three quarters up. It had just conservative them on your part that (inaudible) by the type product rebuilding but what's causing five quarters for stabilization.","Tom Toomey","This is Tom, Harry, do you want to take that.","Harry Alcock","Sure. The period that once the last unit is whoever don't take roughly five quarters for the property it become fully occupied and for all her most of the lease-up concession to fully perform, which is more reflective of the real stabilize run rate to the asset.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. There's still some occupancy stabilization on?","Harry Alcock","No.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then last question Tom, you can't talk about this in your prepared remarks. When you look at 2013 how would rank your external growth opportunity between acquisition and development and I guess further activity with the MetLife JV.","Tom Toomey","You know I think it's premature to rank on, but I will tell you I think the acquisition environment are shares or trading today would clearly be a very challenging to find anything that would be a creative. Yeah today's prices then containing ourselves within our leverage metrics and so you probably see us continue to look at a redevelopment platform followed by a development activities and (inaudible) come out. But I think it's going to be the tough acquisition environment for us and we were trained and confined where we want to keep leverage of the enterprise.","With that being said I think Jerry has got a very good year coming up in 13. We still see a good strong fundamentals and so the core of the business in operation looks like it's going to have good year mixture.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. I appreciate the color on the year-over-year occupancy compared you are expecting in the fourth quarter. Do you expect to get sequential revenue growth from the third quarter or the fourth quarter, I think you got a little bit last year, expecting that again.","Jerry Davis","Yeah, we will always expect to get sequential growth. I mean we're still raising rents, I think your occupancy level is probably be flattish for most of your growth, is really going to come more through the rent side.","Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets","Okay. Next question is, I think you said on the last call that you're expecting the non same-store pool to contribute 10 to 30 basis points the same store growth next year, is that still your expectation or is that increased a little bit given the strong performance in New York.","Jerry Davis","I don't think that's really changed, although I would tell you we're still under midst of doing our budget and so we don't have a firm number yet, but I don't think any of the assumptions I have back then have changed materially.","Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets","And the last question, am I reading your results correctly that there was a roughly $2.9 million, $3 million tax benefit from RE3 that was included in FFO?","Warren Troupe","Yeah, hi. This is Warren, yes it was. It's a recurring benefit but, as we said it's dependent on how many buildings are held in our TRS at any time.","Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets","And was that included in your previous guidance?","Warren Troupe","Yeah. So we expected the fourth quarter benefit will be somewhere what we've realized in the third quarter, but (Inaudible).","Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Tom Toomey","Karin, this is Toomey. Just to add, I think the business is operating just as we thought it would for the second half of the year and Jerry still has pricing power in a lot of his markets as evidenced by his ability to on renewals and new leases traffic always dries off this time of year. And we wouldn't expect that number to change. So I think we've still got good solid fundamentals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi, please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Yeah, good morning. Just sticking, just for a moment on guidance, so the 134 to 139 stands, Tom I think you were talking about everything being at the mid-point so with the buckle 1 done in the first 9 months that sort of leaves you 33% to 38% as implied fourth quarter guidance and I guess if you did 33% in the quarter which was up - propped up a little bit by this accounting change, so let's just call it 32%. How do you get from 32% up to a 33% to 38% range or 35% - 36% as the midpoint.","Tom Toomey","I'll start out with Jerry and finish on as little bit.","Jerry Davis","Well, I can tell you I think, we typically have good growth in the fourth quarter because expenses go down. So some of it will come from that. I think when you said the event in the fourth quarter are you talking about the change in the bad debt, the $1.9 million?","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Yeah, would that affected so is third quarter, so the third quarter you've produced $0.33 but reality it's more closer to $0.32 just given the $1.9 million within FFO, in positive impact that wasn't known before, I assume within your guidance because you never talked about it. So you need almost a $7 million increase in FFO, which is a pretty substantial number on a base of $85 million going into the fourth quarter to hit that midpoint and it just - I don't know where the pieces are to get $7 million of incremental FFO to get you to the midpoint and, I want to make sure that the expectations are correctly adjusted for what you're going to produce in the fourth quarter.","Tom Toomey","This is Tom. A couple of things, Michael, with respect to the third quarter you're also taking a charge for acquisition expense of about $1.1 million, so we probably won't be buying anything in the fourth quarter, that'll be part of it. And the second aspect on your guidance of the range of 33% to 38%, the consensus on the street is about 136, we see it pretty much that way ourselves and I think we'll really leave it at that.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Then just in terms of leverage you and we did the accretive offering, last quarter you talked a lot about bringing your leverage down to peers. We have seen a lot of peers in the apartment specifically continue to over leverage down pretty aggressive use of the ATMs as well as equity issuances. I guess what are your thoughts today. Is the rest of the industry now too low or do you need to move your leverage down further, because you know you spent a lot of time talking about getting from the right hand side of everybody's leverage chart to the middle and from this question I am just trying to figure out how you are thinking about it?","Tom Toomey","We see it in a number of different ways. First, it's not really for us to define where leverage should go. I think lower in the long-term directional is where we're headed and other companies use of ATM seems prudent if they think they are selling stock above NAV. Right now we would probably not be selling stock and we haven't since May added, because we don't believe we're trading anywhere near our NAV estimate. So I don't see the use of the ATM is a way to lower the leverage. The way I see it is unless the enterprise development redevelopment activities mature that will naturally deleverage us as well as operating cash flow growth. So I am not trying to chase the peers if you will. I think today we're right about a [6-9] on debt to EBITDA and all the other metrics look like we're at average or below average, and I think this tree will be prudent and our judgment of this as they see us consistently bring that number down over time. So leverage, that's kind of how we think about it at this present time.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","","Here you have made a comment about the leverage is going to move up in the interim, where did that [6-9] go in your model as you I guess fund the development the development has not yet stabilized. I think that's what you are particularly referring to?","Tom Toomey","Yes, we are and I think in the first two quarters the next year (inaudible) happen and then rapidly start coming down as the NOI from that development redevelopment activity comes online. As you know we're delivering $700 million, which is practically no earning for us in '13 and then '14 has a substantial uptick. So that's how we see it unfolding. In the interim we'll continue to monitor the share price in the sales market and see if we can affect the positive direction on leveraging that way, but we're comfortable with it drifting up slightly for a couple of quarters as people can clearly see the long-term path is towards lower leverage and we think that path is within our control.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Just [surfing] on the exchange this morning, what was the gross value, I know you paid them $10 million in cash to even it out, but what was the gross value including any share of debt between the two?","Tom Toomey","The gross asset value is a little over $400 million. These assets are probably at about 45%, 50% levered.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Then what left in terms of non-core either within the MetLife JV that you would think about selling down either back to your partner or out into the broad market and how much is left non-core on the Company's balance sheet?","Tom Toomey","In Met JV I non-core is probably less than $400 million in our estimation and non-core of the asset, you know we have kind of divided than into two bucket assets that we think we have exhausted the value creation and we think that there will be an opportunity to sell and that's primarily Sacramento and Norfolk. Those assets probably have a gross asset value of probably $250 million and then we have a much more larger pool if you will of what we call warehouse capital, where markets are recovering, we think there is still more value to be cleaned out of the asset through operations or just natural market recovery, and that's probably the Nashville and Florida portfolio, and then those assets are probably - Barry could probably give you a better asset number, probably $1 billion and realize it's in the context of multiple years on $12 billion enterprise. So I think we'll hang onto them for a while, we don't see any particular need to sell them in the short run. In fact it probably wouldn't be prudent to do so.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Toomey, for closing remarks.","Tom Toomey","Well thank you, all of you for your time today. I know that we're all watching the weather and certainly our (inaudible) go out to those who are going to be impacted by the storm. We stuck with having this call this morning in hope that; one, we would be able to focus our attention on the balance of the week to what damage may occur by the storm and positioning ours assets and our people to help our residents and associates get through this event. We think we're well prepared, anticipated it and again thank you for your time and know that we will see many of you in a couple weeks in San Diego.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn conference over to Chris Van Ens, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christopher G. Van Ens","Thank you for joining us for UDR's first quarter financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risk and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","[Operator Instructions] Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas W. Toomey","Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to UDR's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","Multifamily fundamentals remain strong. Job growth continues at a slow and steady pace, while new supply remains manageable in the majority of our markets. Third-party research providers estimate that 5 new jobs are required to generate demand in 1 apartment home. Using this relationship, 18 of our 20 markets are expected to have more than sufficient demand to fully absorb the new multifamily supply that is forecast to come online over the next 3 years.","Single-family housing is clearly recovering, but move-outs to home purchases remain contained at less than 12%, still well below the long-term average of 15%. From our investment perspective, the amount of capital looking to participate in the multifamily sector remains deep. This has kept cap rates stable, which in turn continues to propel above-average profit margins for development and redevelopment investments. Over the coming years, we expect the majority of these macro tailwinds to persist, especially for UDR, which owns a portfolio primarily concentrated in coastal gateway markets for multifamily renters who want to live and work where alternative housing options are relatively unaffordable and where long-term new supply pressures are below average.","In February, we presented a 3-year strategic plan for the company. The plan focuses on driving high-quality cash flow per share growth over the coming years. We believe that cash flow growth is the primary driver of NAV per share growth, dividend growth and ultimately, total shareholder return. The team is highly focused on executing our plan.","What does high-quality cash flow per share growth mean to UDR? First, growth that is driven by capitalizing on what we do best, operating our business to generate strong top line results but also controlling expenses in an efficient manner. Second, growth that is augmented by accretive investments. Currently, development and redevelopment are the most attractive of these pursuits. Our $1.2 billion pipeline, of which 43% is expected to be delivered in 2013, is nearly 52% funded and is comprised of projects in desirable locations that will help drive high-quality cash flow growth per share in the coming years. Lastly, growth that is achieved while realizing our long-term leverage objectives. As we addressed on our last call, we are comfortable with our current balance sheet but expect that organic NOI growth and the delivery of our development and redevelopment pipeline over the coming years will further deleverage the company. In addition, we will continue to look for other ways to improve our balance sheet metrics through non-dilutive activities over time.","I'd like to congratulate Jerry and his operating team for strong results they produced in the first quarter and for great execution during the initial quarter of our 3-year strategic plan. 2013 is continuing to look like it will be another strong operating year for us. We are excited to share our success with you as it unfolds.","With that, I will pass the call over to Tom Herzog.","Thomas M. Herzog","Thanks, Tom. There are several topics I will cover today: first, first quarter results; second, our balance sheet update; third, an update on insurance recoveries from Hurricane Sandy; fourth, a change to our income statement presentation; and lastly, our second quarter and full year 2013 guidance.","Let me begin with our first quarter results. FFO per share was $0.35. After deducting a $0.01 benefit from Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries, FFO as adjusted per share was $0.34. The $0.02 of upside versus the midpoint of our previous FFO as adjusted guidance was driven by a $0.01 from better-than-expected operations and another $0.01 from timing differences in G&A and other miscellaneous items. We expect these timing differences to reverse during the balance of the year. First quarter AFFO per share was $0.31 and benefited from $0.01 of lower CapEx spend than anticipated during the quarter, which again was due to timing. We continue to target $1,020 in maintenance CapEx per home in 2013.","Turning now to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on a historic cost basis was 39%. On a market value basis, it was approximately 31%. Our net-debt-to-EBITDA was 7.3x, which remains on target with our plan. As a reminder, we anticipate that net-debt-to-EBITDA will peak at 7.5x toward the middle of the year and subsequently decline to 7.0x by year-end 2013 as non-income earning assets come online. We ended the quarter with $826 million of available liquidity through a combination of cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facilities.","Next, an update on our insurance recoveries from Hurricane Sandy. Original damage estimate of $28 million to $32 million remains intact. To date, we have recovered $16 million or approximately 90% of the $17 million we have paid for hurricane damages incurred for rental income loss. Moving on, we have updated our income statement presentation in this quarter's and future 10-Qs and 10-Ks. Additionally, we conform Schedule 1 of our supplement to the income statement presentation in these filings. We adopted these changes to improve the flow of the schedule and increase comparability to how our peers' report","On to 2013 guidance. We increased our full year FFO per share guidance to $1.36 to $1.42 from our previous $1.35 to $1.41 to reflect the $0.01 benefit from insurance recoveries in the first quarter. The full year FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance remains unchanged at $1.33 to $1.39 and $1.17 to $1.23, respectively. We did not raise guidance to reflect our first quarter operational upside as we are only 1 quarter into the year and are still within our initial guidance ranges. Our same-store expectations for the year also remain unchanged. We will revisit our guidance on our second quarter call.","For the second quarter 2013, we are providing FFO and FFO as adjusted guidance of $0.33 to $0.35 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.27 to $0.29 per share. As a reminder, primary guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15, Page 25 of our supplement. Lastly, during the quarter, we raised our annualized dividend per share to $0.94, a 7% increase versus our 2012 dividend.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry A. Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I will cover the following topics: first quarter operating results; an update on our non-mature communities, development lease-ups and redevelopment projects; and lastly, an update on our New York operations.","We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store NOI grew 6.3%, driven by a 5.4% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 3.4% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 5.4% year-over-year, $1,448 per month, while same-store occupancy was flat at 95.5%. On a total portfolio basis, including our pro rata share of joint ventures, our revenue per occupied home was $1,569 per month. Sequentially, first quarter NOI declined by 10 basis points, representing typical seasonality for the first quarter. This was driven by a 0.8% increase in revenue and expense growth of 2.7%. Turning to new and renewal lease rates. In the first quarter, effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities increased by 2.2% on average and renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.8%. Annualized turnover in the first quarter decreased by 130 basis points year-over-year to 45.5%.","Moving on to our stabilized non-mature communities, detailed on Page 8 of our supplement. These properties account for 40% of our total non-same-store NOI, excluding joint ventures, and they are performing slightly ahead of plan. Our in-progress developments and redevelopments are an important driver of our anticipated cash flow growth over the coming years. During the quarter, we spent $111 million on development and redevelopment projects, including $2 million on our recent work completed, Capitol View on 14th development in Washington, D.C.","I'm pleased to report that our development lease-ups are on plan and our redevelopments are commanding the rental rate increases we underwrote. Lease-up specifics. Our 255-home, $126 million Capitol View development in D.C. is currently 69% leased and 56% occupied. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan. To date, we have yet to feel any negative impact from impending new supply in the U Street Corridor of D.C. Our 391-unit, $98 million Fiori on Vitruvian Park development in Addison, Texas is currently 10% leased, with the first home just being delivered a little over a week ago. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan.","Our 467-home, $150 million residences at Bella Terra development in Huntington Beach, California, is currently 17% pre-leased and does not deliver its first homes until mid-May. The project is on budget, on schedule and leasing up ahead of plan. To date, we have not had to offer any concessions on the first 77 leases. Lastly, our 256-home, $65 million Domain College Park development, located across the street from the University of Maryland's business school, is currently 11% pre-leased and does not deliver its first homes until June. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan.","Turning to our redevelopments. First, the 583-home, $36 million Westerly on Lincoln redevelopment in Marina del Rey, California. As of quarter end, we have completed the redevelopment of 424 homes. On these homes, we have averaged a 15% rental rate increase. The property is currently 98% leased and 96.4% physically occupied. Demand remains strong at the Westerly. Second, our 706-home, $60 million  Rivergate redevelopment in Manhattan. As of quarter end, we have completed the redevelopment of 205 homes. On these homes, we have averaged a 12% rental rate increase. The property is currently 94% leased and 91% occupied. Lastly, our 964-home, $75 million redevelopment now called 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde in Costa Mesa, California. As of quarter end, we completed the redevelopment of 220 homes. On these homes, we have averaged a 21% rental rate increase. Like all of our major redevelopments, 27 Seventy Five is truly a transformation project.","Moving on to New York. On our last conference call, the update I provided was on our lower Manhattan communities, indicated that we expected to have occupancies and lease rates back to normal by the end of second quarter 2013. I'm pleased to report that this is occurring. Currently, occupancies at Rivergate, Hanover and 95 Wall are all comparable with pre-hurricane levels, and we are no longer offering concessions related to Sandy. I would like to thank our New York team for this impressive achievement.","With that, I'll open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jerry, can you let us know what April is looking like for occupancy and new leases and the renewal rate growth and then what you're sending out for renewals?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. Thanks, Jana. Currently, occupancy, as of yesterday, for the same-store portfolio was 96%, probably averaged a little above that 95.5% that we had in the first quarter. And in the month of April, new lease rate growth is currently coming in at 3.4% growth. And renewals are coming in at about 5.4%. We're sending out renewals right now, 60 days out, right up around that 5.7%, 5.8% range.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, your D.C. results were better than I was expecting. I was curious, do you think it's due to maybe having less government-related tenants in your portfolio. Or anything that you can kind of surmise why D.C. is holding up really well for you?","Jerry A. Davis","I think it's a couple of things. First, I would tell you, I think, we have the best operating team in the industry in Washington, D.C. that helps us, every year, perform well above average. Secondly, I think our properties are located in submarkets that today are not seeing a whole lot of new deliveries affect them. There's 1 or 2 that -- submarkets we will feel the effect of new supply later this year, but we've been fortunate to this point to not really encounter that. And I'd say on the government workers, we do have 1 or 2 properties that have felt the effect of some of the sequester, but it hasn't been rampant throughout the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Toti, Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just a quick question. Some of your occupancy and turnover trends kind of bucked what we had seen in some other reports. Your occupancy stayed flat and your turn actually went a bit lower. Two questions, are there any specific regions where there was strength impacting those metrics? And number two, do you believe you left some rent on the table by maybe not being aggressive enough with the rent part of the equation?","Jerry A. Davis","I don't think we left anything on the table. I think our intent this year was to run the turnover roughly flat with last year, and we are still pushing renewals up to what the current market rate is, so I don't think we're really leaving any money on the table. And I would tell you there's a couple of markets where turnover decreased significantly. One was up in our Monterey Peninsula, another was -- which was down about 16%; Portland was down about 14%; and Richmond, Virginia was down about 7%. And then, we did see spikes in San Diego. It was up almost 20%. And a large part of that is we had a tax-exempt bond that matured about 1 year, 1.5 year ago that had 20% of -- that required 20% of the units to be low-income housing. That requirement went away at the end of last year, and we're in the process right now of retenanting those units with the conventional lease rates.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question just has to do with technology. And you guys are sort of at the forefront of pushing a lot of the online service to your tenants as far down as the phones. Do you think you've kind of maxed out the technology impact at this point? Or are there other things that you're working on that you think you might get some additional financial benefits from?","Jerry A. Davis","We definitely don't think we've tapped it out. There's -- online leasing should be rolling out. We've been beta testing it for the last 4 to 6 months. We're ready to do a full rollout as we go into leasing season so that'll be beneficial. We probably don't see it having the same penetration rate that we've achieved on our online renewals, which are up around 80%, but we think that'll help people make a decision, that 24\/7 ability to lease a unit and enjoy self-service. The bigger impact though of what we're working on this year and then probably carry forward for the next 2 to 3 years is introducing technology into the service aspect of our business. Where we use handheld devices to enable our guys to get service requests mobile-y, to punch in and punch out their time on a handheld device, which will save us quite a bit of time. And we're also using different reports now that are in our property management system to better measure the effectiveness of all of our service teams. One thing that we've also started putting in several of our rehabs, as well as our new developments, are electronic locks that we find our resident base appreciates that and our service teams also appreciate it because there's not a need to go back and forth to the office to get keys or the need to re-key the lock every time somebody moves in or moves out, which is a huge time savings.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just one last question, if I can, Jerry. Have you guys experimented widely with trying to push through higher rental rates via the Internet-based applications versus sort of the traditional walk-ins and call-ins?","Jerry A. Davis","I'm not sure I understand the question. You're saying can I get higher rates because we have the electronic platforms for leasing?","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes. Well, I guess, have you ever experimented with trying different rates through the different channels? Let's say, a walk-in really wants the apartment, do you offer higher rates there? Do you try to push the higher rates through the Internet, where the customers might be more accustomed increasingly to closing deals? I guess, have you experimented with the different tolerance levels in the customer base?","Jerry A. Davis","No, David. We've never done that. Whatever the rate is that we get from YieldStar for the given lease term, we would honor that regardless of how the person found us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nic Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How did first quarter same-store revenue growth compare with your original expectations? It's early in the year, but I'm trying to get a sense where you're tracking relative to guidance.","Jerry A. Davis","Sure, this is Jerry again. It came in a little bit better, not materially. I would tell you the biggest surprise to us was fee income was higher than expected predominantly due to lease breaks, and that was caused not so much by people moving out for home purchase. As Tom said, that move-outs to home purchase was still at 11.8%, below our historical averages. But we believe it was more related to people needing to move for job transfers. So that was a little better than what we had expected, a couple of hundred thousand dollars, and we're hopeful that continues throughout the year, but it's hard to tell if it will.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, then. How does traffic trend, I guess, in the first quarter and what you've seen in April relative to historical averages?","Jerry A. Davis","Traffic actually is almost exactly flat. It's up 3 basis points, if you will. And through the month of April, it's continuing to track pretty even with what it was in 2012.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then finally, you mentioned earlier, Tom, that development remains very attractive. So can you give us some numbers around kind of where the development yields are trending, initial yields, versus where you're seeing transaction cap rates in those markets?","Thomas M. Herzog","Sure. We -- on an untrended basis, we won't start a project unless we have sort of a meaningful variance to spot cap rates. That's going to be at least 100 to 150 basis points. As we've looked at our trended results of between 6% and 6.5% where the average spot cap rates in those markets are perhaps 4.5%, we've got 150- to 200-basis-point variance on our expected yield versus spot cap rates in those markets.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Jerry, can you talk about where first quarter, on the expense side, came in relative to expectations for snow removal and the other sort of seasonality things like utilities, et cetera?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. Expenses actually came in pretty close to budget. We were a little bit under, I think, utilities expense due to the first part of the season being a little warmer than normal and many of our markets was down. Snow removal really didn't affect me much on a same-store basis because most of the snow that hit us was up in the Boston area. And the impact of that I felt more in my MetLife JV assets. The one -- I've got 3 assets up there that are in my fort, that are in my same-store, one is actually an urban property with no snow removal costs. So snow removal was not a big player in my numbers.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Tom, just back to the development question. I mean, you're sitting here, just on the development side with $1 billion pipeline. A lot of it's going to be delivered this year. When you look out and sort of see how the market is, sort of pricing development or underpricing development opportunities, is it a situation where you think about it and you steer the pipeline down or just let it burn down from projects coming off or you look at it as an opportunity and going to continue to maintain a sort of $1 billion development pipeline going out the next year until the economy starts weakening?","Thomas M. Herzog","So Rob, first, we operate in 20 markets, and each market has its own cycle, with respect to the size and the annual spend on our development pipeline. First of all, is you're going to look at what our cost capital is versus what the opportunity is. And as we articulated in our 3-year strategic plan that we published in February, we'd like to keep the numbers somewhere between $300 million and $600 million on an annual spend basis. Projects typically take 3 years. So you can see that we're probably going to average right around $1 billion, $1.2 billion in total pipeline over the next 3-year period. We think we have enough in the shadow pipeline in the right markets that are stacking well up on the supply\/demand equation for us, and we'll continue to execute at that level. We'll wait and see how the cost of capital changes that, how cost of building deals changes that and the individual markets before announcing more starts.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then one for Harry. Have you been seeing any changes in the environment for dispositions, given the rumblings about changes at Fannie and Freddie?","Harry G. Alcock","Well, there continues to be tremendous demand for product in the marketplace. Cap rates, in general, for -- I  mean, both for A and B product are flat or in some markets, are even down recently. I think more of the B market product is migrated down even more so than the A recently. The market fundamentals are still good, interest rates are still good, and there's a lot of demand for product in the market right now.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a first question is on the mid-Atlantic. If you look on Page 18, you have your new lease rates versus the renewals. And in the mid-Atlantic, Baltimore, Richmond, Norfolk, the new rates were negatives, while the renewals were positives. And conceptually, I understand that you can push rents more on renewals. But as you think about the -- going out the balance of this year, do you expect this trend to continue or do you think that new rates you'll be able to make positive? Or what's going on in those 3 markets that's causing it? Is that sequester? Is that just more competition?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, Alex, this is Jerry. I guess, first, I'd start they're smaller markets for us but still irrelevant. The question, I don't think it is sequester. I think it was just timing of what was happening with the expiring leases and what was happening with some of the new leases. What happened in the case of Richmond, for example, we had 1 property that had quite a few corporate leases roll-off late in 4Q and early 1Q. And those are typically shorter-term leases with premium prices, and we reloaded with 12-month leases on conventional renters. I can tell you in the month of April, Richmond, for example, new lease rates are up 2.1%, so they're not down anymore. In Norfolk, that's a military town, and again, you'll have cycles with folks going out, folks coming in, things like that. I would expect new lease rates growth there to stay low. But again, in the month of April, it was flat, right at 0. And then in the case of Baltimore. Baltimore is a pretty weak market right now. There have been some government job cuts that have affected Baltimore, and there's also some new competition in a few of our submarkets, including Carlson, [ph] that have made it more difficult to push new rate on incoming people. And unfortunately there, I do have to report that in the month of April, I'm still negative at negative 1.6.%","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, for Mr. Herzog, I didn't want to say Tom and have confusion. Is -- on running the operating assets through the TRS through RE3, is there a time limit of how long you can run those through or this sort of accounting or tax say, \"Hey, if you're operating, you have to move them back into the regular REIT?\"","Thomas M. Herzog","No, there's no time limit on that, Alex.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So they can ...","Thomas M. Herzog","From a -- go ahead.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So indefinitely, you'll be booking these tax benefits or at a certain point, that somehow they reverse out or it burns off?","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, it gets into a tax strategy conversation, that's probably a little deeper than we'll get into on this call. But when we think about the type of assets that might end up in there, it would be, solvent assets were one optionality. There could have been some assets that had certain improvements that might have had the 2-year rule attached to them historically or condo-type assets that we've decided since to keep down in the TRS. It is producing this benefit. You will note from the 3-year strategy document that we do show that benefit ticking down over the next couple of years in 2014 and 2015. So I do see us -- seeing that number reduce over time through some tax strategy that we'll be employing over the next couple of years.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And just to finish up there, does it make these assets more advantageous to sell or when it comes time to figure out which assets you want to prune, it's no different picking these assets versus other assets?","Thomas M. Herzog","It's really no different. There are strategies that we can employ that allow us to have a similar outcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just on the 11.8% move out to home purchase stat. Jerry, can you just give us what the sequential quarterly comparison is on that versus last quarter?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. Yes, last quarter, Karin, it was 13.4%.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then just, Tom, just your thoughts on the single -- competition from the single-family market. It sounded like from your comments that you're continuing to think about it. Just wondering if you're feeling -- as we keep getting more and more positive data points on the recovery in the single-family market, that you're feeling increasing concern from competition there. It doesn't sound like it's manifesting itself in the stat yet, but is there something you're thinking about in the quarters ahead?","Thomas W. Toomey","Yes, Karin. A couple of points on this. I guess, first, I'd say, we've all lived through a period of time where single family was almost a predator of the apartment industry through lax lending and programs that were probably just not, and turned out to be, not right. I don't see that horizon turning, and that was a big fueling engine towards a lot of our results over the last decade, is fighting back homes. If you look over even a longer period horizon, I think homes will start to get back to the 1 million, 1.2 million start number. That's going to be concentrated a lot in the prior homebuilding markets. This exposure of this portfolio today doesn't quite carry the same exposure it has historically at all to that type of marketplace competition. So it seems to weigh less on our mind as a direct competitor because we're just not in those markets that much anymore. And so going future, I don't believe the housing policy in America, that what derailed us for the financial crisis is going to come back into vogue. And I'd see a nice balance, with a healthy recovery in the single-family market, driving jobs. We'll benefit from some of that, and I like our position on a long-term basis.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paula Poskon, Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jerry, just a follow-up on some of the expense commentary on Page 15 in the supplement. Just wondering what is sort of causing the huge swing or discrepancies between some of the submarkets within even the same region. So for example, Monterey expenses were up 10.5%, but San Diego was down 9.5% or similarly, Dallas is only up 4% but Austin, over 13%. So kind of what's driving those kinds of discrepancies within regions?","Jerry A. Davis","Well, Paula, frequently, most of the outliers tend to come from real estate taxes.  Now there are some situations where it's lower or it's something else. For example, in the Monterey Peninsula, the bulk of that increase came from an increase in personnel because we are running that portfolio in the first quarter of last year with quite a few staff openings from natural turnover, plus in the fourth quarter of 2011, as the positions turned, we elected to keep them open for a prolonged period of time. Because it's our slower time of the year, we waded deep into the first quarter to really feel the need to reload that position. But I can tell you as I look at the reasons for all of either large increases or decreases, 80% of the time, it's real estate taxes, either something that happened this year where the valuation increased or last year, we potentially had a refund.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful, Jerry. And Tom, just a big-picture question for you. It's been a tremendous 5-year period of activity for UDR. Playing Monday morning quarterback, do you wish you had done anything differently? Or did everything pretty much play out according to plan?","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, Paula, I'm not one to kind of look in the rearview mirror and try to drive the ship towards the future based on what I would have done differently or not. I think we had a good 5-year period. I think we executed. We communicated. Probably, could have done a better job of communicating our activities, the long-term vision. And that led us to generate the 3-year plan. And clearly, articulate here is where the portfolio is, here's where the portfolio is headed. And we're extremely focused on executing that plan. And so I don't \"Monday quarterback\" a lot other than maybe the Bronco's safety and letting the ball get over his head. But with running the business, we're very focused on that plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Tom, first question. Just we're basically approaching May right now. As we think about disposition timing relative to your guidance, are you guys marketing anything right now and how do you expect that to play out? As well as additional development starts for the year. I know your guidance previously did not include any additional starts.","Harry G. Alcock","Mike, this is Harry. We -- even though we have some dispositions in our guidance, we're working on getting those projects in the market now. Again, as I mentioned earlier, there is terrific investor demand for the type of product we're going to be selling, so we don't anticipate any issues achieving our guidance. Second part of the question with respect to development starts, I think it would be -- it's unlikely that we're going to have any this year. Just given where we are in the entitlement and design process, I wouldn't expect any new starts until early next year.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just following up on that question then. As you think about -- I mean, consistent with your 3-year plan, kind of developed -- delivering kind of $300 million to $600 million annually. I mean, if you don't start projects in '13, it kind of leaves a hole there in terms of '15 deliveries. How should we think about kind of backfilling the pipeline, if that is? Or is it more -- can you guys take a kind of sit-back approach here looking at potential acquisition opportunities in kind of '15 and '16?","Jerry A. Davis","Mike, we've looked at that '15, a little bit of drop-off, and it will probably drop to the $300 million in that year would be kind of the run rate at this point. That doesn't mean that something might come out of the woodwork but I doubt it. With respect to acquisitions in that window of time, we always look at the acquisition markets, but we're going to weigh it against our cost of capital and weigh it against what we think we can do with the asset. And it's hard for me to forecast out what's going to be the environment in '15 given all the variables. But we continue to always examine it under that light.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So Tom, just kind of a first big-picture question. With Avalon and EQ Irvine, Archstone, do you see this sector kind of going the way the health care REIT sector has gone to a couple of very large companies and then a smaller rung. Or do you think that it's getting closer to a time where M&A, public-to-public M&A, could start to make sense in the space, to get bigger companies?","Thomas W. Toomey","Rich, it's hard for me to speculate on public M&A in this space. You know what it takes to be successful in that frontier, which is a cost of capital advantage, a G&A cut savings. And I just don't know how those line up in other people's minds. We're focused on our 3-year plan. We'll continue to execute on that. With respect to the debt markets and taking companies private, you're seeing large pools of capital rates. That's probably one of the things that they are looking at is same REITs are cheap compared to private market valuations, leverages are out there and it's abundant and it's an attractive rate. That seems to be probably where I would tilt conversation more to -- than I would towards M&A activity.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So you don't feel any kind of anxiety about not being very large, relatively speaking, as a company?","Thomas W. Toomey","No, I think, Rich, very good question. We weighed, as part of our 3-year strategic plan, about the size and scope of our enterprise. And what our research indicated to us is the top 25 REITs have a distinct and a very tight bandwidth of cost of capital, and it's not very advantageous once you get out the top 5. So our focus and plan over the 3 years was to remain in the top 25 REITs in terms of equity and enterprise value, and we think that plan will sustain us in that range. And don't see the ambition toward getting in the top 5 and trying to create a cost of capital advantage. So I think we thought through that process. We'll continue to monitor the market and how it shifts. But that seems to be the historical trend. And I think it's probably going to be one that will project to the future very well in our view.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Another big picture, if I may. Have you ever worried or do you worry about any kind of regulatory pressures entering the system? You guys, as an industry, did very well pushing rents when we're in the midst of a recession. I'm curious if taking the foot off the accelerator a little bit from a rent perspective and maybe making your money through lower turn, lower CapEx is a model you think that we could be someday approaching as a means to not have that regulatory conversation start to happen. Is that something you would consider?","Thomas W. Toomey","No, we continue to monitor it. And I will say that Washington, no one ever sleeps while they're in session. On a state and local level where we do see, from time-to-time, fights on rent controls, it seems, in the end, cities are looking at it from a longer-term perspective and realizing rent control environments do not bring new innovative product to their space, and they resist that. And they want that new innovative because they want to attract the younger, more vibrant workforce. And in our markets, we think that will win out over time, so I'm not overly concerned about rent control in the current environment. Trading off, turnover and rent increases, Jerry weighs that every time he prices a unit. And so we're always looking at it and saying, \"We want this much traffic. We need to get this price point.\" We're going to always try to maximize the value of our assets, and if we feel like a market has reached a point or an asset has reached a point, we'll look at the alternatives. I mean, our job is to allocate capital, get the most out of it. And when that is exhausted, move on and find another place for that capital.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then last question, maybe for Tom -- I'm sorry, Mr. Herzog. The issue of holding assets in the TRS, could you just remind me if you can quantify what the kind of benefit is to FFO from doing that, if any? I just don't remember. Is there like a flow-through that you get because of that strategy?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes. We have, in our guidance, a number, $12 million for 2013. It was in at, I think, $9 million for 2012 so that is the benefit that does flow through.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's just a tax benefit. Is that right?","Thomas M. Herzog","It was a tax benefit, correct.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Do you take it out when you look at operating FFO or whatever you call it?","Thomas M. Herzog","No, we don't. We did take out the removal of the valuation allowance last year. That was a carve-out that occurred in the first quarter, and that had been reduced from the FFO, the core FFO and for that matter, the FFO itself. But in the exact sense of itself, it does flow through.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","It smelled a little bit like Archstone when they were booking gains because they did things in the TRS into FFO. I mean, is that kind of the path you want to go down from an FFO definition perspective? Any thought about just taking that out? It's a small number, why bother with it anyway?","Thomas M. Herzog","It's been something that was in our numbers, from a comparability perspective. We'll keep it in there. It is part of our run rate. Again, I do see that declining over the next couple of years, so we'll continue to present it as we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg","I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of comments that you made and ask a question on it. Tom, you mentioned that the amount of capital in the multifamily space remains deep. Harry, I think you observed flat cap rates continuing, but we'd all agree that NOI growth outlooks are moderating. So to what extent do you observe that buyers are continuing to lower their return requirements? And are you noticing that from your JV partners specifically?","Thomas M. Herzog","This is Tom. I'll take a first shot at it, and let anybody else clean up on it. What I think of this is, first, there's lots of long-term yield-oriented investors out there that are interested and have been underexposed to multifamily and are gaining an appreciation for the asset class and are growing their asset base. And I think second buyers, the levered buyer who's taking advantage of extremely low rates continues to be deep and hunting a lot of the B-type portfolio, where they could add extra leverage. The institutional-quality, coastal A buyer, low-levered buyer, it's a safe haven for money in their view, and probably will continue to be buyers in the future. So I don't think they're overly concerned about a degregrading [ph] NOI curve when they look at the long-term alternatives and believe that coastal, high-quality urban product has a long-term growth trajectory, which is probably going to be more prevalent as we see costs rise for replacements, as well as NOIs. So I think they're in for the long-term haul, and I would expect the asset class to do well, not just in the public space, but in the private space.","Dave Bragg","Okay. And speaking of rising construction costs. It seems as though yours were pretty well contained with the exception of Mission Bay. A bit of an uptick there. Is that project-specific? And while we're touching on that, can you just comment on the supply outlook for that submarket?","Harry G. Alcock","Dave, this is Harry Alcock. With respect to Mission Bay specifically, that was project-specific. There's couple of reasons for it. One is we intentionally slowed the rate of unit deliveries, given that first units are scheduled for delivery in October so that added something to our carry costs. Second as we went through and assessed the project, we found that we could get paid for improving the quality of the product in a manner that will allow us to standout from our competitor. So we did things like added AC, we upgraded the unit interior finishes and we upgraded our wireless system. We did this whole thing in a lower cost environment, meaning that we expect that our costs, even with these upgrades, will be lower than competing developments or these changes did force a change in our overall reported development cost.","Jerry A. Davis","And Dave, this is Jerry. I think you had asked about supply coming. And what we're seeing is somewhere in the 1,000 to 1,500 units coming through the end of 2014 down in that Mission Bay submarket.","Dave Bragg","Okay, that's helpful. And on this project specifically, where do you see your rents on a per square foot basis coming out?","Harry G. Alcock","Well, we're going to be well above $3 a foot, well above $3.50 a foot. When we begin our lease-up here in the next 3 to 4 months, we will again look at rent expectations. As you probably know, the San Francisco market has been very, very strong. These units have continued to reprice, and we'll look at it again, but we'll be above $3.50 a foot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste","So 2 questions. I want to go back to the comprehensive 3-year strategic plan that you laid out on last quarter's call. I'm curious how some of your near-term outlook on sources and uses could change if your stock continue'  to trade below NAV. In conjunction with attractive unsecured bond market pricing and the relatively attractive pricing for well-located, good-quality assets. So just thinking how some of the numbers you laid out could change against a backdrop that I just laid out.","Thomas M. Herzog","This is Tom Herzog. When we look at the assumptions in the 3-year strategy, we spoke to a certain amount of equity issuance, some bond offerings, some sales, and those all are ways to generate capital. And I'm going to add to that proceeds from joint venture transactions, where we might bring a partner in. And I think as we look outward, first of all, we've got conversations going on, on a number of fronts in some of these areas. And so what we end up doing is going to be dictated by the outcome of those conversations. As far as the bond markets, they definitely do look good. Rates look favorable. From a stock perspective right now, we're trading at a discount. As we indicated in the last call, we're very unlikely to want to issue stock at a discount to our NAV. So all those factors will come into play, and we'll see what transpires over the next several months. For now, we have not modified those assumptions in our 3-year strategy, but certainly, over the next quarter or so, I would imagine we'll have a better insight into what that will look like, that we'll be able to provide to you.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. And one more here, specifically on asset sales. We've seen a number of your public peers sell some D.C. assets recently at pretty good pricing. Curious how you view your current D.C. exposure today in light of those recent asset sales, but also against the backdrop of moderating growth and the supply wave?","Jerry A. Davis","I'm sorry, Haendel, our D.C. asset sales?","Haendel St. Juste","Curious -- we've seen Equity, Avalon and Lehman Brothers sell assets in D.C. here over the last few weeks, few months. And so I'm curious how you think about your D.C. portfolio in light of the attractive pricing that's available against the backdrop of the slowing growth we're seeing in D.C. and the mounting supply wave that's coming into D.C.","Jerry A. Davis","I think we look at our portfolio sort of on a regular basis to decide which assets we're going to sell. We expect to find very strong pricing in many of our markets. And typically, if you're going to sell an asset, you'd prefer to sell an asset that has sort of robust, expected short-term revenue and NOI increase as opposed to assets that, just from an investor standpoint, have slightly lower. I mean, your pricing simply is going to be better. Does that answer your question?","Haendel St. Juste","To a certain degree. But just more curious as to we've seen others pare back their exposure there. Just curious as to your -- not just the portfolio and its prospects, but just do you feel that it might be a good time to pare back and capitalize on some of the full -- the rather full pricing that people appear to be getting for D.C. assets?","Thomas W. Toomey","Hendel, this is Toomey. With respect to the portfolio, I articulated earlier a little bit of our strategy about the size of the enterprise. And how we expect it to be over the next 3-year period. And from that, what we drove down was a submarket ranking of our portfolio, and from there, really look at it and said, \"How much do we want to have in D.C. to have a balanced portfolio?\" Today, we're at that target. What we will always look at is the pricing of assets, the use of capital. We'll weigh it as time goes by. We're not really kind of trying to tie markets in our overall philosophy. What we're trying to do is buying the best submarkets with long-term cash flow appreciation and value. We think we have a great portfolio in D.C. that fits very well in many of those submarkets, as you can see in Jerry's recent market performance relative to peers. And it's taken us a decade to assemble this portfolio. We're a long-term holder. We're not going to flip it out when market conditions are just right for a day. We're a long-term holder. We're comfortable where we're at, and we think there is other places where we can maximize our capital utilization and recycling in D.C. in this current cycle right now.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. For closing remarks, I would like to turn the conference back to Tom Toomey, President and CEO.","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, thanks, all of you, for participating on today's call. Certainly, you can see we feel very good about our business after 1 quarter. We feel very good about our long-term business plan and the execution on that. And we will see many of you in NAREIT in a few weeks.

(Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, Monday, February 6, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Chris Van Ens","Thank you for joining us for UDR's fourth quarter financial results conference call. Our fourth quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. The discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you to be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Welcome to UDR's fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are David Messenger, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Senior Vice President of Operations, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","My comments today will focus on three topics: first, our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results; second, the summary of our 2011 accomplishments; and finally, our outlook for 2012. Following my comments, David will discuss our financial results and 2012 guidance, and Jerry will provide commentary on operational results and early 2012 trends.","First, UDR's business continues to improve, as evidenced by the accelerating revenue growth we reported during 2011. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share rose 21% year-over-year, driven by same-store revenue and net operating income growth of 5.3% and 7.7% respectively.","For full year 2011, core FFO per share of $1.28 per share rose 13% year-over-year, driven by same-store revenue and net operating income of 4.1% and 5.6% respectively.","We expect that 2012 will even be better than 2011. Second, we accomplished a great deal in 2011, expanding our enterprise by $1.8 billion in key urban markets and disposing of nearly $600 million of non-core communities. At yearend, our equity market capitalization stood at $6 billion and our total enterprise value is nearly $10 billion.","Some additional highlights from the past year that demonstrate the progress we made in implementing our long-term strategic plan to improve our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet and grow our cash flow include: we entered New York City market through four unique off-market transactions totaling $1.2 billion. These acquisitions offer meaningful operational upside as they continue to grow in excess of our original forecast. At the yearend, New York City accounted for 10% of our total net operating income versus 0% at the beginning of 2011.","We increased our ownership interest in Boston metro area, Washington, DC, and San Francisco through the purchase of approximately 1,800 apartment homes worth $606 million. At yearend, these markets accounted for 25% of our total net operating income versus 21% at the beginning of 2011.","As I mentioned earlier in my comments, we disposed of nearly 4,500 apartment homes in 18 communities for total proceeds of $594 million. We will continue to use the proceeds from non-core asset sales to help fund our development and redevelopment pipeline unless a 1031 exchange is necessary for tax purposes.","We commenced the development and redevelopment of nearly 4,300 homes in 11 communities located in markets such as New York, Southern California, Washington, DC, and Dallas for a total estimated cost of $808 million. Our in-progress development and redevelopment pipeline totaled $1.2 billion at yearend, of which 30% has already been funded. We expect to delivery roughly half of these homes by the end of 2013.","We increased our portfolio-wide total income per occupied home by 15% to approximately 1370 a month. This metric will trend higher as we continue to execute on our strategy of owning apartment homes in high barrier-to-entry markets, while also disposing up lower ramp non-core community.","We raised nearly $1 billion of equity consisting of $496 million to its secondary offering in July, $109 million in OP units and an additional $384 million through our At the Market program, all of which strengthened and delevered our balance sheet. We completed $300 million in offering of seven year unsecured note at 4.25% in May. And finally, we increased our annual dividend by 10% to $0.80 per share.","With the closing of 2011, the entire management team would like to thank nearly 1,700 associates for an outstanding year. We look forward to our continued success.","Turning to 2012, we are off to a great start on all fronts and looking forward to another successful year. I'd like first to briefly comment on a second real estate joint venture with MetLife, announced in early January. It's a new $1.3 billion 50-50 joint venture consist of 12 operating community containing 2,500 apartment homes, with an average income per occupied home of over $3,000 a month and is comprised of well-located communities in our core markets.","We were pleased with the upside our operating platform generated in our first JV with MetLife as well as the progress we made in owning larger interests in these high quality well-located communities. We look forward to further growing our relationship with MetLife.","We remain committed to deleveraging the balance sheet overtime. Our 2012 guidance fully contemplates capital needs for the recently closed MetLife JV, as well as $500 million in development and redevelopment activities, the majority of which will be funded by the anticipated disposition of non-core communities in 2012. David will speak further on these sources and uses in his prepared remarks.","Moving forward, deleveraging will occur opportunistically and likely in connection with growing the enterprise. At times there potentially that our leverage will increase over the short term, especially when of if we close on larger transaction, such as the second MetLife joint venture. But overtime deleveraging enterprise remains a priority.","Turning to multi-family fundamentals. The robust supply and demand characteristics current evident and our business will continue to provide a tailwind for apartment owners and operators. With our leading operating platform, much improved portfolio and experienced management team, UDR is well positioned for the future.","Our 2012 guidance calls for same-store revenue and net operating income growth of 5.5% and 6.75% at the midpoint respectively, leading to FFO per share of $1.37 to $1.43, a 9% increase at the midpoint. David and Jerry will provide more commentary on our 2012 expectation in their prepared remarks.","In addition to a strong same-store guidance, we will see meaningful growth from our non-mature pool community this year. Importantly, many of these non-mature communities are located in the supply-constrained gateway markets that are expected to generate outsized topline growth over the coming years. At the end of 2011, our non-mature pool accounted for 28% of our total NOI. David and Jerry will further discuss our non-mature portfolio and our expectation forth in 2012.","The following support our 2012 outlook: first, multi-family supply remains intact. Second, there remains an aversion to home ownership as evidenced by still downward trending home ownership rates. This phenomenon continues to simulate demand by depressing turnover and thereby limiting fresh new supply.","Lastly, job growth is expected to continue to gain traction in 2012. More importantly is that the 20 to 34-year old age cohort, which has a high propensity to rent should continue to garner a majority of new jobs, but potential speed bumps still exist. First, the general economy is recovering, but progress remain stubbornly slow. The overall recovery from Main Street's perspective is still somewhat fragile to us. Second, government intervention, specifically changes to either the GSE or broad-base housing initiative. Lastly, the ongoing European debt crisis or the realization of another macro shot could negatively impact capital markets and\/or consumer confidence in the U.S.","Regardless of these or other risks, UDR remains well-positioned for a robust 2012 and beyond. To summarize, we expect 2012 will be another strong year for UDR. We projected FFO per share will increase by 9% at the midpoint of our guidance, due to the continued acceleration of our same-store and non-mature net operating income growth. As a result, the Board has increased our annual dividend by 10% to $0.88 per share for 2012.","With that, I will pass the call over to David.","David Messenger","Thanks Tom. My comments this morning will focus on our fourth quarter results, of balance sheet update, 2012 guidance and our capital funds. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter core FFO per diluted share of $0.34, a 21% year-over-year increase and consistent with our guidance in month of July. Reported FFO per diluted share of $0.35 during the quarter was positively affected by several non-recurring items which led into an additional $0.01. These items are disclosed in more detail on the first page of our fourth quarter press release.","Turning to our balance sheet and capital market activities. As of December 31, we had $739 million of cash and credit capacity available to flaunt our business and external growth opportunities. In December and January, we sold 1.8 million shares under our At the Market equity program at a weighted average net price of $24.67. There are 7.4 million remaining shares available for sale under this program.","At December 31, UDR had 233.1 million common share equivalents outstanding and pretty modeled is the assumed no further equity issuances for the remainder of the year to 2012 weighted average share count will be 234.3 million. This includes the shares sold under the ATM in January.","In early January, we completed $400 million 4.625% on secured offerings, $100 million of which was used to repay higher cost unsecured debt. With the conclusion of 2011, it is important to look back at the improvements we have made in our balance sheet over the past two years.","In addition to making substantial and sustainable progress with regard to our credit methods we also acquired and developed over $2 billion of wholly-owned high quality apartments in desirable location.","The purchases were primarily funded with dispositions of non-core communities in access of $600 million and the issuance of $1.5 billion in equity. In short, we have successfully de-leveraged our balance sheet over the last two years while at the same time materially improving the quality and location of our portfolio. We will continue our de-leveraging efforts as we acquired new assets into opportunistic capital market activities.","A few highlights since 2009. At the end of 2009, UDR had a debt plus preferred stock to gross assets value of 55%. In annualized debt-to-EBITDA of 10%, a secured debt to assets ratio of 31% and a fixed charge ratio of 2 times.","Fast forward to year-end 2011, and our metrics have improved meaningfully. UDR had a had a debt plus preferred stock to gross assets value of 47%, a reduction of 800 basis points. In annualized debt-to-EBITDA of 8.3%, that's 1.7 times better or a 17% improvement. A secured debt to assets ratio of 22%, a 900 basis points improvement and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.6, that is 0.6 times better or a 30% improvement.","Next our 2012 guidance. Consistent with prior years, our guidance is driven by a bottom-up approach that begins at property level forecast from our experiences operations team. Our approach includes a review of the local economy including job growth, potential new supply, current rentals, application counts et cetera. Additionally, we review macro expectation for the national economy and use this information to gage the reasonableness of our more micro expectations. Our guidance is driven by many components, all of which are detailed in Attachment 14 in earnings supplement.","Let's begin with same-store growth guidance which is predicated on a pool of 38,680 homes or 82% of the homes UDR wholly-owned. For 2012 we anticipate an increase in same-store revenue of 5% to 6%, portfolio occupancy of 95% and expenses to be up 3% to 3.5%, all resulting in same-store NOI growth of 6% to 7.5%.","Next, non-same-store operations. Due to homes being added to our year-end, non-same-store pool throughout 2010 and 2011, we are unable to provide an apple-to-apple year-over-year growth estimates for these assets. But we'll give you a sense of the increased contribution this pool made to the operations in 2012.","Excluding our development and redevelopment communities, our recent acquisitions are expected to grow NOI at a rate nearly doubled that of our same-store pool in 2012.","Let me quickly explain our methodology for this calculation as it is not based on a year-over-year comparable growth rates. All of our acquisitions generated a full quarter growth of NOI in the fourth quarter. If you annualized that amount and than compare to our budget for 2012, we find a growth rate that is nearly doubled the same-store pool when its fourth quarter and alliance is treated and compared to comparable 2012 assumptions.","I want to be clear with everyone, this is not a comparison of year-over-year growth expectations but rather it compares our 2012 NOI expectations for our acquisitions and same-store pool for the annualized fourth quarter NOI outlined on Attachment six of our earnings supplement.","Third, external growth wholly-owned acquisitions. We continue to actively pursue opportunities in our core markets, but cannot ensure success in these pursuits. Accordingly 2012 acquisitions will be market dependant. Joint venture investments, we reasonably form a second joint venture with MetLife valid at $1.3 billion. Our equity commitment to fund the additional interest in seven communities and the acquisition of Columbus Square totaled $290 million.","Dispositions, in 2012, we are marketing some of our non-core communities and expected sales $400 million to $600 million of these communities, at an average cap rate between 6% and 6.5%. These dispositions are expected to be diluted by nature given the timing differences between the realization of sales proceeds and the reinvestment in the development and redevelopment activity in 2012.","Development and redevelopment. We have 18 projects currently underway that when completed will deliver 6,163 homes. The development and redevelopment pipeline will acquire approximately $400 million and $1 million of spending respectively in 2012, which as previously stated will be funded primarily by disposition.","G&A expenses. We expect G&A cost of $32 million to $34 million in 2012 down 7% at the mid-point from $35.4 million in 2011.","Debt activities, aside from the $400 million unsecured debt offerings and the coinciding repayments of $100 million of higher cost unsecured debt referenced earlier in my remarks, the remainder of our 2012 obligations consists of $195 million or 4.5% secured debt that can be refinanced at roughly 4% to 4.5% based on today's spreads, treasury, and a tenure-term.","Equity activity, potential new equity guidance in 2012 is best understood by examining our capital activity for the year. Starting with the lying balance as of December 31, 2011 are $421 million, our sources include the following. January 2012 ATM sales of $29 million, an unsecured $400 million debt offering completed in January, and planned asset sales of $500 million at the mid-point of our guidance in 2012.","Then the uses consist of our previously announced payoff of $100 million or 5% unsecured debt at far in January, our previously announced investment in a new MetLife joint venture which required $214 million of cash in January. The payoff of a $31 million secured mortgage in January. And on the anticipated development spend of $400 million during the year, the anticipated redevelopment spend of $100 million during the year and the anticipated redemption of the remaining $82 million of our preferred G stock later this year. Based on this analysis, our activity is fully funded and we do not have an immediate need for additional equity or debt to meet our 2012 funding obligation. Any new equity or debt will be market and use dependant.","Recurring CapEx, for 2012, we anticipate increase in the amount we spend for stabilized home to $1,150. This equates the $55 million fee-spend on 47,545 stabilized home. The per home increase is the result of the transformation our portfolio is undergoing, moving into more high rise products in the higher cost markets.","Finally, non-recurring items. In the first quarter we repaid a secured mortgage of $31 million and recognized a gain on the mark-to-market adjustments of approximately $4.5 million, which will be included in our first quarter of 2012 results. This will be offset by an approximately $1 million charge related to acquisition cost incurred with the purchase of Columbus Square. And annually $3 million charge in connection with the plan redemption of our preferred G stock. When added together, these input result in a projected 2012 FFO per diluted share range of $1.37 to $1.43. We will update this guidance during our 2012 second quarter call, fourth and material event, we weren't such an update. ","With regard to the dividends, this morning we announced a 10% year-over-year increase. Therefore, the 2012 annual dividend will be $0.88 per share and will be paid in quarterly amount of $0.22 per share.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to announce another strong quarter and full year of operating results. In the fourth quarter same-store net operating income grew 7.7% year-over-year, driven by a 5.3% revenue increase and minimal expense growth of 0.5%.","The fourth quarter progressed as we thought it would, effective rental rates on new leases filed during the quarter grew 1.1% in our same-store portfolio. San Francisco and Austin significantly outperformed the reminder of our portfolio and 14 of our 22 same-store market exhibited a positive new lease rate growth in the quarter.","Our loss to lease at the end of January was 4%, inline with last year. Growth and renewals remain strong throughout the fourth quarter increasing 6.2% on an effective basis. We continue to go on a renewal rate increases at or slightly above what we originally spin out to residence. San Francisco, Phoenix and Seattle were our top performers. All of our same-store markets exhibited positive renewal rate growth in the fourth quarter.","Fourth quarter occupancy declined by 40 basis points year-over-year to 95.1%, as we held the rates in the fourth quarter and we're willing to observe the small decline in our occupancy. However, we're announcing occupancy strengthen again. Resident turnover was up slightly in the fourth quarter to an annualized rate of 50%, compared to 47% in the fourth quarter of 2010.","Move out for home purchase remained well below historical average of the 12%, move outs due to rent increases rose slightly, but still represent only 7% of total move outs. For full year 2011, our annualized turnover rate was flat at 53%. In addition, our eight communities continue to outperform our three communities this past quarter.","On our third quarter call, I commented that the growth spread for new lease rate between A and B was 170 basis points. It widened to over 300 basis points in the fourth quarter. More discretionary income provides our high rent residents with the means to accept market driven increases, but as our lower rent paying residents have less platitude to accept such increases.","Sequentially, revenue increased 0.2% just as we had expected and expenses declined by 3.9%, leading to NOI growth of 2.3% during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2011, net operating income grew by 5.6% on the back of 4.1% revenue growth and 1.4% expense growth. Importantly fourth quarter income for occupied homes for our same-store portfolio increased 5.7% to $1,216 highlighting our operational success during 2011.","Given the substantial acquisition development, redevelopment and disposition activity we undertook in 2011, our non-same-store portfolio grew to 8,663 homes and represent a 28% of total quarterly NOI at the end of the fourth quarter. Our acquired bucket includes 3,200 homes purchased in 2010 and 2011 and they are located in market such as Boston, Manhattan, San Francisco, Washington DC, Los Angeles and Orange County.","Excluding the redevelopment communities in this group our acquisitions are plying out as expected. With regard to the original MetLife JV results exceeded our initial expectations. Specifically, the four New York acquisitions achieved weighted average rents increases of 11% during the fourth quarter, but occupancies averaging 97%.","Over the past six months, we have turned just under 40% of the roughly 1,900 homes we acquired last year in this market. And there still seem meaningful upside in the rental rate growth. We expect this to continue in 2012 and experience little to no negative effects from way off in the financial sector. On the expense side, we've eliminated broker commission and reduced third-party cost at our New York communities.","Lastly, we have nearly 3,100 home and 11 communities under development and over 3,100 homes and seven communities in redevelopment. These homes are expected to generate strong NOI growth as we move past 2012. The Barton Creek Landing in Austin, Texas and City South in San Mateo, California are schedule to be completed by the second quarter of 2012.","Recent velocity and realized rent increases continue to be very strong at both communities and both are operating ahead of budget. These two projects illustrate well our ideology towards redevelopment, generating strong post-rehab topline growth and also achieving cap rate compression by moving up the quality spectrum.","In an effort to provide more clarity on our non-mature portfolio, we have included attachment 7(NYSE:D) in our fourth quarter earnings supplement. The new attachment demonstrates our same-store NOI versus total portfolio NOI concentration for the fourth quarter. As you can see from attachment 7(D), the corridor between Washington, D.C. and Boston, now comprises 39% of our NOI, and West Coast comprises 36%.","Turning to 2012, new lease growth is beginning to reaccelerate and occupancy is heading northward again. In January, new lease rates increased 1.7% year-over-year similar to the prior-year period, while occupancy grew 10 basis points versus yearend 2011. Renewals continue to trend well, up 7% in January or 240 basis points about last January results.","16 of our 23 same-store markets for 2012 generated sequential improvement during the market, encouraging signs that seasonal pricing power is beginning to ramp. Renewal increases sent out for the remainder of the first quarter of 2012 have averaged 6.5%. We expect to realize the majority of this increase as many of our markets strengthening.","With that, I'd like to thank all of our dedicated associates in the field and in our corporate regional offices for a strong quarter and a great 2011. Now, I'll turn the call back over to you, Tom.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Jerry. And operator, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman.","Dave Bragg - Zelman","A few questions on disposition plans. Tom, what's the likelihood or your interest in pursuing large portfolio sale that not unlike that of January 2008, maybe not of the same magnitude, but that general strategy, given you disposition plans for the year? And along with that can you comment on whether or not you believe that there is a premium or discount inherent in a portfolio sale today?","Tom Toomey","I'll let Harry take that call.","Harry Alcock","We've got $400 million to $600 million in our guidance. And we're going to sort of pursue what we believe to be the appropriate disposition strategy, which may or may not include a portfolio sale. In terms of whether there is a premium, I think, my guess is portfolios would trade today at pricing that's roughly equivalent that the pricing we will get on a one-off basis.","Tom Toomey","I had to add that in a portfolio you could probably control the timing and minimize the risk a little bit, the portfolio transaction versus one-off market.","Dave Bragg - Zelman","Could you remind us of your methodology to get to that 6% to 6.5% cap rate on these expected dispositions in terms of the NOI and the CapEx embedded?","Harry Alcock","Sure, that's going to be 2012 NOI. It's going to have a reasonable management fee and they are up about 3%, and 500 unit to 600 unit in CapEx.","Dave Bragg - Zelman","And last question, can you talk about what you're doing on the G&A line to continue to drive that down?","David Messenger","A couple of items on the G&A front impacting the 2011 versus 2012. We made several restructuring changes over the past couple of years and you're starting to see the effects of. Our technology efforts have been solely focused on our operating platform and we made significant strides at the corporate level as well.","Our portfolio composition is a positive for us. It's significantly easier or more efficient to manage $300 million assets in one location and 10 $30 million assets elsewhere. And additionally, we have increased our development and redevelopment pipelines, which have moved some of the people from our G&A forces into that segment of our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc","Question just on your revenue growth guidance. I know that the midpoint is slightly higher than the revenue growth you achieved for 4Q '11. So could you just walk through what you expect to see the progression through 2012 quarterly of revenue growth for the first half and then the back half of the year?","Jerry Davis","I can tell you, you're right, our midpoint is 5.5%, 4Q it's 5.3% and for the year it was 4.1%. So we do expect 2012 to have better revenue growth than last year. Our expectation is somewhere in the middle of the year. It's probably going to be at its higher points and then it will tail off a little bit at the end of the year.","When you look at the markets, I don't think it's going to be a surprise from what anybody else has been saying. But the strongest markets will be on the West Coast spearheaded by San Francisco. The Texas markets will also do well. We do expect Southern California to be an above average market for us this year.","And if I had to differentiate between several markets down in Southern California, I would tell you, I think Orange County and LA will do better than San Diego and the Inland Empire. And then our weaker markets, we expect Florida to still be below average for us. And we think Washington D.C. will be a little bit below average for us this year.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc","My second question is related to Tom, a comment you made at the beginning of the call. I guess one of the items you mentioned is possible driver of your businesses here would be changes to GSEs or something on the regulatory front with respect to housing. Are you seeing anything on those two fronts or is that just a hypothetical case related to your guidance?","Tom Toomey","Karin, it's a good question. I don't think anybody really has clarity in an election year about where the GSEs are going to settle out. There's certainly a lot of noise surrounding it and a lot of people are going to say things to try to garner votes. So I'm not certain that it's going to settle itself out in '12, but it's certainly going to impact our business in '13 as a new congress is seated and undertakes what to do with the management of the GSEs, both from a rate standpoint as well as an asset standpoint. So it's just one of the things that on the horizon it's going to loom larger and larger in our calculus of risk as well as opportunities.","Today, we're not seeing anything impacting our business. The GSEs are open. The rates are attractive, and we think we are going to take advantage of that window by moving a lot of our portfolio into the sales window, and take advantage of that interest rate environment on the sales front.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You mentioned deleveraging would be a priority. Can you talk about some goals or targets of where you'd like to get to on the different leverage metrics you laid out?","Tom Toomey","I think it's a long-term directional goal. And I'm not really set on a set of numbers or specific metrics. When I look at the balance sheet today, I look at a laddered maturity schedule that feels very good and overall cost of debt inside of 4.2%. And look at the financial flexibility of the enterprise, I think we're right about average on most metrics and above average on debt-to-EBITDA.","But overtime, I think we'll just drive that down. David mentioned in his remarks about the progress we've made over the last couple of years. I don't think we'll try to do some big transaction, if you will, to fix it overnight. I think we'll going to continue to make slow steady progress on that front. And we think that's a prudent balance when managing a balance sheet.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I apologies, if you said this, but I wanted to clarify, is there any new acquisition functions in your 2012 FFO number?","David Messenger","There is not.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citi","I think you mentioned in your remarks that the acquisition equity guidance here can be market depending. Last year you gave us some specific numbers around that. Just curious, why you changed your approach this year? And secondly, how you think about 2012 might shape up from an acquisition perspective relative to 2011?","Tom Toomey","I think when we looked at the beginning of 2011 and we're formulating that game plan about what to do. We thought it was a great window of opportunity to buy that most people were not in the market, trying to buy the caliber of assets, and we think we've been rewarded by finding unique opportunities in that window. And Jerry and his team have delivered on those pro-forma, they've not exceeded them. And that's why we are aggressive in our guidance at the beginning of '11 related to acquisitions.","As we start out in '12, our intentions turn more to what do we think the pricing of assets are for the sale side of the equations. And we're going to move more towards that initially at the year and I think we'll have success on the sales front.","On the acquisition, we are continuing to look at the marketplace. It's hard for us to forecast and really see significant number of opportunities at this point, so we elected really to say, we'll look at it as they come up and weigh each of them individually. And again, look at them in light of what do we think we can do to improve the quality of the asset, garner better return out of it. And that's kind of our attitude right now about '12 acquisitions.","Eric Wolfe - Citi","And so you wouldn't see it as being, I mean you had a pretty busy year in 2011, so 2012 is the continuation of that or is it just you're trying to pick off assets here and there, and you're sitting or bossing. Just trying to understand how busy I think this year could be relative to 2011?","Tom Toomey","A lot of the activity in '11 was big, because we had a couple of successful relationships and we were buying from a lot of private individuals. And those individuals are not forced to sale, so they kind of elect, both on a relationship and a trust basis to sale. And I think that's kind of the environment. Harry, anything you'd add?","Harry Alcock","We're in the market on a regular basis and as you know acquisitions are sort of opportunistic by nature. To the extent we find transactions that we feel good about, we certainly will be willing to pull the trigger as we did in '11. I mean, if you remember when we started '11, we didn't expect to complete the level of activity that we did, but again on an opportunistic basis we're in the market we find deals that we ended up closing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","I want to come back to the G&A question from earlier. Specifically what drove the much lower G&A in the fourth quarter relative to the other three quarters of 2011? And then looking ahead for 2012, how much of the drop in G&A that you're expecting is attributable to the reallocation of staff?","David Messenger","When looking at Q4 versus Q3, couple I know is going to jump out. First, we had an extremely busy year in the first nine months, first three quarters and a significant portion of our acquisition's debt, equity and sales marketing efforts were undertaken and completed. So accordingly the bulk of the incentive comp for the company was accrued during that timeframe, so there was really a little that had to be accrued in the fourth quarter.","We had several severance contracts and consulting contracts went up in the third quarter that weren't present in the fourth quarter. And then getting to your second point, we also started capitalizing more of the costs in the fourth quarter to our development and redevelopment pipeline, as those have started to take shape and have nearly doubled over the course of the last year or so. I'll have to get back to you on an exact number for capitalizing costs, so we haven't previously disclosed that.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","And then just one other question. Just broadly speaking, what are you seeing in terms of trends in hard construction costs? And also are you seeing any increased difficulty in getting plans approved or projects through the local municipalities just because they are getting overloaded relative to their staffing?","Harry Alcock","With respect to construction cost, I think construction activity just in general the levels remained weak by historical standards. There have been some upward pressure on commodity and material prices. In general, construction prices have increased moderately, perhaps 3% or so. So I think that answers part one.","In terms of part two, the types of markets, there are a couple of different things. One, many of the projects that are in our guidance for 2012, we either have approvals or are near the point where we can put shovel in ground. And in terms of those where we are sort of starting from scratch and working through a new entitlement process, we haven't noticed any particular slowdown in terms of the processing time for these types of deals. A lot of the markets that we're building in, inevitably have longer approval or lead time process, just given the types of markets that they are in.","Operator","Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","I just want to go back to the comments you put on the last conference call. I just want to see if it's still the case. You talked about last time funding development and redevelopment with proceeds from dispositions and funding acquisitions with new issuance. Is that still the plan as you're looking into 2012?","Tom Toomey","Yes, Mike, that's currently the plan. And you can see that pretty much they match up at this present time, and the walk-forward that David provided in his comments. We've got about $500 million in development and redevelopment spend plan for the year. And Harry is out marketing a number of communities and we gave guidance of $400 million to $600 million on the sales front.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","So that doesn't include those acquisitions?","Tom Toomey","No.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","I am sorry, joint venture acquisitions, so that wouldn't be defined as an acquisition?","Tom Toomey","It's very hard for us to forecast our joint venture partner's appetite or success rate on acquisitions. If they come to the market certainly we'll be telling you about them and fund them accordingly.","Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Second, can you give an update on the performance of the Hanover portfolio in the fourth quarter? And just curious what you define is below average for D.C. in 2012 as you can kind of walk us through what your expectations are for that market just given the supply pressure that we are seeing there?","Jerry Davis","The MetLife portfolio, I don't have the fourth quarter numbers with me. But I can tell you for the year, we exceeded our budget that we underwrote that deal at by 12% and it did pick up steam later in the year. We would expect in 2012 for those MetLife properties to do better than our same-store pool still because there continues to be more opportunities for revenue growth, whether it's continued concession burn off or just rent growth. And as far as D.C., I would tell you we're looking at D.C. probably in the 4.5% to 5% range for revenue growth this next year.","Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","And then finally just can you give us an update as to what you're expecting on the real estate tax front built into the guidance?","Jerry Davis","Sure. A large portion of the portfolio in California were at the 2% for Prop 13, but when you look at it when did throughout the portfolio, it's up in the roughly 5% to 5.5% range. Most of the pressure is coming from Virginia as well as Florida.","Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","And I'm assuming that's a same-store number that doesn't include the revaluations for acquisitions done last year at some of the markets like New York, Boston?","Jerry Davis","That's true. That is a same-store number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derek Bower with UBS.","Derek Bower - UBS","Just on the performance of the A's versus B's of the 300 basis points. Can you talk about which markets maybe more pronounced and others not widening and what your sense maybe for how wide that break could get in 2012?","Jerry Davis","In the fourth quarter the spreads, like you said, was 300 basis points. And the markets where you really saw the larger spreads were predominantly San Francisco, Seattle. The markets where you didn't see as much of a spread tended to be more in the Washington D.C. area, because new supply has affected our downtown inside the Beltway markets and outside the Beltway did better and that's where our B product is located.","So those would be the two outliers whether it's the best door or worse. And how large of a spread do I think that will get to be? It's hard to tell. I could see it getting a little bit more, but probably not markedly.","Derek Bower - UBS","And, Tom, back to you remarks earlier on the call on rolling the enterprise. Can you give us a sense for how large and if there is any target size you have for your portfolio? And is there a number out there might be too big?","Tom Toomey","Derek, that's a very, very thoughtful question. And one that the management and the Board have undertaken as part of our strategic plan and review in 2012 is to revisit the size and shape of the enterprise. So we'll probably be able to give you more color later in the year on the subject. But it's certainly one that we feel good about getting into what turns out to be a $10 billion enterprise and managing $4 billion of JVs. So certainly, we have the management talent and scale to manage a larger enterprise. But how big and where is that right balance is something that we're just undertaking this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Just going back to the dividend, you guys in the fourth quarter increased it 7.5%, so it sounds like you're increasing another just over 2%. As the Board thinks about the dividend, what changed from last time they met when they raised it to the subsequent quarter, they raised it just a little bit again? Was there something that changed or were you guys waiting to finalize like taxable income?","David Messenger","The increase in the dividend for 2012 compared to 2011, there is 10% from $0.80 to $0.88. The change we made really this time was to make sure we're paying it out quarterly versus the staggered payouts that we did during 2011 of the $0.185 and $0.20 and $0.215. But the Board looks at this, management looks at this dividend, and always considers taxable income and cash flow of the enterprise, and so the 10% increase on a year-over-year basis to $0.88 per share was appropriate.","Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","But from the last time, I'm just curious, I mean you guys raised it 7.5%, which is meaningful. But the additional amount, I'm just trying to understand, if there was something new that the Board considered or if there was just as the books closed for yearend. Just trying to assess where the taxable income stands? And then also curious where the new dividend rate compares to taxable income.","Tom Toomey","Couple of parts in that Alex. First, management and the Board weighed what our growth prospects were going into '12 and beyond in setting the new dividend, and feel comfortable that the level we've set. There is no taxable event or structuring needed at the end of the year to increase the dividend to ensure that we met both, the taxable minimum or to not become a tax payer if you will? So that's aspect.","David Messenger","With regard to where we are with the dividend compared to taxable income, we have not disclosed what our taxable income per share amount is.","Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Then the second question is on the property tax. It's a two-parter. First of all, just as you've entered New York and you're now a 421a, if you can just remind us when the first year where you will experience the step-ups? And then the second was, your comments about Florida real estate taxes increasing and being a pressure point. I would've thought that, that would've been one of the parts to rebound, less, just given that rent growth in some of those northern markets has lagged some of the other parts of the country.","Harry Alcock","With respect to the New York City tax abatement. We have tax abatements that range from 10 years, to all the way up to 20 years. So, we will see that the abatement fades out over the course of the 20 years. So it's a long time. 2013 or 2014 is the first year where we'll get sort of the partial burn-off of any component of the abatement.","Tom Toomey","On the Florida, Alex, I can see your point. I would tell you that we will appeal anything we can, but right now what the consensus are showing is that heavy growth in Florida, as well as, again, the Virginian team. It's not surprising that D.C. and Baltimore pushed up ahead just like you said, because they were the first to rebound that didn't drop this far. Florida, over the past couple of years to municipalities have really have really come after us more on water rates than anything else, and it seems like their strategy this year is get more tax.","Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Harry, what is the step-up in '13, '14? What's the amount or impact?","Harry Alcock","I don't know what the exact amount impact is, but it's sort of the first 20% of one of the properties they've waived in first half. So, it's not going to be any ruling sort of for it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie","Tom, what do you think today sitting here the percent of your portfolio that you would classify as non-core?","Tom Toomey","Rob, I don't have the door counts, but with respect to value, we look at it and say it's somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. And if you look at where I and we as the management team size it, that's equivalent to about where we are in the development pipeline. And so our strategy over time is to sell assets and redeployment the new development and the development pipeline of '12 is over the next three years, that's kind of our horizon to dispose of that.","Now, there will be some dilution as it relates to, we'll probably sell before the asset come online and stabilize, but we think that' a good prudent way to fund the development activities.","Rob Stevenson - Macquarie","Given the fact that a lot of these non-core assets are in core markets for you guys, I mean, do you have any desire to do sort of a disposition JV or are these likely to just be outright sales to maximize the value?","Tom Toomey","Rob, the vast majority are in tertiary markets that we'll probably exit, and I wouldn't see us joint venturing those. I would just see a whole effort to sell them. And we think the market is good for that today. I mean this capital environment as well as debt environment is very conducive to creating a wide range of auctions and a number of players to expose the assets to. So, I'm very comfortable with our ability to execute the sales at attractive prices.","Rob Stevenson - Macquarie","Then one quick one for Dave. Thanks for the additional disclosure. One quick question on the same-store guidance for '12; looks like the unit count is the same for '12 as it was in the fourth quarter. Is that just because you're expecting for whatever is rolling in to sell an appropriate number of assets this year in terms of units, or is there something else going on there?","David Messenger","I guess, are you asking are we forecasting sales coming out of the same-store numbers?","Rob Stevenson - Macquarie","No, no. For the '12 guidance, the same-store unit count is 38,680, which I believe is the same as the fourth quarter same-store number. Now, the reason why there is no additions to the same-store, no variance between that is because whatever you're rolling into the same-store bucket you're expecting the dispositions to be an equal number of units roughly, or is there something else going on there?","David Messenger","Everything that's in the same-store pool in the fourth quarter then goes into your 2012 year-to-date same-store pool. So, I don't think I'll a full year of comparison. And then we've got an additional attachment in the attachment seven that disclose each quarter as to when each asset will roll into the same-store bucket. So that way you can roll your quarter numbers. But I think where it was, we're getting hung up on this. And so we can take it offline is difference in the quarter pool and the year-to-date pool.","Rob Stevenson - Macquarie","Well, the 2012 pool. That is offline.","David Messenger","That's fine.","Operator","Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","Jerry, can you give us an idea of your exposure to financial services employment in your Manhattan portfolio?","Jerry Davis","Absolutely, it varies really by submarket within Manhattan. When you look at the two deals we have done with Financial District, roughly 50% of our residents are in the financial industry. As you go to Rivergate which is Murray Hill, Chelsea and then up to Columbus Square, it's more in the 15% to 25% range.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley","That's helpful. And then, in terms of the dispositions, did you guys talk about the markets that you're looking to make these dispositions and also you can give us some idea of the timing of these? I mean, should we be modeling sort of equally over the quarters, or is any timing we should be thinking about?","Harry Alcock","The markets are going to be our non-core tertiary markets, and by and large we didn't give any specific guidance, but that will give you sense as to what we're talking about. In terms of the timing, we've got a couple of deals tied up now that it could close in the first three or four months of the year. I think we expect most of the balance to close in the first half of the year. It could be some inevitably that they carry into the second half. But generally, the disposition should be relatively front-loaded.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","So, Tom, if you could get a hypothetical great transaction for your Southeastern region, your Southwestern region and sell all or most of that portfolio, would that be a good transaction for you? Or do you think still, because you guys seem to be leaning towards these higher barrier markets, Northern markets. I mean, is that something that you think still adds value to the story, those kind of low barrier regions?","Tom Toomey","There is couple of different questions inside of it, Rich. I mean, certainly for us, any offer that we receive for any asset is always considered. And if we were to receive an offer of substance and size for a particular portfolio or region, there's no question we would weigh it. If it's in our long-term plan to dispose of it. And so that's kind of part of what Harry and the entire acquisition and disposition team is doing, is exposing a lot to the market and see what we get. So, we are not afraid of selling assets.","And as you recall in 2007 and 2008, we sold 25,000 apartment homes and about a third of the enterprise because we thought it was a great time to unload those assets and it turned out to be very fortuitous and in the sense that we headed just about the right window.","Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","So if I were to guess though in that transaction, if there is one thing you would have like to done to that transaction is maybe had more of the Florida element involved in the fail, is that accurate? I'm not suggesting you ever told me that but I just feel like maybe that's your past year, is that about right?","Tom Toomey","Well, the first thing you're testing is my memory which over the year is saved but on the long-term aspect of looking at it, if we've asked ourselves several times and looking at that transaction that we would have sold more. And what we really thought about when we sized it and shaped it, was both the element of where we would go with the dividend and the coverage of the dividend as well as asset pricing. And it turns out we've got it about half right. We had the right asset pricing, right window to sell but the truth is we didn't forecast the economy dropping as perceived those we did.","And ultimately a year later we had to cut the dividend. And I don't regret the decision. Florida at the time we thought would weather a better storm. We thought there was some more value to wrung out. And the truth is here we are five years later and Florida is still has not bounced back. And I think we'll probably see some of our asset dispositions in the Florida this cycle.","Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","Just quickly a couple of question, this is on the joint venture. Did you say that you can't gauge the appetite of MetLife in future activity but you did say you expect to do more? So can you provide any color on how big the future business could be with MetLife?","Tom Toomey","Well, in the case of Met, I can't really speak on behalf of Met with respect to their goals and aspirations and pricing. What we have is a very good working relationship. And we talk about individual communities and portfolios that are in the market today as well as may come to the market. And I think they are very astute buyers of real estate. And they'll have their own sense of price, we'll have ours and we'll compare in those. But I would say that their overall tenure is towards growing their multi-family platform.","Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","In Southeast?","Tom Toomey","That wouldn't be fair for me to speculate what market.","Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","And then lastly on the Kuwait Finance House, I'm just curious, is there anything unique about having them as a partner, anything cultural? I mean, are they nice people?","Tom Toomey","Rich, I mean, anybody you pick as a partner is always nice people.","Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","But I mean it's just your typical joint venture. It's not anything unique about because it is kind of unique type of partner I guess I would say?","Tom Toomey","Well, I think they are obviously, sure we are compliant, and they are very proud\/compliant investor and prudent. They've been investing in United States for many, many years, and they have been successful at it. So, we find them very engaging, thoughtful, and a very strategic partner to have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Trujillo with Bank of America.","Tom Trujillo - Bank of America","I appreciate your comments to Jana about your future de-leveraging being more kind of directional and opportunistic and goal-oriented, and I know that's hard to forecast acquisitions in 2012. But can you just provide some comments on potential sources of financing should your acquisitions exceed your divestitures?","So, if you need additional capital, do you see using the equity market, preferred debt, either secured or unsecured and kind of what you're seeing out of pricing in each of those markets?","Tom Toomey","Hey Tom, this is Dave. I think that when we look at future acquisitions and whenever there is an additional need that arises, we look at all sources of capital, and determine at that time what is best for pricing, what is best for long-term growth of the enterprise, and so there may be points in time where unsecured offerings make more sense, while there will be other times where we're going to fund more with equity than we would with debt.","From an unsecured standpoint, we're looking to continue to bring down our secured leverage and you've seen us access the unsecured markets more frequently than the secured. Unsecured basis we're probably around 4% type number on 10-year paper, and equity is what is trading at today.","I think we've been pretty vocal in saying that we would fund more of the acquisitions with equity and debt and that we also always have the opportunity to look at the wide array of capital market, I guess products that are out there; being an investment-grade rated company.","Operator","Mark Fisher with Bloomberg.","Mark Fisher - Bloomberg","This is question for Harry. I'm just wondering if you can talk about acquisition cap rates in 2012, and what you're seeing. Whether you think that cap rates will continue to compress at current levels or if you think they'll level off?","Harry Alcock","In terms of acquisition cap rates for the core products that we've been looking at, my general assumption is that the cap rates will be relatively stable throughout the year. These types of assets are influenced significantly by changes in interest rates if buyers tend not to capitalize purchase with nearly as much debt.","In terms of the non-core product perhaps that we're selling, again, I think cap rates are probably going to move generally sideways and interest rates remain low. Buyers are still underwriting sort of properties with good fundamentals and expect cap rates to remain generally low.","Mark Fisher - Bloomberg","And then you guys gave disposition cap rates of 6% to 6.5%; I'm just wondering, given that that's funding your development, what the dilution will be from development in terms of the timing when it bleeds into your portfolio in terms of sale. Are you going to sell these as you need the money for funding for redevelopment, or is there going to be a mismatch of funding there?","Tom Toomey","Mark, this is Toomey. There's probably a mismatch. I think the sales will probably be more frontloaded, the development dollars will be even throughout the year. And realize that the development dollars are going to assets under construction. So there inherently is no cash flow coming back from that constructing activity. So that's a big part of the dilution we are taking in the short run. But in the long-run, the caliber of assets, the growth rate of new asset and the market composition of them should far and exceed the assets that we are selling. So that's kind of our plan for '12.","Mark Fisher - Bloomberg","And then lastly, on your CapEx spend. You guys have $1,150 a unit priced in and that's up from $1,081 last year. I'm just wondering, where that number goes and how of that is being impacted by the new non-same-store pool that's coming in, given the higher cost markets that they are in?","Tom Toomey","You hit it on the head. A lot of it is, it's a different portfolio than we've had for the last couple of years, and whether it's a high rise or a mid rise, you have a lot of systems that cost more than a basic garden community to take care of, as well as the common areas, the amenity base when people are paying rents that are in New York, up in the $3,000 to $4,500 range, the upkeep is more timely. So, most of it is due to the change in the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Taylor Schimkat with KBW.","Taylor Schimkat - KBW","Just one question guys. Going back to dispositions, it looks like a chunk of the 2011 dispositions where newer properties developed through RE3. Looking forward at 2012, what does the mix look like between newer assets in secondary markets than older assets? And then secondly, could you comment on the expected cap rate spread between those newer and older assets if that's appropriate.","Harry Alcock","In terms of the characterization of the properties that we're selling in 2012, a majority of the properties will be our, call it, the non-core assets in these tertiary markets that the age will vary, but it will not be weighted in any particular way towards newer assets. So, inevitably there will be some in those sales.","In terms of newer versus older, it depends on so many things, including whether there's a rehab component in terms of the quality of the sub market et cetera. I mean, in general, particularly new assets will trade at lower cap rates than older assets, but it gets a little hard to generalize because you have to look at sort of the really micro aspects of the deal on a property by property basis.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citi","Just one quick clarification. I think you mentioned in your remarks that your anticipated de-leveraging was fully in guidance and does that mean do you have some equity issuance in guidance or is it just the dispositions that you're talking about there?","David Messenger","On the disposition guidance, we don't have any additional equity in our guidance numbers other than the shares issued to the ATM in January that were disclosed.","Operator","Okay thank you. And there are no further questions. Please proceed.","Tom Toomey","Well, I thank all of you for your time this morning. And as you can tell, 2011 was a very, very good year for UDR. And that we accomplished many of our strategic goals. And as we look at 2012, we feel very good about the business on the ground from an operating and from an opportunity standpoint.","And I believe that we will advantage of those as they present themselves. We have a very good sound management group, execution team on the ground. And it's reflected both in our guidance as well as our increasing of our dividend. So, we think we're off to a great start in '12 and looking forward to it. With that, we'll close and thank you for your time again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes UDRs fourth quarter conference call.

Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today, and posted to our website, www.udr.com.","In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.","Discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","[Operator Instructions] Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas W. Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to UDR's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","My comments will be brief and focus on 5 topics. First, all aspects of our business continue to perform well in the first quarter. Operations is hitting on all cylinders, and our development completions and return in aggregate are meeting or exceeding the expectations.","Apartment fundamental in our markets remained favorable, and our momentum entering the prime leasing season remained very positive.","Second, our first quarter results came in at the high end or beat our initial guidance ranges provided in February on both earnings and same-store basis. Much of 2014 has yet to unfold, but we feel good about where we are, and we'll reevaluate and update you on our full year guidance on the second quarter call.","Likewise we are in line or slightly ahead of the expectations set forth in our 2014 to 2016 strategic plan. We continue to view the plan as a solid roadmap for long-term value creation and remain fully focused on its execution.","Third, we completed $295 million of accretive coastal development during the quarter. Maintaining a consistent development pipeline improves our portfolio quality and geographic footprint, and remains a primary driver or expected cash flow growth in the coming years. We are excited about the $566 million of development projects we have completed over the past 6 months, as well as the $183 million that is expected to come online during the remainder of 2014.","Fourth, we completed the migration of the final 8 operating assets out of our original UDR\/MetLife I joint venture with another set of transaction. After 3 years of hard work, this brings the operating community portion of the UDR\/MetLife I joint venture to a close. Over this time, we have been pleased with the progress made in increasing our ownership interest to 50% in 16 of the original 26 condo-quality communities that are located in our core markets. And we are excited about the continued expansion of our relationship with the stable long-term partner in MetLife.","I'd like to acknowledge Warren and Harry for their hard work that created a mutually beneficial outcome for both UDR and Met. Tom will provide further details on our investment to date, including our current estimated IRR.","Fifth, we are making progress on our planned dispositions for the year, and while it is early to provide details, pricing has come in favorably versus original expectations. Tom will provide an update on our capital sources and uses in his prepared remarks.","And finally, I'd like to thank all my fellow associates for their hard work in producing another strong quarter for UDR. We look forward to the remainder of 2014.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: First, our first quarter 2014 results; second, a balance sheet and debt maturity update; third, a development update; fourth, an overview of first quarter and post-quarter transaction; fifth, our second quarter and full year 2014 guidance; and last, I'll provide clarification on UDR's guidance relative to future equity issuances.","First, our first quarter results. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.36, $0.36, and $0.33, respectively. Each of these earnings metrics were at or above the high end of our guidance range provided in February.","Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis were 39.9%. On a fair value basis, it was 32.0%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.2x, but is forecast to trend to the mid-6s by year-end. We will continue to manage our balance sheet to BBB+ credit metric.","Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $630 million of cash and credit facility capacity at quarter end. In the first quarter, $184 million of 5.1% debt matured was temporarily pointed on our revolver. On April 1, we paid off an additional $129 million of 5.5% debt. We intend to refinance these obligations in the unsecured market later this quarter. The only remaining debt maturing in 2014 is $34 million of secured debt that comes due in December.","Turning to development. During the first quarter, we completed 3 projects containing 891 homes for $295 million at a weighted average spread between expected trended yield incurred market cap rate of approximately 220 basis points. Of these completions, Channel Mission Bay in San Francisco is expected to yield well above the upper end of our targeted 150 to 200-basis-point trended range.","Domain College Park, which is across the street from the University of Maryland Business School and Los Alisos, which is located in Mission Viejo, California, are expected to come in 20- to 25-basis-points below our targeted range. But will still be well accretive to earnings than NAV both with solid double-digit IRRs projected at the point of stabilization.","Of our remaining $671 million pipeline of projects still under construction, $183 million of which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2014, we've continued to trend near the midpoint of our targeted range. In total, our $1.1 billion development pipeline is 65% funded.","As to future development projects, we continue to carefully underwrite opportunities, and look for new land sites. In the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced $78 million Pacific City land parcel, a 516-home project located in Huntington Beach, California, and 3 blocks from Huntington Beach Pier.","We're currently completing the design process and expect to break ground in early 2015. Looking ahead, we also expect to announce 2 to 3 new starts in the second half of 2014 and will range from $100 million to $150 million in total.","Next, our first quarter and post-quarter transaction. In January, we sold for approximately $49 million Presidio at Rancho del Oro, a 27-year-old 264-home community located in North County, San Diego. The community's fourth quarter 2013 average revenue per occupied home was $1,485 per month, and the sale was transacted at a 5.4% cap rate.","As Tom mentioned, we have several assets for sale currently in the market and are on track in moving forward with the planned disposition set forth in our guidance. Pricing on such transactions looks to be a bit more favorable than our original expectations.","In addition, during Q1, we sold our minority interest in 2 small UDR\/MetLife I JV operating community to MetLife, and received cash proceeds of approximately $3 million. The 2 communities had a combined market value of approximately $85 million with an average cap rate of 3.8%. First quarter revenue per occupied home for the 118 homes in these assets averaged $4,817 per month.","Subsequent to quarter end, we increased our ownership interest from 12% to 50% in the remaining 6 operating assets in the UDR\/MetLife I JV for a payment to MetLife of $82 million and contributed to assets to the UDR\/MetLife II JV. These 6 assets had an aggregate market value of approximately $505 million with an average cap rate of around 4.8%. The 6 assets comprise 1,523 homes with first quarter average revenue per occupied home of $2,563 per month, are all recently constructed communities located in Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Boston.","Let me now take a step back and provide some context from life-to-date activity of the UDR\/MetLife I JV since its formation in November 2010. When we entered into the venture it comprised 26 recently constructed high-quality operating assets with 5,748 homes, and 11 potential development sites with UDR acting as the property manager. UDR owned approximately a 12% interest in the operating assets, and a 4% interest on the land parcel.","Since then, we have engaged with MetLife in 4 ownership swap transactions, as well as other activities wherein we increased our ownership interest from 13% to 15 -- 50% in 16 of the original 26 operating assets, encompassing 3,932 homes and contributed them to the UDR\/MetLife II JV.","We sold the minority interest in the remaining 10 operating properties to MetLife. The JV is sold or swapped 4 of the original 11 land parcels, including the sale of one parcel through a third-party. We recapitalized certain operating communities as debt matured, and the JV made distributions of available net cash generated for the joint venture partners.","Let me show to you some key takeaways how we currently view the economics of the deal. We estimate that UDR's current 50% share of the assets and UDR\/MetLife II JV, excluding Columbus Square, is valued at approximately $460 million versus cumulative investments over the 3-year period of around $340 million. The annual IRR computed for all cash flows, along with the fair value of the real estate holdings at April 2014, is over 18%.","As a reminder, UDR\/MetLife JV I still holds 7 land parcels for which we own 4% interest for a total investment of $6.6 million. These assets provide us the opportunity to participate with Met and the development of well-located land for a total basis of approximately $180 million. We're in various stages of the evaluation and entitlement process on these land parcels, and we'll provide updates as those plans are finalized.","We are very pleased with the value that has been created to date with these ventures and with our strategic relationship with MetLife. This relationship will allow us to continue to jointly own an outstanding portfolio of high-quality assets in our core markets, and develop the remaining land parcels over time while earning management and development fees. We've continue to look forward to additional value creation opportunities with MetLife going forward.","On to 2014 guidance. First quarter earning metrics and same-store results came in at or above the upper end of our original guidance expectations and the momentum was good. But given how early it is in the year, we are maintaining our full year 2014 FFO and AFFOs adjusted per share guidance of $1.47 to $1.53, and AFFO guidance of $1.30 to $1.36 per share. In addition, we are maintaining our full year 2014 same-store guidance with expected revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.25%, same-store expense growth of 2.75% to 3.25%, and same-store NOI growth of 3.75% to 5.0%. We will revisit both our earnings and same-store guidance ranges during the second quarter call.","Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 25 of our supplement. In this page, you will note, we reduced our 2014 acquisition guidance by $100 million at the midpoint, raised our 2014 disposition guidance by $100 million at the midpoint, and reduced our acquisition disposition cap rate spread by 50 basis points at the midpoint based on current pricing and the potential basket of assets to be sold.","Second quarter 2014 FFO, and FFOs adjusted per share guidance is $0.36 to $0.38, and AFFO per share guidance is $0.31 to $0.33. Also, during the quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.26 or $1.04 per share when annualized, an 11% increase over 2013. This represents the yield of approximately 4% and 166 uninterrupted quarterly -- quarter ended dividend.","One final item I would like to address. The topic of UDR potential issuing new equity seems to receive a lot of attention during the last couple of months. In a public presentation at the Citi Conference, we made a point to clarify that our commitment to not issue an equity as a discount to NAV does not imply that we will issue equity immediately upon trading at NAV. We have a $1.4 billion portfolio of capital warehouse and non-core communities that we plan to sell over time for strategic reasons. And the proceeds from such sales are capable of fully funding our development plan for the next few years. Accordingly, we do not currently need new equity capital. However, when our stock again, trades at a premium to NAV, we will, of course, consider accretive opportunities as they arise. The equity issuances set forth in our 3-year strategic plan provide a placeholder for such opportunity.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry A. Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: First, our first quarter operating results; second, the performance of our core markets during the quarter; and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups.","We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store net operating income grew 5.6%, driven by a 4.5% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.2% increase in expenses. As a reminder, fourth quarter of 2013 revenue and NOI growth was similar at 4.5% and 5.4%, respectively.","We are encouraged by our continued ability to keep expense growth in check, especially given the difficult winter, we experienced, in the Eastern portion of the U.S. All in, first quarter winter-related expenses were approximately $530,000 above initial expectations. Offsetting this were lower repairs and maintenance and personnel expenditures, as we continue to gain efficiencies through our investments in technology and process improvement, as well as slightly lower property taxes as a result of a few prior year refunds.","Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased, by 4% year-over-year to $1,520 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.2% was 45 basis points higher year-over-year. Our total portfolio revenue per occupied home at quarter end was $1,687 per month, including pro rata JV.","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth. First quarter effective rental rates on new leases increased by 1%. Renewal rate growth remained strong at 5.1%. San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and Austin performed especially well, while the Mid-Atlantic region continue to struggle. Further details can be found on Attachment 8E or Page 18 of our supplement.","Annualized turnover in the first quarter decreased by 120 basis points year-over-year. As was the case in 2013, this decrease was attributable to our ongoing focus on lease expiration management and the lengthening of our average new lease term. We continue to move lease expirations from the first and fourth quarters into the higher demand second and third quarters where we can realize better rate growth.","Our average new lease term reached 11.9 months in the first quarter of 2014 versus 11.6 months in 2012 and 2013. The lengthened term helps us in the following ways: First, in geographies where new supply is pressuring fundamentals, like Washington, D.C., we are better able to maintain occupancy in the market, in general; second, our churn costs and vacancy loss improve as fewer apartments turnover annually; and finally, longer tenures Drive higher occupancy, which allows us to proactively be more aggressive on rates and fee increases. This focus on intensive lease management should continue to benefit our current and future year results.","Next, rent, as a percentage of our residents' income, held steady at roughly 18%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 230 basis points year-over-year at 14.1%, but still below our long-term average of 14.5%.","Moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary core markets. Orange County and Los Angeles, which combined represents 16% of our total NOI, continue to improve and are expected to perform well in 2014. Our 467-home recently developed Bella Terra community in Huntington Beach continues to be a rocket ship, and is currently 97% leased with rents 10% above up pro forma estimates.","Pricing power in New York City, which represents 13% of our total NOI, improved meaningfully as the quarter -- first quarter progressed, and we continued to feel good about the city's prospects during the upcoming prime leasing season.","New supply in Metro D.C., which represents 13% of our total NOI, continues to hamper fundamentals, but our diverse mix of A and B products, as well as less direct submarket exposure to new supply will help us fare better than many of our peers in 2014. We are still expecting positive full year revenue growth of approximately 1%.","San Francisco, which represents 10% of our total NOI, remains very strong, with employment growth continuing to be driven by high paying professional job. Demand is robust throughout the city, Peninsula, and Silicon Valley. In North San Jose, we are experiencing some pricing pressure due to new supply. Our 315-home Channel Development in Mission Bay is 70% leased, just 4 months after opening its doors and at higher rates than initially expected. Like Bella Terra, Channel is a home run.","Seattle, which represents 7% of our total NOI, remains a very good market for us. Supply is coming, the jobs are as well. Seattle has added over 40,000 jobs since March of last year, enough to absorb new product thus far.","Lastly, Boston, which represents 5% of our total NOI, is emerging from its typical seasonally slower period of the year. The winter was brutal, but we are seeing a seasonal pickup in leasing.","Turning to our new -- our development lease-ups. Channel at Mission Bay in San Francisco and 13th and Market in San Diego comprised $218 million in aggregate estimated cost. Weighted average effective rents are nearly 11% above plan and leasing velocity of 13% ahead of expectations. These lease-ups continue to perform well.","Los Alisos in Mission Viejo, Domain College Park across the street from University of Maryland Business School; and Fiori at our Vitruvian Park JV in Addison, Texas comprised $199 million in aggregate estimated cost.","Weighted average effective rents are 1% below plan, while leasing velocity is 17% below where we would have expected at this point, primarily due to Fiori -- as the prime, excuse me, leasing season gets into full swing, we expect the demand of these projects, especially Domain College Park, and Los Alisos will pick up. We are seeing strong leasing activity at all of our lease-ups in April. In fact, each one of these properties is achieving at least one lease per day thus far. All in, we remain very positive on how the lease-ups are progressing in aggregate.","With that, I will open the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you can give some color around the changes to transaction activities for 2014? Was that largely led to what you would accomplish in the first quarter? Or just are you seeing less potential acquisitions out there?","Thomas M. Herzog","It's Tom Herzog. As far as the transaction activity, we reduced the acquisition number down by $100 million at the midpoint. We increased the disposition guidance by $100 million at the midpoint. Equity, we just clarified that, that drove to $150 million and the cap rate spread, we just tightened up by 50 basis points. As it pertains to the reason for the changes, the acquisitions, we've got the Pacific City that was purchased in January, we're using that as one of the reversed 1031s, reduced in [ph] April acquisitions. Dispositions we raised, that created a couple hundred million of extra cash flow. We've got the joint venture contribution that we described that comes in as a net $79 million and then we have Steele Creek that comes in at about $60 million that we expect to fund during the year, leaves a little bit of extra cash flow in the mix. So those are the moving pieces that we have.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And you mentioned the $1.4 billion of non-core in potential dispositions, just given the strong demand for apartment assets, would you potentially increase that disposition number further?","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, I mean, as far as the dispositions at the range that we've set, there really isn't going to be reason likely to increase the disposition number. We do have, of course, the capacity to do that if we needed to. But we're not expecting at this time that will be modified.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You mentioned that the pricing for the planned dispositions has been better-than-expected. Have you seen any increase in condo conversions in your markets?","Harry G. Alcock","Nick, it's Harry Alcock. First of all, none of our assets that are in the market are going to be sold to condo converters. But in terms of the question itself, we're starting see a little bit of condo activity on existing operating assets creep into a couple of markets, New York was first, we're starting to see a little bit of it in San Francisco, and we're seeing more of it in those 2 markets on land sites where the -- many of the buyers are going to develop for a condo use.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And in terms of guidance, what are you assuming on the price in for that unsecured bought issuance this quarter?","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, we've -- it's to look at what current pricing is, Nick, this is Tom Herzog again, on the 10-year, we would assume it's somewhere roughly into the vicinity of 4%. If we went with the 7-year, it's more in the vicinity of 3.5%. We've got our guidance number in a little bit lower than that. So we've got a little bit of upside if we get to [indiscernible] between now and [indiscernible].","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And finally, what's the timing of the potential development start to MetLife I JV?","Harry G. Alcock","Nick, it's Harry Alcock. The first couple of sites could start as early as later this year. We've got another 2 to 3 sites that could start in 2015, and then the remaining 2 or 3 would potentially be further out.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Derek Bower with ISI Group.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Given the MetLife funds carry higher leverage, can you speak to what your pro rata leverage metrics look like, pro forma the transaction? And how do you expect leverage, including the JVs to trend relative to your guidance in the 3-year plan?","Thomas M. Herzog","As far as leverage on the MetLife joint venture or just leverage in general, as, I think, you're aware, we see our net-debt-to-EBITDA is the one I'll focus on, taking down during the year, probably on a consolidated basis and in the year somewhere around 6.5, and then further taking down during the period of our 3-year plan down to about 5.7. As to -- with the inclusion of JVs, we would see that number coming in at somewhere in the mid-6s by the end of the year. The impact of the MetLife swap was quite negligible to the look through, if you will, net-debt-to-EBITDA number somewhere around 0.4x. The transaction itself on the 6 assets came in at I think 56% leverage on that particular component bumped up against our actual leverage in the company and when you do the math on all that, it really does not make that big of an impact.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. You've talked in the past about your desire to increase your ownership stake in the MetLife funds, so now you've done that into Fund II. Can you speak to your desire intent to further increase your stake or own the remaining assets outright?","Thomas W. Toomey","This is Toomey. Our intent in a short-term with Met is to continue to expand the relationship on a 50-50 basis with the development pipeline. And beyond that, we're comfortable right now at a 50-50 relationship on the operating assets, and we'll continue to always have dialogue with Met on a range of topics. And so we're comfortable where we're headed.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just lastly, Jerry, how much more work is left to rightsize lease exposure schedule? And are you having these concessions to do so? And how should we think about the impact of these efforts on 2015 growth?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. Yes, we're continually moving lease expirations to get into the higher traffic months, which is -- which occur in the second and third quarter. A lot of the work has been done. So I think the impact in 2015, it'll be a little more of a normalized year as far as occupancy affected by these lease expirations changing, as well as new lease rate growth. Really not using concessions to achieve this, actually concessions, when you look at first quarter of '14 versus first quarter of '13, are down 29%. So haven't had to use that, it was really more through lease expirations. One thing we have seen is our resident base is selecting, on their own, to go a little bit more with longer term leases. We've offered up in some of our markets, such as DC and some of the Texas markets up to 14-month lease terms, and we found people opting more for these. This has expanded our average lease term from 11.6 months to 11.9, which has helped to drive down turnover. One thing it has done is when you look at new lease rate growth in first quarter, we are at 1% so far in April, we're at 2.5%. Short-term leases tend to have a bit of a higher premium, so they will help new lease rate growth. So we've seen a little bit of an impact on that. But even though people are selecting those longer term leases, we're finding people that need to move for jobs or select to move for home purchase, they will pay a lease break fee, and we've seen our fee income actually go up 7%. So while we are not overly happy with our new lease rate growth of 1%, which is about 120 basis points lower than it was in the first quarter of last year, we understand why it's happening, we think it has helped us push occupancy up to that 96.2% in the quarter, I would tell you today, our occupancy is at 96.8%. So we're running very high occupancy, probably given up a little bit of new lease rate growth, but it's really more resident selection.","Thomas W. Toomey","Just before we move on to the next question, I want to clarify one thing. Your question on the net-debt-to-EBITDA with the JV pro-rata debt, I think I said 6.6% at the end of the year, I meant to say at the end of the 3-year strategy period. At the end of the year, it'd be more like 7.4x. So 6.6x at the end of '16, 7.4x at the end of '14.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just some quick questions here. One, on the increase in the disposition guidance, how does this compare to the dividend? Does this mean more pressure on paying out the dividend or there is sufficient weather coverage or ability to shelter the gains?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes. No, Alex, this is Tom Herzog. The dispositions had nothing to do with gain capacity or ability to cover the dividend. Yet literally, it's just -- it was cash flow decisions that we made. So nothing to do with the dividend.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Right, right, to the point that by increasing dispositions, you're not changing the trajectory of what you think the dividend growth is going to be like?","Thomas M. Herzog","No.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, Tom, just you made your comments on equity issuance downplaying that. I mean, there's still some in the guidance, but it sounds like from your comments, it's not going to happen. So over the next 3 years, as we think about the development program, is it just -- should we just factor in sort of like amount of dispositions, so as we're modeling it out as the development's deliver, we sort of have an offsetting amount of dispositions, is that the way we should think about it out or is there, I guess, a different way?","Thomas M. Herzog","No, that's a good question. How we think about the dispositions is that the development program will be funded with these dispositions. And so as far as looking beyond that, I don't think there's a lot more to say. As far as equity issuance is in the plan, those are more of a placeholder. I kind of look at it this way. The cost of issuing equity is probably, call it, what, 4.85% on a yield basis and the cost of dispositions may be call it 6% and the cap rate are 5.5%, I think, is probably the vicinity of what we have in our -- built into our numbers. So there's not going to be much impact on the FFO as a result of -- if there's movement between those 2 numbers. So if there's fewer equity issuances, that's offset by disposition. So I just put that way. Those 2 numbers are relatively [indiscernible].","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, while we have to wait for updated guidance on the second quarter, would you -- should we just assume that there'd be increased disposition guidance? Is that more towards the back part of the year like fourth quarter? Or we should be expecting some pretty big trades in the upcoming few weeks, months?","Harry G. Alcock","Alex, this is Harry. We closed one deal in January. I think the next 2, 3 deals could close in the second quarter and the balance will be the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a question for Jerry on same-store revenue growth. You didn't see any deceleration really from fourth quarter to first quarter. How much deceleration are you expecting here in the back half of the year? I know you have more difficult to occupancy comps, but it sounds like you're running pretty far ahead. Should we -- is your expectation that we should see same-store revenue growth trend down from 1Q levels for the balance of the year?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, Karin, I definitely think it will trend down from the level we had in the first quarter. But we're just now entering our prime leasing season. So far, things have been going well. Our traffic and applications have held up a little bit better than last year. Turnover, as we've disclosed in the supplement, is down 120 basis points. And I can tell you, as through the month of April, it's down -- April versus April of last year another 130 basis points. Occupancy levels today are very high at 96.8% on the same-store pool. But we do have more difficult comps and I think you will see a deceleration. If I had to -- again, we're not updating guidance at this point, but if I had to handicap it right now, I'd say we'd be above the midpoint rather than below the midpoint of our full year guidance. Then we just like to see how the next 2 to 3 months play out before we update guidance.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you -- did you tell us where renewal notices are going out for, I guess, June and July?","Jerry A. Davis","They're averaging right about 5.5%.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful.","Jerry A. Davis","And I can tell you in the month of April, we achieved 5.7%.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then just last question is on -- do you have an estimate of if there'd be a change to the same-store growth if you backed out any kitchen and bath activity, this quarter?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, I mean, if we look at -- let me actually take a moment on that because here's how we think about it. So first of all, we don't have any camp Bs that are in place at the current date, but we do have revenue enhancing spend. And, I think, when you think about revenue enhancing spend, you need to look at it based on probably 3 pieces of data. The first one is the amount of capital spent, which I think as you know, we've disclosed in our 3-year strategic plan. The second is expected return that you get in the first year and in subsequent years. Third, I think, one has to consider the rollover effect of those enhancements that are dropping off from prior years. So in our case, we spent $10 million in 2013, we'll bump it a little bit in 2014. I think it's up to $11 million is the number. As I said in the past, and Jerry said, we typically underwrite to around 20% year one cash on cash return because these are relatively short life improvements often 10 years or so. And we seek to get an IRR hurdle of at least 200 basis points in excess of our WAC [ph]. The impact of $10 million of spend in the year of the spend is probably about 15 basis points on same-store. And if you took a 4 years worth, you're probably at 30 basis points. But because we've been doing this for a long time and the rollover effect occurs on I'm guessing that the same-store growth is probably closer to 0 because there's as much rolling up that's coming on. One other point that I'd make around this is the impact of redevelopments, which we would heard a lot about recently. And especially major redevelopments like a 2775 or a Rivergate and just to be clear, we do not include these in our same-store sales. And these projects are typically, call it, $70,000 to $100,000 per door, usually stripping them to the stud, so major projects and those are excluded from our same-store results all together. So if anybody has desire to want to dig deeper to how we do these calcs and how we look at it, I'm glad to take any of those questions offline.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Tom, I know you didn't update guidance, but you just inject the $79 million in the joint ventures. If you were to update guidance, what kind of lift we would we expect on the joint venture by and there just given the mark-to-market on the debt there?","Thomas M. Herzog","Mike, this is Herzog again. The impact of the swaps themselves had a very slight positive impact in 2014, it'll be a bit more positive in 2015, but not enough to be probably adjusting your numbers for. Harry, I know you looked at those 2, I think, it was quite small, I don't think we have any...","Harry G. Alcock","It'd be in the fractions of pennies rather than full pennies.","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Second, question, the 3 plants starts for the back half of the year, do you hold the parcels on those already?","Harry G. Alcock","We do. 2 of those 3 are MetLife parcels and the other's a wholly owned deal in Los Angeles.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And with those, you'd buy in the 46% you don't own and go from there on the pari passu, will you fund the development cost or how would you fund that?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, that's the expectation that we would develop those on a 50-50 basis with Met.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And finally, you get the debt maturing in the Texas joint venture. Obviously, Texas has been strong performer over the last couple of years. Just can you give us an update on what you're thinking is on the Texas joint venture, whether there's a plan to marketing any of those assets or just to extend that debt maturity?","Thomas W. Toomey","Michael, this is Toomey. I think the intent in our conversations with our joint venture partner is when the debt is prepayable to expose those to the market and see what pies, we feel good about the prices of those assets at this time. And the job that Jerry and his team have done in running them. So they'll probably be able to be sold some time early next year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Question on development. Understanding you're seeking yields 150, 200 basis points of bulk market cap rates. Given that we're late in the cycle and the recent, I guess, softness that your domain, Los Alisos and Fiori. Wanted to know whether you considered raising your return requirements for new development starts?","Harry G. Alcock","Haendel, this is Harry. First of all, clearly, cost are rising, land prices are rising, but rents were also rising. So, I think, yields are generally flat. We don't intend to increase our yield requirements per se, but we will take all of those factors into account in underwriting these deals. And won't start a new deal until we hit those threshold, which is the 150 to 200 basis points. So it's true, not all deals are going to pencil today, clearly, less than what would have penciled 2 to 3 years ago.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Can you talk more specifically, you talked about -- you seemed more optimistic on domain in Los Alisos, but more muted on Fiori perhaps can you go into -- am I reading that correctly, first of all? And then maybe can you talk a bit about the Fiori asset, what you're seeing there? Is it pricing that's the issue, is it weak demand, is it supply in uptown, can you talk a bit more about that?","Jerry A. Davis","Haendel, it's Jerry. Fiori, as most of you know, is in Addison, Texas. We built a product that was comparable to what is built typically in uptown, about 10 miles north up in Addison. We priced it very similar to uptown assets and we're getting the pricing, the velocity just hasn't been there. We would attribute a large portion of that to general weakness in the uptown market today where a lot of these lines have been coming online. And that's kind of prevented us from getting the pricing we would have like to get in Fiori. We recently have cut pricing at Fiori to get leasing velocity back on track. In fact, this month, we had 40 gross leases in the month of April. Our expectation is to continue with it. One other sign of encouragement for Fiori is, Toyota announced yesterday, they're going to move their headquarters from Torrance, California to Plano, Texas and add about 4,000 to 5,000 jobs. Plano is about 5 or 6 miles north of Addison. We have about 1,200 heads up in Plano, as well as the 1,000 or so units at the Vitruvian Park that we think will really help us out there, too. But a lot of it has been softness in uptown due to new supply, some of it has been due to, we were introducing a new price point to the absent market and the leasing velocity has been just slower than we expected.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Appreciate that. We haven't talked much about it lately, it seems. But A versus B performance in your portfolio this past quarter, is there any discernible performance and any thoughts as we head into decreasing season here?","Jerry A. Davis","These are a little bit stronger, but it's not enough to really call anything on. What you typically find is in some markets, if your product is A and it's near-new supply, it's obviously, going to be competing more against lease-ups that tend to have higher concessions. But overall, Bs are less than probably 70 basis points better on pricing and, as far as occupancy, my entire portfolio was occupied at a very high level right now.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. One point of clarification you mentioned, I see that the first quarter same-store expenses in Northeast were, I guess, pretty far below expectations. You were talking earlier about some lower RNM costs and maybe some tax, realty tax benefits. Was that primarily the reason for the Northeast portfolio, the low year-over-year expense -- increase in expenses over there something else there?","Thomas M. Herzog","No, I'm glad you asked. It's really 2 things. One, we've done a good job of hedging our heating costs up in the Northeast, about 90% are hedged, so that put a collar, if you will, on some of the utility expenses. The second thing is we get hit pretty hard last year with snow removal up in Boston. And typically in Boston, you buy a contract on the number of inches of snow that can be removed. We bought this year an unlimited amount of snow removal for a fixed-rate and we locked in that rate for the next 3 years because of that. And because of the harshness of the winter and especially up in Boston. We didn't have as much of snow removal cost up there, as you would've expected.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Could you please share some of the specifics on the new Huntington Beach development deal? It looks like a really interesting site and it'd be great to hear your expectations for the total cost, rents per square-foot, and the yield on today's rents.","Harry G. Alcock","Dave, it's Harry. I think, we acquired the site for $78 million, it's zoned for 516 units. We're still in the midst of the design process. The design will ultimately sort of determine the costs and the rents we expect, I think, we're probably a little bit early to start talking about those. We expect to start the project probably in some time early next year, and we'll talk about it more once we completed our work.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, We'll circle back then. How about on 399 Fremont now that, that one has started. How is that one looking in terms of rents per square-foot and yield on today's rents?","Harry G. Alcock","David, it's Harry again. Yes, we're well underway on that one. The costs numbers are published. We expect to spend approximately $318 million development as -- is going fine thus far. We expect that one to finish in late '15, early '16. Rents today should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $5.25 per foot and we'll trend up from there. We expect to stabilize yield on that one somewhere in the low-6s.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Toomey. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas W. Toomey","Thank you, operator, and thank all of you for your time today. The closing remarks, I guess, I would say this. We're very excited about the position that we're in. With the leasing season upon us, the teams are pretty focused. And certainly, seen the traffic and the operational platform is running on all cylinders. So we're excited about that. I thought we had a very good quarter all the way down the line on all metrics and clearly, are performing at our 3-year plan or ahead of our 3-year plan and I would expect us to continue that trend for the balance of the year, and we look forward to seeing you guys in NAV [ph].

Prior to reading our Safe Harbor disclosure I would like to direct you to the webcast of this call located in the Investor Relations section of our Web site www.udr.com. The webcast includes a slide presentation that will accompany our two year strategic outlook commentary.","On to our safe harbor, statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","With that I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Chris and good afternoon everyone and welcome to UDR's fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","We will present our updated two year strategic outlook following prepared remarks.","In 2014 we again met or exceeded all primary objectives of our plan and to-date have meaningfully outperformed versus our initial full year plan and last year's update. Tom will address this outperformance in detail later in the call. In short 2014 was another great year for UDR. We continue to see strength in all aspects of our business.","A quick recap of our team\u2019s accomplishments during the year. First, operations continue to run on all cylinders and delivered strong same-store results across the board with 5.2% NOI growth. Second, the 480 million of developments we delivered in aggregate leased up well with rents and trended spreads hitting our targets. Third, we accretively funded our growth through the sale of 368 million of well priced and well timed non-core dispositions and 100 million of equity issued at a premium to consensus NAV.","Fourth, we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio growing portfolio revenue per occupied home by 7% year-over-year. Fifth, we further improved our balance sheet metrics hitting the marks for leverage and net debt-to-EBITDA we set forth at the beginning of 2014. Our successes were recognized with a credit rating upgrade from Moody's to Baa1. Last we grew cash flow per share by 10% a strong rate which resulted in 11% dividend increase and meaningful NAV per share growth. We continue to believe that growth in these two metrics translates into strong total shareholder return overtime.","As we enter 2015 we feel very positive about the business and our prospects. Multi-family fundamentals remain firmly in our favor. Steady job growth capable of absorbing forecasted new multi-family supply and augmented by stagnant single-family housing market remains our base case scenario. Secondarily, the majority of new multi-family construction lending is concentrated in the heavily regulated banking industry making it easier to turn off capital sp\u0115kt it if necessary.","Our balanced geographic mix of A and B quality communities should continue to generate strong operating results. Our submarket locations are top-notch with better than average walk scores versus the peer average in the vast majority of our markets. Our development pipeline is expected to generate the incremental cash flow and value creation we originally forecasted. Expected additions to the pipeline in 2015 are also forecasted to be highly accretive and we will continue to improve our debt metrics.","In the nearly 15 years that I have led UDR, I do not remember being more upbeat about our prospects. We believe that 2015 and 2016 will look a lot like 2014 and that January results only solidify this belief. There remains a lot of runway for growth at UDR and we have the right plan and the team in place to capitalize on those opportunities.","With that I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all my fellow UDR associates for their hard work in producing another strong year of results. We look forward to a great 2015 and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include, our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results, our balance sheet, debt maturity and capital markets update, our development update, our transactions update and our full year 2015 guidance. Our initial 2016 expectations would be addressed in the upcoming three year plan commentary.","First, our fourth quarter earnings results were in line with our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.40, $0.39 and $0.34, respectively. A couple of items to note when moving from NAREIT FFO to FFO as adjusted in the quarter. First item, we removed certain legacy assets out of our TRS in 2014 in a tax efficient structure. Completed in the fourth quarter this resulted in the recognition of a 5.8 million one-time income tax benefit that was included in FFO. We excluded this benefit from FFO as adjusted and AFFO. Note that we're forecasting 3 million to 5 million of run rate tax benefit in 2015 relating to remaining communities in the TRS versus the 9 million recognized in 2014 net of the one-time fourth quarter benefit.","Second item, we backed out a $2.2 million after-tax impairment from FFO as adjusted related to the 50% sale of our 3033 Wilshire land parcel to Metlife. Our seven year whole period on the parcel and cost capitalized subsequent to acquisition led to the write-down, but we can earn back this impairment if certain written hurdles on the development are met. Fourth quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 4.2%, 1.9% and 5.1% respectively. For full year 2014 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $1.56, $1.52 and $1.35 respectively. Full year same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth of 4.3%, 2.5% and 5.2% exhibited continued strong demand for apartments and were above our initial expectations provided last February.","Next the balance sheet. At year-end our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 38.6%, on a fair value basis, it was around 30%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.5 times inclusive of pro rata JVs it was 7.4 times, all metrics improved as planned.","On the capital markets front. 325 million of 5.25% unsecured debt matured in January. We intend to refinance some or all of this debt in the first half of 2015. We did not issue equity during the fourth quarter despite trading above consensus NAV as our capital needs were met through asset dispositions. In January we issued 78 million of equity net of fees through our ATM at a premium to consensus NAV. Moving forward we will consider all capital options when funding our growth and will utilize the most advantageous source depending on our strategic objectives, market conditions and pricing. At year-end our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was 763 million.","Turning to development. We completed two development projects located in Alexandria, Virginia and Huntington Beach, California for 184 million in the quarter. Both are leasing well and bringing a differentiated product to the respective submarkets. We also commenced construction of our 107 million, 3033 Wilshire development in Los Angeles and a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife. In addition, we increased our ownership to 50% in two UDR\/MetLife I JV land parcels, Crescent Heights and Wilshire La Jolla both located in Los Angeles. Additional details are available in our fourth quarter press release. At year-end our underway development pipeline totaled 875 million with 72% funded with an estimated spread between stabilized deals and market cap rates near the upper-end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range. As for future development, we continue to underwrite opportunities and we\u2019ll take advantage of our land bank.","Next, transactions completed in the fourth quarter. We acquired a future development land site in Boston Proper for 32 million through a 1031 transaction. We believe this deal will generate significant value and should commence construction in 2016. Regarding dispositions, we sold three wholly-owned non-core communities in Long Beach, California, Port Orchard, Washington, Puyallup, Washington for 91 million at a weighted average cash flow cap rate of 5.5%. The weighted average IRR for the dispositions was 12%.","We also sold MetLife a 49% interest in our 110 million, 13th & Market property in San Diego and a 50% interest in our recently started 3033 Wilshire land development parcel in Los Angeles, for an aggregate total of 62.5 million. 13th & Market generated a strong IRR of approximately 16%. In January we completed the disposition of our 20% interest in our Texas, JV. We expect to ride net proceeds of 43 million on the sale inclusive of promote and disposition fee of approximately 9 million. These will be recognized in the first quarter and full year 2015 NAREIT FFO but excluded from FFO as adjusted and AFFO. This disposition was well timed as it eliminated our exposure at Huston, reduced our exposure to Dallas and generated a strong IRR of approximately 14%. Additional transaction details are available in our fourth quarter press release.","On to the first quarter and full year 2015 guidance. Full year 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share is forecast at a $1.60 to a $1.66, a $1.58 to a $1.64 and a $1.41 to a $1.47 respectively. For same-store our full year 2015 revenue guidance is 3.75% to $4.25%, expense 2.5% to 3% and NOI 4% to 5%. Average 2015 occupancy is forecast at 96.5%, other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement. First quarter 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.41 to $0.43, $0.38 to $0.40 and $0.35 to $0.37 respectively. Finally we declared a common dividend of $0.26 in the fourth quarter or $1.04 per share when annualized. With our release today, we\u2019ve increased our 2015 annualized dividend to $1.11 per share, 7% of our 2014\u2019s level and represented a yield of approximately 3.3%.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks Tom, good afternoon. In my remarks I\u2019ll cover the following topics. First, our fourth quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the continued success we realized in pushing rental rate growth again this quarter and into January. Second, the performance of our primary markets during the quarter and expectations for 2015 and last, a brief update on our recently completed and in lease-up developments.","We\u2019re pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. Our fourth quarter same-store revenue growth of 4.2% was driven by an increase in revenue per occupied home of 3.6% year-over-year to $1,631 per month while same-store occupancy of 96.7% was 50 basis points higher versus the prior year period. Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,795 per month including pro rata JVs. A robust full year same-store revenue growth of 4.3% was driven by a 60 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 3.8% increase in revenue per occupied home. We see strong rate growth continuing in 2015.","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth which is detailed on attachment 8-G of our supplement, we continued to push rates in the fourth quarter. New lease rate growth totaled 2.1% or 80 basis points ahead of the fourth quarter of 2013, renewal growth remains resilient improving 10 basis points year-over-year to 5.3%. This year-over-year acceleration was accomplished with only a 10 basis point sequential decrease in occupancy. Importantly, our leasing momentum continued into 2015, with January new lease rate growth of approximately 350 basis points ahead of January 2014 and strong renewal growth of 5.2% during the month. This when augmented by stable current occupancy of 96.5%, the 2% rent growth that is already built into 2015 as of the end of 2014, the continued strength in multi-family fundamentals and the additional $100 of discretionary income the average American has on a monthly basis due to gasoline prices has resulted in us starting the year slightly ahead of what we initially budgeted three months ago.","Next, rent as a percentage of our residents\u2019 income rose slightly to 18%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 120 basis points year-over-year at 15%, in line with our long-term average. Importantly our full year 2014 resident turnover rate declined by 140 basis points versus 2013, even with the renewal increases at a robust 5.3% only 5% of our move-outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary markets. These markets represent 65% of our same-store NOI and 71% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 16.5% of our total NOI. Orange County posted sequential revenue growth of 60 basis points and continues to outperform our budgeted expectations early in 2015. Los Angeles is slightly weaker due to our heavy concentration in the Marina Del Rey submarket where we\u2019re encouraged by new job growth in the immediate area specifically from Yahoo. Our current expectation is that both of these markets will generate revenue growth greater than 4.5% in 2015 slightly in excess of 2014.","New York City represents 13% of our total NOI. Our downtown assets posted strong revenue growth of 5% in the fourth quarter. We expect continued strength in 2015 as technology, finance, media and advertising employers expand in Lower Manhattan. Although our 2015 forecast revenue of 4.5% is expected to slightly decelerate versus 2014. Metro DC which represents 13% of our total NOI posted positive full year revenue growth of 50 basis points. We expect slightly better full year revenue growth in 2015 above 1% currently. As we will continue to benefit from our diverse exposure of 50% B assets and 50% A assets located both inside and outside the Beltway.","San Francisco which represents 11.5% of our total NOI shows no signs of slowing down as renewal and new lease rate growth in January point to another strong year from Northern California. Revenue growth is expected to increase 6% to 7% in 2015 a slight deceleration from the 8.2% growth we realized in 2014. Seattle which represents 6.5% of our total NOI benefited from strong growth from suburban B assets that are less exposed to new supply than A assets downtown. Although new supply will challenge us somewhat in Downtown Seattle and Bellevue we expect 2015 to be similar to 2014 or roughly 6% growth.","Boston which represents 5.5% of our total income should continue to see supply pressure downtown but our suburban assets in the north and south shore markets should fair relatively better in 2015. Long-term we like the downtown market and look to continue to grow through development in the submarket. During 2015 revenue growth forecast of between 4.5% and 5% right in line with 2014. Last Dallas which represents 5.5% of our NOI posted 4.2% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We expect new supply pressure in Uptown and Plano in 2015. January results indicate that these submarkets are performing slightly better than initially budgeted expectations. The 2015 revenue growth is still projected slow to roughly 3% from 4.4% in 2014. As you can see on attachment 7-B of our supplement, our 467 home Bella Terra located in Huntington Beach California and our 255 home Capitol View community located in Washington DC will join the same-store pool in 2015.","Turning to our recently completed and in-lease up developments. Beach & Ocean, our 173-home, $52 million lease-up in Huntington Beach was 53% occupied at quarter-end and as of today is 67% occupied and 79% leased, after welcoming our first residents just four months ago. We\u2019re currently offering one month of concessions at this community and leasing has been very strong in January with 35 applications taken during Huntington Beach\u2019s slow season. Los Alisos our 320 home $88 million lease up in Mission Viejo, California was nearly 90% occupied at quarter-end. We are on-budget and meeting our lease-up expectations.","Finally, DelRay Tower, our 322 home $132 million lease up in Alexandria, Virginia remains challenged by the weak DC market. But we\u2019re confident in its long-term prospects. We are currently offering concessions of two plus months in this oversupplied submarket in order to hold rate and maintain leasing velocity to reach our budgeted occupancy. Of note, in a typical development project a one month concession through the lease up period is fairly standard. When a submarket is seeing lease ups offer less than one month it normally indicates excess demand versus supply and vice versa when lease ups are offering more than one month. If you ever want to gauge submarket strength, shop a sampling of lease ups in the area to see what level of concessions are being offered.","With that I will remind those listening that there is a link to our updated two year strategic outlook document on the Investor Relations page of our Web site. We will pause for a moment so that everyone can gather the two year outlook materials as we will lead you through the document page-by-page.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you Jerry and I hope all of you who have the presentation up will go page-by-page with our comments directed to those highlighting the page numbers we are on. Starting with Page 3 a couple of high level thoughts. First we view this year's update as a continuation of last year's plan with a few minor tweaks. We believe this continues to be the right plan for UDR and here is why. The plan primarily objective is to drive high quality cash flow growth while incrementally improving our balance sheet and portfolio. In another words consistent sustainable growth that is funded in a safe low risk manner. We believe that successful execution of these objectives will drive strong total shareholder return.","With solid apartment fundamentals as a backdrop in 2015 and '16, we believe that UDR still has a long runway of accretive growth ahead, whether that growth comes from operations where we work daily to drive efficiencies through our organization or external growth where we are still finding plenty of development opportunities that create significant value. We will continue to capitalize on the opportunities available to us. So how have we performed versus the plan presented in 2013 and 2014? In short we have met or exceeded all primary operational and financial objectives previously set forth.","Some of this upside resulted from strong fundamental backdrop I referenced earlier, but a focus on excellence and execution listening to and serving our customers and continuously improving the business process from the C suite to our community level staff also played a major role. Growing cash flow to optimize shareholder return while also ensuring a great customer experience at our communities and making UDR a great place to work are our most important objectives and we will remain fully focused on executing them.","With that I will turn over to Tom to discuss the details of the updated outlook.","Tom Herzog","Please turn to Page 4 as Tom mentioned earlier we have met or exceeded all the primary, financial and operational objectives to-date as set forth in our previous two plans published in 2013 and 2014. In particular our same-store growth over the past two years has outperformed and along with our successful development deliveries have served us the primary driver of our better than expected cash flow growth and improving the leverage metrics.","Turning to Page 5 perhaps the most important driver of UDR's value creation strategy is our best-in-class operations. We are continuously implementing revenue growth and cost efficiency initiatives throughout the organization to improve how we do business. As is evident on this page, we have generally produced better top-line growth in our primary markets which comprise approximately 71% of our NOI over the past one and three year periods. But market wins represent the true measure of our operational accomplishments. Win in a market is defined as ranking first among peers and same-store revenue growth in a quarter. The chart at the bottom of the page illustrates our success since 2008 wining a larger percentage of our markets than the peer average in each year. This is a testament to the organization that Jerry and the team have built and the culture of continues improvement that has promoted inside UDR.","So how have we maintained our operational advantage and how do we intend to keep it in the future? Please turn to Page 6 many listening to this call are familiar with the primary revenue generation and expense control initiatives we have implemented overtime. These along with potential future initiatives are presented in the table on this page, importantly all of our growth and efficiency initiatives have one thing in common, they either provide our customer a wanted service or allow our associates to their jobs better. Our past initiatives which primarily focused on moving customer services online were a significant success current initiatives as will become evident on Page 7 should continue to drive our bottom-line for years to come and our list of potential future initiatives is extensive. Operation has been and will continue to be a significant competitive advantage for us. This not just because of our superior block and tackling in the field but also because of the creativity our operations team employs to continuously improve the business.","Please turn to Page 7 this page lists some of our operational projects that have been implemented over the past couple of years and their potential impact on our NOI. As is evident we have made solid progress on each initiative to-date and our bottom-line has benefited greatly. As we look into 2015 and 2016 there are still opportunities to increase the efficiencies as these initiatives further.","Finally we launched a new Web site at the end of 2014. This is a third major revision of udr.com and represents a complete rebuild of our online presence. It is a result of several months of research including the input from customer focus groups that indicated their preferences in an online shopping experience. The new Web site features elements such as online appointment scheduling, enhanced neighborhood, information and comparison shopping tools all of which are available through any device that customer chooses. To-date we're exceeding our initial targets for the site by converting a higher than expected amount of traffic to community visits.","Turning now to capital allocation and development on Page 8 development remains the vital component of our value creation strategy. While not as many deals pencil in today\u2019s environment development remains accretive and will continue to be a primary means through which we improve our portfolio and grow our Company. Our underway and completed non-stabilized developments totaled 875 million and was 72% funded at year-end. Most of this pipeline is concentrated in our primary coastal markets. In 2015 we expect to deliver over 225 million of projects. Our annual targeted spend of 400 million to 60 million per year and our targeted trended spread versus cap rates of 150 to 200 basis points have not changed. While construction costs continue to increase so do rents.","To mitigate market risk we employ a few tactics. First prior to the development commencing, we demand full drawings and GMAX contract thereby locking in costs. Second we diversify our geographic exposure, our goal is to commence a new development in a target market as the previous development is leasing up. Third, we utilize conservative top-line growth assumptions to underwrite our projects. In 2015 and '16 we will continue to mine our current land bank as well as add new land sites such as our Graybar site in Boston. We're planning four to five starts in 2015 which include one large fully owned project Pacific City and three to four smaller 50-50 JVs with Metlife. As of year-end 2014 our Shadow pipeline was approximately 1.2 billion at our pro rata ownership and represented 400 million to 500 million of value creation assuming current spreads.","Please turn to Page 9. We anticipate that our under weighing completed developments as of 12\/31\/14 will average $0.035 of drag offset by $0.055 of accretion annually in 2015 and 2016. Upon stabilization which occurs at different periods for each project the pipeline is expected to generate accretion of $0.08 per share with growth thereafter. On an NAV basis we expect our pipeline to generate $2.5 per share at stabilization approximately 35% to 40% value creation over cost. Page 10 exhibits some of our recent developments.","Please turn to Page 11. As focused as we're on operations and development, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet to optimally fund our business is just as important. We exceeded the balance sheet metric goals provided in our 2013 and 2014 strategic plans and we expect further improvement in 2015 and '16. This has also been acknowledged by the rating agencies in 2014 we received a credit upgrade from Moody's to Baa1 and revised a positive outlook from S&P. On the capital markets front our 2015 and '16 capital needs will be funded through a combination of asset sales and new equity and debt, the mix of which will depend on availability and pricing at the time the capital is needed.","Please turn to Page 12. The primary objective of publishing this plan is to illustrate how we intend to drive high quality cash flow and NAV per share growth in 2015 and '16. In 2014 our AFFO per share growth was a very strong 10%, in 2015 and '16 AFFO per share growth is expected to average in the 5% to 8% range which will continue to be driven by favorable same-store growth, development earn in and favorable debt refinancings versus in place debt. This was somewhat offset by higher trending interest rate assumptions, a lower tax benefit from our TRS and potential dispositions. We expect the business to drive 8% to 10% NAV growth in both 2015 and '16.","Please turn to Page 13. This page provides our '15 guidance, initial '16 expectations and detailed modeling assumptions. In 2016 we're expecting solid same-store and cash flow growth based on still strong third-party job growth expectations against moderating new multi-family supply growth in our markets. In addition, our expected asset sales in 2015 combined with our 2016 entrance to our same-store pool will enhance our same-store mix toward high growth markets. And finally Page 14. Our 2015 top-line growth assumptions for our markets are presented on the map. We expect the West Coast to Northeast to grow at a rate above the portfolio average, the Mid-Atlantic will continue to struggle but it's still expected to outperform relative to our peers due to our 50-50 mix of As and Bs in DC and less direct exposure to new supply inside the Beltway.","With that I will open it up to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to our first question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan","Can you discuss the strategic positioning of the Metlife transactions in the fourth quarter in January, are you fine tuning your geographic exposures or were you looking to back fill the 2016 development pipeline? And then do you expect to continue growing with MetLife maybe in joint venture III?","Tom Toomey","This is Tom. With respect to Met, we established this relationship many years ago and see its still as a strategic benefit for the enterprise and that brings us opportunities, we discuss them and we\u2019re going to continue to undertake that on a go forward basis. With respect to the quarter, you really have a series of transactions here where we bought in the two land sites that were part of the land bank that Met owned, we'd started at 4%, bought up to 50%. We typically do that and we\u2019ll probably look at those other remaining sites in the future after we have a pretty good clarity about the product, the zoning and the good use of capital.","On the other side, we sold an interest of 49% of our San Diego community which is right across the corner from Strata, and as a result felt that was a good alignment of interest at a great price and welcome Met into that asset and feel that that\u2019s a good investment for both parties. And lastly with the development site that we had for about seven years in Koreatown in LA and looking at expanding our deployment capital across the platform, we thought it was a good addition by having Met come to that.","So on the future; I think we take them as we go. I know that we\u2019ll look at the land sites as we get them zoned and more detail around and about investing in them.","On a Met JV III, I don\u2019t know if I see that, I like our 50-50 platform that is in Met JV II, it\u2019s a good alignment of interest and we\u2019ll continue to have ongoing conversations with Met.","Jana Galan","And Jerry, can you guess the new renewal if that's for January, and renewal asks for February and March?","Jerry Davis","Sure, January new leases reprised at about 3.6% higher than the prior residential we\u2019re paying. I would tell you that is actually about 350 basis points higher than we were last January. Renewals in the month of January were at 5.2%, which is slightly above where it was last January, call it 10 to 15 basis points. And as we look out over the next two months, we see an acceleration in renewal rate growth, currently on about half of the renewals being fine that we would expect for the month of February, we\u2019re up in the 5.5% to 5.6% range. And as we look at, call it 20% to 25% of March renewals that we\u2019d expect to have completed. Those are actually pushing north of 6% right now. So, you see an acceleration actually in renewal growth which is making us very optimistic and it\u2019s also has shown us that new lease rate growth is probably going to follow.","We spent, much of the last six months setting ourselves up to have outsized rate growth, and we did that after we achieved high occupancy in 2014. We've been pushing market rate on new leases mostly to set a new mark so that we come in later and start realizing that on the renewal side. So our renewal growth has lagged a bit over the last four months or so as we look out over the next three to four months, we\u2019ll start to see that acceleration on the renewal side up also.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Tom you mentioned the long run rate for growth and the outlook expect same-store growth in 2016 generally in line with 2015. Can you talk about what gives you the confidence that growth in this cycle will remain above historical trend and can you talk about the largest risk to that base case?","Tom Herzog","Nick, its Herzog. When we look at 2015 and 2016 I think we said it looked a lot of like 2014. We continue to see good fundamentals across our market. We use third party data and our individual market knowledge when considering what we think 2016 growth will look like, and arriving at these numbers. And we\u2019ve looked in third party data providers both jobs and supply, we have a tendency to use Axion, Moody's. From a jobs perspective and I know lot of you have these numbers, but we fell 1.9% job growth in 2014. Looks like it\u2019s probably going to be at least according to the data providers 2.1% in '15 and probably going to 2% on '16.","When we look at supply on the other hand, in '14 we're at somewhere around 1.5 or expecting '15 to be somewhere around 1.5% growth and it probably declines a bit and '16 the 1.2%. As we've used this data historically, we've a tendency to look at the jobs to supply kind of 5:1 ratio, but we look at them market-by-market to make them more specific. And in 2014 we had a positive ratio of 1.2, meaning that there would be more new relative jobs to supply. In 2015 we see that ratio according to the data experts being about 1.4 or 1.44. In 2016 it is yet higher but probably will be tapered back down a bit as the full supply comes to pass.","So as we relate that to our hard markets, job growth looks better than the national averages with slightly higher supply growth. So we\u2019ll call that maybe a push, but still as a whole very net favorable, all the same things you\u2019ve heard also formations, demographic trends, home ownership we see a lot of runway when we look into 2016, so we feel favorable about it.","Jerry Davis","Yes, I would add one thing Nick, this is Jerry. In addition to all of the national end market factors that Herzog just spoke about. I would include Harry has been developing a pipeline in high rent growth markets, many of which properties will go into our same-store pool as we go into 2016. And at the same time as we use some sales to pay for the development pipeline those sales will probably come more from our slower growth markets, you\u2019re going to net out with new higher growth properties coming in and slower growth properties being sold.","Nick Joseph","And then with regards to the Boston land site that you purchased. Can you talk about what was attractive about that site? And how it fits in with your existing Boston portfolio?","Harry Alcock","Sure Nick, this is Harry. First of all its 32, it\u2019s located in the South end of Boston which is a dynamic location, it's sort of an edge location now but there are is a lot of new activity in that area including a 50,000 square foot whole foods across the street that just opened two blocks from Tufts Medical Center, it's a seven minute walk to the Back Bay of Boston. As we've talked about in the past we want to sort of complete one project in a market and then some point there after start of new one, we\u2019re going to complete our Pier 4 project in Boston during 2015. We would expect to start the Graybar project in 2016, meaning we'll be delivering sometime in late '17 or early '18, $32 million price to center 600 units or 55,000 unit land basis we found attractive as well.","Nick Joseph","And then finally Jerry just in terms of the DC outlook. It sounds like you\u2019re expecting '15 to be better, slightly better I guess than '14. When do you expect actually start to get pricing power in that region?","Jerry Davis","I would tell you actually Nick it\u2019s starting to come now. I won\u2019t call it power, but I will tell you this; we feel like we bottomed in the fourth quarter and our rent was negative 0.6%. I\u2019ve got early indications and I\u2019ve actually seen my January numbers and they actually popped back in positive territory. But we are seeing new lease rate growth in the B product, mostly that\u2019s outside of the Beltway, its going positive. Inside the Beltway new lease rate growth is still slightly negative, and renewal growth in both of those product types are in the 3% to 3.5% range.","I would tell you this too, when I look at that 0.6% or so that I\u2019ve realized in the month of January and I bifurcated between Bs outside the Beltway for the most part and As inside the Beltway, the Bs outside the Beltway are probably coming in at about 2.5% positive and my As inside the Beltway are about a negative one in a quarter. So there is still a difference between who is adding the new supply, but again we feel better about DC. We think it will accelerate slightly from where we came in last year, and we definitely feel like the negative revenue growth that we put up in the fourth quarter was our bottom.","Operator","Next to Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin Ford","Jerry I guess just a question on the 2015 same-store revenue guidance. It sounds like you've got 2% already earned in as rent-roll. You\u2019re having a really good January; the same-store pool is getting better. I\u2019m just curious as to why the mid-point of guidance on revenue is a deceleration from what you saw in 2014 given all those factors.","Jerry Davis","That\u2019s a good question Karin. I would tell you when we look at what makes up revenue growth it\u2019s really two components; first is rent per occupied home and the second is change in occupancy. Last year we had a change in occupancy of a positive 60 basis points, and as we look into 2015 we see a decrease in occupancy down to 96.5 which is 20 basis point drop. The more important factor we\u2019re looking at is rent per occupied home and we have been driving rate for the last six months and we see that actually increasing by 40 basis points.","Now you\u2019re right the mid-point of our revenue is about 30 basis point deceleration from last year, most of it coming from no occupancy benefit. But I'd tell you we are very encouraged with where we stand in the month of January and what it looks like going forward. We currently have a loss to lease of 3.4%. A year ago my loss to lease was 1%. So it\u2019s 240 basis points higher. So that gives us hope and really good prospects for the next couple of months gaining that.","I would also tell you when I look over the last four or five years, we've seen market rents typically go up sequentially each month from January through August then we start to get some of it back each month. We have not seen any month that we did not have a gain in market rent, December of 2013. So it's continuously grown over that time period. And like I said, when I look at how January had started, we're very encouraged by the way we're performing today. And compared to what we budgeted just three months ago, we're excited about '15, we think things look very strong right now.","Tom Toomey","Karin before we get into the next question throws out again. Speaking to the '14 or '15 same-store guidance, I'd like to add to it we had a few different pieces that were issued that indicated that folks thought that our AFFO growth looked a little bit light compared to the strength of the business, and I'd like to address that for just a moment. If you looked at consensus, its showing and this is for 2015, it's showing $1.63. But I will remind you that when you look at consensus, it's always in mix bag. Some are going for FFO, some FFO is adjusted and some their own creation of what they believe the appropriate funds from operations. So that\u2019s how we've heard a measure. But we're at $1.61 against the $1.63.","As you guys are modeling, I would ask you to consider there are couple of items to just make sure it's in your model. One is last quarter we had mentioned that upon the sale of the Texas JV which was obviously a favorable transaction for us that reduced our FFO as adjusted by close to a penny per share. And the second thing and it's something that we mentioned about a year ago, I mentioned about a year ago that we're going to be moving certain TRS assets out of the TRS up into the REIT through some tax structuring, and that was going to reduce the tax benefit. That\u2019s about a two penny difference as well. So you add those two together that's $0.03, that equates to about 2%, and that would certainly bridge the gap plus the penny probably against consensus no matter how you measure it.","And the other thing as we show 5% to 8% FFO adjusted growth during the 2015 year $0.03 equates to 2%. So that would equate to 7% to 10% growth. And as you know from our strategic plan we've indicated strong cash flow growth has been one of things that we're working hard toward 7% to 10% growth rate is certainly consistent with what we've been seeking to accomplish. So I just wanted to add that in as you're considering remodeling.","Karin Ford","I think you mentioned also Tom in your opening remarks that the strategic plan was essentially unchanged, but as there were some minor tweaks. Can you just give us a quick summary and so what you think the tweaks were from last year's plan to this year's?","Tom Toomey","I'm really minor in scope and nature, I think you are going to continue to see us with our development spend which is probably a little bit less than it was in prior year's asset sales last year exceeded plan, this year we put forward some guidance as total capital requirement the mix may change upon that. That\u2019s probably where I think the tweaks are.","Karin Ford","And then just last question is on the operating initiatives that you guys are so successful on last year. How much of that NOI benefit do you think you guys have harvested? And are there additional initiatives that you're planning to implement for 2015?","Jerry Davis","Yes Karin this is Jerry. I think there is still lag on quite a few of the initiatives we started last year. And if you looked at page seven in the two year strategy. We started out on reducing vacant days if you will. Back in 2012 when we were averaging about 26 days we so far cut five days off of that and we're down to averaging 21 days in 2014. We're going to try to get a few more days off of that this year and our long-term goal today is 18 days, but we\u2019re going to reassess when we get to that point. So we still think there is some room to pick up some reduction there.","The biggest item or one of the big items is increasing staff efficiency. We first looked at this several years ago, we deemed our maintenance teams were probably inefficient about three to four hours a day where they are soundly walking from place to place, and we've introduced technology and standards. If you capture a 50 minutes of that which adds about an annual almost $3 million to NOI, we think there is another 1.5 hours to two hours to get. So we think we're only 40% of the way there this year. And I can tell you as I look at the components of what make up my expense growth next year, our expectations as our NIM expense is going down again for the third year in a row by a little over 1%. So there is some juice there.","Then the third large initiative that we'll continue this year that we started last year was our outbound call center, what we called in the two year document resurrecting discarded rental lease. We picked up 400 incremental leases last year we feel from this group which boosted our occupancy about 50 basis points. We increased the size of that group but our intent is not to increase the occupancy, it's actually to increase traffic which will probably result in a lower closing ratio at the site, but we think it will drive rates. So we're not going to have to be the cheapest place to live, we can hold out here quality, high paying renters, drive rate more. Whereas last year was an occupancy pickup, we think this year it's going to be more of a rate pickup.","I would say there is a few things we're working on, that are in this document. It is hard to tell if we'll make much money in this year but its problems we know we have to solve and that's the resident package lockers or delivery systems, electronic locks we've been working on for several years haven't come up with a good solution but we think when it does it's going to be staffing efficiency as well as add amenities to the residents.","And we pick another big one that we've really, we've dedicated some resources here in our Denver office too is reputation management by not doing -- we think we need to get our scores better even though they are better than the average for the industry, we realized a lot of our demographic looks at that metric before they make a buying choice. So we want to work to get our scores up but more importantly we want to listen to what our residents are saying about us and make the UDR community a much better place to live.","So those are the things that are one the immediate pipeline. I can tell you we've got about 50 to 60 different items. Some may take years to prepare implementation but we'll tell you about those once we get them rolling.","Operator","Next question will be from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Just real couple of quick ones, first. Did you mention this one-time infrastructure repair cost and what that was?","Tom Toomey","No I didn't.","Rich Anderson","And what is it, and when is it?","Tom Toomey","Yes it is going to be throughout 2015, it pertains to two projects that we have; one that involves re-piping and one that involves a garage structural repair that's fairly significant. They are both one-time, they are both not going to add or provide a return. And so we felt it appropriate to break it out separately in Schedule '15 which is where you'll find that guidance. And I know your next question is going to be, are we going to include that in our recurring CapEx? And the answer is no, because of the one-time nature of it and the non-recurring nature.","Rich Anderson","So will it be ratably throughout the year or specific quarters or what? Just for modeling purposes.","Jerry Davis","Rich this is Jerry. I think you are going to see first quarter is more planning, I think the bulk of the spend is going to come in the last three quarters.","Rich Anderson","Next question is just on the 1031 exchange; by buying land I wasn't aware you can get satisfied with the 1031 exchange requirements. Is there something you have to do with that land in a specific period of time to satisfy that tax issue? Or is that legal -- not legal or just buying land enough or they would like exchange?","Harry Alcock","Rich this is Harry. The 1031 works or function the same whether it's an operating asset or a land asset, both work equally as well.","Rich Anderson","I wasn't clear on that, so. And then maybe a big picture question for Toomey or whomever. But a lot of shifting around some complexities, with things moving from one bucket to the MetLife relationship. Do you foresee some of those kind of moving buckets some of that moving, activity slowing down in future periods does create some create some noisy situations in certain quarters. So I was just wondering if you could comment on that and what the kind of long-term objective is and where you want to get to in terms of your ultimate relationship with MetLife?","Tom Toomey","Well certainly with respect to Met, I think the long-term goal about four years ago was try to move it to a 50-50 platform. And as you can see every quarter we chip away at that, the remaining aspect to get there is probably about six parcels of land that are currently going through rezoning efforts. And so over probably the next year or two years you will see us evaluate those as to more clarity about the investment opportunity is understood, and they'll move to a 50-50. And at that point I think we pretty much have completed what I would call hand over Met UDR transition will be done, Rich and I think that's a great position to be.","You can see we took steps to simplify the organization this quarter with certainly the sale of the Texas JV and realizing a great return. So I think these well might add some complexities Tom has done a fabulous job of laying out the path, the value created in each of them. And we think that\u2019s a continual effort going forward, but certainly things that have been worth undertaking and certainly a benefit to our shareholders.","Rich Anderson","So maybe some moving parts, some noise for this year but then it starts to die down and you get to where you want to be?","Tom Toomey","Yes sir.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg","And Jerry I wanted to follow up on a point you made earlier which is that your asset sale and rolling of new assets into the same-store pool could move the needle a little bit. So just to help us to have a clear perspective on what '16 could look like relative to '15? How much does that impact your '16 revenue growth if you think about the same-store pool this year, what\u2019s that growth rate in '16?","Jerry Davis","Dave, I don\u2019t have the exact number, I can tell you as we\u2019ve looked at potential dispositions and the assets that are going to come in, we think it\u2019s going to be fairly de minimis, call it 10 to 20 basis points probably at most.","Dave Bragg","And then question for Herzog, when we look at page 11 of the plan, you have debt equity in sale proceeds group together. Your peer AvalonBay provides a constant capital heat map which really provides their view of relative attractiveness of each of those three sources. Could you talk about that from your perspective and how you\u2019ll balance that with your leverage targets?","Thomas Herzog","Sure Dave. We don\u2019t provide heat map but we do in the same kiosk. So, here is how I think lets out. If we look at the three different sources, first look at just cost of equity. If we're showing equity we do it against AFFO yields, just for the per share, so I don\u2019t mean the true cost of equity including growth but the per share cost against AFFO, call it somewhere between 4% and 4.5% cost in that particular year. If we look at sales proceeds, we just look at the cap rate on a cash flow cap rate basis and again ignoring growth. That could be -- it depends on what assets were signed it could be a sub four, it could be six, 6.5 maybe seven. But that\u2019s the type of range dependant on what it is, we\u2019re selling that in which market, which assets, et cetera.","When we think about that, we could be issuing debt at call it three, 3.5 today on a 10 year basis. When we look at what it could be in 2015, maybe we say four, maybe we'd say less. So that\u2019s anywhere from 3.3 to four in the current year for newly issued debt. So, when we think about the most attractive source of capital, we have to take into account, we trade in at a premium to NAV, what do sales proceeds look like? Do we have assets that we would really like to liquidate and from a debt metric perspective, however we\u2019re thinking about our leverage, our net debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage et cetera. And as you know over the last couple of three years, we\u2019ve leaned toward issuance of less debt or at least keep it neutral, so that we can improve our metrics, we\u2019ve not been a big issuer of equity because the good portion of that we\u2019re trading at a discount, that as we look at it today, frankly we have three very attractive sources of capital and we\u2019ll definitely take into account our debt metrics and we\u2019ll look at each of those, every time we consider, which source of funds we want to utilize.","Dave Bragg","And last question is just back to Jerry. Of course you noted your reduced exposure to taxes but just talk about your broader thoughts on the impact of lower oil on Dallas and on Denver?","Jerry Davis","Sure, I would say Dave from what we\u2019re seeing and what we project to see, these are diversified economies and we don\u2019t see much of an impact to us. I would remind you, in Denver we only have one 50-50 owned assets, so it will have minimal effect on us. And then Dallas to date we see nothing, I would tell you even the January is been a bit stronger than I would have expected three months ago. So, I think when you look at everything that Texas has going for it outside of Huston, the other two markets, they will have some effect from oil prices but not nearly as much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Ian Weissman","My questions have been asked and answered, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky","Hey, good afternoon guys and just follow to Dave\u2019s question just as we think about dispositions there. How much can you sell in 2015 without pushing up a need for special dividend?","Tom Toomey","We\u2019ve got a decent gain capacity, but Mike it depends on the blend of assets that we sell. You can look at what we\u2019ve sold in 2014, they weren\u2019t all in non-core markets, we had certain assets that we chose to sell in Seattle. We had assets in Florida; we had assets in Norfolk, we had an asset in California. So it depends on which assets we choose to liquidate and what the gain on that is. But we\u2019ve also got the clawback rules in a variety of different things. So we\u2019re not bumping up against any issues around that right now. If we chose to fund our entire development pipeline in 2015 from sales proceeds [indiscernible].","Michael Salinsky","Second question I think you mentioned three to four stretch with MetLife one on balance sheet. Could you give just kind of a dollar amount as we think and then just as you\u2019re looking ahead to '16 there thinking about the capital sources and uses, how much should we expect kind of to start there, just kind of building out the pipeline there.","Tom Toomey","Can you repeat that second part Mike? I missed it.","Michael Salinsky","You gave a number of starts but I'm just thinking in terms of dollar amounts, how much should we kind of -- what\u2019s the dollar amount there just given MetLife for probably three to four of the starts.","Tom Herzog","Yes, hold on a second I\u2019ve got that number here. The starts in '15 will be somewhere around 400 million in total, so that\u2019s the start number.","Tom Toomey","Mike, that\u2019s UDR's share. So we expect to start our Pac City project in Huntington Beach in 2015. We also expect to start a 50-50 JV, 155 units in Mountain View the early part of '15 and then we have two or three others that could start in 2015 UDR share would be 400 million to 500 million.","Michael Salinsky","And finally just the leverage metrics you gave in the strategic outlook don't include your share with JVs. Just given the asset sales into the JV as well as the client commitments with MetLife. Just could you give us kind of an update where you think those metrics kind of play out relative to wholly owned portfolio over the next two years?","Tom Herzog","Let me just start with 2015. We\u2019ve got net debt to EBITDA, in fact let me just me actually go to the range numbers rather than what I have in my model. So, net debt to EBITDA, we\u2019re showing 5.8 to 6.2 the same number with JVs would be somewhere around 6.8, and in 2016, I\u2019m triangulated in a couple of schedules here. Net debt to EBITDA dropped to somewhere, I\u2019m not going range just one, just call it a mid-point of about a 5.4 and it would drop inclusive of JVs to somewhere around 6.4.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Derek Bower with Evercore ISI.","Derek Bower","Just a couple of quick ones. Tom can you comment on the reasons for delaying the financing of the January maturity? And maybe what the revolver balance stands today?","Tom Herzog","Yes, the revolver balance, it\u2019s just over 400 million. We\u2019ve got some proceeds that will be coming in and we\u2019re looking at a couple of potential different sources of capital. So it\u2019s sometime in the first half that we expect, we\u2019ve already got a piece of that debt hedged. So that plays into our thinking as well. So with variety of different things we\u2019re thinking about as we think about the timing of debt.","Derek Bower","And then just given the West Cost concentration of the pipeline. Are there any East Coast markets that you\u2019re actively looking for land sites today?","Harry Alcock","Derek this is Harry, we just acquired a land site in Boston for large a projects that we\u2019ll start next year. We are actively looking for traditional sites in Washington DC possibly in New York, in addition to the West Coast assets.","Derek Bower","Jerry, sorry if I missed this, but where is occupancy today or the end of January?","Jerry Davis","Both cases into January and today it\u2019s 96.5.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","I was wondering if you can talk Tom about the outlook and potential risks to it, how much of the lower turnover that you\u2019re seeing has occurred for past few years? You think is due to the shift in the markets where you are into better customer service and satisfaction. How much you think is cyclical sort of it could present a risk in terms of expenses also in terms of unit to that way.","Tom Toomey","I would tell you, I think a lot of is our markets I think when you look at it with our mix of As and Bs, the Bs really hasn\u2019t been moving out as much because they\u2019re not being tempted by the new developments. So that helped somewhat. I would tell you too that we\u2019ve done a better job of lengthening lease terms, few couple years ago our average lease was probably around 11 months and its gotten closer to 12 months and it doesn\u2019t sound like much. It will reduce the number of explorations you're going to have in a any given year by several percent that will help drive it down to. I think our turnover is going to continue at a low level. Our expectations right now is probably be pretty stable with where it was last year we continue to see build outs to home purchase slightly below long-term averages. And we don\u2019t see that picking back up and as far as exposure to new development properties we sell to lot of that last year we don\u2019t see a getting much worse.","Dan Oppenheim","In terms of the 10 year trends we're talking about that in terms of the new lease. How much of that is influenced most the regional mix of lease exploration in terms -- and January clearly would want to have few of those and some of the colder snowier markets. Is there any mix that you saw in terms of just how these aspirations are in January for some of the Northeast versus West Coast markets?","Tom Toomey","We work to keep it down pretty much on a national basis, because there is very few markets honestly where you are going to do better in January. California I will tell you, you want heavier concentrations in the middle two quarters. So it's going to hurt you almost as much as it does place like Boston. So I don\u2019t think there is a significant differentiation across the portfolio, I would tell you though that first in fourth quarter we like to keep our explorations down to about 21% per home account in each of those quarters. And then it gets up into third quarter high as the low to mid 30s.","Operator","Next to Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill. Ryan Peterson your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.","Ryan Peterson","Just back to your outlook on dispositions, given the pricing on Gables recently are you encouraged to sell more of your Sun Belt assets?","Tom Toomey","This is Toomey. I think we'll keep with the discipline that\u2019s worked for us for so many years. We're exposed a lot to the market; we'll see where pricing comes in, the certainty around the buyer and execute accordingly. So I think it always gives us a boarder perspective of the cost of selling assets and we'll continue to do that. I don\u2019t think there is any particular focus on market or an asset I think, we have them ranked, we list them all we'll see where they come.","Ryan Peterson","And then just one other quick question. Can you discuss all the hurdles that you have on the Wilshire development to kind of recoup with the impairment that you took there.","Tom Toomey","We likely said if we meet certain return thresholds on that, we will back the 2.2 million. But we have a partner involved here, so we're not going to disclose those details.","Operator","We'll take our next question from William Kuo with Cowen and Company.","William Kuo","Just on View 34, I was wondering if you could talk about that look like the completion day was pushed back two quarters.","Harry Alcock","William this is Harry. I'll talk; it really was a function of the final element in the building is completing the roof top. We had a few delays in the permitting last summer and just decided intentionally to push the completion of that piece of the project into 2015 which will allow us to complete the balance of the project and give the tenants a rest, this thing's been under construction for two plus years. So we expect to start that here sometime in the next 30 to 45 days and complete it in the second quarter.","William Kuo","And then just a follow up on Texas on Page 14 of the outlook it looks sub 3.5% revenue growth for '15 which is a bit of deceleration from 4Q. Is that a bit of conservative built in there? Or that\u2019s kind of what you guys are seeing on the ground in terms of renewals and new leases that you're getting.","Jerry Davis","This is Jerry. I don\u2019t its conservatism, I'll tell we are feeling the effects of new supply that has hit Austin especially hard over the last year, 1.5 years. We were able to avoid it for the most part last year. But I would remind you we have a small portfolio there, so four same-store assets, one of them is surrounded by new supply and it's definitely feeling it a couple of them are B assets that even there is new supply they paired well last year but they're is starting to feel it. And then one is a B plus product, it's close to the South Lamar project that have been coming up just South of Downtown Austin and it's feeling it.","So I probably feel a little better today about Dallas honestly from my portfolio then I do Austin, we've had a good start to the year in Dallas. But Austin is a bit concerning. Now I would tell you they've been good strong markets for the last couple of years but even absent anything from oil new supply is affecting our portfolio there.","William Kuo","Just finally in light of the kind of cost saving initiatives you guys have been doing. I was wondering if you could comment on the differential between the expense growth in the same-store portfolio and in the JV portfolio. Is there something different there or you just aren't able to kind of roll these initiatives into the JV?","Tom Toomey","When you look at it our JV full year the expense growth has been about 5.7%, that's for the MetLife and that compares to our 2.5%. The bigger component honestly this is, I mean real-estate taxes. They comprise over 30%, 33% in both pools and you are just seeing more pressure in some of the markets where the JVs are. In addition it could be that last year and I don't have the details of top of my head, sometimes it's affected by tax refunds, it is tax rates and valuations but it's predominantly taxes.","Operator","We will take our last question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste","A couple of quick ones here for you guys. So curious looking at your portfolio map, we've talked a bit in the past about your warehouse markets. And just going through the list here of some of those markets, looks like you have maybe about a billion or so depending on what cap rate sort of assumption people use of what I deem sort of non long-term warehouse type assets. Curious in terms of your near-term contemplated asset sales, I am assuming the majority of these the sales are in those sort of warehouse markets. And then as a follow-on, why not accelerate the asset sales in those markets a bit given the rising supply, hearing from the home builders that they are picking up their starts and given the strong asset pricing in those markets?","Tom Herzog","Well just in general I will start and if Tom wants to add something. Let's talk about capital warehouse for a minute. So we've got certain non-core assets and capital market warehouse assets. In the capital warehouse markets I think for the past year or so we've made it pretty clear or a bit longer than that that these are markets that right now are most of them are doing pretty well, we're not in rush to liquidate those assets and some of them are actually producing some pretty strong returns and we don't think we've exhausted their value creation potential.","So when we look at and I think I am repeating a little bit what I said earlier or what Tom said earlier that when you look at the 2014 sales there was a diverse mix, some out of Norfolk non-core, some out of Florida that's capital warehouse we have couple of assets that we pruned out of Seattle and one of San Diego just as an example. So we will choose the assets that we feel that have exhausted the value creation potential and from time to time those will also be non-core capital warehouse. That's where we're with that Haendel, Tom anything you would add to that.","Tom Toomey","I think a couple of points to add Haendel and thanks for the question. First I think every company has a certain pool of assets, they are below average and probably over a long-term will liquidate. We've elected to kind of identify what that proposed markets to help our shareholders understand where we are going to be strategically. We've never put a timeline on it, we think it's an economic decision and in that context as long as we're executing our strategies and making good economic decisions we will arrive at that date sometime in the future and be happy with the result. So if it comes along and the world changes economically or asset values materially change one way or another, then I think we could think about acceleration. But right now we're happy with the pace, the redeployment of capital and driving long-term cash flow growth.","Haendel St. Juste","And while I have you just curious on the decision to pare back the three year outlook to two years but certainly it was well received implemented a few years back, clients so far certainly appreciate the view on your look on how you would be running your business or expectations over the next couple of years. I now there is probably not a lot of certainly or maybe valuing then guiding the third year, but it did provide a bit of comfort to some folks. Just curious how you sort of balance those considerations when you guys were contemplating cutting back the three year to a two year plan?","Tom Herzog","Haendel it's Herzog here again. During the last year I and others on the team here had opportunity to speak to numerous investors and one of the things that we heard from investors is there was a lot less value to that third than there was certainly the second year. And because the numbers just get fussier the further out you go. And there were also comments made that by providing the second year it gave more clarity to what those numbers are rather than blending them with the third year. So we asked a variety of different investors how they felt about it and the majority said you know what we would prefer a two year plan, and so with that we moved to a two year plan accordingly. And we don't think we lose a whole lot of -- it provides you more clarity as to why we\u2019re thinking about 2016 and so we see some benefit in that and certainly our investors let us know that they felt the same way.","Haendel St. Juste","Appreciate that, and last one I don't know you guys mentioned or, would you be able to mention just curious on the Met benefit, Met impact to your same-store pool of the new entrance of pool this year, the new assets? The new entrance into your same-store pool just curious as to what benefit they might have on your same-store revenue for full year '15?","Tom Toomey","Yes, Haendel its probably fairly muted it\u2019s really just two properties that are coming in, residences of Bella Terra and Huntington Beach and in Capital View in Washington, D.C. So the volume of additions is very small and when you look at those two markets they probably blend down to about where the mid-point of our guidance is.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I\u2019d now turn the call back over to our moderator Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you for your time today and certainly your questions. In closing, we\u2019re happy with 2014 and certainly the progress we made against our long-term plans. As we look at 2015 it\u2019s off to a great start and I repeat a great start. We see a long runway for growth in the company and for the business and so we\u2019re very excited about the prospects not just '15 but beyond that. And we know we\u2019re going to see many of you in the conference seasoned as it unfolds, certainly don\u2019t hesitate to reach out and talk to the team about what our progress is.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, July 30, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens. Please go ahead.","Christopher G. Van Ens","Thank you for joining us for UDR's Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call.","Our second quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed earlier today and posted to our website, www.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.","A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in this morning's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","[Operator Instructions] Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas W. Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to UDR's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","I will cover 4 topics today: first, our quarterly performance and recent guidance grade; second, multifamily fundamentals; third, our expanding relationship with MetLife; and lastly, the continued execution of our 3-year strategic plan.","The second quarter was strong across all aspects of our business. Both earnings per share and operations outperformed versus our expectations, as well as we completed a number of transactions and finances. As a result, we raised earnings per share and same-store guidance into late June. Herzog and Jerry will provide more details on their prepared remarks on the quarter and the recent guidance increase. All in, we were very pleased with the first half of 2013 and the way it played out and look forward to more of the same for the balance of 2013.","Nationally, multifamily fundamentals remain healthy. Demand continues to be driven by improving employment and positive demographics. New multifamily supply have increased from the trough as expected, but permitting trends now appear to be leveling off. In the vast majority of UDR's markets, demand and supply dynamics appear favorable, with 21 of our 23 markets expected to create at least 5 jobs for every new apartment home over the next 3 years.","The national single-family market has also improved from its recessionary lows, albeit with some support from institutional investors. UDR's markets remain more sheltered than most from this improvement given the relative unaffordability and higher-propensity rent. In our coastal markets, the recent increase in interest rates in conjunction with the rising single-family home prices has significantly increased down payment requirements and monthly mortgage payments. As a result, our move-out to home purchases remain favorable at 13.4% in the quarter, still well below UDR's 15% long-term average.","Given the recent rise in interest rates, numerous market participants have asked us how the potential future increases might impact apartment values. First, there remains significant investor interest in multifamily space, especially on the coast for high-quality assets. NOI continues to grow at an above-average rate, both good signs for near-term stability and valuations. Offsetting this, in part, is the recent rise in interest rates, which could negatively impact cap rates. Higher quality urban assets are less likely to be affected, but there have not been enough trades to form a definitive conclusion.","Under the assumption that any further increase in interest rates is driven by a strengthening economy, apartment cash flows and related values prove resilient over the long term and fare better than most of the property sectors given: A, their short-term lease duration; and B, the related impact of homeownership cost increases.","So does the evolving interest rate landscape change our capital deployment strategy? The short answer is no. We anticipated that rates would increase in our 3-year plan, and we continue to see good opportunities in our targeted submarkets and above-average profit margins for development and redevelopment. Should this change, we will revisit our strategy.","Next, a few comments on our expanding relationship with MetLife. In late June, we announced 2 separate transactions. First, the formation of an operating development partnership for a significant portion of our Vitruvian Park master plan communities located in North Dallas. And second, a swapping of ownership interest in certain UDR\/MetLife I JV assets that increased our ownership to 50% in 2 high-quality, high-rise communities located in Denver and San Diego.","We are excited to be expanding our relationship with MetLife. They're a partner we are very familiar with, and they are committed to the multifamily space and can co-invest in all aspects of the apartment business.","Finally, an update on our 3-year strategic plan. Feedback from market participants continues to be universally positive. Now 2 quarters in, operating and cash flow growth are ahead of plan, and we continue to expect significant growth and value accretion from our development and redevelopment platforms.","Herzog and Jerry will provide you with more details on these transactions and activities in their prepared remarks. Our team remains highly focused on executing the 3-year strategic plan, which we continue to believe will drive strong NAV and cash flow per share growth in the future","With that, I will pass the call over to Tom Herzog.","Thomas M. Herzog","Thanks, Tom. There are a number of topics I will cover today. First, our second quarter results; second, a balance sheet update; third, an overview of our recently announced transactions with MetLife; fourth, an update on insurance recoveries from Hurricane Sandy; fifth, a reiteration of how we look at development yields; and lastly, our third quarter and full year 2013 guidance. I'll begin with our second quarter results.","FFO per share was $0.37. After deducting a $0.01 benefit from Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries and taking into account the effects of rounding, FFO as adjusted per share was $0.35. The $0.01 of upside versus the midpoint of our previous FFO as adjusted guidance was primarily driven from better-than-expected same-store and non-same-store operations. Second quarter AFFO per share was $0.31 and benefited from a lower amount of CapEx spend anticipated during the quarter, which again was due to timing. We continue to target $1,020 in maintenance CapEx per home in 2013.","Turning now to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage on a historical cost basis was 39%. On a fair value basis, it was 29%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.9x following the recent closing of the Vitruvian Park transaction with MetLife. And we anticipate that it will remain near this level through year-end 2013 as non-income earning assets come online. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no remaining outstanding debt maturities in 2013.","Our improving balance sheet has not gone unnoticed. Recently, Moody's affirmed the company's credit rating of Baa2 and changed its outlook from stable to positive. We ended the quarter with $769 million of available liquidity through a combination of cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facilities.","Next, as Tom highlighted in his opening remarks, in late June, we announced 2 separate transactions with MetLife. The Vitruvian Park transaction included the formation of an operating partnership, which comprises of Savoye, Savoye II and Fiori communities, and a development partnership made up of 28.4 acres of land in the Vitruvian master plan. The operating partnership transacted at a weighted average NOI cap rate of approximately 5% and total transaction proceeds of approximately $200 million. Note that the 997 legacy Vitruvian Park homes, 13 million of its developable land and the freestanding commercial real estate on the site were not included in the partnership transaction.","The second MetLife transaction involved exchange of ownership interest in certain UDR\/MetLife I joint venture communities. We increased our ownership interest in 2 high-rise -- 2 high-quality high-rises located in Denver and San Diego from 15% to 50%. Both of which are in underallocated core markets. Now we relinquished our 10% ownership interest in 4 communities. Further details for both MetLife transactions are available on our second quarter earnings release filed this morning and in the transaction press release filed on June 25.","Moving on, an update on our insurance recoveries from Hurricane Sandy. Our original damage estimate of $28 million to $32 million remains intact. To date, we have recovered $20 million of the $24 million we have submitted for hurricane damages and business interruption losses.","Next, we expect to deliver approximately 39% of our development pipeline in the second half of 2013.","As we have had a few questions on how we calculate stabilized yields on development, I wanted to take a moment to explain the computation. Expected stabilized yields on development are calculated as: projected stabilized NOI, including the charge for management fees, divided by construction cost. The stabilization period for development projects is defined as: the full 12-month NOI commencing 1 year following the delivery of the final home of the project.","You may note that these definitions in Attachment 16 of our supplement have been enhanced but for clarification purposes only. The way in which we calculate such estimated yields remains unchanged. On a trended basis, the weighted average yield for our pipeline continues to be in the range of 6% to 6.5%.","On to 2013 guidance. In our release this morning, we increased our full year FFO per share guidance for $1.40 to $1.44 from a previous $1.39 to $1.43, so it reflects a $0.01 benefit from recently received Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries in excess of previously established receivables. As a reminder, we previously increased full year FFO per share, FFO as adjusted per share, AFFO per share and same-store guidance at the same time as our announcement of the MetLife transactions in late June. Our full year FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance estimates remain unchanged from our June increase, at $1.36 to $1.40 and $1.20 to $1.24, respectively. Our same-store guidance also remains unchanged from our June update with full year revenue expected to go at 4.5% to 5%, expenses at 2.75% to 3.25% and NOI at 5.25% to 6%. Other changes to various guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.","For the third quarter of 2013, we are providing guidance for both FFO and FFO as adjusted of $0.33 to $0.35 per share. AFFO guidance is $0.28 to $0.30 per share. Lastly, during the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.235 per share or $0.94 when annualized, our 163rd consecutive quarterly common dividend paid.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry A. Davis","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: second quarter operating results; I will also provide an update on our development lease-ups and redevelopment projects.","We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, same-store net operating income grew 6.8%, driven by a 5.2% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 1.6% increase in expenses. Real estate tax increases of almost 9% were offset by a reduction in repairs and maintenance expense, as well as lower marketing costs. Same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 5% year-over-year to $1,472 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.1% was 20 basis points higher year-over-year. On a total portfolio basis, including our pro rata share of joint ventures, our revenue per occupied home was $1,602 per month. Sequentially, second quarter net operating income increased by 2.7%, representing typical seasonality. This was driven by a 2% increase in revenue against expense growth of 40 basis points.","Turning to new and renewal lease rates. In the second quarter, effective rental rate increases on new leases at our same-store communities increased by 4.3% on average, and renewal rate growth remains strong at 5.4%. Specifically in New York, our communities that were impacted by Hurricane Sandy are fully back on track.","Annualized turnover in the second quarter decreased by 230 basis points year-over-year to 55.4%. I'll remind everyone that turnover is highly seasonal and peaks in the second and third quarters during the spring and summer leasing seasons. Rent as a percentage of our tenants' income held steady at roughly 17%, similar to where it has been over the past several -- past few years.","Next, our development and redevelopment programs, along with our same-store will drive our anticipated cash flow growth over the coming years. During the quarter, we've spent $133 million on development and redevelopment projects. I am pleased to report that our development lease-ups remain on plan and our redevelopments continue to command the rental rate increases we anticipated.","Some lease-up specifics. Our recently completed 255-home, $126 million Capitol View on 14th community in Washington, D.C., is currently 91% leased and 90% occupied. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan. Until the past month or so, we had experienced negligible impact from impending new supply in the U Street Corridor of D.C. However, competing product did begin to pre-lease during the quarter.","As Herzog indicated in his prepared remarks, Fiori at Vitruvian Park is now owned 50-50 in a partnership with MetLife. This 391-unit, $98 million project in North Dallas is currently 27% leased and 17% occupied.","Our 467-home, $150 million residences at Bella Terra development in Huntington Beach, California, is currently 50% leased and 31% occupied. The project is on budget, on schedule and leasing up well ahead of plan. To date, we have not had to offer any concessions on any of the leases.","Lastly, our 256-home, $65 million Domain College Park development, located across the street from the University of Maryland's business school, is currently 39% leased and 13% occupied. The project is on schedule, on budget and leasing up on plan.","Turning to our redevelopments. First, a recently completed 583-home, $36 million Westerly on Lincoln redevelopment in Marina del Rey, California. The renovated homes at this project averaged a 20% rental rate increase over pre-renovation rent over the life of the property, and demand remains strong for our upgrades. Currently, the property is 98% leased and 96% physically occupied.","Second, our 706-home, $60 million Rivergate redevelopment in Manhattan. As of quarter end, we have completed the redevelopment of 288 homes. On these homes, we have averaged a 13% rental rate increase. The property is currently 95% leased and 93% occupied.","Lastly, our 964-home, $75 million, 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde redevelopment is in Costa Mesa, California. As of quarter end, we have completed the redevelopment of 356 homes and we'd also built a 12,000-square-foot amenity building and a resort-style pool. On these homes, we have averaged a 25% rental rate increase. For those of you that have toured 27 Seventy Five, you understand that it's truly a transformational project.","With that, I'll open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jerry, I was wondering if you can follow-up on the expenses in the quarter and particularly we saw a pretty good decrease in R&M. I was curious if that was just kind of led to timing of items last year or if you're starting to see some of your technology initiatives take hold?","Jerry A. Davis","It's really a little of both. A little bit's timing from last year, but most of it is the technology and other initiatives we've been doing to make our service teams more efficient in the way they do their business. And by making them more efficient, they're then able to bring more of the third-party services that we've historically vended out in-house. Those include automation, we've given all of our service guys a handheld device now that they can receive service requests without having to come into the office. And secondly, they're able to do their timekeeping online instead of having to walk all the way back to the office to punch in and out for breaks and for lunch. Lastly, I would tell you we've really started managing our people to labor standards, comparing different people, telling them what the expectation is of how long each task should take and that's helped make them more efficient, too. So it's predominantly that.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just turning over to San Diego, you had some very impressive rent growth in the quarter there. I was just wondering if you're finally starting to see those job gains help apartment demand or is something else is going on during the quarter?","Jerry A. Davis","I think San Diego is picking up a bit, but our numbers are really inflated. We only have 2 properties on our same-store pool there, it's only about 300 units. But one of the properties on Oceanside is -- it has a tax-exempt bond that expired about 1.5 year on it. You have to wait 1 year after that to increase the rent on the 20% of the residents that really benefited from below-market rate units. So after we waited that 1-year period really to bring those 20% up to market, that's probably driven the outsize growth a little bit more than improvement in the market. But the market has...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What are you seeing in terms all-in rates for unsecured debt and how has that changed over the past few months with the increasing rates?","Warren L. Troupe","Nick, this is Warren. I think our all-in rates on our -- on the tenure, we're looking right about kind of a 4.2% to 4.4% range. Spreads have tightened a little bit. We're in the 160 to -- 150 to 160 range, and obviously the tenure has gone up and down over the last month or so.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, I guess a bigger-picture question. How do you balance the attractiveness of JV capital against the additional complexities associated with the partnerships?","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, I mean, when we think about joint venture capital, there are a variety of different benefits. For one, at times it could be trading at a price that's different from your NAV. And that provides an opportunity for bringing in funds at a cost-effective rate. Another is, it gives you the opportunity to tackle bigger deals by bringing -- and I'm assuming you're talking specifically about us, the deals that we did with MetLife. And with them we've got a long-term investor that is interested in multifamily. They like development. We have a long history with them. They prefer lower leverage. From our perspective, it also provides a good source of fees. So as I think about the size of the program and at what point it becomes too big, certainly, at a $500-or-so million equity investment in JVs, and call that $1 billion or so of real estate, against the $13 billion asset base for the company, we think it's still relatively very much in line and not too large at all. We consider it a net plus.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have a couple of general questions. Tom, in particular when you talk about the focus on urban concentrations I kind of understand the -- why they're compelling from a rank-growth perspective and sort of a -- in a kind of defensive positioning. Do you grow concerned that at some point there can be a liability on the urban locations relative to move-out rates because of the particulars of demographics you're targeting?","Thomas W. Toomey","It's a fair question. I guess, time will yield an answer that we can look back on. Our view would be is that the urban setting, if you look at most demographic studies, this is where that 20- to 35-year-old age cohort is moving to the secured jobs and be around that lifestyle that they want. And I suspect that they're going to be renters for a longer period of time in that urban setting. If you specifically look at our market mix, you can see we've diversified across both coasts on an urban platform, if you will; trying to insulate against economic's ups and downs, but focusing on submarkets with a higher propensity to rent and a higher income bracket. We think that combination of characteristics over the long term will enable us to grow cash flow, grow NAV and deliver better returns that are available in the marketplace or what would be available in a boom-bust-type portfolio in a suburban setting.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Given that focus, and I know you -- this has been a particular strategy for the company for some time, do you guys experiment at all with adding services to those particular sites where you have that target demographic and concentration? Outside of the sort of standard cable and whatnot, is there a way to sort of package a real sort of secondary fee stream for these tenants given the preferences of that demographic?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, David, this is Jerry. We've looked a little bit into that. Most of these properties will have concierge-type services, a doorman, at several of the properties especially the ones we have in the MetLife joint venture. We have valet parking services. We have started to experiment a bit with offering other types of concierge-type services to better accommodate our resident base and really sell them time that we can do some of their personal errands for them. We're really in the beginning stages of that. But we are finding with that higher-end demographic, probably not some of those urban guys that are more working class, but at the higher end, I think they do value their time and have excess funds and they would appreciate that. So we are looking into it.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, and I apologize if I missed this, but did you guys talk about the specifics to the Texas market today? Seems to be growing concerns about supply. Some of the numbers look a little softer on a year-over-year basis. What are your views on the Texas markets for the next 6 to 12 months?","Jerry A. Davis","Well, this is Jerry again. Texas right now is holding up. It decelerated slightly from 1Q to 2Q. We operate in Dallas, both in up to North Dallas, Plano, as well as Addison and in uptown. And right now, supply is becoming an issue especially in uptown, a little bit up north, but job growth to date has been able to offset it. As we look over the next couple of years, we do anticipate job growth of at least 5:1 to new developments. So it probably won't be able to sustain the 7% to 10% year-over-year [indiscernible] in the last year or 2, but I still think it's going to be strong. I don't see it getting overbuilt. I think Austin, you're also seeing very high job growth, especially in the tech sectors. Apple's doubling their workforce, Samsung has built a $4 billion plant expansion there. There is a lot of new supply, as everybody knows, coming into Austin. Most of our properties are in the direct line of it. When you really go tour that downtown area, a lot of it is -- a lot of the new supplies coming up down on the South Lamar Street corridor. But when you're downtown, where our joint venture with MetLife at Ashton Austin is. We probably have the nicest product in town and we're not seeing a lot of competition there. And our other product in Dallas is more the B, B+ grade, and we're not competing directly with the new product.","Thomas W. Toomey","Yes, it's Tom Toomey. I might add that just -- I think it's your typical cycle in Texas, which is you've got a very good run up in rents. There was not much supply. And what's happened recently is move-out of homeownership is going to kick in a little bit and supply. But for us, in our view in the long-term basis, Dallas and Austin are both great cities for job machines. There is where the economy is going to continue to prosper across many different employment basis. And so I think it's still a very good long-term market. It's just going through one of those minor adjustment periods and we'll probably see a good '14 out of it, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","While we're on Texas, can you remind us when does the window for the debt repayment on the Texas JV open up? And what's the current thinking about what you guys are going to do with that?","Warren L. Troupe","This is Warren. The window, it opens in December 2014. I think we would discuss that with our partner both [indiscernible].","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Tom. What's the thought on the development pipeline now in terms of new starts? I mean, you're sitting here the 6, 6.5 yield on the current pipeline. When you take a look at the next projects in the queue, where are the -- given rising construction costs and financing costs, et cetera, where's the return sort of penciling out if you guys wanted to start those today? And what do you think you're starting between now and the end of the year?","Harry G. Alcock","Rob, this is Harry. We don't expect any additional starts in 2013. And if you look on Attachment 11, you can see that we have several land sites in our portfolio, both wholly-owned and in MetLife, many of which will be used to backdoor existing pipeline. We're actively working for the design and approval processes and would expect to start number of new projects in 2014. But remember costs are rising, but rents are also rising. We won't start a project unless we achieve a meaningful spread over market cap rates, at least 100 basis points on an untrended basis. So it's really -- it's asset-specific. The -- and the spread between the expected yield versus the expected market cap rate is something we look at closely. Today's spreads are relatively high. We think we have a little bit of cushion, but we will underwrite each of these assets before we start construction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a few quick questions here. First, and maybe I'm just not really good at math and maybe I'm just missing a few things, but if you -- if we look at the MetLife JV, its $290 million is gross. And it looks like if you stabilize the -- forgive my pronunciation, Fiori deal? It looks like there's about $8.6 million of NOI coming off of that on an annualized basis, which would imply sort of a 3 cap. But if we used the 5 cap that's cited, that says that the development portion of that JV was valued at about $120 million. So $172 million for the 3 assets and $120 million for the development. Can you just walk through like what I may be missing in these calculations, or is that, in fact, the right way to look at it?","Thomas M. Herzog","This is Herzog. Alex, your math -- there are a lot of numbers flying around there. But I do get your point, is that you're looking at what the cap rate was in the MetLife I transaction when we completed it and what does it look like today based on some of the transactions that are taking place. I guess I would describe it this way. The transactions that have been taking place have been swapped transactions, so that we and our MetLife partner could both increase our ownership and assets that fit our individual portfolio needs. And it really -- the whole transaction was more than a collection of assets. It really involved more the relationship, the options that were in place, development potential, et cetera. So as we look at the overall transaction, there's a lot more going on than just that. But as to the specific detail of what you're looking at on the cap rate, I'd have to look at the detail to see what you're referencing.","Warren L. Troupe","This is Warren. I think when you look at that deal, that deal was structured as a portfolio trade rather than disposition of individual assets. And they have their own specific allocation requirements and we are pretty much ambivalent. So when we look at it, it was just a $290 million trade.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Right, but you guys cited a 5 cap. So I'm just curious, the 5 cap would imply the part of the Vitruvian, those 3 assets, were value at $172 million. I just want to make sure, is that math right or am I missing something?","Harry G. Alcock","Alex, this is Harry. I'd have to look at your math, but Fiori is still a lease up. So my guess is you're looking in a non-stabilized revenue stream with a -- and applying a cap rate to that. If you apply a stabilized NOI to Fiori you'll get a number that's meaningfully higher than that.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. We can go offline. I was using a stabilized, but we can go offline. The second thing is just looking at the back half of the guidance, you guys have done 6.4% year-to-date, but your full year NOI guidance is 5% to 6%. So where in the portfolio are you expecting more of the slowdown that's going to bring the NOI down for the back half the year?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes. I'll take that, Alex, this is Jerry. Really let's look at it in 2 pieces. First, revenue. Through the first half the year, we've had results of 5.2% growth. So to get to the midpoint -- or the high point of our guidance, which is 5%, that means the second half would need to come in at about 4.8%. I can tell you based on what we're seeing today, what we expect to see the rest of the year, we're comfortable with that guidance. Our expectation is revenue will be near the high end. When you look at the expense side, year-to-date through June, we're at 2.6%. And to get to the midpoint of 3%, we need to average 3.4% in the second half of the year. I'd say we have 2 factors that could get us there. One, real estate taxes continue to be somewhat of an unknown. We've gotten valuations in on about half of our portfolio, but we still don't have them in for California or Florida, which make up 40% to 50%. And the second is we had a pretty favorable -- difficult comps in the second half of last year to compare to. So when you really see what could drive it, the biggest unknown right now is still real estate taxes.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But isn't -- California is Prop 13, so why would the real estate tax be unknown?","Jerry A. Davis","It is Prop 13 but there's still the potential that some of our Prop 8 adjustments that we had in prior years haven't totally been factored in.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So if I heard you correctly, the downside to NOI in the back half is more expense related not revenue related?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, I think so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just given that we're halfway through the year, can you give us an update on where you stand with the remaining dispositions in your guidance?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, we've got about $100 million of dispositions remaining. So that's where we're at in the second half. We have the $145 million or so with the Tribune [ph] transaction and then there's another $100 million on top of that.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Are those actively being marketed or...","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, we're in progress on a number of fronts and feel good about that number.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So that would be like a fourth quarter closing and kind of expected?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, that's probably either late third or probably early fourth quarter.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question for Jerry, did you give July leasing trends? And also in previous calls you've given a loss -- a gain or loss lease statistic. Can you give us where that is for the portfolio? And then curious where the D.C. market is on that?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, I can give you parts of that. I'll probably get the D.C. part later, I don't have that with me but in a follow-up, I'll give you that offline. Loss to lease as of the end of the quarter was about 4% for the portfolio. And as far as leasing trends through today, for the month of July, new leases are up about 4.3% to 4.4%. Reno [ph] was up probably right at that 5%, 6% level. And as of today, our physical occupancy in the same-store portfolio is 96.3%.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up to that, if I may. Also on the guidance, if you look at the run rate for the first half of the year in G&A versus the back half, seems like there's a pretty substantial increase in G&A in the back half of the year. Could you talk about what's going to drive that?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, there were a couple of different things, Mike. Part of it is just timing items such as personnel, health care, legal costs, costs associated with software development, et cetera. And the other part of it is due to timing on incentive comp-type programs, just based on the way that the accounting works. Because the program was set up in February, there's no expense in the first month, for instance. And then certain components of it will be more heavily loaded in the second half of the year. So from a G&A perspective, it's still relatively just timing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So, Jerry, I guess just a quick follow-up question on expenses. Can you talk about the 9% year-over-year real estate tax growth? How did that compare expectations? And where do you see the most pressure across your portfolio for conversations that are underway today outside of -- was it California and Florida?","Jerry A. Davis","It's roughly at expectations. We were right up around that 9% level in our budgets this year, so no huge changes yet. But like I said, we still haven't heard about California and Florida. I think Florida probably is where most of the conversation will come. We've already talked to Texas, Virginia, places like that. But I think most of it's going to come in Florida.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. And another one for Warren or Tom. On the new MetLife Vitruvian JV, the one with the Savoye and Fiori assets, can you discuss generally the nature and scope of fees from the JV? And also the long-term return required to hit and to promote there?","Warren L. Troupe","Yes, Haendel, this is Warren. In terms of the fees, it's structured pretty much like our existing one on MetLife II. There's a property management fee, there's a financing fee or pretty much market. As we do development, there will be development asset management fees. In terms of promote, there's not a promote structure in that. It's a 50-50 JV.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And one more related to that. Can you discuss timing early thoughts for the other -- in the press release, the other 2,500 homes and 50,000 square feet of retails you plan to build out?","Warren L. Troupe","I'll start and let Harry really address that. We're in active discussions right now with MetLife over the future development of Vitruvian. And I will tell you they're very excited about developing that and making our master plan come fruition.","Harry G. Alcock","Yes. Haendel, this is Harry. In addition to talking to MetLife, we are beginning the design and planning process for the next phase. When that comes to fruition, I don't know. It'll be our first development deal with Met, so we're sort of testing each other out a little bit as we work through the planning process.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So just comparing your guidance for the year to the 3-year plan that you had laid out. It appears as though with the stock trading at a discounted NAV, you've been able to remove your equity needs for 2013, and in doing so, have increased dispositions, cut back a little bit on development spending and redev spending. If the discount persists into 2014 and '15, is this the playbook that we should look for you to follow in terms of a deviation from the 3-year plan?","Thomas M. Herzog","As far as the adjustment to the guidance as a result of the Vitruvian transaction, we did bring enough cash to remove the equity issuance that we had previously included. If our price went back up above NAV, we still could raise some of that equity. As far as cutting the development or redevelopment though, that had nothing to do with the current conditions. That's just been the timing of the spend that we've had within the programs. So as I look forward into 2014 and 2015, there's really nothing that's changed in our plan relative to the Vitruvian or market conditions at this point.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Right. But, Tom, if you go through 2014 and '15 and the stock's at a discount over that time frame, looking at the, I think, would be $350 million to $450 million of equity issuance in your 3-year plan, what are the levers -- could you just talk through the levers that you'd pull to offset that?","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, one of the big ones is we still have about $400 million of non-core assets that could be utilized to create some funding. We have some warehouse assets of a much larger size that could be utilized, that we're in no hurry to liquidate, but that stands as a possibility. So again, as we look forward, we've got a number of different sources of funding that could be brought in. Equity, it could be debt, it could be joint ventures, and of course, the sales of noncore-type assets. So -- and on top of that, we've got, not that we would intend to use it, but in a shorter term, we still do have a sizable amount of capacity on our revolver. So there's a lot of different funding that we could use as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. Please continue with any closing comments.","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, thank you, all of you for taking the time this morning or this afternoon. And certainly, we feel good about the business, feel good about our 3-year strategic plan and the execution of it. And we're seeing good, strong fundamentals in the business. And we see that continuing for some long period of time and are enjoying the benefits of it, and you'll see us continue to focus on execution.

[Operator Instructions]. ","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas Toomey","Thank you, Chris and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to UDR's Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers Warren Troupe, Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. ","My comments today will be brief, highlighted by an update on apartment fundamentals and a broader overview of our business performance. First, macro apartment fundamentals. At the outset of the year, we anticipated relatively stable apartment demand in 2017. That is the continuation of 150,000 to 200,000 national job additions each month and wage growth in the 2.5% to 3% range. Year-to-date, both metrics are in line of these initial forecasts, with monthly job creation averaging 180,000 and wage growth of 2.6%. Additional key drivers such as household formation, propensity to rent and demographics also remain supportive of our businesses. In short, apartment demand drivers are performing as expected. ","Moving on to supply. We began 2017 expecting apartment deliveries to peak around the middle of the year and then steadily decline through the end of 2018. While the aggregate 2017-'18 new apartment supply picture remains intact, our latest third-party data in conversations with large merchant builders indicate that 2017 deliveries continue to slip into 2018 due to tight construction labor market which is contributing to an average delay of 3 to 6 months. This trend will likely continue, resulting in 2018 deliveries more on par with those of 2017. While these are national numbers, we operate in individual markets which Jerry will address further in his prepared remarks. ","Moving forward, we still expect that apartment starts will begin to decline given ongoing cost increases, labor shortages and construction financing limitations. The latter of which continues to create opportunities to accretively invest through our Developer Capital Program.","Next, with this positive backdrop in mind, our team, again, produced solid results in the second quarter. Driven by our diversified portfolio and long-lived, high-margin operating initiatives that continue to boost revenues and constrain expense growth. Importantly, these initiatives are sustainable and will contribute significantly to our NOI growth for years to come. ","In total, 2017 feels decidedly better than 2016 did at this point in the year. Putting this altogether, we raised our full year of 2017 same-store and earnings guidance. The drivers of which were strong operations, accretive financing activities and continued investment in our Developer Capital Program. Longer term, we remain confident that we have the right portfolio, platform and team in place to continue to effectively execute our strategic outlook and generate strong earnings, NAV and dividend per share growth over the full cycle. ","With that, I will turn it over to Jerry to address operations.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. Year-over-year, second quarter same-store revenue and NOI growth were 3.9% and 4.2%, respectively. After including pro rata same-store JV communities which are heavily weighted towards urban A+ product, revenue and NOI growth was 3.6% and 4.2%, respectively. In total, 2017 is progressing a little better than expected. ","During the quarter, our operating strategy focused on, one, pivoting to capture an increased number of higher rate growth renewals; two, maintain portfolio occupancy in the high 96% range; and three, continuing to capitalize on our long-lived broad-based operating initiatives. We were successful in these endeavors as demonstrated by the following. Quarterly renewal growth remained strong at 5% and our corporate level renewals team, coupled with improved reputation management, helped to drive quarterly and year-to-date annualized turnover, down by 180 and 130 basis points, respectively. Second quarter same-store occupancy of 96.8% increased by 10 basis points on a sequential basis and by 40 basis points year-over-year and our operating initiatives contributed significantly to our year-over-year quarterly same-store NOI growth. ","Other income which makes up almost 10% of our total revenue, grew by 9% in the quarter, fueled primarily by our parking and shorter term furnished rental initiatives. These two multiyear initiatives contributed over half of our other income growth and should continue to grow at rates in excess of our unexpected rent growth for the next couple of years. ","These continued successes allowed us to modestly increase full year 2017 same-store revenue and NOI growth guidance despite recent market rent growth flattening out a bit earlier than initially forecast. Importantly, overall leasing trends in 2017 have stabilized versus 2016, as evidenced by a 25% year-over-year decline in our concession and gift cards spend during the quarter. Moving forward, we expect that our results will continue to compare favorably versus the market and peers. ","Next, similar to years passed, we see minimal pressure from move-outs to home purchase or affordability which totaled 13% and 6%, respectively, during second quarter. Likewise, net bad debt remains low and at levels consistent with previous quarters. ","On to expenses. We continue to feel pressure from real estate tax increases and personnel costs. You may remember that we were impacted by a large upward adjustment in taxes paid at our channel at Mission Bay property in San Francisco during the second quarter of 2016, a portion of which reversed in the third quarter of 2016. This drove the relatively low 4% year-over-year growth in real estate tax as we realized during the second quarter of this year. We continue to expect that full year real estate taxes will grow by high single digits.","On the personnel front, wage pressures continue to intensify, as does demand for our people. We're actively combating the impact of these forces by additional technological and corporate level solutions that yield greater productivity at our communities.","On to a brief market update. First, Seattle, San Francisco and the Monterey Peninsula continue to outperform versus initial 2017 expectations. Most of these markets will feel the impact of new supply throughout 2017 and potentially into 2018, but demand remains resilient. ","Next, Washington, D.C. and Orange County are generating results marginally below initial expectations, although still within original ranges. Weaker job growth and concentrated apartment deliveries are restraining new lease rates to a degree. Our 2017 revenue growth in these markets is still forecast to be good, but not quite as strong as what we had forecast coming into the year. Our remaining markets are generally in line with expectations. ","Next, our development lease-ups continue to perform well as the concessionary environment has rationalized somewhat in 2017. In aggregate, our pipeline is generating lease rates and leasing velocities above original expectations. Community-specific quarter end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 of our supplement. ","Last, summing it up, second quarter was a good quarter as our operating platform and diversified portfolio continued to drive strong results in our modest increase in same-store guidance. We remain highly confident in our ability to execute through the remainder of 2017.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Jerry. The [indiscernible] that I will cover today include our second quarter results and forward guidance, a transactions update and a balance sheet and capital markets update. Our second quarter earnings results came in at the mid- to high end of our previously provided guidance ranges. ","FFO per share was $0.45, FFO as adjusted per share was $0.47 and AFFO per share was $0.43. On a year-over-year basis, AFFO was up $0.02 or 5%, driven by $0.02 from same-store performance, $0.02 from developments and acquisitions and offset by $0.02 of disposition-related dilution and corporate activities. I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 of our supplement which details our latest guidance expectations. ","Full year 2017 FFO per share guidance was reaffirmed at $1.83 to $1.87. FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were increased to $1.84 to $1.88 and $1.69 to $1.73, respectively. Primary drivers of the increases include better-than-expected operational growth, increased investment in our Developer Capital Program and accretive capital markets transactions.","Our full year same store revenue growth guidance was raised to 3.25% to 4%, expense growth was reaffirmed at 2.5% to 3.5% and NOI growth was increased to 3.5% to 4.25%. Average 2017 forecasted occupancy was reaffirmed at 96.7%. ","For the third quarter, our guidance ranges are $0.46 to $0.47 for FFO and FFO as adjusted and $0.42 to $0.43 for AFFO. ","Next, transactions. As a reminder, the overall goal of our Developer Capital Program is to take advantage of the opportunity provided us by the ongoing disruption in the construction lending market. We do this by investing in third-party development project that give us direct or indirect access to the real estate through a buy, hold or sell, while also generating risk-adjusted returns that slide in between a stabilized acquisition and an on-balance sheet development. ","During the quarter, we added 3 investments to our Developer Capital Program with an initial capital outlay of $33 million and a total funding commitment of $79 million. This increased the size of the program to $261 million at quarter end which is at the upper end of our targeted range. As we have previously communicated, we exposed 3 DCP assets to the market during the second quarter and expected a variety of outcomes depending on where market pricing came in. For the 2 West Coast JV communities, it is likely that we'd sell one and hold the other with our partner. Steele Creek is still in the market and its future will be decided once we see final pricing in the third quarter.","As it relates to future options on West Coast development joint venture communities, we will evaluate the economics of each of the investments during their relevant option windows. Holistically, you can expect it as we harvest accretive capital from DCP sales, a portion of the proceeds will be reinvested into similar types of value-accretive structures as you saw this quarter. Please see attachments 12B and 13 of our supplement for further details.","Next, balance sheet and capital markets. As we entered 2017, we identified several improvements to our balance sheet that we could execute on. These included further on encumbering our asset pool, decreasing our outstanding floating rate debt and reducing 2018 maturity risk. The combination of our $300 million, 3.5% 10-year unsecured debt issuance during the second quarter and our proactive debt prepayments throughout the first half of 2017 achieve these goals. And importantly, we're MPV and cash flow positive.","Prepayment cost on the $177 million of debt we retired during 2Q totaled $4.3 million. On the JV front, we refinanced 399 Fremont's construction loan into a $197 million, 3.5% secured fixed-rate loan with a 10-year term and we refinanced $135 million of 4.6% pooled debt, securing 2 UDR\/MetLife communities and a 2 separate 7-year secured loans with 3.25% rates. ","With regard to our $500 million commercial paper facility, $240 million was outstanding as of the end of the second quarter at a weighted average rate of 1.49% or LIBOR plus 27 basis points. We remain pleased with the pricing and liquidity of this facility.","At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity net of the commercial paper balance, was $896 million. Our financial leverage was 33.3% on an undepreciated book value, 23.9% on enterprise value and 28.5% inclusive of joint ventures. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x and inclusive of joint ventures, was 6.4x. Timing will drive some variability in our quarterly credit metrics, but in total, they are tracking in line with our strategic outlook.","Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.31 in the second quarter or $1.24 per share when annualized, representing a yield of approximately 3.2% as of quarter end.","With that, I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph","I appreciate the color on the supply commentary for 2017 and 2018. Just wondering if you think that part of the outperformance year-to-date in terms of same-store revenue in the guidance raise maybe comes at the expense of 2018 same-store revenue, at least relative to what you put into the 2-year plan.","Jerry Davis","Nick, this is Jerry. I'll take that up. When you look at the 2-year plan, none of the drivers in our assumptions for the cumulative 2-year period have really changed. And I would say just right now, it's probably too early to talk about 2018.","Nicholas Joseph","And then just -- sorry, go ahead.","Jerry Davis","I was going to say the slippage, we definitely need to see a little bit of slippage from first half into second half. As we entered the year, we saw about 55% of deliveries were going to be first half and today, it looks like it was about 44%. Now take into account there's typical slippage at all times, so you could see a little bit of that slippage slide a little bit, as you stated, from the back half of '17 and to early '18.","Nicholas Joseph","And then just for New York specifically, it looks like same-store revenue decreased from the first quarter which is one of just 2 markets along with Austin. So just wondering if you could provide some color on what you're seeing in New York and then how much of an impact are you feeling from the lease-up with the Copper building next to View 34.","Jerry Davis","Sure. A big part of that was, when you look at it, rents, obviously, each of the successive quarters that build up your revenue growth has been going down in New York. So it's a drop-off that we expected to see, somewhat was on the fee side. We continue to have good occupancy in New York, as you can see in the supplement. But it is down a bit from first quarter. We were running very hot in the first quarter of '17 at 98% and the second quarter's 97.3%, so we lost about 70 basis points there. The rest of it was pretty much on, again, the buildup of the rents. Our expectation, we've said this in the first quarter, that we didn't expect to see New York continue to put up 4% revenue growth as it did in the first quarter. That's an easier comp. Our expectation was it would be somewhere in the 2% to 3% range.","We're still comfortable with that as the -- for the full year. And as talking about the Copper building which is right next to View 34, it is in lease-up. They've begun leasing some of the higher floored units which are more expensive. And when I talk to my team in the field, they continue to say they're not feeling much of an impact from the Copper building right now just because the average price per unit for the rents is quite a bit higher. I'm sorry, the floor plan, Nick, is very different. Copper building has quite a few smaller units. Our building has predominantly larger units that are more conducive to multiple roommates.","Nicholas Joseph","And when you think about competition with it, from a net effective rate perspective, are they offering concessions? And how does that compare to where View 34 is?","Jerry Davis","Yes. View 34 is offering modest concessions right now. And when I look at the Copper building, I think right now, they're just offering about a month free. So it's not too excessive right now.","Operator","The next question is from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just curious, with kind of the first half of the year baked and you're tracking above the high end of the range on same-store revenue guidance and probably some visibility into July and August, what would it really take for you to hit that low end of the revenue guidance range at this point?","Jerry Davis","The low end, I guess, is the potential scenario, but we think it's very unlikely. Right now, when you think about how do you get to the midpoint just to start with. Midpoint would assume the second half would come in at about a 3. We don't expect to have an occupancy pickup in the second half of the year. During the first half of the year, we had occupancy contribution of about 40 to 50 basis points. With some of that shift of supply that we were just talking about going from the first half to the second half, if you start to see some of the irrational pricing, similar to what we saw last year in places like San Francisco, New York and L.A, it could put significant pricing pressure potentially on us. We don't see that happening right now, but if it did, we think that, that could push us down pretty close to that midpoint.","As I look at concession levels today, though, in most of my major markets, whether it's New York, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco or Southern California, there's very few markets today that we're seeing concessions levels up around 2 months. The only ones we see today, a little bit in Brooklyn where we're not directly competing, but we get a little ancillary competition, the ballpark area of D.C. has seen anywhere from 1 to 2 months free. Then really the only other 2 places we're seeing get up to 2 months in some locations is Santa Clara. There's a couple lease-ups there providing that large of a concession as well as that platinum triangle area of Anaheim.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then just -- you touched on the ballpark in some of the concessions you're seeing there and DC has been a market you flagged as modestly underperforming your initial expectations. As you look out with job growth kind of slowing a bit here recently, are you concerned that, that market could backtrack as some of the additional supply within the ballpark and the Wharf area start to come online?","Jerry Davis","I have to go backtrack, we're still comfortable at the beginning of the year, we thought it was going to be high 3s. Today, we'd see it down closer to 3-ish, may be a plus or minus. So it's sliding a bit. Some of that is because of the heavy supply that's hit in 2Q and 3Q. There's a couple of submarkets that are getting hit. Predominantly the ballpark, we're feeling a little bit not much out in Tyson's Corner. But yes, when we look at which markets have probably come in a little worse than we anticipated this year, you have DC as well as Orange County. We have discussed that back in NAREIT. But I would tell you, overall, this year's coming in right about where we expected, maybe a little bit better because you get those offset by Northern California and Seattle and then the remainder of the markets are pretty much coming in as expected. So yes, D.C. is one that we're feeling a little bit of pressure in right now predominantly because of the supply, a little bit because of the jobs, but we think it's more supply. And we're hopeful it's a little concentrated right now. But we're still not seeing really crazy levels of concessions like we saw in some places last year.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Hightower of Evercore.","Richard Hightower","So I was looking through the new and renewal page in the supplemental, you can't help but notice renewals were pretty strong, at least in the aggregate and turnover went down pretty significantly year-over-year. Just curious what you guys think the lower limit on that turnover metric is. And can you tell us if it sort of ebbs and flows with the volume of supply deliveries in any given quarter, just how we should think about it?","Jerry Davis","I can tell you there's -- you have external factors that affect supply which you described. When you have heavy new development in your submarkets and they're offering 2 months free, that's enough to entice those people to move. And when you look at the comparison to last year, the 3 or 4 markets that we see the most marked decline, if you will and turnover are San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City which were the ones where we saw the most irrational pricing last year. So yes, if you do see heavy new supply come at you and you have heavy concessions, that's typically enough to make people jump. That shift heavy supply with 1 month free which is what typically people are offering.","The burden of moving typically doesn't get you there. But I would tell you, there's two other things that I think we focused on to help drive down that turnover. One, we're paying a lot of attention to call it reputation management and resident polling of any issues they're having and then we're taking action to remedy the solution. So I think we're doing a good job there. Secondly, we implemented an inside renewal team here in our office about eight months ago and to date this year, we feel like we've saved an incremental 200 move-outs that would have occurred if we didn't have this team and that's helped buoy up our occupancy and helped drive down some of this turnover.","Richard Hightower","All right, that's helpful, Jerry. And maybe one follow-up to some of the comments on the concession environment this year versus last year. What do you think is driving that if it's anything beyond just the volume of supply deliveries? Is there something else that's causing the market to be a little more rational this time around? Is it just the experience of last year sort of chastening behavior, in that sense or something else?","Jerry Davis","I think part of it last year, I think people were very concerned with significant interest rate increases and they're trying to lock in their financing. I think that you've seen a little bit more of an elongation of the delivery period so much at one time. So while it's putting some pricing pressure on most of the stabilized new leases, it's not extensive to the degree it was last year. So I think it's a little bit less of both of those things.","Operator","The next question is from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Jerry, thanks for your comments on the other income growth. Could you just quantify the basis points lift to full year '17 revenue growth that ancillary income's thrown off?","Jerry Davis","I don't have that number on me. It's -- I think when I looked at it a while back, it was in probably the 60 to 90 basis points. And I'll tell you this too, it's not a onetime thing. We're a company of innovation. We're consistently coming off of that next new thing that will continue to drive outsized other income growth. So I don't want anyone to think that it -- this year and then it drops off. I think we've got things in the works today, whether it's increasing the penetration on a lot of these things we rolled out this year or it's on new things we'll roll out next year that make this a sustainable driver of our income.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Is it a sense that '18 is in line with that 60, 90 bps lift or less or more?","Jerry Davis","It's probably early to give a number on that. I think it's still going to be a significant portion that's going to grow that line item, if you will. Other income which grew at about 9% this quarter, I think it was up about 12% in the first quarter. Compare that to where rents are growing and call it within somewhere in the 3% to 4% range on a blended basis. Now I'm comfortable to say that other income is going to continue to grow at a much higher rate than rents.","John Pawlowski","Okay, great. And one last one for me, on the capital allocation front, on the margin, are there any changes to your view on the attractiveness of the risk-adjusted returns for on balance sheet development versus other uses given what's happening with construction cost, land costs, supply not seeming to abate?","Joseph Fisher","John, this is Joe. No, there really hasn't been -- I think commensurate with commentary last quarter and what you've heard from peers, the development front, the fact that construction costs have continued to increase, labor has been difficult, construction financing market's difficult and land hasn't certainly reprised at this point. So that our underwriting has adjusted to that reality. I think it's still a little bit difficult to make things penciled. We still have a desire to maintain the development pipeline and to go out there and find land parcels, but it's not as easy as it sounds perhaps. So there's still a desire in the capital allocation front to find parcels, keep the development pipeline where it is, although it's naturally going to drift down, if you look at our completion schedule.","And similarly, on the DCP, you can see we had some good success there in the quarter of deploying additional capital into that program, both with Wolff on the West Coast development JV as well as a couple of new structures with other partners. So we still have interest there, still taking a look at additional investments on that front. So there really hasn't been much of a shift at this point in time on capital allocation.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Stevenson of Janney.","Robert Stevenson","Jerry, when you think about the submarkets around D.C., the RBC, Alexandria, Tyson's, suburban Maryland, the district proper, I mean, any material differentiation operating performance lies between that? Or is it just basically whack-a-mole with wherever the new supply is coming?","Jerry Davis","It's fairly consistent, Rob. You got some markets are doing a little bit better. I will tell you, our -- two of our larger concentrated markets, one is that Logan Circle, U Street area, we had revenue growth there of 2.6%. It was a little below average but when you go over to Columbia Pike out in Arlington, you've got revenue growth that was 6.5%. So that was by far our strongest. I think that was predominantly, it was going off an easy comp last year when it was hit with new supply. You got a couple of submarkets for us of that are suffering. It's Silver Spring is being affected by new supply right now. When you get out further into areas like Dallas. There's some new supply. But I guess, we had to say where's the area that's the most impacted right now, whether it's because it's in the same exact submarket or not, Washington, D.C. is doing worse than Virginia. And then I would say our Maryland properties which are either up in College Park or mostly in Silver Spring are doing worse than D.C. right now.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then within the portfolio today, what are you guys seeing as the opportunity for redevelopment, both on a widespread basis as well as the more or less simple sort of kitchen and bath with a limited scope? What's those 2 subset of opportunity within the portfolio today, you think?","Jerry Davis","Yes. I'll tell you, Rob, for the last couple of years and we've stated this. We've been spending about $40 million a year consistently on those smaller scope items. Those are either kitchen and baths, smaller amenity upgrades, things like that. And that $40 million this year, we're actually realizing a cash-on-cash return of about 21% and the IRRs are coming in at about 12%, so well above our whack. About 40% of those are kitchen and bath and the rest of them are either inside the units, things like flooring or just appliance replacements or it's things like converting old theater rooms into conference rooms, making rooftops more inviting, creating dog parks or throwing amenities into courtyards.","So there's stuff like that, but we think for the next several years, there's the opportunity to continue to spend about $40 million. We don't want to ever get to the point where we make it too big of a program. We like the consistency. When you get to the larger renovations, the larger renovations, just to let you know, we typically underwrite those that are cash on cash, something a little between 8% and 9% return. You're looking for under, I guess, assets that you are -- B assets, things like that in A locations that you can do some improvement to. And we've got a few. We do not have an extensive inventory of properties to go these -- do these renovations on, but we probably got a couple in D.C. that when the time is right, we can take a look at. ","We may have one up in Boston. We have a couple out in California. Maybe 1 or 2 in Seattle. But it's a handful. It's not a super extensive list and I'll tell you, we're not going to go spend the money unless we can get the return and we're not going to go do it unless it's a location that we think there's at least a potential for some cap rate movement.","Robert Stevenson","Do those become more attractive in the aggregate if, as Joe said, you guys can't find over the next year enough land to replace the ground-up development pipeline? Do those get elevated on the priority scale? Or is that regardless you've got enough capital to do both if you really wanted to?","Jerry Davis","I think if you had good investment opportunities, you would find a way to, I guess, allocate the capital appropriately. And I will tell you this, we're not -- just like we were not going to aggressively underwrite development, we're not going to aggressively underwrite for a redevelopment just to find a place to go spend some capital. If we don't believe in the project, I don't see us spending the money on it.","Robert Stevenson","And then just lastly on that same thing. If it's not -- if it's a B -- if the B asset and A location and it doesn't deserve CapEx dollars to do a renovation, does that immediately put it on the candidates for sale at the right price?","Jerry Davis","No, I think you're right. We look at assets like that if we can't pencil a renovation. And it's a B asset in an A location or especially more frequently the B in the B that you can underwrite and if it's not just viable to spend the CapEx, then yes, I think it can work its way onto our disposition list.","Operator","The next question is from Jeffrey Pehl of Goldman Sachs.","Jeffrey Pehl","Just wanted to go back to the same-store revenue growth guidance. Looks like year-to-date, it's about 4.2% and you were 3.9% in 2Q. Just want to see what your expectations are for third quarter, if it be similar to 3Q or 2Q or if you have a deceleration from there.","Jerry Davis","I think we really don't give quarterly same-store guidance, but I think, again, if you were going to just do the basic math of how do you get to the midpoint, it would probably infer that it's going to come down from the 3.9%.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","So are you guys seeing -- despite the specifics of supply slippage that you're seeing, is there a movement away from the urban core into the suburbs? And do you expect maybe some of your more outlying assets outside of the downtown to do worse in the coming years?","Jerry Davis","I think we've had the assumption for a while that, that's going to happen. We're seeing a little bit of it, but still today, Rich, when you look at where we're feeling the biggest impact of new supply, it's typically in those reports, whether it's a place. But sometimes, you'll have the outskirt locations, I'll give you an example, Dallas. Uptown is still extremely being hit by new supply, but so is that Frisco Legacy Village. We're feeling it up there, too. So it can move a bit. But today, it still feels like it's more urban. So I don't think it's fully gotten in and hitting the suburban product. But yes, I think our expectation, I'll throw it over to Harry to see if he's looking at land and talking to guys if he think it's moving out, but our expectation would be that probably will be the next step.","Harry Alcock","Rich, it's Harry. On the investments side, I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, we're actively looking at -- in a number of our traditional sort of large East Coast and West Coast markets. But in addition, we've expanded sort of our investment reach to include other markets that we currently operate in, including Portland, Austin, Nashville and Denver. Some of those will be suburban-type assets as we look to deploy capital, either in the Developer Capital Program. And in fact, a couple of the deals that we closed this quarter were in more suburban locations, if you look at Portland in particular. But also as we look for land sites to back fill our development pipeline, we're looking in sort of those first-ring suburbs outside of the urban core just simply because with relative -- with continued rising construction costs and relatively flat revenue growth for the next year in the urban core given the amount of new supply, the suburban-ish type markets may pencil better for us.","Richard Anderson","It may pencil better now, but if it takes 2 or 3 years to bring product to market, are you kind of putting yourself in danger zone in the sense that if Jerry's right in terms of the decision about the future of urban versus suburban, maybe you shouldn't be doing that?","Harry Alcock","We look at -- just like anyone else underwriting deals, we look at in-place plus an expectation as to how revenue growth is going to trend. So we take all that into account as we look at these investment activities.","Richard Anderson","I'd ask a little bigger picture question. I imagine from a stock market perspective, this sort of concept of supply slipping forward is probably less good than bad in a sense that you don't take your medicine now, but you've kind of just hangs with you for the next several quarters. But then I'm thinking about it, I wonder if the slippage and tell me if I'm right or wrong. If the slippage almost like in sync with the slippage of demand. By that, I mean, the Trump administration hasn't really produced the type of economic activity in the time period that they suggested. And so maybe as the supply slips and we get more sort of tax reform and whatnot from this administration, yet economy starts to heat up a little bit more, do you think this is actually sort of an in-sync type of scenario supply slipping and maybe demand picking up about at the same sort of pace? Is that a fair way of looking at it?","Joseph Fisher","Rich, it's Joe. Maybe a couple of things on that. If you go back to when we first put out the outlook and talked about our job expectations, while we were positively biased on what Trump may or may not accomplish, we did not actually factor that in. So when we're talking about demand slippage, I think it's demand slippage versus perhaps lofty expectations but not expectations that we had worked into our forecast. In fact, if we look at what we're seeing in terms of demand today, job growth and wage growth for us and UDR markets across the board are coming in well above national averages. The quality of jobs continues to improve. When you look at kind of changes overall. It's a mixed bag, but generally, we've had a few markets coming better, a few coming worst. But overall, a little bit better than our initial expectations. ","So I wouldn't say that we've seen job slippage versus our original expectations. To your point though, I can see where you're going with that. But yes, if, in fact, we do eventually get some type of tax reform or deregulation, it is probably only incremental to the demand picture. But at this point, we're not underwriting it. We didn't factor that into our initial 1 or 2-year forecast. So it's kind of gravy on top of that if, in fact, it comes to fruition.","Operator","The next questions is from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.","Andrew Babin","Quick question on Seattle. It looks like sequentially on a year-over-year basis, Seattle decelerate a little bit from 1Q to 2Q. I'm just wondering if there's anything behind that or is it just kind of a blip? Is there jumpy supply deliveries? Is demand slowing a little bit? Is there anything kind of unique going on there?","Jerry Davis","I don't think so. I think Seattle has the ability to have starts and stops. When you looked at the first quarter, I know our blended rate growth was a bit on the low side then it accelerated. Today, when you look at what we put out in the second quarter, we have blended rate growth of 6.3%. So sometimes it's just the comp versus the prior year, but we did start the year very good. But I don't think it's anything to be overly concerned about. A lot of our product is in the Bellevue area and Bellevue is getting a little bit of supply coming out today but nothing extraordinary that's being absorbed well. Our Bellevue properties had revenue growth of 6%, 6.5% I believe during the quarter and you got a lot of job growth that continues to either come into Bellevue, come into downtown, job growth kind of happening now in Redmond. So I'm still not overly concerned, but you do have to keep an eye on the levels of supply that continue to come at Seattle. And for the last 3 years or so, it's been heavy, but it's been absorbed well. Today, I'm not concerned. But as you know, we keep our eyes on anything that's showing that much supply coming.","Andrew Babin","That's helpful. And one last question on the JV guidance increase for the JV FFO, was that something that just occurred during the second quarter and was passed on for the year? Or I guess, I'm just questioning the Verve, Mountain View asset, is that stabilizing maybe quicker than you'd expected? Was it JV or refinancing? What's kind of driving that upside there?","Joseph Fisher","Drew, so the increase that we saw in JV really have a couple of things taking place there. One has to do with the assets that we've talked about that were in the market and the timing of those potential dispositions or acquisitions as they remain in equity and earnings. So 8th & R, Katella, Steele Creek and the timing of those, maybe a little bit later this quarter than originally expected. The other piece of it, if you look in our guidance page, you can see that our Developer Capital Program in terms of the deployment of capital there, that range of $50 million to $100 million now factors in the 3 additional deals that we saw in the second quarter, so a little bit more capital deployment on that front which is going to flow through the JV side. And then I'll kick it to Harry, who can just comment quickly on kind of where Verve yield is.","Harry Alcock","Yes. Verve is -- we're 80-plus percent leased at this point. We expect the yield deal to come in at about 6.1% return on cost. Properties right on the El Camino, it suits up very well and that's in the JV with MetLife.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","I want to follow up just a little bit on the supply picture in your commentary about supply being pushed out a little bit. I apologize if this has been asked, but are there any specific markets you can point to where supply is being pushed out? And maybe, I think you discussed some of the markets where you're seeing higher but maybe where you're seeing it specifically pushed out.","Joseph Fisher","Rich, this is Joe. So [indiscernible] is coming earlier just in terms of seeing the slippage, both within first half to second half and then probably second half into 2018 as well. So when we look at the slippage overall, more weighted towards the second half today, but that could change if we do see more slippage in the 2018. But I think when you kind of look at the themes, all markets by and large are seeing some slippage due to contract labor. But the ones where we're seeing it most pronounced got to go through the West Coast primarily. It's Orange County, it's L.A., San Francisco, Seattle and probably the only other market that received a meaningful slippage is going to come in Nashville. So it is more of a West Coast theme overall in terms of that slippage that's taking place.","Richard Hill","Got it. And maybe the same question on the job growth side. Are there any markets where you're seeing better or worse job growth? I know in your prepared remarks, you talked about Orange County. Any other markets where you would point to as outliers, either on the upside or downside?","Joseph Fisher","Yes. You mentioned one of them already. So Orange County in L.A. probably a little bit weaker than our original forecast on the demand front. I would want Austin in San Jose in there as well. To the positive, so a number of positives. Austin doing better. Nashville orlando, Seattle, even New York City is doing a little bit better than our original forecast. So we've got some ticks and ties in there. But overall, as I mentioned earlier, job growth doing a little bit better than expected and continue to see job growth and wage growth in our markets doing much better than the national average.","Richard Hill","Got it. And then one final question, I promise. Same-store revenue, how did that sort of trend throughout 2Q, if you could? And how does that look going into July? Any sort of guidance or insights there would be helpful.","Jerry Davis","I'm assuming instead of same-store revenue, you're talking more about new lease rates?","Richard Hill","Well, yes. Either or, but yes.","Jerry Davis","All right. I'll give you the rent trends on the new site because renewals has stayed fairly static, call it in that 4.9% to 5% range for the last several months and we expect that to continue, at least into the near term. You look at 2Q, new lease rates on an effective basis were up 2.2%. That's what's in the supplement and it progressed up from 2% in April and it was 2.3% in both May and June. At this time and July is not fully done, we would expect to July to come in the mid- to high 1s. I would tell you, when we look back 4 of the past 5 years, new lease rate growth has experienced a similar seasonal decline from 2Q to 3Q. In fact, when you look back 6 of the last 7 years, we've actually seen July come in a bit lower than June. So what we're seeing today is fairly typical. This year, the slowdown appears to be coming a little bit earlier, but that's kind of where they stand right now.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector","Not sure if this was asked already, but I heard comments about New York City stronger than expected. Can you talk a little bit more about the New York City market and maybe some of the submarkets where you have exposure?","Jerry Davis","I don't know if I said New York was necessarily stronger than expected. New York is one of the markets that's coming in about as expected. In our first quarter, we had very strong growth at 4% that decelerated to a more normalized growth rate for right now. It was 2.2%. Our expectation is it's going to continue to be in the -- somewhere in the 2s. But when you look at the submarkets we're in, we're really in about 3 or 4 submarkets. The Financial District during the quarter have revenue growth of about 2.4%, Chelsea came in at about 2.7%. Murray Hill property came in just below 2% and then the one property that's not in our same store is our Met JV property. It's on the Upper West Side and that one came in at slightly negative because it's competing most directly against the new supply of Midtown West.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay, great. And then I'm not sure if you had mentioned this already, but did you say occupancy today, we were curious on that verse. Let's think about a comparison to the second half of '16 same-store results? We're just trying to get a feel for that.","Jerry Davis","Yes. Occupancy, today, is 96.7% or so in our expectation. Last year, we ran the second half high 96s, call it, 96.7% to 96.8%, but it's going to be -- right now, what we're looking at is probably no uptick in occupancy compared to last year. Whereas in the first half of the year because of -- we ran the first half of 2016 in the mid-96s, we ran the first half of this year high 96s, we had an uplift this year on the occupancy side in the first half. And just one thing I was going to add. Even though occupancy's going be there, the one thing we do see happening as the year progresses is that blended lease rate growth will compress to a comparable level to what it was at the same time last year. So it has continued to get closer each of the subsequent 3 quarters or so. We continue to see that happening throughout the year.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay. That's helpful. And then just last question, just -- I know that you hear this throughout all the tours we take about cosigners and parents guaranteeing young renters today. I mean, is this higher than what you've seen in the past? You guys even track this? Is this something that we should even be paying attention to?","Jerry Davis","I'd say I don't specifically track it. It's not one of the main metrics I'm looking at. I can tell you I would look at cosigners more intently if I was looking at bad debt, but bad debt is stable over the last couple of years at roughly 0.1% of potential rents. But I couldn't tell you right now it's increased or decreased.","Operator","The next question is from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Panagiotis Peikidis","This is Pete Peikidis here with Dennis. First question we had is if we look at the second half revenue growth guidance, if we look at the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, how do you see that trending?","Jerry Davis","Yes. We're not really giving that kind of guidance right now. I would say [indiscernible] going.","Panagiotis Peikidis","Great. And the next question, I just want to clarify your earlier comment that was made. So it would take -- where it would take pressure from irrational activity on lease-ups to raise the midpoint of the full year revenue growth guidance. And is that safe to assume then, without that, you could reach the high end?","Jerry Davis","I think the high end is definitely reachable. I think if you see the lack of pressure on new lease rates which right now, we would say is most likely to come from that types of irrational pricing, there's the potential definitely that you could get there. But things have to break right in a multitude of ways. But right now, we're comfortable with the midpoint maybe for the...","Operator","The next question is from Daniel Santos of Sandler O'Neill.","Daniel Santos","Just one quick question going back to the Developer Capital Program. What's your comfort level with any expansion of the program moving forward? And as you think of new projects, are you looking to have exclusive relationships with developers in certain markets? Or does every deal stand alone?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. I'll answer that. So just to sort of recap it, we recently did 6 deals, 5 in the West Coast JV plus Steele Creek out of the total investment of $233 million. This year so far, we've added 4 deals with a total capital commitment of $94 million. We bought CityLine which is one of the West Coast JV deals, so that went out of the program, $20 million and then we had 3 projects that are stabilized today that are all or one of which is 8th & Republican in Seattle. That's in the market and tied up for sale. So that'll come out of the program. Katella, in all likelihood, given that there's a Phase 2, that it comes online next year and in all likelihood, we're just going hold that for the time being and nonetheless, that just becomes a JV. So in effect, that comes out of the program and then Steele Creek, as we talked about earlier, is in the market for sale and that we'll see where pricing comes in. But either way, in all likelihood, that comes out of the program.","So in effect, we've gone from $233 million to roughly $150 million today. That whole first group of assets has done very well in line with our expectations, sort of low double-digit type unlevered IRRs and we're actively looking to backfill that program with additional opportunities to get it back to prior levels in that $200 million to $300 million range. In terms of the second part of the program, we do not have exclusive deals with developers. However, you've seen us do 7 deals with Wolff in the West Coast JV. So it's not exclusive. It clearly is a program that's working out well for both parties. From our perspective, we get a 6.5% coupon on the invested capital, plus in effect, we get a 50% upside in value creation of the assets relative to our buy-in price. ","And importantly, we have a fixed-price option on those assets that we believe could be valuable in certain cases, as you saw with CityLine 1, where we had an option price of roughly $100 million -- or $90 million and we had the value of the asset when we declared it was something over $100 million. Did I answer all of your questions?","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Toomey, for closing remarks.","Thomas Toomey","Well, thank you, all of you, for your time today. We do appreciate it and certainly, your interest in UDR. We started out the call by saying it was a very good quarter. You can see that things are going very well for us, leading to an increase in guidance across the board in earnings and same-store results. And we're very focused on the third quarter and the balance of the year and think things are going to work out for us on both of those. So we're enjoying a very good swing in it, guys and we look forward to seeing you soon. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.","Shelby Noble","Welcome to UDR\u2019s first quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.udr.com. In this supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements.","I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although, we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday\u2019s press release and included in our filings with the SEC. And we do not undertake the duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you'll be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Shelby and good afternoon everyone and welcome to UDR's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","The first quarter of 2015 was another great quarter for UDR and our business is firing in all cylinders. As a result of great execution from operations, exceptional lease up velocity and a new strategic investment, we increased our full year same-store and earnings guidance ranges. In short, we continue to execute on our previously communicated 2 year strategic plan, with transparent strength of fundamentals and our diligent capital allocation we feel great about the plan and our ability to deliver on it.","The following four topics highlight our first quarter. First, our operations outperformed versus our initial expectations and historical norms due to exceptional new lease rate growth, strong renewal rate growth and a continued focus on containing cost. These trends continued as we move into our prime leasing season in the second quarter. Second, our development lease-up continue to perform very well. We are exceeding our budgeted lease up absorption and realizing rents in excess of our initial projections at Beach & Ocean in Huntington Beach and our 100 Pier 4 in Boston Seaport area.","We expect to complete 326 million of a previous development in 2015, which will continue to drive our cash flow and NAV growth. Third, subsequent to quarter-end we entered into a joint venture agreement with The Wolff Company in a portfolio of five communities that are currently under construction. The venture will provide UDR with a pipeline of over 1,500 new homes with an accelerated delivery schedule and anticipated completions beginning in 2015 and ending in 2017. All of the communities are located in core coastal markets including Metro Seattle, Los Angeles and Orange County. Tom will address the economics and the benefit to UDR in his prepared remarks.","Fourth, we are increasing our full year same-store and earnings guidance ranges to reflect the strength evident in our operations and the accretive nature of the venture that I just mentioned. Better operations and the venture contributed a penny each versus previously announced guidance. Lastly, our prospects look fantastic as we enter the second quarter. Our mix of A and B quality communities in northern and suburban locations should continue to generate strong operating results. As I indicated earlier April trends were well above our initial forecast and May looks like it will continue to accelerate. There remains a long runway for growth at UDR and we have the right plan and team in place to capitalize on the opportunities.","With that, I\u2019d like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow UDR associates for their extraordinary work in producing another strong quarter of results. I\u2019d also like to welcome Shelby Noble to the UDR team as our new Head of Investor Relations and express my gratitude to Chris Van Ens for all his hard work and along over the past 3 years. I know he will be very successful working with Jerry on the operating team. We look forward to continued success in 2015.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, our balance sheet and capital markets update, our development update, recent transactions and our revised full year 2015 guidance. Our first quarter earnings of results were at the upper-end of our previously provided guidance ranges. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.43, $0.40 and $0.37, respectively. This was driven by better than expected first quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth which were strong at 5.1%, 2.5% and 6.2% respectively. Jerry will provide additional color in his prepared remarks.","Next, the balance sheet. At quarter-end our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 37.5%, on a fair value basis, it was around 28%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.4 times inclusive of pro rata JV\u2019s it was 7.3 times, all metrics continued to improve as planned. At quarter-end our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was 517 million. On the capital markets, as previously disclosed we issued 109 million of equity net of fees through our ATM program during the quarter, the shares were issues at a premium to consensus NAV.","Turning to development. We commenced construction on our 155 home $99 million Domain Mountain View development in Mountain View, California in a 50-50 joint venture with Metlife. At quarter-end the pro rata share of our underway development pipeline totaled 838 million and was 73% funded with an estimated spread between stabilized yields and market cap rate and at the upper-end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range. As to future development we continue to underwrite opportunities with a bicoastal focus and we anticipate the size of our pipeline to be in the targeted range of 900 million to 1.4 billion by mid-year.","On to recent transactions. As previously announced, we completed the disposition of our 20% interest in our Texas JV. We realized net proceeds of approximately 43 million on the sale inclusive of a promote and disposition fee of approximately 9.6 million. These were recognized in the first quarter but excluded from FFO as adjusted and AFFO. This disposition was well timed as it eliminated our exposure to Houston, reduced our exposure to Dallas and generated a strong IRR of approximately 14%.","As Tom mentioned subsequent to quarter-end we entered into a joint venture agreement with The Wolff Company to invest 136 million for a 48% interest and a portfolio of five communities that are currently under construction. Our investment is based on an initial all-in price of 559 million. We are discussing a fixed asset with our partners that we may add before closing which would represent an approximate 20% increase to both our initial all-in price and investment. This transaction is beneficial on a variety of ways.","First, we received a 6.5% preferred return on 136 million investment. So the transaction would be immediately accretive to FFO and avoid their earnings drag associated with typical development projects. Second, assuming all five of the communities are acquired, we estimate NAV creation of approximately 80 million at current market cap rates. Third, this transaction increases our exposure to high quality communities located in our core coastal markets for multifamily supply demand fundamentals appear favorable for the foreseeable future.","Fourth, the JV is less risky than a typical development as construction is already underway on all five of the communities. Our partner has provided certain guarantees the 136 million to be paid represents our entire reported investment in the venture and there is no promoted structure to our partner. Fifth, four of the five communities are located within a mile of an existing UDR community, thereby enhancing similarity with anticipated operations and valuations. And finally, with lease up starting on average in seven months we\u2019re able to take advantage of current fundamental market strength.","Additionally, given our accelerated ability to exercise our purchase options ranging from 22 to 36 months from today, we view this transaction as having elements of a financing arrangement with an option to purchase rather than simply a traditional joint venture. We are excited about the accretive nature of this transaction, additional details are available on our first quarter press release and the West Coast Development joint venture presentation posted on our Web site.","On to the second quarter and full year 2015 updated guidance. We increased our full year FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO guidance ranges by $0.02 at the midpoint due to stronger than expected operations and accretion from the development joint venture. Full year 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share are now forecast at $1.63 to $1.67, $1.61 to $1.65 and $1.44 to $1.48 respectively. For same-store we have increased our full year 2015 revenue growth guidance by 50 basis at the midpoint to 4.25% to 4.75%. Expense growth is unchanged at 2.5% to 3% and increased our NOI growth forecast by 75 basis points at the midpoint to 4.75% to 5.75%. The increase was driven by strong new and renewal rate growth, total occupancy and lower turnover. Second quarter 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.39 to $0.41, $0.39 to $0.41 and $0.34 to $0.36 respectively.","From a sources and uses perspective we have updated our sales proceeds and debt and equity issuance guidance at the midpoint from 775 million to 825 million. This net 50 million increase is the result of an increase in our acquisition guidance to account for the development joint venture transaction mentioned earlier and the removal of 75 million of assumed land acquisitions. As to funding our capital needs for the year, to-date we received 43 million from our Texas JV disposition. We issued 109 million of equity on our ATM and have 65 million of assets under contract for sale. Assuming a 300 million bond offering late in the second quarter we have only 250 million to 300 million of remaining capital funding needs for the year.","As we outlined in our call last quarter, we will continue to utilize the most advantageous source of capital to fund these needs typically either through asset sales through equity issuance at or above NAV. Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 25 of our supplement. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.2775 per share in the first quarter or $1.11 per share when annualized, 7% above 2014\u2019s level and representing a yield of approximately 3.3%.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom and good afternoon. In my remarks, I\u2019ll cover the following topics; first, our first quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and early results for the second quarter. Second, how our primary markets during the quarter and last a brief update on our development lease-ups. We\u2019re pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter same-store net operating income grew 6.2% driven by a 5.1% year-over-year increase in revenue, that was above our expectations and a 2.5% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 4.6% year-over-year to $1,659 per month. Our same-store occupancy of 96.7% was 60 basis points higher versus the prior year period.","Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,836 per month including pro rata JVs. Our first quarter revenue growth was well above our original forecast and was driven by widespread strength across our markets. Stable job growth, limited impact from new multi-family supply, a single family housing market that is still finding its footing, significant demand from new Millennial households and incremental demand from empty-nesters are all helping.","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth which is detailed on Attachment 8-E of our supplement. Our ability to push new lease rate growth continued to outpace historical precedent during the first quarter by wide margin, we grew in the lease rates by 4.2% in 1Q, a full 320 basis point ahead of the first quarter of 2014. Renewal growth also remained robust at 5.7% in the first quarter or 60 basis points ahead of last year. In April, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 6.3% and 6.8% respectively. Our leasing success in conjunction with stable, sequential occupancy and lower year-over-year turnover gives us plenty of confidence that demand is more than sufficient to continue pushing rates higher throughout the upcoming prime leasing season. These factors also served as the primary drivers of our sizeable 50 basis point increase in same-store revenue guidance at the midpoint.","Next, rents as a percentage of our residents\u2019 income decreased slightly to 17.2%. Move-outs to home purchase were flat year-over-year at 14% in line with our long-term average. Even with renewal increases at a healthy 5.7% in the first quarter, only 6.8% of our move-outs gave rent increases the reason for leaving.","Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary markets. These markets represent 65% of our same-store NOI and 71% of our total NOI. Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 17% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 5.8% and is outperforming versus our budget expectations thus far in 2015. Our Los Angeles portfolio is concentrated in Marina Del Rey and Playa Vista submarket and continues to be impacted by new supply in the submarket. As a result, our first quarter year-over-year revenue drove 3.8% lag versus the overall LA market. However, we still expect full year same-store revenue growth of just under 5% for Los Angeles.","New York City represents 13% of our total NOI. Our downtown assets posted combined rent growth of 6.5% in the first quarter while maintaining occupancy at just under 98%. Lower Manhattan remains attractive as the result of limited new supply, strong job growth in the technology, finance, media and advertising fields and low housing affordability which limits move-outs to home purchase. Metro DC which represents 12.5% of our total NOI posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.9%, compared to a negative 50 basis points in 4Q of 2014. We are forecasting 1.5% to 2% revenue growth in 2015, as we continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway.","San Francisco which represents nearly 12% of our total NOI shows no sign slowing down as new and renewal lease rate growth in the first quarter and April point to another strong year for the Bay area. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter reached 9%. Submarket-wise results were more mixed with our Downtown properties posting 5% top-line growth due to the impact of new supply and compared against 11% growth at our properties on Peninsula and in the Silicon Valley. Seattle which represents 6.5% of our total NOI continue to benefit from the strong growth inherent in our suburban B assets which are located in submarkets which are less exposed to new supply. Long-term we continue to like the Downtown Seattle submarket and believe that the ongoing creation of new jobs by companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle\u2019s urban core.","Boston which represents 5% of our total NOI continues to see new supply pressure Downtown. Our suburban assets north of the city and to a lesser degree those on the south shore should fair relatively better in 2015. Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI posted 4.4% year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the first quarter. We expect new supply to pressure our Uptown and Plano communities in 2015. For the full year we expect revenue growth to modestly decelerate from our first quarter results and come in around 4.0%.","I\u2019ll turn now to our recently completed and in-lease up developments, which you can find on Attachment 9 or Page 19 of our supplement. These three properties represent $400 million or roughly 48% of our pipeline. Beach & Ocean, our 173 home $52 million lease-up in Huntington Beach was 91% leased and 85% occupied at quarter-end. We are ahead of budget and exceeding our lease-up expectations. Asking rents today are just over $3 per square foot or $0.30 ahead of budget. I\u2019d like to remind you this property is located three miles from our Bella Terra project that was stabilized a year ago and it\u2019s just a mile from our oceanfront development site Pacific City which we plan to start at the end of the second quarter.","DelRay Tower, our 332 home $132 million lease up in Alexandria, Virginia remains challenged by the weak DC market. But we\u2019re confident in its long-term prospects. We are currently offering concessions of about two months in this oversupplied submarket in order to hold rate and maintain leasing velocity to reach our budgeted occupancy. Long-term, we believe in the DelRay submarket where we built an exceptional property. Lastly, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the first three months of leasing of our 369 home $218 million 100 Pier 4 development in Boston\u2019s Seaport District. We\u2019ve taken over 120 applications in the month of March and April well above our expectations. At quarter-end the property was 31% leased as of today it is 50% leased 17% occupied asking rents of 4.70 per square foot are ahead of original underwriting.","Pier 4\u2019s waterfront location is surrounded by new office building construction and is only a five minute walk to the Downtown Financial District and Boston\u2019s South Station Train hub. Several major employees are relocating to the Seaport district including Goodwin Procter which is relocating its Boston headquarters in 2016 and taking 380,000 square feet, State Street Bank which is relocating from the Back Bay taking 485,000 square feet and PWC which is slated to take 334,000 square feet as well. We\u2019ve experienced exceptional leasing demand ahead of these transformational events and are excited as the area continues to attract new potential residents.","April results came in well ahead of plan, as we look ahead to the next few months we see continued and improving pricing power and stable occupancy. All-in we had a great first quarter and we remain very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute during the peak leasing season and throughout the remainder of 2015.","With that, I\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Can you talk about how the development JV was sourced and what the benefit is to your partners for executing the transaction at this time?","Harry Alcock","Nick this is Harry, Wolff was in the market looking for capital partners and given our sort of recent experience with Steele Creek we started talking to them about a similar type structure which is how this thing evolved from our partners perspective I assume there are a number of benefits that they could communicate but I know specifically they\u2019ve got a couple of benefits, one they get to return money to an open-ended fund and redeploy it and secondly they were specifically over allocated on the development front to certain of these markets.","Nick Joseph","And then stabilized estimated yield of 5% on current rents or on trended rents?","Harry Alcock","That\u2019s on trended rents we have grown rents up 3% on average over the next couple of years through stabilization.","Operator","Next would be Jana Galan with Bank of America.","Jana Galan","Jerry I appreciate you\u2019re going to the core markets, it sounded like DC and Dallas revenue growth are expected to decelerate as we make our way through the year but every other market looks to be are gaining\u2026?","Jerry Davis","Now that is true, actually DC will be close to flat we expect DC for the full year to come in between 1.5% to 2% we\u2019re starting to see the Downtown area as I said in my remarks get closer to the same types of growth as we saw in the suburbs over the last year or so they\u2019re roughly even in that 1.5% range today. A big part of that is most of those assets last year were combating against the lease ups and therefore I have an offer I am going to have free of concessions when those have gone away. But the rest of the portfolio as you noted we are seeing a continuing growth in revenue when we first gave our guidance back in early February we felt our numbers were realistic given our economic data at the time, even though at that time we were seeing a lot of the operating trends on the ground that were showing strength, that was a little early in the year as we got further into the year we've seen the rate growth continue to accelerate sequentially and just as an example I would tell you that in the month of February our blended rate growth between new and renewals was 4.9% in March that grew to 5.6% in April it's jumped up to 6.6% so it has been going up 50 to 100 basis points a month even though we don't expect that pace to continue we do anticipate that the growth will continue to go higher just not the same level of increases each month","But I can also say in the month of May I would expect it to be higher that was in April with 6.6 I\u2019d also like to point out that we sent out renewals for the month of June and renewals in June are averaging at over 7% portfolio wide but there is a fairly wide disparity between the strongest markets which are the West Coast where renewals are pushing very high single-digits in the Sunbelt and Mid Atlantic are at the bottom those are about 5% renewal increases right in the middle close to the midpoint of what we are sending out is the Northeastern markets of New York as well as Boston so big disparity and I would remind you that typically we realize very close to what we have sent out so the seven should be a pretty good strong number.","Today also just to get this out of the way our fiscal occupancy is 97% and what's really impressive to me and this really speaks to the broad success or strength of the rental markets that we\u2019re in we don\u2019t have a single market that has fiscal occupancy today less than 95.8% and when I look at our new lease rate growth in April our blended rate growth in April compared to the month of March 90% of my markets are higher in April than they were in March. So, going back to what you said we see continued strength and it's virtually across the board.","Jana Galan","And then just following up Tom had mentioned that you maybe adding a one project to the West Coast Development joint venture and Harry you said The Wolff Company was over allocated to Southern California I was just curious if there is opportunity to add more to the JV?","Tom Toomey","Yes. Just in and Jana you are talking about the land development JV or about Wolff? Yes we have five assets that are included in the JV currently there is a sixth asset that is currently being considered by both parties and we may add that prior to closing so yes that would be a West Coast asset as well.","Jana Galan","And any other opportunity to work more with them?","Tom Toomey","We do have a pipeline of additional development opportunities that is something that we would discuss with them once we move forward.","Operator","Next would be Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Just a couple of quick questions on The Wolff side just to be clear with the five and the potential sixth was that kind of the entire current existing pipeline or did they have a portfolio of 15 and you went in and in effect pick out these five or six assets?","Warren Troupe","Steve. This is Warren. They recently had a portfolio of 10 that they presented to us and when we looked at the 10 the six that we've been talking about are the ones that we thought had the promise for us.","Steve Sakwa","And then I guess for Tom Herzog if you kind of think about NAV and consensus NAV I mean we're hearing more companies kind of using consensus NAV as the maybe the justification for issuing equity the companies don't always provide kind of their own views on NAV but just how do you -- it is just I guess to the extent that there was a large disparity between your own internal and consensus, how do you sort of rationalize that and is there a at which you probably would not issue equity in?","Tom Herzog","Yes, Steve. Certainly we look at consensus NAV it is an easy number for us to speak to, because it's produced by a sell side analyst, but we absolutely do our own NAV internally every quarter and then we bump that up against consensus before we consider issuing equity so that definitely comes into our capital. Did I answer your question on that?","Steve Sakwa","Yes. I mean we could sort of chat offline about it. It's just I guess to the extent that your NAV was 35 and consensus was 32 and the stock was at 33 you would be above consensus below your own number it may justify that we issued above consensus the duration below your own estimated value and so just trying to sort of get your arms around that or how should we should be thinking about that?","Tom Herzog","So I would put at this way we do look at our internal NAV and we run it for a purpose to determine whether we believe internally a transaction would be accretive or dilutive and more certainly if we had concluded that it would be dilutive to us we would not do the transaction so we do look at our own NAV when we consideration equity as well.","Steve Sakwa","And I guess just one last question for Jerry I mean DC looks like it turned the corner I don\u2019t want to put the carts before the horse here. But how you\u2019re just feeling DC it seems like the supply is being absorbed better than people thought. Is there a chance that DC surprises further to the upside there?","Jerry Davis","Steve as I look at my original plan DC is one of my most positive upside surprises along with Baltimore so the entire Mid-Atlantic area. The last quarter we stated that we felt so we had bottom in fourth quarter of 2014 in DC and then it was either going to plateau or start to reaccelerate the acceleration was a little bit sooner than we expect although we did expect it to go positive.","I think it potentially could outperform even more we\u2019ll have to see if the jobs continue to come. But right now the new supply inside the Beltway is providing less resistance than it was last year. In fact I think on this call last year I had given some data points of what were my best performing and worst performing individual assets were in DC and I know my worse performing was at about a negative 4% growth and it was my View 14 property down on View Street and if I look at my first quarter results this year that same property has positive revenue growth 3.5%. So that U Street Corridor in particular where we\u2019ve bet pretty heavily with really about four properties within a mile up there are really performing well.","Steve Sakwa","And I guess that\u2019s the only market at this point you\u2019re worried about just downside surprised or is the jobs picture in the household formations just running so strong that there are very few markets where you kind of worry about downside surprise?","Jerry Davis","It is universal look so one when it will show occasional signs of some weaknesses in Dallas although the job growth continues to be strong we have felt the effect of new supply have been playing out where we have roughly one half of our same-store portfolio. But other than that the strength is across the board I think the Downtown San Francisco is impacted by supply as I stated in my prepared remarks that Downtown area is underperforming the Bay Area at about 5.5% to 6% if you call that underperforming. But Steve today we keep looking for when it is going to hit us that is negative and it\u2019s been hard to find. Earlier in the year we were a little concerned with Boston but then what came into reality similar to last year is it was a seasonal weather issue because as soon as March came around we saw a dramatic pick up in our rent growth, our occupancy which have stayed strong, got a little bit stronger and as evidenced by the success of our Seaport lease up Pier 4 we\u2019re very enthused by the strength of Boston even though there is significant development pressure Downtown.","Operator","And next will be John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","I had a question on the consolidation in the sector recently. Do you expect this trend to continue given the leveraged buyers in the market? And does this change the way you run your business at all? For example, do you want to get large or do you increase your economies of scale?","Tom Toomey","This is Tom Toomey and thank you for the question. It\u2019s an open-ended speculative question and in all frankness I\u2019d rather focus on what our strategic plan is, the execution of it and the delivery of the results. And so, while we sat around and observed what\u2019s going on we think our best plan is the one we\u2019ve outlined and the execution of it.","John Kim","So do you think that if you could figure the economies of scale would improve for your company?","Tom Toomey","I think it\u2019s a double edged sword. I mean I at one-time with a few other guys in this room ran a company that was 400 apartment homes. And to tell you the truth after about 200,000 doors you start having inefficiencies because you become a company that\u2019s run by spreadsheets and not the local knowledge of the particular real estate. And we like our size today and are more focused on what we derive out of the assets than what our G&A is relative to the size we don\u2019t see it as a problem today. We look at the results and the cash flow growth of the enterprise more than we do to the G&A aspect of the enterprise.","John Kim","I had a couple of questions on the mechanics of the joint venture, so just understanding the immediate the preferred return that you are getting is essentially a coupon that you\u2019re getting from your partner?","Tom Toomey","Well we get a 6.5% preferred return on our $136 million investment so I think you could describe it as a coupon, yes.","John Kim","And then you -- when this asset stabilizes the development stabilize the yield goes to 5%, 5.4%. So is that actually a little bit dilutive once the developments are complete?","Tom Toomey","Well it\u2019s not dilutive relative to our cost of capital but the question is that the 6.5% coupon that you realized sort of reverse to a 5.4% the answer is yes, so the returns do come down slightly as we -- as the properties come online.","John Kim","And your preference today is to exercise this\u2026","Tom Herzog","If I could just jump in, it's Herzog just to be clear the 6.5% prep on the investment balance until such time as the asset is considered stabilized which would be at 80% occupancy and until that date The Wolff partner will incur all operating losses minus interest or get any operating income during that period of time. Once we have been deemed stabilized on an asset to that definition, then we move into our sharing ratio of 48% to 52% from that point forward. So whatever the asset is yielding at that point will be what falls to the bottom-line and the stabilized numbers that Harry is speaking to at the 5.4 is what he is referencing. So that is the mechanics as to how that will play through the P&L over the life.","John Kim","And so the accretion really picks up once you exercise the options and is your preference right now is to exercise all the options on the properties or what\u2019s your view on the projects today?","Tom Herzog","Well, I think the benefit of having fixed option price is that when we get to that point and the property is stabilized, we can make a separate investment decision as to whether that option prices is a favorable and then make the decision at that time.","Operator","Next will be Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Was wondering about the increases on the renewals that you're talking about for May and June were you talking about the greatest increases in the West, it looks though there was a slight increase in turnover in some of the Western market where renewables were pushed a bit are you -- do you end up softening renewals based on turnover in any of the market how are you thinking about that in terms of how much you want to push the rents?","Tom Toomey","No we would not we really look at occupancy and generate the highest NOI based on rent increases turnover and things like that and what we\u2019ve seen as we pushed rates in places like Seattle, for example you\u2019ve pointed out. We had renewals of 7.4% in the first quarter, they went up to 8% in the month of April and turnover at 43% is not dramatically up from a 38%. But when I can reload it at 6.1% on new lease rate growth, I am okay with that trade-off. Our job is to increase the value of the real estate, and we believe we have to do it by driving rate growth by really whatever means is necessary and if you get to a point where you're having to dramatically cut new lease rate growth because you have pushed too many people out the back door that would tell me I am pushing too hard.","But I am still able to get to 6.1% in Seattle. I've got occupancy today in Seattle that's north of 97%, place like Portland where it also increased 40 -- turnover increased 46%, we have 9% renewal growth and 8.1% new lease rate growth and my renewal growth in the month of April was 10 and my new lease rate growth was 12. That tells there is opportunity to do it. Sometimes people are moving because it\u2019s a transient workforce and when you look at places in the West, a lot or people have relocated from other markets, especially in the Millennials that are going to the West for the job opportunities. And they\u2019re just going to jump around a little bit more. So, we\u2019re not overly concerned with that today.","Dan Oppenheim","And then secondly wondering about the -- so The Wolff joint venture and just thinking about development overall here in the -- at this point in the cycle, given sort of what has happened in terms of the upward move in rents or in such couple of years, will you look for more opportunities to participate in development this way or a potentially putting a shorter time between putting the capital and sort of having building in lease-up than it would be if you were buying land given the land appreciation to the risk at this time?","Tom Herzog","Yes this is Herzog again. I\u2019ll start and let Harry pick up behind me. We still feel that if we pencil development deals in general, we're still targeting 150 to 200 basis point spread over market rates and we still see plenty of deals that meet those standard and that\u2019s true that not as many deals pencil today as might have penciled a year or two ago. But when we look at The Wolff deal, one of the things we really like is it is a much shorter period to stabilization because these projects are already well half underway and so we reach the goal a lot sooner. So as we think about this relative to our pipeline of 900 million to 1.4 billion with anticipated deliveries, of call it 350 million a year or $350 million of your spend. This ties in very much to the strategic plan that we have -- we\u2019ve previously communicated. So this definitely falls in line with the game plan that we\u2019ve had around development. Harry, anything you'd add to that?","Harry Alcock","No and I think you touched on it, that one of the things we looked at and liked about The Wolff transaction is that the initial deliveries whereas in a typical development deal when you are three or four years out from the time you start the planning process in The Wolff transaction initial deliveries are 11 or 12 months from now and stabilization follows about a year later so Wolff does get us there much more quickly.","Operator","And next will be Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","So, I just want to make sure I understand that with 900 million to 1.4 billion of target range in your development that\u2019s just what you got now plus Wolff is that right?","Tom Herzog","Yes, what we have now plus Pacific City plus Wolff.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And regarding Wolff you said the all-in stabilized yield is estimated five if you pull the trigger on acquiring assets, does that mean you\u2019re buying a low four on the actual incremental deal because you\u2019re getting the 6.5 to start with?","Tom Herzog","No I think the math is, it\u2019s a, the 6.5 doesn\u2019t come into play in terms of calculating the stabilized yield. If you take the 5.4% that we\u2019re going to achieve for the first 48% it would be a mid for us for the incremental 52%. So we are assuming we acquired all five proprieties we\u2019d be somewhere in that 5% or low 5% range. That includes property tax reassessment in the California property so that sort of diluted the return somewhat but that\u2019s fully incorporated into the underwriting and the reality is that if we sell the property or two loan exercise on all of them and to monetize those gains and apply it against the retain fees that we would be at somewhere in the mid fives. And when we\u2019re talking about underwriting, we\u2019ve underwrote these things in a fairly conservative manner. We\u2019ve assumed revenue growth of roughly 3% per year for the next couple of years through stabilization.","Rich Anderson","So the total price is 597, right and that includes 136 that you\u2019re getting a 6.5% return on. So I can\u2019t imagine how the number is for the incremental amount above the 136 isn\u2019t something below five to get to an average an all-in average of five?","Tom Herzog","Rich, the 136, I\u2019ll say the same thing Harry said a little different though. The 136 million based on that going in price is -- comes in at a 5.4.","Rich Anderson","Okay, that actually, okay, I got you. All right, yes I got it.","Tom Herzog","I want to be real clear, and I\u2019d probably answer your question but just one other item to clarify. When we acquire the remaining portion that we don\u2019t own for those assets that we chose to exercise the option. You got to look at that as just we\u2019re acquiring at that point a new stabilized asset for that additional purchase price.","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Tom Herzog","So, when Harry speaks to the mid 4s that is on a stabilized asset.","Rich Anderson","And then Jerry, I can hear you\u2019re chomping a bit to say that DC has recovered but I mean is there any talk about adding to your investment thesis in DC at this point before we really recovers I mean whether it would be development or looking for assets or just nothing there right now that pencils for you at this point?","Jerry Davis","I\u2019ll start it to Harry in a second. One thing I will tell you Rich is, we\u2019ve been going and looking at opportunities to do renovation properties and we are in the midst of one out in the Fairfax County right now underwriting it with a hopeful start later this year when we think we can do some value-add. We also have some more modest renovation opportunities inside the Beltway but I know Harry has been looking at product inside the Beltway and I will let him give an update on that.","Harry Alcock","And Rich if you think about sort of a development strategy that we\u2019ve talked about historically it\u2019s a deal that we\u2019re going to have sort of one property under construction in each market at any given time. So as we for example finish our Pier 4 deal in Downtime Boston we just recently acquired a land site and in the south then with the expectation that we\u2019re going to start next year. As it applies to DC we have our DelRay property that is where we have completed construction and are in the midst of lease-up. Our hope and expectation would be that at some point in the near future that we have a new DC development asset that we can start to construct and we\u2019re actively sourcing those opportunities now.","Operator","And next will be Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","And Tom I was hoping to get a couple of questions on the guidance. What is the reason for interest expense now going down versus your prior guidance and can you just remind us the capitalized interest you expect this year?","Tom Toomey","Yes hi Nick, we took it from 1.25 to 1.30 down to 1.20 to 1.25, and just a couple of items on that, most of it\u2019s due to the delay in the bonds issuance. Just based on timing that we previously had in the plan and we\u2019re comfortable at this point pushing that back to the, towards the latter half of the second quarter. And a little bit of timing on cap interest on one of should development assets. So that's what makes up that difference. And as to cap interest, I could add it up out of the -- I want to say it\u2019s like $5 million of quarter. That's just from memory. I think that's right, but I can add it up and you can call me after the call if you like and I can verify that. But I think it's in that range.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Got it, thanks. And then just going back to the Wolff joint venture, can you just talk about why it sort of made sense to -- if you guys have been citing 150 to 200 business points as a spread on development in this deal, at the end of the day it's going to be 50 to 125 basis points. Why it\u2019s only made sense to take that lower spread and then just I guess separate from that on the future met life JV development, is that also sort of a lower spread than where you guys are doing stuff from balance sheet?","Harry","This is Harry. I think the whole question -- we view this really as a hybrid between an acquisition and a pure development. So if you think about it long kind of the risk return spectrum, you start all the way to the left where you have a fully occupied or nearly fully occupied property and operating results that are well known at a kind of a fore cap rate for these types of assets. And then you take it all the way to a pure development where the results won't be known from three years to four years from the time they just started sort of the designed process and go through the construction and lease up period and have full risk on construction and as well as lease up -- it didn't get somewhere in the 6% plus return on that when Wolff fell right in the middle where we'll be in the fives. We'll start initial occupancy in a year. Our partner has all construction and cost risk and so it really is a hybrid. In addition, rather than having the drag associated with the pure development deal, we did 6.5% coupon on our invested capital through the construction and lease up period.","Oh I'm sorry, the second part of the question was MetLife. So the main Mountain View property that we just started, we haven\u2019t talked about returns, but that property we would expect to be at the very high end of our 150 to 200 basis points spread, probably above that. We have a couple other properties that could start in the MetLife portfolio later this year, two in LA and possibly a new phase at the [indiscernible] and we're still working through the design and the economics of those assets and we'll talk about it at the time but then we get there. The 3033 Wilshire deal that we started last year, again we would expect to be at the high end of our 150 to 200 basis points spread on the market cap rates, but we'll talk about that more as we get closer to completion. ","Operator","And the next question will come from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alex Goldfarb","I guess we'll continue the Wolff. So maybe this is for Warren. On the deal, the Wolff Company has the right to get a 6.5% preferred equity if you guys don't buy at least two of the five deals. The economics would seem punitive to you guys if you didn't. So apart from providing them comfort with here -- that you guys will take at least two of the deals, what are other reasons why you would not exercise that apart from obviously the market falling at or better, something like that?","Tom Toomey","Well. Alex, as Harry said, one of the things we really like is that we have the option and the ability to look once we get to the utilization and once we get to our window and we can look at the properties, making new investments and deciding which one we'd like. Wolff, one of the two of five which are really just to give them some comfort that we were going to perform, but as we said to one of your earlier questions, we initially started with 10 properties and went through the investment analysis and the joint venture hopefully will be safe towards the process negotiating for one final property. So I think from a real estate -- I think perspective Jerry and Harry feel very comfortable with the six that we have in the JV, and like I said, we'll be able to make that decision at the option time.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. And then Tom Herzog, on the ATM in the press release and your comments, you mentioned the stock trading above NAV. Yes, above consensus NAV. Looking at SNL, the NAV right is around $33. At year end it was $31.50. You guys issued at like $32 - $30 gross or $31.16 set. So one, sounds dilutive to where or below where consensus NAV is. But second is a lot of companies talk about that chain, the issuance of the ATM, what they use, and I didn't hear you guys talk about it, but maybe that's the way you look at it. So should we expect that every time your stocks trades above $32 you guys are issuing ATM or is it truly a face of where you have investment opportunity that's above your implied cap rate than your issuing?","Tom Toomey","Okay, multiple questions there. Let me see if I can get them all. The first question was we issued at a net price on the $109 million at $31.64. That\u2019s correct. You got to remember we were issuing most of that at the very beginning of 2015. So the lease of January 6, January 12, that\u2019s when the majority of it occurred. So when we think of an average of what the consensus NAV was at that time, and you guys will recall that early in the year that NAV started to move fairly quickly. We had an average consensus NAV during the issuance period during the same time they were issuing these shares of $31.07. So on a net basis we came in at $31.64 and the consensus NAV was $31.07.","I think the second question was, you note that we utilized the ATM -- I would -- and if our price exceeds that which allows us to issue at or above what we continue to do so, what I would reference back is the remarks that I made in the first quarter call when we spoke to our different uses of funds, which are set forth in that trader [ph] strategic document where we had development cost, we had certain acquisitions, spend and so we sort of bucket of funding needs for the year and we spoke to three sources that we would fund them with; and that was issuance of stock, sales of assets and debt. And we have executed to that as we had indicated we would and we said that we would identify what we thought the most favorable sources of funds to fund our needs and we have done that and we\u2019ll continue to do that.","As we look at where we stand today after picking up the various fundings that we\u2019ve already completed, I guess it\u2019s probably important for me to remind you that a good portion has already been funded. We\u2019ve tweaked our guidance a little bit on attachment 15, but the changes are not major. You will see that when you compare the old attach from 15 to the new which provides our guidance. And we have already funded a 109 -- we started with a need of $825 million. ROE, it has adjusted for the latest adjustments. We funded 109 in the ATM. The Texas JV brought in 43. We\u2019ve got sales under contract of 65 and we\u2019ve got more out there that will go under contract. We\u2019ve got 300 million of debt that I\u2019ve already alluded to that will likely come in at the end of the second quarter. And what that really means is we\u2019ve got about $250 million to $300 million remaining for the entire year, which is a relatively small number for us as you know and we continue to state that we will use the most advantageous funding source for that purpose.","Operator","And then next will be Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Chris for Ian. Monterey and Portland are essentially non-core markets that continue to generate very strong rent growth and have occupancy over 97, and I think in Portland\u2019s case 98%. Obviously when rent growth was increasing in the high single digit, it lowers the urgency to sell, but just curious about your thoughts about market timing or whether you\u2019re more like performance agnostic when it comes to exiting out of those markets?","Jerry Davis","This is Jerry. I guess I would start with -- you\u2019re correct. These two non-core markets are performing extremely well. And I would remind people that when you do look at our non-core markets, it\u2019s not always because they\u2019re underperformers. They just don\u2019t meet our strategic initiatives and plan. And I think at times it\u2019s best to actually exit a market when it\u2019s at the top. So in a second Harry will give you an update on some of the transactions that he is looking at in those markets. But today the operating teams are doing an extremely good job and markets that have good fundamentals. But again they don\u2019t fit our core strategic focus of these gateway markets that are bicoastal. Even though they\u2019re in the coast, our preference would still be for Seattle over Portland.","And while the Monterey Peninsula market has done extremely well, the average rents in that market are fairly low. It caters more to an agricultural economy. And longer term we grow their CR assets in some of the other markets in the West Coast or East Coast but when you think about San Francisco, Seattle, Orange County, LA, a more comfortable long term.","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. I think I\u2019d just add that we will continue to chip away at these properties to meet our sales objectives, to just give you kind of an overview of the properties that we\u2019re working on now. We have two properties that are in central Florida that are under contract, one in Tampa, one in Orlando. And to your point on Portland, we have one of our three assets in Portland that's currently in the market. We\u2019re getting terrific investor interest and would expect to close that sometime in the third quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","So it sounds like you have a mix of assets out to market regardless of how those markets are performing. Now that you\u2019re said that you\u2019re kind of more -- you would tend more to sell assets that are performing well than those that are kind of laggard, is that kind of what I am hearing?","Tom Toomey","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I -- if I said it, I didn\u2019t mean it in that context. What I was saying is just because a market is performing well, we\u2019re not going to hold on to it ride out strong NOI growth and wait till it starts to go on a down cycle. Jerry can get optimal pricing when there is still some upside opportunity. So we don\u2019t wait till the market is about to turn south to mark it for sale. That's what I meant to say.","Unidentified Analyst","And then I apologize if I missed this, but revenue growth came in at 5.1% for the first quarter. It sounds like things are accelerating over the last month. And then guidance is up 4.25 to 4.75. Just wondering where the drop is going to come from?","Tom Toomey","It's really occupancy. You look at the two components that really drive revenue growth, one is change in occupancy, the other is change in rent per occupied home. And then the first quarter it was 60 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year and 4.6% growth in rents. We will most likely not have the opportunity in last three quarters of the year to see that same occupancy growth since we pushed occupancy last year up starting in 2Q to the high 96 levels. So it's predominantly going to come from rent growth. That being said, if I had to look at it today based on the trends, we\u2019re probably moving more to the middle to high side of our guidance number, then we are too below.","Operator","And next will be Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler","So just curious -- I'm coming back to Wolff one more time. Can you offer price versus development cost to Wolff? I'm curious about how the 559 compares versus their basis and ultimately sort of the premium replacement cost here?","Tom Toomey","I\u2019ll start with that Jordan. I think -- I don\u2019t know that we have the -- I know that we don\u2019t have the exact -- their exact cost numbers. Suffice to say this a premium to the resisting cost, but I think I'd point to that the 559 is $357,000 per apartment home and the 597 is prudent to be exercised the options on over -- and the remaining 52% on all five properties is $380,000 per apartment home. So neither of those are numbers that are alarming over the field, particularly rolled us from a new construction standpoint.","Jordan Sadler","And I guess there was a previous question surrounding this I think regarding the motivation of this at this point. As you guys are pointing to potentially $80 million of value creation, it seems like a pretty short window to get there. I think we\u2019re talking about lease-up commencing in as little as seven months for some of these. Can you maybe sort of talk about what the trigger might have been or why there is this opportunity for that amount of value creation in this relative to 136 million of principal in this shorter window of time in this environment?","Tom Toomey","So Jordan, the way that I think about it is rather than pointing to $80 million of $136 million, we get the point to $80 million on $597 million which is the total aggregate purchase price assuming we acquire all five assets. But what Wolff gets is -- again, I think I mentioned at the beginning of the call they get -- first they get return capital to their open ended fund, which is favorable for them, I assume on then assume many levels including the fact that they get to redeploy these assets.","And secondly, Wolff has a robust pipeline of additional opportunities. In their minds they were over allocated on the development side to both Southern California and to Seattle and therefore they we having just sort of forego other opportunities. So from their perspective they get a couple of -- there is a couple of significant benefits to that.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] here. I had just one quick one as well. Jerry you may have touched on in a bit at the end of the last question, but given sort of where you guys finished in the first quarter, both top-line growth and same store NOI, and the accelerating trends you\u2019ve seen really into May and June, what\u2019s kind of held you back on raising the same-store growth even higher?","Jerry Davis","I guess just caution as we go further into the leasing season, and again we have visibility into June during the months of the third quarter you got another 30% of the properties, the leases that will reprised. Today again I am more optimistic that we're going to push towards the high-end than I am to the low end, but we have another couple of quarters later this year to take a look at it. But today I can\u2019t tell you anything that I see that's excessively negative.","Operator","And next will be Rob Stevenson with [indiscernible].","Rob Stevenson","No Wolff questions I promise. Just two quick ones here, Jerry how many projects or dollar value do you think you're going to put into the redevelopment pipeline this year?","Jerry Davis","We anticipate -- and these will all be later in the year. We anticipate --three to seven would be my estimate. There will probably be a handful of those that are in the $15 million to $20 million range, and then some that will be under $10 million. So you\u2019re not going to see any -- I believe we had guidance Tom for a redevelopment. So what was that number?","Tom Toomey","The spend is somewhere -- that's going to be as adjusted about $350 million for the year. That\u2019s development [indiscernible]","Jerry Davis","But we don\u2019t see any of the redevelopments we\u2019re anticipating right now Rob being of the size of some of the ones we've done over the last couple of years.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So it\u2019s going to be less than $100 million of incremental assets going in there if I'm just using fixed project at $50 million gives me $90 million or something in that neighborhood will be the sort of upper end you think?","Tom Toomey","I think it\u2019s less than that I can\u2019t say it\u2019s probably more enough 50 range at the high end.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. ","Tom Toomey","And that would be start this year. A lot of the spend would actually be next year. ","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then Tom Herzog. Just a quick one. With the $0.03 gap between FFO and FFO as adjusted in the first quarter, when I look at the full year announcement, does that mean that you're at this point not including anything else that would be a gap a between FFO and FFO as adjusted for the last three quarters.","Tom Herzog","Right.","Rob Stevenson","Okay.","Tom Herzog","Nothing of any significance. You can see that the couple of odds and ends in the -- attached from \u201815, but all the big stuff would be passed, which was really the Texas JV promote and dispo fee. ","Operator","And next will be Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste ","So I guess first for you Mr. Herzog, quick one on capital allocation. Help me understand the decision to raise the dividend by 7% during the quarter while you\u2019re selling about 109 million stock in your ATM. Is there after-tax issue or something I'm not fully appreciating there?","Tom Herzog","No, we just looked at our coverage, we looked at the growth of our AFFO, and as we\u2019ve lined out the last couple of three years, we wanted our dividend growth to largely reflect our AFFO growth. So nothing has changed on that front. It wasn\u2019t the tax issue. And we'll contaminate that as we think forward the next couple of years, as you look at our plan too, you\u2019ll see that our dividend growth coincides with our AFFO growth.","Haendel St. Juste ","Okay. And now that you fully liquidated the Texas JV with Fannie Mae, can share what the IRR was? We felt a cap rate of about 6% on recent sales assets but curious what the return of the likely investment was?","Tom Herzog","The all in IRR on it was 14%. ","Haendel St. Juste ","That\u2019s levered?","Tom Herzog","Yes.","Haendel St. Juste ","Okay. And you guys mentioned the four assets you chose not to pursue with Wolff. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it or not, but did you mention why you weren\u2019t pursuing those? Perhaps they were markets you don\u2019t want to exposure to? Was it a size issue? Maybe you don\u2019t want to take too big of a portfolio? Can you give me some sense as to you opted not to pursue the other four?","Harry","Haendel, this is Harry, -- take on the quality of the assets and their specific submarkets.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Last one, Jerry on Seattle -- recently the supply that hit downtown Seattle was -- you absorbed without much of impact. But now the fund shift over to Belvieu which is a much smaller submarket and some forecast suggest that Belvieu might -- they're seeing a 20% expense ratio on supply over the next couple years. And given that Belvieu is where you and a couple of your peers are effectively concentrated, curious on -- I guess you still have good pricing product today but your expectations for the market over the course of this year into next, thoughts on perhaps operating strategy. And would you guys perhaps consider culling some of your portfolio there, especially given not only the supply outlook but you guys acquired it looks like two asset, the Wolff link up.","Jerry Davis","We like Belvieu very much. Now there is job growth continuing that there even though Expedia is moving their headquarters over to Seattle from Belvieu we think it will get refurnished within downtown Belvieu which is a growing and vibrant city to be honest with you. We continue to see revenue growth so far this year north of 6%. We have a very high end A portfolio there, although as you stated there is significant new supply that is coming to that market. We think Belvieu caters a lot of the east side job centers, whether it\u2019s Microsoft or downtown Belvieu, or Google employers on the east side. I don\u2019t think we would be looking to downsize Belvieu. Two of our deals are MetLife JVs and then very high end we have the Element Steels which -- they're extremely well with the workforce in Belvieu and we have one property down in the downtown area Belvieu that's only about 80 units. That typically does very well although this year as you noted it surrounded by supply and it\u2019s probably suffering the most with revenue growth that\u2019s roughly flat compared to the 6% or 7% to the rest of that sub market.","The two deals that we did we get in the Wolff transaction related to this are ones in Salt lake [ph] Union, which we're excited to have one downtown presence. Currently we really have one 50-5o JV deal with Met down there. That's probably the best property in all of downtown Seattle. This property provides us with -- I think of it is a dormitory for Amazon workers. It' surrounded right in the middle of the Amazon campus. So I think that is going to do extremely. And then other deal is then Columbia city which is probably 5 - 6 miles south of the downtown area. The thing we like most about that property is it's right on the LiveRail. It's directly across street and it's in an emerging neighborhood that we think has a ton of upside growth. And what we really like about that -- because a lot of our portfolio in Seattle is a product, this is a price point is about 65% to 70% of what downtown rents are. So it's a great alternative to those people that want to want to have more of an urban feel but can't afford downtown Seattle. So I know it's at long question about Seattle but we are very bullish on Seattle. You're right. That city, [indiscernible] new supply but the job growth was more than sufficient and we continue to be very excited about really growing our exposure in that market.","Operator","And next will be Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky","Just to go back to Wolff a little fast, the assets you guys are requiring, are those in the same fund? And then as you look at Wolff -- obviously MetLife being a long term joint venture, I think you've characterized their [indiscernible] joint venture as an intermediate term. How would you characterize the Wolff joint venture?","Unidentified Company Representative ","Michael, t Wolff assets are all in one fund. And then as you know on this one it has a finite life. It's less than six years, and [indiscernible] periods start in this second year. So this is a lot different than what we have in terms of long term MetLife count joint venture.","Michael Salinsky","Alright. It's helpful. Then my follow up question, G&A guidance went up for the quarter and you brought in your corporate headquarters. Why -- I would have thought buying that in what have actually reduced unit. What was the reason for the G&A increase?","Unidentified Company Representative ","But we had the increased performance and FFO which impacted the LTI plan. And so that's what the net increases over time.","Operator","And next will be Drew Bewin [ph] with Robert W. Baird and Company.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, guys. It's actually for you Jerry, on the Marina del Rey concentration in Los Angeles. I was hoping you could talk about the growth in that area and what ultimately kind of gets that market out of the --and how the flattish environment -- it's then persisting and furthermore maybe talk about other operational improvements you're making elsewhere on the west coast to improve growth just beyond what the market is providing and to win more of those markets.","Jerry Davis","Sure. Yeah start on Marina del Rey, and as you pointed out, it has struggled. Our revenue growth -- this quarter my expectation will be the lowest in the sector at 3.8%. About 80 to 90% of our same store portfolio is in the Marina and when you look at the Marina it has been hit with new supplies down at Playa Vista which an adjacent sub markets, your buying company and several other operators have been building there over the last couple of years. And while it struggled last year and this year, our expectation is that as you get into 2016 and 2017, when the sliver comp [ph] beach really starts cranking out the jobs which are projected to be probably about 10,000, whether it's Google, Yahoo, [indiscernible], several other tech employers are coming to that sub market. We think our proximity to the jobs is going to more than offset what's been hurting us with our proximity to the new supply. So it's just a situation where the supply beat the jobs, and we would expect in 2016 and 2017 to see that get quite a bit better.","As far as initiatives in the west coast, we were really run the same initiatives, whether it's east coast or west coast. One thing we have been doing down in our Orange County portfolio is investing some revenue enhancing dollars which Herzog requires and we comply with getting a 200 basis points over [indiscernible] IRR, which typically is about a 20% return on your money. But we're looking for opportunities to upgrade those 40 plus year old properties that we've maintained well but we haven\u2019t improved the functionality since we bought a lot of those assets back in the mid-2000s. So they were due and we've been putting some of that $30 million or so that we get guidance, revenue enhancing dollars since beginning the year. It's heavily growing into the west coast. As you look up into the San Francisco area where we had 9% revenue growth, on a situation there honestly as we don't have anything in the east bay, the downtown area, the jobs are coming, again commonly but I said about the Marina del Rey area. The financial district is going to have significant job growth over the next couple of years but that's also where the new supply is coming. We are fairly heavy in that some area. And then up in in Seattle, I think about 80% of our portfolio up there is a product, and even though new supply haven\u2019t hurt it too much, it has had an impact on it. So no real new initiatives, although we are looking for opportunities like I said in So-Cal to reinvest even more in our real estate to give our residents some of the things they\u2019re looking for.","Unidentified Analyst","And one follow up, shifting to the East Coast, as you look at markets like Boston and New York where obviously condos in the city are very pricey, people are -- they want to be in the city. Renting is still the most attractive option. Given the public transportation systems of both of those markets, there is always options that somebody really wants to get out if they\u2019re willing to spend like commute to save money. Are you seeing anything in those markets, whether it\u2019d move outs to buy ratios or sort of where people are interested in renting? It would indicate that there is some potential rent fatigue there.","Jerry Davis","We think our renting demographic wants to be in that urban core, and they have various things they have to spend money on. And when you\u2019re living in urban core, you get to cut down on your transportation cost, which can run upwards of $1,000 and they just make trade-offs. But that younger demographic that we\u2019re typically focused on in those urban markets have a high preference to be in the downtown locations, their entertainment, their jobs. And you'll always get few people that will move out to the next ring, whether it's in San Francisco going to Oakland, Manhattan going to Brooklyn or Jersey. Only one of those markets you brought up that I continue to see a fairly high new downtown purchases since the Boston market which historically since we benefited last three to four years has been one of our highest move out to home purchase markets at over 20%.","Operator","And next will be Connor Wagner with Greenstreet Advisors.","Connor Wagner","Jerry on DC last quarter you provided some good commentary on the split between the deals outside of the Beltway, how they are performing in the Asian side of the Beltway. Just wondering if you could update that for the first quarter and placed in April?","Jerry Davis","Deals outside-inside, as I stated I think earlier on the call, they\u2019re starting to compress to where either it's a B or it's an A or it's inside or outside, they\u2019re all getting more to the point where they\u2019re averaging between 1% and 2%. So the differentiation is tightening. My As actually were at about 1.9% revenue growth during the quarter and my B\u2019s we\u2019re about 1.2%. So the A\u2019s actually did pick up. And again I think that was because they had more supply pressure last year for concessions. We\u2019re keeping the price down. And honestly what\u2019s been interesting for the same reason is my urban product which is more of the inside of the Beltway, and revenue growth of high twos and my suburban was just slightly negative. So we kind of have flipped a little bit where the suburban A is starting to pick up steam.","Then when you look at how does April looked, in DC my new lease rate growth was 0.8% in April. That\u2019s probably if I look back the first time, that number has been positive in the last year and half. So it did go positive at 0.8 and my renewal growth in the month of April in DC, and these are effective numbers, is 5.6%. So DC is starting to look a lot more like the rest of the portfolio. It\u2019s getting there.","Connor Wagner","Thank you. And then last one Jerry, on Austin we\u2019ve seen job growth decelerate obviously at the high number over the last year. Have you seen any slowdown in your portfolio or between the properties that you have that are more within city limits versus the suburban ones?","Jerry Davis","Well, haven\u2019t really noticed the job growth slow as well as far as the performance of my properties we have seen our downtown product, which competes with new supply as a rough patch at times. We have another property up north at the domain shopping center where new supply is also effective, even though it's kind of in a tech corridor. So we like it long term. But Austin is definitely a market that has seen a slowdown from last year to this year just as absorption of that supply is occurring. Although Austin goes through these waves where you will have new supply grow 10%-12% over a three year period. It will be difficult three years but then as soon as they eat that up, it takes off again.","So -- but Austin right now, I just told you the good news about DC accelerating. When I look at Austin my new lease rate growth in the month of April is negative 0.3%, and that compares to about 2%-2.5% in the first quarter. So, we are definitely feeling some pressure in Austin today.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess I had a couple of just quick questions going back to the Wolff transaction. You talked about certain guarantees. What are those guarantees?","Tom Toomey","Jerry, do you want to take that one?","Jerry Davis","I can\u2019t.","Warren Troupe","This is Warren. The completion guarantee is under the construction loan and certain other non-recourse bad void guarantees.","Unidentified Analyst","What are the total construction loans and what are the terms in terms of the amount and maturity date and rate?","Warren Troupe","The average price for construction loan is about 210 and the total amount of construction loans, it's about 275 million and our UDR share would be about $140 million. So of that 2017 maturities would be approximately $173 million, 2018 maturities would be $39 million. Of those UDR shares will be 84 million in 2017 and approximately $19 million and 2018. All construction loans have two-year extension feature.","Unidentified Analyst","And then the all-in construction cost that they guaranteed, I take it, it's like $400 million. Is that what you said to Jordan before?","Harry Alcock","No, we didn\u2019t talk about the all-in construction cost, Michael. This is Harry. ","Unidentified Analyst","So what is the all-in -- I guess the $275 million of debt, 70% LTV is $400 million. Is that a fair?","Harry Alcock","Yes, the number is probably higher than that but we didn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t have that handy and we didn\u2019t speak to the all-in construction cost start. Our buy in price is 559 million. So what we did say is that construction cost is below our volume price.","Tom Toomey","And you're right that the partner is responsible for all cost overruns and the guarantees on the construction loans.","Unidentified Analyst","Do you guys have any involvement in the lease-up? Do you have any share of responsibilities at all and or was it just all-in there?","Tom Toomey","We\u2019re actually going to be the property manager for each of the properties and Jerry\u2019s team will be doing the lease-up on the properties.","Unidentified Analyst","And what\u2019s the guarantee in terms of that they are not going to try cost at a higher margin and higher profit in terms of -- rather than being effectively a merchant builder in this case, what\u2019s going to be the recourse that you have to make sure whether [indiscernible] spent is in?","Harry Alcock","Michael its Harry. They are a required facility to the documents to build the property in accordance with the approved plans and specs. These properties are all in a construction. We\u2019ve reviewed the plans and specs of -- we\u2019re going to hire a third-party construction manager to participate in the weekly OAC meetings, constructions meetings and get weekly reports or monthly reports from Wolff. So we\u2019re going to have sort of kind of an active oversight rule in that process.","Tom Toomey","One other thing I would mention is part of the due diligence process, Harry's team have actually now look at existing Wolff product. So we\u2019re familiar with their construction, we\u2019re familiar with their product. We have teams now have been meeting the Wolff people and going through finishes, going through layouts and so I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we're going to have a very active role and a very active voice in this whole process.","Unidentified Analyst","And then your 6.5 preferred return -- that's a -- is it a pit payment or is it actually a cash payment from Wolff on your equity?","Tom Toomey","6.5 is going to get paid Michael at the end -- at the time that we take the asset out.","Unidentified Analyst","And does that include equity or is that actually a preferred payment? It's actually overturn or is it go towards your equity to buyout the next piece.","Tom Toomey","Yes, it's actually a return on our investment. It's compounded as we go.","Unidentified Analyst","So it's a real return. It's not \u2026","Tom Toomey","It's a real return.","Tom Herzog","And then just one other guarantee that Warren might have spoken to us, and I think we spoke earlier, but keep in mind at any operating losses during that development period are included by Wolff up to the point stabilization. So that\u2019s another form of guarantee from our perspective.","Unidentified Analyst","And then outside of refinancing the debt, you're payment to them when you -- when these stabilize to own 100% is just the $38 million additional of equity and then are you blaming now [ph] you would have to fund then do a refinancing?","Tom Herzog","Yes, that\u2019s correct. We\u2019ve got debt that comes due. There's some delay on that and take a two to three years out as these options become exercisable and that debt comes due -- we can choose to fund that -- whatever the most advantageous way is. And keep in mind too that if we choose not to acquire one or two of the assets, that that can also act towards the funding. But as we talking, but we would be looking at all five assets as having appeal from a purchase perspective, but we\u2019re through a place out on that.","Unidentified Analyst","But your total, if you're on 136, you have to fund the difference between the 136 and the 597 outside any debt loans?","Tom Herzog","That\u2019s correct, after the debt is still.","Unidentified Analyst","So whichever ones we acquire?","Tom Herzog","Correct.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the conference call back over to President and CEO Mr. Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Well first let me say thank you for your time today. It was very productive. And we appreciate your interest in UDR. As we started the call business is great and bordering on fantastic. You can obviously hear from the call our level of enthusiasm for where operating trends are headed and the opportunities that lie ahead and we\u2019ll continue to execute on our two year plan and believe that that is a great path for UDR and for our shareholders. So with that take care and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation today.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher Van Ens","Welcome to UDR\u2019s fourth quarter financial results conference call. Our fourth quarter press release supplemental disclosure package and 2017\/2018 Strategic Outlook document were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.","Prior to reading our Safe Harbor disclosure, I would like to direct you to the webcast of this call located in the Investor Relations section of our website ir.udr.com. The webcast includes a slide presentation that will accompany our 2017\/2018 Strategic Outlook commentary. On to our Safe Harbor, statements made during this call, which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements.","Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectable of everyone\u2019s time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone and welcome to UDR\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe, Harry Alcock and Shawn Johnston, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","Later in this call, we will present our 2017\/2018 Strategic Outlook as we have done in the last four years. As is evident in the outlook document, we continue to execute well on our primary strategic objectives, which are operational excellence, maintaining portfolio diversification, allocating capital to accretive growth opportunities and strengthening our balance sheet. Focusing on these core principles provides a robust environment for driving total shareholder return, and we'll continue to make UDR our full cycle investment.","Moving on to 2016, it was another strong year for UDR, and one that included a number of achievements for the Company. First, the strength of our best-in-class operating platform and portfolio diversification was again evident, allowing us to maintain same-store guidance throughout the year, while effectively combating the marketplace that was choppier than expected. Second, our external growth remained highly accretive. Third, our balance sheet metrics continue to improve enhancing both liquidity for the Company and safety for our investors. Fourth, we join the S&P 500 and accomplishment that places us in a select group of only 27 other property REITs.","In short, these accomplishments showcase another year of successfully executing our long-term strategies, as set forth in our Strategic Outlook. All of the credit for these successes goes to our associates in the field and in the corporate office as they face daily market challenges and a CFO change. I would like to sincerely thank everyone in the organization for their dedication and hard work throughout 2016.","Next, as we move into 2017, we are confident that the outlook for the long-term apartment fundamentals remains strong despite short-term challenges in the form of new supply coupled with elevated concession levels, which are forecast to abate as we move into the second half of 2017. In total, we expect this year will again produce topline and bottom line growth in excess of long-term averages.","Lastly, we remain confident that UDR is doing the right things, and has the right team in place to create long-term value for our shareholders. Adhering to our Strategic Outlook\u2019s core principles will continue to help us generate high-quality cash flow, dividend, and NAV growth for many years to come.","I will provide further commentary regarding our 2017\/2018 Strategic Outlook later in the call, but will turn it over to Jerry for additional comments on the quarter.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. During the fourth quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.0% and 5.3% respectively. For full-year 2016, same-store revenue and NOI growth totaled 5.7% and 6.5% respectively.","During the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of the topline operating trends evident throughout 2016. That is overall fundamentals continue to normalize with localized demand\/supply dynamics in markets determining our ability to generate revenue growth. Making up 45% of our same-store NOI, strength was evident in Orange County, Seattle, The Monterey Peninsula, Boston and our Sunbelt markets. While San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, which comprised 30% of our same-store NOI, remained challenged primarily due to concentrated new supply and elevated concession levels.","For the year, the strength of our operating platform, combined with our diversified portfolio allowed us to effectively combat these supply driven headwinds, generate portfolio growth that compared favorably versus the apartment group average. I would like to thank all of the operating associates for making this happen.","Similar to what you heard on our last call, we focused on driving occupancy during the fourth quarter to remain full during the seasonally slower periods. While each market and community is different with regard to the trade-off between rate growth and occupancy, I envision us maintaining this strategy at the portfolio level through at least the first half of 2017.","During the fourth quarter, our occupancy averaged 96.8%, that's 20 basis points higher than in the first half of 2016 and 30 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Next portfolio-wide new lease and renewal rate growth were flat and positive 5.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We continue to see minimal pressure from single family competition with move-outs to home purchases staying flat at 14% during the fourth quarter.","Portfolio-wide affordability remains a non-issue with move-outs due to rent increase at 5%. Net bad debt remains low and at levels consistent with previous quarters. Year-over-year same-store expense growth of 4.2% was elevated during the quarter. Real Estate taxes were the primary culprit growing 9.5% year-over-year. We continue to see pressure in New York from 421 burn-offs and across many of our markets due to still rising incremental valuations. I'll provide market level expectations later in the call when we address our 2017\/2018 Strategic Outlook.","Last, our development lease ups continue to perform well, achieving rates in aggregate above original expectations and with leasing velocity is generally ahead of original forecast. The average value creation spread built into our pipeline is in excess of the top end of our 150 basis point to 200 basis point range. Community specific quarter end at lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 or Page 21 of our supplement.","Summing that up, the fourth quarter was another good quarter and 2016 was a solid year given the challenges we faced. We remain laser focused on maximizing revenue growth and constraining expense growth when possible and are confident in our ability to execute in 2017.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter results, a transactions updated, a balance sheet update and capital markets update and our first quarter and full-year guidance. Our fourth quarter earnings results were the mid to above the high end of our previously provided guidance.","FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.47, $0.46 and $0.40 respectively and were driven by solid same-store growth. Full-year 2016 earnings results came into the mid to high-end of our previously provided guidance with FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share at $1.80, $1.79 and $1.63 respectively.","Next transactions, subsequent to quarter end, we exercised our fixed price purchase option to acquire CityLine, a 244-home West Coast Development Joint Venture community located in suburban Seattle. The Company's total investment in CityLine was $86.5 million, roughly a 15% discount to the communities\u2019 estimated fair market value. This equates to a 5.3% cash flow cap rate.","As it relates to future options on the West Coast Development Joint Venture communities or Steele Creek, we will evaluate those options as they become available based on our funding capacity and potential value creation for our shareholders. For an overview of other transactions consummated during the quarter and year, please see the transaction section of our 4Q earnings press release or Attachment 13 of our 4Q supplemental.","Next to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was $1.2 billion. Our financial leverage on undepreciated book value is 32.1%, on quarter end enterprise value, it was 23.9% and inclusive of joint ventures it was 28.8%. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.1 times and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.2 times. All credit metrics continue to track well versus our strategic outlook.","Lastly, on the balance sheet. As it relates to our new $500 million commercial paper program announced last week, the program offers us an incremental source of low cost floating rate capital and is fully backed by our line of credit. Looking ahead, we do not intend to increase our floating rate debt exposure as a result of putting this facility in place.","I would like to make it clear that this facility will be utilized in place of, and not in addition to our existing line of credit. We extend our thanks to the rating agencies and our lending partners for making UDR, kind of only a limited number of REITs with access to this form of capital.","I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have provided full-year and first quarter 2017 guidance. Our full-year 2017 guidance ranges are $1.83 to $1.87 per FFO and FFO as adjusted and $1.68 to $1.72 per AFFO. Our full-year 2017, same-store guidance cost for revenue growth of 3.0% to 4.0%, expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, and NOI growth of 3.25% to 4.25% with average 2017 forecasted occupancy at 96.7%. Other primary full-year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15.","For first quarter 2017, our guidance ranges are $0.44 to $0.46 per FFO and FFO as adjusted and $0.42 to $0.44 for AFFO. Finally, we declared a common dividend of 29.5% in the fourth quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, this equates to a yield of approximately3.2% as of quarter end.","With that, I will remind those listening that there is a link to our 2017\/2018 Strategic Outlook document on the Investor Relations page of our website. We will pause for a moment, so that everyone can gather the outlook materials.","Thomas Toomey","Thanks Joe, and while you are pulling that up I just want to welcome Joe to his first of many earnings calls and it's been a joy working with him and we're looking forward to many more years of this. But now turning to our 2017\/2018 Strategic Outlook, which was published in conjunction with our earnings release yesterday afternoon. I'd like to start with some big picture thoughts.","First, as you page to the document, you will note continuity with previous strategic outlooks. Our focus on optimizing operations for preserving a diversified portfolio, investing in accretive external growth, maintaining a safe and flexible balance sheet, enhancing transparency has worked well for us and driven strong cash flow dividend and NAV growth for our shareholders.","We believe adherence to these strategies position UDR well to capitalize on opportunities in a variety of economic backdrops and parts of the real estate cycle. Specifically, our diversified portfolio accomplishes several goals, including lowering our relative exposure to any one market supply and demand trends giving our transaction team more avenues to accretively deploy capitals and provide our shareholders with a predictable growing cash flow stream. When combined with our excellent operating platform, this is what ultimately differentiates UDR and makes us a full cycle investment.","Moving to Page 3 of the outlook, we lay out our core principles. These are comprised of long-term consistent strategies that govern the path and direction of our enterprise takes. These are, one, maximize revenue and NOI growth in our markets through innovative and margin enhancing efficiency initiatives. Two, invest when appropriate in accretive internal and external opportunities that optimize returns for our investors refresh our portfolio, maintained diversification and better position us for future growth. And three, maintain a safe liquid balance sheet capable fully funding our enterprise throughout the cycle.","These strategies represent our core tenants and we believe when executed upon well, drive predictable cash flow, dividend, and NAV growth over time, while also contributing to an equitable environment for robust TSR.","Moving to Page 4. Our tactical execution of our long-term strategies can take different forms, depending on a variety of factors, including shifting market fundamentals, available growth opportunities and access to accretive capital. On this page, you can see a number of different topics that impact our daily businesses. Being flexible and proactive in all aspects of our business is crucial to our success and a differentiating factor.","Next Page 5. Consistently executing our long-term strategies has led to strong AFFO dividend and NAV growth since our initial Strategic Outlook was published in early 2013. During that time, our shareholders have been rewarded with compound annual total shareholder return of 14.9% versus the NAREIT apartment index of 12.3% and NAREIT equity index of 9.2%.","Moving on the next 9 Pages of the document outlined how we have performed versus our previous four published outlooks, in key aspects of our business and where we are going in these areas in the future. We are not going to turn each page today, but I encourage you to read through these pages in detail. You will see that our operating capital allocation, balance sheet, cash flow growth and NAV growth results since our initial outlook was published in February 2013, compare well versus previous plans.","Now, a couple highlights from that section. First, we do believe that we have the best-in-class operating platform. Whether we measure this by our ability to forecast results and trends or how we perform at the market level versus peers, we compare favorably. Second, our diversified portfolio makes UDR a full cycle investment. We value this attribute, and intend to maintain diversification by MSA price point and submarket in the years ahead. Third, our developments continue to be highly accretive. We are looking to maintain our pipeline in the range of 5% to 9% of enterprise value, but will not stretch if a deal doesn't pencil. Last, we have made significant progress on derisking our balance sheet over the years. We are comfortable where our metrics are, but we'll continue to make progress from organic growth moving forward.","Prior to closing out my comments, I'll provide a brief overview of our macro view, and how it impacts our outlook. While our budgeting and outlook process is granular and built from the bottom up, we also employ a macro overlay as a check. Today, we face the uncertainty of government deregulation, tax reform, volatile interest rates and fluctuating supply demand fundamentals at the market level. While we do not know where these factors will ultimately settle, we lean towards an optimistic longer-term outlook on apartment fundamentals balanced against the pragmatic patient view of our business.","Consensus expectations for continued job growth of 150,000 to 200,000 per month in 2017 feels appropriate and results in a relatively balanced supply demand environment through the first half of the year before supply begins to subside in the second half of 2017. From an incremental capital deployment perspective, we are in an excellent position to remain patient, but will still look to capitalize on growth opportunities, should they meet our hurdle rates using conservative underwriting. Ultimately, we are willing to say no to deals if they do not pencil and simply focus on operating our real estate.","To close out my comments, the runway for solid growth in the apartment industry remains long in our view. While it is true that new supply has presented short-term challenges, we see this choppiness in the market as an opportunity for UDR to outperform versus peers. We look forward to another strong year in 2017 and successfully executing our latest Strategic Outlook.","With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to speak about 2017\/2018 expectations.","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Tom. Please turn to Page 15 of the document. On this page, we lay out our 2017 guidance, much of which I covered in my prepared remarks and our initial outlook for 2018. We expect that both years will produce same-store growth in excess of historical averages, I would like to stress that our initial 2018 expectations reflect how we currently view next year's fundamentals point out. Of course expectations for 2018 will change as 2017 progresses, but as in years past, we will not be updating our out year expectations until we provide 2018 guidance a year from now.","Moving down the sources and uses, as you can see we have minimal debt coming due in 2017 with more debt coming due in 2018. As we move through 2017, you can expect that we will be continuously evaluating our options with regard to the 2018 maturities. Lastly, development spend will remain at primary use of capital during both 2017 and 2018 largely funded with free cash flow and dispositions. Regarding the balance sheet, we expect our credit metrics to continue to organically improve at a measured pace and both years.","Now I will turn it over to Jerry to comment on the market level expectations.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Joe. Please turn to Page 16 of the document for our market level 2017 same-store revenue growth expectations. See from the map, we expect that the Pacific Northwest, the Monterey Peninsula, Southern California, Boston and many of our Sunbelt markets will continue to generate same-store revenue growth in excess of our portfolio average. This includes Los Angeles where we were negatively impacted by new supply in 2016.","Washington D.C. is expected to incrementally accelerate versus 2016 and is now forecast to be a portfolio average growth market in 2017. Please note that this forecast incorporate same-store additions and D.C. in 2017, including five of the six home properties, which will increase D.C.\u2019s share of our same-store NOI to approximately 19%.","New York, San Francisco and some smaller markets will continue to struggle in 2017. New York and San Francisco especially will continue to be impacted by still elevated supply coming online in 2017, although San Francisco additions are expected to peak in the first half of the year, potentially setting us up for a better 2018.","Last, as we consider new supply in 2017, our data providers are forecasting national deliveries of approximately 370,000 new apartment homes. Of this 175,000 homes or 47% of national deliveries are expected to impact the markets where we operate. Of the supply coming into our markets around 28% or 48,400 homes are expected to be added in our submarkets in 2017.","Regarding how supply will be delivered as 2017 unfolds, our submarkets are expected to see average quarterly deliveries of approximately 13,000 homes in the first half of the year as compared to11,000 quarterly deliveries in the back half of 2016. In the second half of 2017, deliveries should fall back to approximately 11,000 per quarter on average.","With that, I'll open the call up for questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. For 2017 same-store revenue guidance, what are the assumptions embedded in achieving either the high end, or the low end of that range?","Jerry Davis","Yes. Nick, this is Jerry. Basically the key differentiating factor on that is going to be, what kind of pricing to the lease-ups put out there. And are there going to offer two months free or one-month free. And the second one is job growth, but I can tell you the assumptions that we put into really get to that midpoint is job growth between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs. Our expectation is delivery should peak in the first half of 2017 that shows that our data providers are expecting roughly $370,000 home for the year, possible if it repeats what happened this past year that some of those could Slide in 2018.","Now when you look \u2013 take that $370,000 national deliveries, the 70,000 are going to be in our markets and 48,000 of those are going to be in our submarkets. That's 13% of the total 2017 national deliveries are going to be in our submarket. We dial it down a little bit closer, when you take our top seven markets which make up about two-thirds or NOI, only about 20% of the 2017 deliveries in those seven markets will be within one mile of the UDR property.","So you really go from 370,000 deliveries and when you get down to our top seven markets, a UDR property is having to deal with probably15,000 or so of those deliveries on a more specific basis. That being said, that's talking about 2017 deliveries. We are in some markets still facing lease up pressures from 2016 deliveries.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. What markets of the widest range of potential outcomes in 2017?","Thomas Toomey","I would say, Seattle. It's one that we're optimistic about job growth in some of our submarkets, for example in Bellevue, it was recently announced Amazon is going to come over to the East side, sales force is going to hire about 500 people about a block away from the two properties that we bought MetLife out of this past year, but you do have potential versus some supply pressures Bellevue got about 800 more units delivering there.","We don't have much product in Downtown Seattle. So the glut of 50% of the supply that's coming into metro Seattle was Downtown, so that shouldn't overly affect us. But I would say, Seattle is one that probably has a fairly broad range. The other one, just because of what happened last year would be San Francisco.","Our expectation is the bulk of the new supply, especially in SoMa gets absorbed, first \u2013 a lot of gets delivered and then absorbed throughout this year, depending on what kind of pricing that people impose, it could move a bit, but I would say those are probably the two markets that I think could swing the most, when we look at it.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Thomas Toomey","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Thanks for the time. I was just hoping you could speak a little it too the expectation is on new and renewal growth embedded in your same-store NOI across the larger markets New York, San Fran, LA in particular for 2017?","Thomas Toomey","I don't have that exact data with me. I can probably give it to you later. I can tell you on a more macro basis, when we look at 2017 with the midpoint guidance of 3.5%, we would see blended rate growth between new and renewal somewhere in that 3% to 4% range.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. Any sense on the blended for those top markets, if you don't have the newer renewals just to see kind of where New York, San Fran and LA shake out amongst the many different markets you're in?","Thomas Toomey","Yes, I don't have that on the \u2013 I mean I can't tell you, I can give you a bit of an update to what's in the supplement on Page 20 of the sub. We give the effective new and renewal growth for the fourth quarter. I can't tell you for example, in San Francisco where we had negative 5.8% new lease rate growth in the fourth quarter. In the month of January, that number came down to negative 3.2%, so while negative. At this time appears to be stabilizing somewhat, I don\u2019t if we'll be able to maintain that, but it has got a bit better.","And then when you look at New York. New York in the fourth quarter, we had a new lease rate growth of negative 2.7%, so far this month we are at positive 0.9% in New York City. So that has improved and at the same time, what's really encouraging to us is our occupancy today in New York City is 98.2%.","So we are able to really build up a high occupancy in the fourth quarter, which was part of our strategy have been able to maintain it and not have to give away rent in the first quarter. And then our occupancy today in San Francisco is 97.5% which is 90 basis points higher than it was in the fourth quarter.","Juan Sanabria","Great. On the expense side, I was just hoping you could talk to the assumptions around expense growth kind of picking back up into 2018, but maybe a little lower than at least we expected in 2017 and kind of what's driving that movement in 2017 and 2018 and any color would be appreciated.","Thomas Toomey","I'd say, really what you see is in the fourth quarter for example of this year, our expenses came in a bit higher than we expected at 4.2%. It was really due to real estate taxes, which were up 9.5%, a big part of that was the phase-in of the 421gs in New York and we also got hit with real state taxes year-over-year in San Francisco and Seattle.","Last year, we also had quite a bit in the fourth quarter of some real estate tax refunds. So we came in a little heavier on expenses in 2016 than we'd anticipated which basically brought down some of the growth rate in 2017. So it was a comp year, but our current expectation is still that when you look at the components of expense growth next year, it's still going to be heavily weighted towards real estate taxes, which will probably be high single-digits. You've got utilities call it in the 3% to 4% range. We expect repairs and maintenance to be flat to slightly negative. We think our marketing will be negative growth in 2017, and our personnel we expect to be about 2%.","As you jump over to 2018, where we have a range of 3% to 5%. There's a lot of unknowns at this point. Part of it \u2013 the biggest component is real estate taxes. We can see what's going to happen with 421s, but over the last couple of years that valuations of our real estate, and sales comps have gone up, which has driven real estate taxes. We are not sure at this point, how much will get into real estate tax refunds from prior years.","Then the other component on the expense stack that we are looking at pretty intently, especially as you get into later this year, but especially in 2018 is personnel cost. We're just not sure if they're going to spike, we've been able to maintain those it basically sub-inflationary levels, as we've been able to realize some efficiencies and even though we've been giving people raises of 3% or so, we've been able to reduce some headcount. Not sure how much more that we have, but really the things that will swing it from the three to the five are probably mostly related to the real estate taxes and personnel lines.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","Thomas Toomey","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, guys. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just wanted to touch on the same-store revenue guidance again. It seems like through the second half of 2016, you guys are north of 5%, so you've got a pretty healthy rate, earning into the first half of the year. And Tom, you mentioned in the concessions should abate in a lot of your markets in the second half of 2017. So I guess really what are you assuming for the second half of the year for same-store revenue growth, to get you down to that 3% to 4% range? ","Jerry Davis","Well really the assumption is obviously that you may or may not, if you get down to the 3%, have the pricing power that we're expecting, which is the blended new and renewal lease rate growth between 3% and 4%. One thing that benefited us quite a bit in the second half of 2016, was we had a positive variance on different line items. One was occupancy, in the fourth quarter, we were 30 BPs higher than the fourth quarter of prior year.","The second one is, late 2015, we started pushing up new initiatives that bore fruit last year. One was charging for parking spaces throughout the portfolio even on at some suburban garden communities. Actually, the pick up and parking revenue attributed about 15 basis points to our revenue growth for the full-year and most of that was occurring in the second half.","So some of that will not be repeatable, but yes, really when you look at the second half of the year, what could drive us down, and what's really hitting us right now is some of this irrational pricing, that you\u2019ll see in our high supply markets where people are given away two months free. Obviously, when you look at what our blended growth was in the fourth quarter at 2.4% and 0% on new and 5.1% on renewals, some of that was seasonal, some of that was weakness in the markets.","We're anticipating easier comps in the second half of the year, but I think the biggest factor that you really need to realize is the impact in the second half of 2016 from the improvement in occupancy and the improvement in some other fee income that may or may not repeat.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for the color, Jerry and then just sticking maybe with Northern California, one of the higher supply markets. What are you seeing across the different submarkets between San Jose, downtown San Fran, and the East Bay just on the ground?","Jerry Davis","They\u2019re all tough, I guess to start with. There is none that are doing great that some are much more challenged with new supply. I can tell you, SoMa is probably the most difficult where you've got a new lease rate growth that\u2019s at least negative 5% and we had our revenue growth revenue growth there in the quarter, I think was something like some SoMa was I think negative 0.8% for the fourth quarter. So it was weak.","Santa Clara was probably our next weakest we've got two or three properties down there and it was 2.1%, but we had a couple of strong producers to our San Mateo were at 4.5% our best market in the fourth quarter was Mountain View we've got one asset their net revenue growth 6%.","I guess the commonality we\u2019ve done really well is they were not combating new supply at all. They are - maybe B minus properties. But you're getting new supply down and Mission Bay and SoMa it's very difficult and you're repricing units negative mid single-digits, which is creating revenue growth that's slightly negative.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great, Thanks for taking the question.","Thomas Toomey","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","Thank you. I guess without delving too far into politics, how concerned are you about headwinds to demand under the new administration? And in particular, we're already seeing major changes to immigration policy, and I'm wondering how much you think that may impact some of your coastal markets?","Joseph Fisher","Yes. Thanks, John. This is Joe. So we been a lot of time going to take and through the variance the scenarios here and kind of decision free analysis of tax for deregulation border Texas immigration et cetera . But to be honest, a lot of it is really just big picture going to theoretical at this point. So trying to actually come up with decisions based of it's a little bit difficult.","I think we\u2019re going to the optimistic side, of course on deregulation and tax reform in terms of what it means for the company longer-term, but in terms of what it means for our forecasting and near-term business, how we're thinking about it. We're going to remain patient prudent about it and not making a big picture decisions based off the theoretical at this point. Harry are going to take through a little bit more detail offline on GSE or tax reform, et cetera, but at this point, nothing major impact in the business.","John Kim","How about in particular like H-1b visas? Is that something you track within your portfolio as far as number of residents that are under this visa plan?","Jerry Davis","Yes, this is Jerry. I don't have that information.","John Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lewis","Thank you. I actually wasn't going to mention Trump, but John got me in the mood. One of the things we were thinking of is, we came across this list of the 50 Trump infrastructure projects most likely to get done. I was wondering if you've looked at your portfolio, and where maybe you have exposure, where there's apartments close to these projects, where maybe you could see some demand increases. I don't know if you've looked at that yet?","Thomas Toomey","This is Toomey. We haven\u2019t seen the list, but I'll be interested in send in our production and if you look forward to Chuck Schumer and the Dems would help as well.","Michael Lewis","Okay, well I can forward it to you, at least. I don't know if I could \u2013 Schumer hopefully has already seen it. My second question is an open-ended one for Joe. To jump on your first call by the way. I was just curious if you haven't been at UDR very long but you have a history of following the Company, and I'm wondering if there's anything you've seen so far maybe that has surprised you or things you think you could do differently. I don't know if the commercial paper program has your fingerprints on it, but just if you have initial thoughts or things you and Tom have talked about?","Joseph Fisher","No, I guess as you said I\u2019ve been around the industry in the Company for quite a while at this point. So knowing the team here, 10 plus or minus years, so got another more over time, their strategies, how they operate and as part of the process, I think both sides did a lot of due diligence in terms of understanding each other and where the organization is going with the resources are available, et cetera. So no surprises at this point. Really just trying to get up to speed and kind of learn the side of business a little bit more and add value where I can.","In terms of the CP program, that was really the work of Warren and Abe Claude from the Treasury team really taking that forward and they getting that in place. So excited about that they work pretty hard with the rating agencies to get the A2 and P2 ratings from S&P and Moody's and then all of our lenders to get that put in place. So pretty excited about that is just another alternate form of capital that we have available.","Again as said in the opening remarks, so keep in mind that an alternative to our line. That is not in addition to our line of credits or intent is not to take on additional floating rate debt exposure. It's not additional capacity as we see it. It's just access to potentially a lower price cost of capital for us, but the line which today indications are kind of inside of L plus 50 on CP possibly even tighter than that. So we feel pretty good about that.","Michael Lewis","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Anderson","Hey, thanks and good morning. So I'm looking at the tone of the call here, and the development spending number in particular of $400 million at the mid point. Tom, you alluded to keeping development in the range of 5% to 9% of enterprise value. Is $400 million of the development spending a low number, like maybe the floor that we could expect from UDR, or could it even be lower than that?","Thomas Toomey","Okay. Rich, good morning or good afternoon, either way, it's about the midpoint of it. We think that range of 5% to 9% gives us flexibility to continue to find opportunities. But we will weigh them one deal at a time and let the market dictate where the best cost capital is against the return and risk.","Rich Anderson","Okay, so $400 million if second half doesn't go the way you think, could go to $300 million or something lower?","Thomas Toomey","Yes, maybe deal is not a clear that hurdle and if it doesn't, I\u2019m not married to that number, a married to proper capital allocation decisions.","Rich Anderson","Okay, and then a question for Jerry. What's the situation with Los Angeles? I remember a year and a half ago, everyone was getting all warm and fuzzy about the market, and then it disappointed in 2016 because of supply, and now it's back up in one of your favorite markets. It's really kind of come full circle in a really short period of time that's not really typical of a market. Can you describe what's going on there and why it\u2019s to hedge such a kind of a wipes \u2013 all kind of event over the past year and a half?","Jerry Davis","I\u2019d love to it, Rich. Yes, I mean we discussed this in prior calls, but our LA portfolio is really predominantly concentrated over Marina del Rey, got three of our four properties there. And that city is about two miles from Playa Vista, which is where the bulk of Silicon Beach and you\u2019ve got significant tech jobs going here. But last year, we also had a couple thousand units, really two operators that came in and had to lease up their properties last year and they came in with some of this what we've been calling irrational pricing.","We are going away two months free on 12 and even though their base rents were probably 15%, 20% higher than ours, when you come in with two months free you basically kill any pricing power we had in our assets. So it took us from a, call it, the fourth quarter of 2015 in Los Angeles, we have revenue growth of about 10% I believe. And when you look at the fourth quarter of this year, it was down to 2.8%. It was really because we have no pricing power throughout the year.","Sometime in the fourth quarter both of those deals stabilized get up to 90% occupancy, and all of the sudden, we\u2019ll start pushing rate again. So again, if you were to look at the new and renewal growth page in our supplement, in the fourth quarter, we had new lease rate growth in LA of 1.4%, which was above average for the Company and it's 2.1% so far in January. So our expectation is LA \u2013 our submarket of LA had the biggest wave of supply in it, once it went away. We are able to get back on track and start pushing rate again and we currently think Los Angeles is going to performing above average for UDR.","Now if you go to Downtown LA, it's a different story. There's probably 3,000 to 4,000 units coming online in 2017. There is a couple thousand units in lease-up there right now. I think most of them are given away about a month free, so it's not irrational, but it's just heavy doses of new supply downtown.","So one of those deals depending on where your properties are located, you could have different results and because we have so much concentration at Marina del Rey. You can see us swing I think from having a great 2015 to underperforming if you will, by peer comparisons 2016 and I think in 2017, we'll probably do about as well as everybody else, maybe a little better.","Harry Alcock","Hey, Rich. This is Harry. I just wanted to add one point, if you look longer term in Los Angeles there's been a couple ballot initiatives, one that\u2019s on the March ballot that is actually proposing to impose a moratorium on all new development in Los Angeles. It's a little unclear how those are going to play out, but clearly with the heavy doses of new recent supply, you have some local pushback, which from a fundamental standpoint could bode well for that market long-term.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then, if I guess to have a yes, no where I'm not going to tell you response Metro D.C. is that a green market so to speak on your Page 16 and 18 or too early to say? ","Thomas Toomey","It\u2019s too early to say, I would say it\u2019s either average or it would be a green. We do see D.C. as being one of the markets that we see continued improvement as you get out to 2018. As we stated this year, we're going to be in the 3\u2019s that's up from mid 2\u2019s in 2016, but yes, we're really not in \u2013 our portfolio, I think that\u2019s the answer just that our portfolio is not going to head-to-head with much new supply in D.C.","We have one asset that's really going against fairly sizable way down by the ballpark or Southwest waterfront, but that one deal happens to be our rent control deal, which is pricing significantly lower, but yes, I think, D.C. if I'd guess today it\u2019s going to be average to above average. The other market we think very likely will show some improvement in 2018 over 2017 just because how bad it's getting beat up this year would be San Francisco.","We think San Francisco is going to definitely be a below average market this year as we go through absorbing supply, especially in the downtown area in the first half of 2017. But what we're hopeful for and I can't say that Los Angeles story repeats itself, but what we're hopeful for is that once you get through that supply pricing comes back, and you get to get back at it.","Rich Anderson","Great. Thanks.","Thomas Toomey","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.","Rich Hightower","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. And welcome, Joe. So first question is related to sort of this comment about irrational pricing and some of the new lease-up competition within your submarkets. So how much of your view on the composition of the builder base, meaning merchant builders, or people with expensive mezz financing going to catch that, or people like that, how much of that colors your view on how long this irrational pricing dynamic will continue, and would you say any of that is reflected in guidance for the year?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry, and then turn it over to Jerry. I think you hit sort of an important element of our business as we look into 2017 that for the merchant builders in particular who rely on construction financing, that financing is clearly much more difficult to obtain lower loan to values, higher spreads, sort of redlining certain developers in certain markets. So that financing is not merely as readily available as it has been a year-ago, which inherently I mean that combined with continued rising costs and deceleration in fundamentals should result in fewer starts in 2017 that we've seen in the past two or three years.","Jerry Davis","Yes, I would add Rich, when you say how much is built into our guidance. I would say if there is significant irrational pricing, yes, we think that's what probably would push us down to the low end of our revenue guidance and if a lot of those get leased up or if there's a lack of that irrational pricing in 2017, I think that's what gets us up to the top end, but we think that is one of the biggest variables that we face on the revenue side.","I think we can maintain the occupancy. I think we see the supply, the other wild card obviously is the job picture, but that pricing as what we feel really did the most damage to us and the sector this past year whether was in San Francisco, Los Angeles, even in New York City. I think there's a bit of a slowdown in job creation in San Francisco last year, but we do think what got us most was two months free on a 12.","Thomas Toomey","Rich, this is Toomey. Just some additional color. The GSEs have a program and I\u2019ve use this is kind of an escape valve. Whereby they will go to permanent financing as well as a drawdown schedule if you will, on properties that are in lease-up. So you can go from \u2013 you don't have to be at 85%, 90% occupancy, you can start financing on a permanent basis as low as 60%.","Now it cuts proceeds, but clearly the GSEs have programs should some of these developers as their lease-ups look for an avenue to go to perm in a quicker pace, they just have to look at the pricing grid and determine if that's the better option forms. So I think is that program starts getting more traction in the space, it maybe a little bit of a relief valve on that urgency to get to 90% so you can get to permanent financing.","Rich Hightower","Okay. That's actually very helpful color. Second quick question, you guys mentioned five of the home properties in DC are entering the same-store pool in I think the first quarter of 2017. Can you guys give us a sense of sort of the basis points of contribution to same-store revenue growth that are held within those assets?","Jerry Davis","Sure. Honestly, we have 3,400 total units coming into the same-store pool in the first quarter. We got the five home properties, you've got one property that was a development deal we did in Del Ray area of DC You've got one renovation deal that's in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco and then eighth property is our Pier 4 deal up in the Seaport area of Boston, and you combine all of those in contribution to total same-stores is basically zero. They kind of net out, a lot of it is because of the locations they\u2019re at.","San Francisco was sub performing market, DC is kind of right in the middle. Boston is probably at the high end the blended altogether. They probably don't make significant they don't make any impact really on the total same-stores and even within DC, the contribution of those five home assets, the contribution is deminimize.","Rich Hightower","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Nick Yulico","Hi, everyone. Going back to your 2017 market revenue growth expectation page here, and New York, Francisco or solicited below 3% revenue growth, something to get a little bit more precise of a range of outcomes for those two markets?","Thomas Toomey","Yes, we typically don't give anymore precise. I will tell you this, at this point, they're not negative.","Nick Yulico","Okay, so not negative. All right, and then for those two markets, where are your in-place rents versus where you're trying to get new leases signed today? Are you still below market?","Thomas Toomey","I do not have that on May, I'm fairly certain I would have a gain to lease, which is what you're saying on both of those right now.","Nick Yulico","Okay.","Thomas Toomey","And yes that\u2019s basically when you do look at new lease rate growth that we show on the page of the supplement, typically if you see the numbers in negative remains what your in-place rents are greater than what current market rents are. So you're going to reprice negatively when you have a turn. So yes, I don't have the numbers on me, but I'm fairly certain those are going to lease.","Nick Yulico","Okay and just last question, Tom I think you talked about concessions abating second half of 2017, I think some of that was related to San Francisco, but if we think about Francisco, New York. I mean maybe there is a little bit different of a supply delivery completion picture in 2017, but there is still 2018 to come more supply. I\u2019m wondering is this \u2013 when we talking about concessions abating, I mean do they go away on 2017\/2018 or they just kind of bounce around and make both markets still challenging markets to be trying to compete versus new supply.","Jerry Davis","Yes, it\u2019s Jerry. I\u2019ll let Tom clean this up if you wants to, but I\u2019d say this in San Francisco, our expectation is I don\u2019t know if we would say concessions go away. We think they come down significantly. Yes, I can tell you and for example in the fourth quarter, this year our concessions in San Francisco were 300,000 plus higher than they were in the fourth quarter of last year that was about 40% of our total concessions.","So I think as the supply goes through and you don't have as many lease up offering one to two months, and I think that takes all the pressure off to stabilize deals. So it should come down, will go to zero. Now, I can't tell you exactly where it will go, but I think the concession pressure there is shorter lived than it is a New York and we've stated previously, we think New York is going to be a challenging market for us and the other peers probably well into 2018 as supply continues [Technical Difficulties].","Thomas Toomey","Hey, Nick, this is Toomey. Just to give you a little bit more longer-term trend view from my point and I\u2019m closing on 25 plus years of doing this, 60% of the time in the market, you can get your deal leased up with one-month concession. 20% of the time, you don't need to offer that. That was 2015.","We did not have to offer any concessionary in almost any of our lease ups to gain the traction in lease up velocity, we are striving for in the pricing power. So 2016 fit a lot into that 60% bucket and we saw a handful of markets that went over the line past one-month free and then that's just a function of either job loss or excessive supply and you identified in both cases San Francisco and New York and 20% of the time you're in a recession, you're delivering a deal and you are going two to three months free.","We don't see that horizon out there in our marketplace. We think the market's moving back to its normal pattern, which it operates 60% of the time. One-month free, as soon as that is leased up, people pull off the concessions, go back to full pricing and that's when we're seeing that exhibited for example in a market like LA.","And our theory for 2017 is a handful of markets operate in that 60%, some of them are going to be on the lower side and still offer that concessionary, but Jerry and his team are pretty sensitive to it and you can see the responses been driving occupancy, and being very successful at it.","So I think the key is, is being very nimble about your pricing schemes and sensitive to the concessionary markets. And I've always cautioned people on your side of the fence, you would learn a lot more by looking at the confectionery market, then you will the same-store market. It is a leading indicator towards our pricing power, strengthening or weakening.","Nick Yulico","That\u2019s good perspective. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your questions.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning out there. And welcome, Joe to the other side of the conference call dial-in. Just a question, Tom, and maybe you are answering it when the phone cut out, but as far as concessions go, do you think that they have reached sort of a stable level and therefore as far as somewhere mid 2017 for the back half, then they\u2019ll go down or do you guys anticipate in some of the markets that confessions pressure could continue to increase in the first part of 2017?","Thomas Toomey","Well, I think it\u2019s a market-by-market specific question, and if Jerry wants to speak to or you want to address this particular market and its concession pattern, it's probably best directed at him. Mine is just an overall trending of how I see the market reacts and it's pretty darn predictable in my view.","Jerry Davis","Yes. I would say this Alex. This is Jerry. I think for now, they appear to be stable. I don't think they're increasing few markets that are actually coming down and we've had some success on lease-ups in a few markets where you're at that normalized level that Toomey was talking about. For example, we've got a deal in Irvine called, The Residences on Jamboree this past month, we signed 40 leases, we open this place about I guess two to three months ago, but we had 40 leases this past month add one-month free and today we're 40% leased and almost 20% physically occupied.","So it is market by market, I think when you get up to San Francisco, we're finishing up to lease-up it 399 Fremont, and we're down to the last couple of probably least desirable units. And yes, we are now going to offer closer to two months free to finish this thing out. So it\u2019s dependent on the submarket, but I do think is significant supply gets absorbed in places like San Francisco, you're going to see it go back down, but it's stable today.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. So the bottom line is Jerry that whereas last year, there is a bit of how much it surprise, but surprise sort of mid-year with the amount of concessions and supply. Right now, you don't see that happening in the first part of 2017 and sort of a stable situation and then should abate towards the year-end it sounds like what you're saying.","Jerry Davis","Yes. I think San Francisco is similar to what it was last year. We're not going to get surprised, because we're in it, but I do think it's going improve about in the second half.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then there is a question for Joe or Warren, whoever wants to take it. On the CP program, you are clear that you would either do CP or line of credit, but from a funding source and overall cost of your debt, does it matter which one you use, does it matter if you think about your long-term bonds, does one react better if you use line of credit versus CP, what's the differences you interplay?","Joseph Fisher","The main difference is just in terms of where we're going to price relative to LIBOR. So if you look at where LOC prices today, we\u2019re at L plus 90, plus 15 basis point facility fee. So you\u2019re at 1.05% all-in on that. Indications are that we're going to be probably in that 40 basis point to 50 basis point range over LIBOR for the CP program. So it's really just taking any balance that we had in the forecast over the next year or two and evaluating at that point in time whether not we want to move that over the CP and pick up 50 plus or minus basis points of spread relative to line.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, and historically, the CP has been inside a line of credit, or has there been times where it's outside?","Joseph Fisher","Yes. If you go back to the crisis, clearly CP dried up and liquidity went away. That's why it's a backstopped by the line and that's an alternative to the line, so it\u2019s not an addition to it\u2019s, that\u2019s why we have the line of credit to back it. So CP can dry up from time-to-time, but historically it has been inside.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your questions.","Drew Babin","Hi, guys. When you first gave guidance for 2016 in Q4 2015, blended spreads renewals and new leases were up 5.3%. Ended up being a pretty good indicator for revenue growth for 2016 being 5.6%. Given the blended spreads are 2.4% right now, lower than the low end of your guidance, what can we expect in terms of turnover ratios, particularly in Q2 and Q3 during the peak leasing season? Would you expect turnover to be much lower than it was last year? ","Thomas Toomey","I would forecast this year it's going to be slightly lower, in the fourth quarter we were down a little over 100 BPs. I can tell you in January so far it's looking like we're going to have slightly lower turnover. It's hard to tell. We could get to a point honestly; Drew, if we got pricing power back significantly as we go into leasing season, we're going to put our foot on the gas again and it could push some people out.","So I really operate to a turnover level, I try to maximize the revenue this past three or four months our intent, because the spread between renewals and new where so wide was there is value in retaining as many people as we could. So we didn't push quite as hard and drove that down and to drove our occupancy up to 96.8% for the quarter. I can tell you today, my same-store occupancy is 96.8% still, but we're just going to have to see where we're at in the middle of the year.","Drew Babin","Okay, thank you. And one more, just on New York City, if you could break it down kind of by neighborhood, where do you expect things to be a little bit stronger in 2017? And I know you mentioned before the financial district assets are maybe a little weaker at some spots during 2016. What does that look like going forward?","Thomas Toomey","Yes. I think Chelsea, our one deal there will be our best performer. I can tell you right now, it's new lease rate growth is I think 4%, you get down to the financial district where we have two, they probably \u2013 one of them is positive one today, one of them was negative one. Now we have few exploration so the sample size is very small and all of these for the month of January. But I think financial district is going to be difficult. There is still some of these older converted buildings that are in lease-up today offering pretty sizable concessions.","The financial district probably goes head-to-head more directly with Brooklyn where there is a fairly significant glut of supply that\u2019s being absorbed. Our property over at Murray Hill, View 34, formally known as Rivergate, it\u2019s doing okay. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s doing great. There's a new lease up that should start welcoming its first residents in the next month or two, it's priced significantly higher than us, but that's one of those situation. If they come in and they want to lease up fast and start giving away two months free, it could have an impact on us, so we're watching that.","And then our Columbus Square deal that's in the MetLife joint venture actually stabilized. It\u2019s doing okay, which means positive, it completes a little bit with Midtown West, but it's probably doing about average with the rest of the City. So Chelsea is the best and I would guess depending on what happens in Murray Hill, that one could get a little messy, but I would think the financial district would maybe be the weakest because of Brooklyn supply.","Drew Babin","Great, thank you.","Thomas Toomey","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your questions.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Jerry, with regards to 2018 revenue growth guidance, can you share the blended rent rate growth assumption that underpins the midpoint?","Jerry Davis","We really aren't going to share that right now. We haven't gotten that specific. I can tell you the basics that come to that. It's really about four points that we thought about. One, we think job growth in 2018, at this point is probably comparable to 2017. We don't have anything to tell us. It won\u2019t be.","Second, we think several of our markets are going to see stabilization in 2017 as far as where supply is coming in, deliveries are expected to peak in the first half as I said earlier today in 2017. And you've got two markets that probably see acceleration from 2017 to 2018. One of those is Washington DC and the second one as I stated earlier in San Francisco.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And can you share January trends? I know you mentioned occupancy but new lease growth, renewal growth, and what you're sending renewals out at today?","Thomas Toomey","Yes, I can give you that. New so far in January is actually down 0.7% that compares to flat for fourth quarter. I can tell you a fourth quarter was kind of propped up a bit by October numbers. So it is down, but as I stated earlier, couple of the markets are doing better than they were in the fourth quarter, San Francisco is that a negative three for January for new lease rate growth.","And New York is that positive slightly under one. The rest on it\u2019s a mix of things. I can tell you again, we have continued to be pushing occupancy. Again our rate is 96.8%, I read an Axiometrics report and came out a day or two ago that was talking about December national occupancy was 30 basis points lower than it was December of last year were 30 basis points to 40 basis points higher than we were at the same time last year.","So we've continued to do a little bit of the occupancy versus rate trade and then your question about renewal growth, January's renewal growth right now is coming in at 5.2%.","That compares to 5.1% in the fourth quarter and what we're sending now for the next couple of months is right around 5%.","John Pawlowski","Okay, thank you.","Thomas Toomey","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question.","Dennis McGill","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just digging in on the supply a little bit, there seems to be too many moving pieces when we look forward. One is how much supply is actually coming and when is it going to come, and then the other piece is how is the market reacting to that supply. So if you look in hindsight, look at 2016, was supply more or less than what these data providers thought it would be at this time last year, or did the market react differently, or some combination?","Jerry Davis","I'll start and somebody can finish. It\u2019s Jerry. I would say \u2013 I don\u2019t think supply was more it actually may have been a bit less because some of the supply of those expected to come in the end of 2016 slid into 2017. I think it was more the pricing of that new supply and again we've been talked about, so I don\u2019t want to continuously repeat. But it was people offering excessive concessions that kind of put a damper on the ability of stabilized properties to push rate.","Dennis McGill","So if we look forward, then I guess the impact would be the opposite? You'd expect more supply, but you expect people to behave more rationally?","Jerry Davis","I don't know. I expect right now that people will behave the way they have been. And again, when we look at the range of guidance we gave 3% to 4%, if more markets prices rationally. I think it takes us to the bottom end of our range and if people price more rationally than I think it takes us to the top end of our range.","Dennis McGill","Got it, okay. I appreciate guys.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go head with your questions.","Robert Stevenson","Thanks guys. On the development pipeline, at this point, do you expect to start 7 Harcourt or the Dublin project in 2017?","Harry Alcock","Rob, this is Harry. 7 Harcourt is going to be a small redevelopment. I expect that we probably will start that in 2017, Dublin. So land parcel that we acquired out of the bed like joint venture, but in the third and fourth quarter of last year, I think we probably have another 12 months or more of design work, I think that probably has not started 2017. I would look at that more for 2018.","Robert Stevenson","Okay, and then since you started a JV project at Addison, is there any reason why you would start another project until that comes closer to delivery date in 2018?","Thomas Toomey","Yes, you're talking about the Vitruvian West parcel, where we have multiple parcels that we own with MetLife. Our expectation is that we'll complete construction sometime in late 2018 on that and probably won't start the next phase clearly until that one is completed. So late 2018 sometime into 2019.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then one quick one for Joe. The $600 million or so of debt was coming due in 2018 has just under 4% cost on it. Where are you from talking to bankers these days, where you guys think that you could place $500 million, $600 million of unsecured debt costs wise today given the 10-year at $250 million?","Joseph Fisher","Correct, yes we got that $300 million coming due in June next year 4.25% and then you have Fannie facility that's about $140 million floating and then $70 million fixed in there that\u2019s high 3\u2019s. So you'll probably see us not come out with a $600 million issuance so I would assume. You may see a $300 million to $400 million within that to refi part of it. We have the ability to prepay some of it, so it could get pulled forward. But when you look at rates today, 10-year for us on unsecured, we are certainly about 135 over.","If you go into kind of insurance in GSE market, you guys have 10 depths wider than that for insurance another 10 depths wider than that or GSEs. So you\u2019re going to have 3.8, 3.9, 4.0 for those three respective options there. If we went down to 7-year, which we have a whole in our 2023 maturity schedule, we could look to do something there as well.","Then you are going more to a spread of 120 basis points on the unsecured side and then again, moving up from there for insurance and GSEs. So it's something we're cognizant of. We're going to continue to evaluate it. We will look at prepays, see if they makes sense at some point, but we'll keep an eye on it and may address some this year may wait till next year.","Robert Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Joe, congrats on the move again, and I'm just curious, now that you're C-Suite Joe. What's your pitch to the old buy side, Joe that at least, at the end of November didn't own any shares of UDR? What would you say to him, now that you're in the seat and why you should have owned UDR rather than NAV peers?","Joseph Fisher","Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the warm welcome.","Michael Bilerman","Would you expect anything less?","Joseph Fisher","I think it\u2019s got the same thing, further reason that attracted to come over here was one, you look at management side in terms of the depth of the platform on the management side. Clearly operations, I think we're pretty excellent on that front and pretty good reputation there, continue to outperform our peers in most markets and then the diversification fees, I\u2019ll call it a NAV trade.","When you think about diversification, it's more or less stability of cash flow trade that plays into kind of the involving shareholder base that exists out there. So the stability of casualties diversification by market, price points of market is pretty compelling. So while it doesn't sound like my old shop owned as November. We've been holders over time in UDR, so hopefully they'll come back in at some point and hopefully some others will as well.","Michael Bilerman","Is there anything that you are advocating when you are starting other side of the table for value creation that you'd want to implement now that you're on that side of the table?","Joseph Fisher","Yes. I think there was always things not just with the UDR, but with all companies that I always advocating for dependent on my near-term and longer-term view. So at this point, it's really taken those views that I have and skill sets that I have kind of learn the business from the other side with the full information as opposed to looking at from the other side and maybe a shorter-term approach that I had in the past.","So there's going be things that I\u2019m going to look at, but at the end of the day part of the appeal that\u2019s coming here was the decision making process. Yes. Five guys in a room, all have equal vote and all put their thoughts into it and then we make the decision as a collective group. So my thoughts, I'm sure will be heard, but we\u2019ll debate them as a group.","Thomas Toomey","Mike, this is Toomey. Yes, I just add to that. And I think it\u2019s critical to point to. What\u2019s critical for our long-term success is to continue to evolve in a smart way and one way to do so is adding really smart people to the room, who have a different perspective on the world and have been on the other side of the table.","And I think Joe brings an enormous amount of that and it\u2019s great to having a dialogue with them about why we\u2019ve done things or what we are thinking about for the future and to have a good lens from the Streets perspective, as well as an investment community perspective added to that. So he is very extremely additive to the conversations, we make a decision on things here as a group and anytime that group is stronger, we make better decisions.","Michael Bilerman","Agreed. I guess one last one Joe is, we spend a lot of time on investments and operations. I guess as a previous investor, how do you evaluate corporate governance for the apartment REITs, and how do you think UDR ranks? And is there things that coming from that buy-side mentality that you would want to implement at UDR in the corporate governance side?","Joseph Fisher","Yes. Anything on the corporate governance side in terms of implementation, we're going to always be open to feedback from investors on the Street, but it's really going to come from discussions with the Board and management team, top down. So not going to speak to any views that I may or may not have on corporate governance at this point.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Hill","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Quick question, maybe just taking a step back, and we may be unique to this, and we may not be. But in a lot of our discussions with both investors that are investing in apartments and maybe more generalist investors that are looking at rentership overall, there seems to be at least more questions we're getting as to whether or not some of the apartment REITs would at some point be looking to invest in the single family rental market.","I guess our response is there's not enough apartments in the United States as is over a longer term, so maybe it's not needed. But I'm curious if that's something you've thought about, if you're getting questions about that, as well and if you just think that's a completely crazy question?","Thomas Toomey","Rich, this is Toomey. I'll give you my point of view on it. First, from lens of, I think home ownership is going to wane. If you look at it, people that are over 60% is 80%, the national numbers are 63% as they age out, so to speak, that number probably comes down. And so I think you're seeing in general acceptance that renting is a very viable option and the sigma that existed under my generation has waned.","When I think about the single-family rental business, I've been amazed and very applauding the fact it went from a transaction to actually an operating model. And then when I look at the operating model they've moved their cash flow margin from about 30% up to 40% in a pretty damn rapid window of time. And I think that's a testament to those management teams and to their efforts and wish them the best of luck on continuing to grow that.","From our cash flow margin standpoint, we're operating at about 63%, 65%, so if I were going to invest a dollar, do I want to invested in a business at 40% margin or one that 60 plus margin and how does that valuation adjust accordingly to that. And we've built a Company as Joe highlighted earlier driven towards cash flow margin expansion et cetera, et cetera.","And so I think apartments would be taking a step back by adding that margin and to look at the operating detail and ask could it ever achieve going from 40 to 60 plus. It might, but times going to \u2013 it's going to take a long time to get there in my view. So that's my lens on the single-family versus multifamily perspective and I would pretty much say at this time, I would have no interest in joining the ranks of the single-family rental pool.","Richard Hill","Got it, that's very helpful. Just wanted to get your strategic thoughts on it. That's all for me.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Wes Golladay","Hi, guys. Looking at the construction lending environment, it continues to get tougher and tougher. Do you think this will lead to more of a supply and demand imbalance late 2018 and 2019, where you get back to that above trend, maybe 4% or 5% national growth for same-store revenue? ","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. I think, I mean just to focus on the first part of your question where you think about construction lending environment is difficult. The fundamentals are increasingly difficult with respect to these individual development assets. So I think it's likely that we will see somewhat of a slowdown in terms of new development starts in 2017, which, to your point could translate to lower deliveries in 2018 and 2019.","I think you are seeing some of the merchant builders however focus on projects that they can't start, which means they are rotating out of the urban infill areas that drove much of that sort of this current wave of new supply into the suburbs, so that the absolute numbers of units may stay relatively similar. Although, I think there's also a decent possibility that delivers late 2019 slowed somewhat. Jerry, do you want to think about what that could mean from a supply demand standpoint?","Jerry Davis","I think as long as job growth continues and you think about what Toomey said a minute ago about homeownership rates. Yes, I think you see a pullback in on supply in our markets. Yes, I could see, getting up to that level, you see the top end of the range we've given for 2018, peers into that range you are talking about, so I can see that potentially happening, but it's really most dependent on jobs.","Wes Golladay","Okay and then, are you seeing more alternative transactions like the Wolfe transaction you did a few years ago to help these developers out?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry again. There clearly is a market for that type of financing structure given that sort of with the reduced loan to cost available through the third-party construction lenders you have a natural gas in the capital stacks. So those types of investments are clearly available and clearly is a market for them and we're continuing to look at them as they materialize.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks a lot.","End of Q&A","Operator","It appears we have no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the program to President and CEO, Tom Toomey. Please go ahead.","Thomas Toomey","Thank you, all of you and for the extended session, I thought it was very helpful and I hope you found the same. In summary, we feel great about the business, the plan and the right team and now it's just a matter of continuing to execute on a day-to-day basis and build on the success that we have. With that, I'll close and say, we look forward to seeing many of you on the road as we get out there and continue to communicate what the attributes of UDR and our success around execution.","Operator","This will conclude today's program.

Good day, and welcome to UDR's First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Shelby Noble. Please go ahead.","Shelby Noble","Welcome to UDR's first quarter 2016 financial results conference call. Our first quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our Web site, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirement.","I'd like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask you that you be respectable of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that do not get answered.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Shelby, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to UDR's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.","The first quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR, with strong same-store results and development lease-ups continuing to perform well. As you have come to expect from UDR, we remain focused on executing on our previously communicated two-year strategic plan, which is still the right plan, given the long-term strength of the apartment business.","From a big picture point of view, we're now in our sixth year of achieving 5% plus NOI growth. Over the past two years, most of our markets have seen accelerating growth trends due to supply\/demand imbalance, and while our overall 2016 same-store operating trends continue to improve year-over-year in a few markets as anticipated, we have started to feel the impact of concentrated new supply. We believe apartment growth is sustainable, and supply can be absorbed with steady job growth and household formations.","Deliveries of new apartment homes are projected to peak in the cycle in 2016 at around 380,000 units, and will subsequently drop in 2017 to 300,000 units, while job growth is forecast to be in the 2 million to 2.5 million range in both years. In this environment, market mix and price points will be key, and this plays well to our overall strategy that centers around our diverse portfolio mix of 20 markets with A and B quality communities in urban and suburban locations, which over the long-term we expect to continue to perform well through the cycles and provide consistent cash flow growth.","Our two-year strategic plan issued in February showed strong expected 2016 revenue and NOI growth of 5.75% and 6.75% at the midpoints. And we spoke to an anticipated solid, but slightly decelerating 2017 operating environment with revenue and NOI growth of 5% and 5.5% at the midpoints. Since then, there have been a number of publications speaking to flowing revenue trends in certain markets. And as such, I have asked Jerry to provide an update on our market expectations for the balance of 2016 and how we currently see 2017 stacking up. I hope you find this useful and that you reach the same conclusion that the UDR team. It's a great time to be in the apartment business, and therefore, we're reaffirming our full year guidance provided in the initial outlook, and we'll provide an update during the second quarter earnings call.","Also let me take a moment to mention that we were pleased that in early March we were added to the S&P 500 index, which is granted to our investors and the entire UDR team who made this possible.","With that, now I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include the first quarter results, our balance sheet and capital markets update, our casualty loss update, and development and transactions update, and our second quarter and full year guidance.","Our first quarter earnings results were in line with our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.43 and $0.41 respectively. First quarter same-store revenue, expense, and NOI growth remained strong at 6.4%, 2.7%, and 8.0% respectively.","Next the balance sheet; at year end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity was 1.1 billion. Our financial leverage on an un-depreciated cost basis was 33.0%. Based on today's market cap, it was 23.8%, and inclusive of JVs it was 28.2%. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4 times, and inclusive of JVs was 6.5 times. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of plan.","During the quarter we issued 174 million of common equity at a net price of $34.73 per share in conjunction with our inclusion in the S&P 500. In addition, in January we paid 83.3 million of 5.25% medium term notes.","On to casualty losses; in conjunction with the previously announced damage to our 151 homes, 717 Olympic Community located in the Los Angeles, we recorded a casualty loss of 1.1 million during the quarter attributable to business interruption and temporary housing for our residents. This resulted in a charge of approximately $0.50 to FFO, what was added back to FFO was adjusted. We expect to recover a significant portion of this charge from the insurance providers. And any subsequent recoveries will be included in FFO, but deducted from FFO as adjusted. As a reminder, 717 Olympic is owned by the MetLife II JV. It has no impact on our same-store results. As of today, all damage has been fixed. The community if fully operational and we're over 88% leased.","Turning to development, we commenced construction of our 585-home 367 million-345 Harrison Street development in Boston's South End, which we intend to fund with non-core asset sales. We have identified a number of assets that we'll be marketing to satisfy our funding needs for the year, with a significant portion of these sales coming from the mid-Atlantic markets. At the end of the first quarter, the company had an under-construction development pipeline for its pro-rata share totaled 1 billion. The development pipeline is currently expected to produce a weighted average spread between estimated stabilized yields and current market cap rates above the upper end of the company's 150 to 200 basis point targeted range.","Next, transactions completed in the quarter. During the first quarter, we sold our 95% ownership interest in two land parcels located in Santa Monica, California for $24 million. This resulted in a gain to FFO of 1.7 million, which was backed out of FFO as adjusted.","On to the second quarter and full year 2016 guidance, second quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share guidance is $0.43 to $0.45 and $0.39 to $0.41 respectively. At this time we are maintaining our full year guidance ranges for both earnings and same-store metrics. Full-year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share is forecasted at $1.75 to $1.81, a $1.75 to $1.81, and a $1.59 to $1.65, respectively. For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged, with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense 3.0% to 3.5%, and NOI 6.5% to 7.0%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%.","Due to the $174 million equity issuance in the quarter, we no longer anticipate a bond issuance later this year, and are updating our full-year interest expense guidance to 121 million to 125 million, from 128 million to 132 million. Other primary full-year guidance assumptions can be found on attachment 15 or page 26 of our supplement.","Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the first quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level, and representing a yield of approximately 3.3%. With that I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks I'll cover the following topics. First, our first quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter, and early results for the second quarter. Second, how our primary markets performed during the quarter with a high-level update for 2016, and 2017. And last, a brief update on our development lease-ups. We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store net operating income grew 8.0%, our highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2012.","These results were driven by a very strong 6.4% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.7% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 6.7% year-over-year, to $1,897 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.5% was down 20 basis points versus the prior year period. Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,995 per month, including pro-rata JVs. Stable job growth, limited impact from new multi-family supply, rental preference from both new millennial households, empty-nesters, and everyone in-between all driving this continued growth.","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on attachment 8E of our supplement, we grew new lease rates by 3.7% in the first quarter, 50 basis points below the first quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust, at 6.9% in the first quarter, 120 basis points ahead of last year. On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the same period in 2015. In April, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 4.2%, and 6.8% respectively. And our current physical occupancy is 96.5%. Our leasing success and stable occupancy gives us confidence that demand is more than sufficient to continue pushing rate higher throughout the upcoming prime leasing season in the majority of our markets.","Next, move-outs to home purchase were flat year-over-year, at 13%, in line with our long-term average. Even with our strong renewal increases in the first quarter, less than 9% of our move-outs gave rent increases the reason for leaving.","Before I move on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, I'd like to give a general update on our general portfolio. First, third-party data indicates that in every one of our markets we expect supply to peak this year, with the exception being New York City. Second, job growth remains robust, and we continue to have strong pricing power in the majority of our markets. The overall economic environment we see today is very similar to what we provided in our two-year outlook.","Now, moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represent 70% of our same-store NOI, and 75% of our total NOI, Metro DC, which represents 18% of our total NOI posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 2.1%, compared to 1.9% in the first quarter of '15. We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016, between 2% and 3% as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway. In the first quarter, our A's and B's had very similar growth rates. Apartment supply in 2016 is expected to increase by 13,600 homes, and then fall to 9,000 homes in 2017. While job growth in 2017 is expect to increase by 1.9%, up from 1.6% in 2016.","Our current forecast is that DC will have modestly-accelerating revenue growth in 2017, compared to 2016. Orange County in Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.4%. We continue to remain very optimistic on Orange County as the market is only expected to see 5,000 units of new supply and nearly 35,000 jobs, implying a 7:1 ratio, which is roughly twice the long-term historical average. Revenue growth in L.A. was 8.8% during the quarter, continuation of very strong results in the back half of 2015 due to job growth and supply absorption in our Marina del Rey concentrated submarket.","Lease-up pressure from almost 2,000 recently-delivered apartment homes in the neighboring Playa Vista market began negatively impacting our pricing power in the middle of the first quarter. And we think this competition will continue to affect us through the end of the third quarter. Fortunately, tech-related jobs continue to come to this part of Silicon Beach. Overall, L.A. will see over 12,000 apartment homes delivered in 2016, or about 1% of supply. And the market is projected to create 88,000 new jobs, again a 7:1 ratio. 2017 and 2018 are each projected currently to see deliveries flow to 7,000 to 8,000 homes per year, with job growth only slowing slightly.","L.A. looks best to be a strong market over the next several years. And after we get past the short-term lease-up pressures in our Marina del Rey-Playa Vista submarket. We will get back on track to above average growth. We still anticipate full-year 2016 revenue growth in L.A. to be in the 6% range, and would expect 2017 to also be in that range.","New York City represents 12% of our total NOI, and posted 5.8% revenue growth in the quarter. While our same-store properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are beginning to feel the impact from the new supply in the Manhattan market. New Yorkers who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods are beginning to be enticed by pricing incentives in places like Midtown West. 2016 deliveries of 25,000 apartment homes are adding 1% to existing supply. 2017 is expected to have deliveries even higher, at 30,000 apartment homes. It's still right around 1% of existing supply. The higher deliveries in these years are directly related to the expiring 421 tax abatement program. Once we get through these multiyear elevated supply levels, new development should decrease significant. Job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to be right around 1.3% each year.","For full year 2016, we have revised our revenue growth expectations down to about 5% in our New York portfolio, which is 50-60 basis points below our original business plan, because of the continuing pressures in new supply, we currently would project 2017 revenue growth in New York to be modestly lower than it will be in 2016. San Francisco, which represents 11% of our total NOI is feeling the effects of new supply in several sub markets, including software market. However, we still expect the bay area to be one of our best performing markets this year, with revenue growth of 7 to 8%.","Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter was 9.6% due to the extremely strong blended rent growth we achieved in the second and third quarters of 2015. The good news is that 2016 will be the peak of deliveries this cycle at 12,600 apartments or roughly 3% of existing stock and the number gets cut roughly in half to 6800 homes in 2017 representing approximately 1.6% of existing stock. Annual job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to average about 2.5% each year. Although the Bay area is slowing, we still expect to be in above average market this year and next.","Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI produced a strong 6% revenue growth during the first quarter. One same-store property in the Back Bay neighborhood had revenue growth of 5% our suburban assets in the north shore were our strongest performers with growth of 7.5%. The Seaport district, home to our 2015 completion 100 Pier 4, continues to see more growth with additional office tenants in the submarket, including the first quarter that GE will be relocating to Seaport about one-half mile from our property.","We started an additional this quarter in Boston South End, a 585 home $367 million project 345 Harrison Street. New supply in Boston is projected at 6100 homes in 2016 with slight deceleration in 2017 to 5500 homes. Both years represent less than 1.5% of existing stock.","Job growth is currently forecasted to be about 1.5% both years. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year. Seattle which represents 6% of our total NOI posted 8.4% revenue growth, continue to benefit from the strong growth inherent in our suburban B assets which are located in sub-markets that are less exposed to new supply. Long-term, we continue to like the downtown Seattle sub-market and believe that the ongoing creation of new jobs by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle's urban core.","The Bellevue submarket is in the midst of fairly heavy new multi family development that is not put up significant pressure on our portfolio as evidence by 7.7% revenue growth in Bellevue this quarter. Deliveries in metro Seattle are expected to peak in 2016 at 9800 apartment homes, before following the 6200 homes in 2017, while job growth continues at more than 2%. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year.","Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI, posted 5.8% year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the first quarter. Our B properties have revenue growth that was 400 basis points higher than A's as heavy new supply in uptown along with tollways and impacting rent growth in those submarkets. New supply in Dallas is projected to peak in 2016 at 18,000 new units and then drop to 12,700 in 2017. Job growth in the Dallas market should remain strong both years above 2.4%.","Outside of our primary markets, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, the Sun Belt, Nashville in Austin, which comprised roughly 20% of our portfolio, we are above our initial expectations provided in our two year outlook. So we continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amount of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.","April results came in inline with our plan, and as we look ahead in the new two months, we see improving pricing power, along with stable occupancy. Our 50-50 AB portfolio located throughout 20 markets has enabled our performance in our Sub Belt markets, Orange County, Portland, and Monterey Peninsula to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply in San Francisco, New York, and L.A. On a national basis, and within our core markets, apartment deliveries are expected to peak in 2016. Currently projections from Axiom Metrics have 2017 deliveries coming down over 25%. New York is the only market that we operate in that looks to experience a higher number of deliveries in 2017 than it had in 2016. Remember, that earlier this year, in our two-year outlook we indicated a 75 basis point deceleration in 2017 with a revenue growth guidance mid-point of 5%. Our overall view has not changed.","I'll turn now to our four in lease-up developments, which you can find on attachment 9A and B or pages 19, and 20 of our supplement. Our share of these four properties represents $316 million or roughly 23% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development JV. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan. 399 Fremont, our 447-home-$318 million lease-up in San Francisco, California took first move-ins in mid-March, and was 26% leased and 15% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 29% leased and 24% occupied, with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently offering a month concession, as planned, as this community, nothing that we will see increased competition for other lease-ups in the submarket in the near future.","Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California in the West Coast development JV was 37% leased and 29% occupied at quarter end. And as of today, is 47% leased and 37% occupied. We are currently offering less than one month of concessions with this community. And leasing has been very strong in April, with 41 applications.","CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 37% leased and 34% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 66% leased, and 52% physically occupied. 8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 8% leased and 0% occupied at quarter end. And today, it is 16% leased and 6% occupied. First units were available for move-in in mid-April.","All in, we had a great first quarter, and we remain very positive on the outlook for multi-family fundamentals, and our ability to execute during the peak leasing season, and throughout the remainder of 2016.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Tom.","Tom Toomey","Thank you, Jerry. And before opening up to Q&A, I want to take a moment to sum up our prepared remarks. We still feel very good about multifamily fundamental, and are at a phase in the cycle where market mix and price points of our portfolio are critical. As Jerry mentioned, due to changes in conditions some of our markets are underperforming, and some are outperforming our original expectations. However, on balance, our outlook for the portfolio is unchanged. This is a testament to our overall strategy and market mix, which is less volatile and more predictable, on average, throughout the cycles.","We feel good about 2016 and '17, and remain on target. UDR has the right plan with right team in place to execute. And we feel confident about our future opportunities.","With that, I will open it up to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, good morning. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the non-core asset sales, I was curious if you guys were looking to do a portfolio sale. What's the potential timing, and will you exit any additional markets? I know you mentioned a concentration in the Mid-Atlantic.","Tom Toomey","Jordan, this is Toomey. With regard to that, we're going to expose probably 300-plus million to the market on individual asset bases, and we'll see what the pricing comes in on those, and we feel like it's a good strong market to expose assets and we'll get good pricing on them.","Austin Wurschmidt","And how should we be thinking about pricing, what's sort of your cap rate expectations at this point?","Tom Toomey","Do you want to take it, Harry?","Harry Alcock","Sure. This is Harry. So it depends a little bit on the product mix. I can tell you, in general, the marketplace, Class As are trading at coastal Class As, and main to main locations are trading at four, sub-four. The Bs that would likely comprise most of what we sell, are going to trade between 5%-5.5% cap rates, and depending on location and specific asset type. There continues to be a strong bid for these assets, particularly in the B space, but A and C continues to be readily available. I can tell you Fannie and Freddie both expect to meet or actually exceed 2016 volume versus 2015. So it's a good time to sell assets right now.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for the detail there. And then just touching a little bit on D.C., I mean, you continue to get a little bit of traction on new and renewal lease rates there, and I was just curious how that acceleration stacks up versus your expectation, and any detail you could provide on submarket trends and what you're seeing subsequent to quarter end?","Jerry Davis","Yes, sure, Austin. This is Jerry. D.C., again, we continue to think it bottomed about a year-and-a-half ago, late-2014, but we continue to see supply pressures and various submarkets throughout the Metro D.C. area, such as Arlington and Alexandria. What's interesting is we've seen the compression between what As and Bs are doing -- occur [ph]. Currently, it's probably less than 100 basis points. Our properties in that 14th and U Street neighborhood, including Capital View, View 14, Andover Place and Thomas Circle, those deals are all putting up probably about 3% revenue growth. And then a couple of the places over off Columbia Pike in Arlington are negative revenue growth right now.","When you get outside the Beltway, even though outside tends to do a little bit better than inside the Beltway, we'll have a couple of properties out there in Woodbridge that are flat-to-slightly negative. So that the A-B mix has benefited us in the past, where these have significantly outperformed, but we are seeing neighborhoods in D.C. where supply has subsided, reacts very well and starting to see good rent growth. All in, D.C. is performing about where we expected. I'll touch on the home portfolio that we bought back in October, it's performing pretty much within plan -- in accordance with the plan that we had. We found a few opportunities to drive expenses down. We're in the process of spending coming close to $20 million on some initial capital expenditures, some on unit interiors, some on the exteriors of the properties, but as we chug through that we're seeing occupancy, which when we bought the portfolio, I think, was down around 92%. Today, occupancy in that portfolio has risen to between 95% and 96%.","So D.C., I would tell you, is going according to plan. Our expectation this year, like I said in my prepared remarks, is that revenue will be between 2% and 3%, and then our expectation going further out is supply continues to be absorbed and '17 is better than '16.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks for the color, and I'll yield [ph] the floor.","Jerry Davis","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. I just wanted to clarify your reduced outlook on New York. So it seems like you have 6% renewal growth this quarter and unusually low turnover of 20%, but you see revenue declining in 2017. So I just wanted to ask if that's purely due to increased vacancy, or do you see rates coming down as well?","Jerry Davis","No, I think it's going to be more rate. I think occupancy there will stay in the 97-98 range. Today it's in the high-96s. The recent turnover was down really in the first quarter as we moved more of our explorations into the more seasonally high demand second and third quarter. So it wasn't purely that we were retaining more people. It was more that we had fewer explorations in the first quarter. So we are definitely feeling the effect of the supply pressures, whether it's Midtown, West, Brooklyn, they're starting to have an effect on our Financial District properties. And if you really stratify what we did in the city in the first quarter, our two down in the Financial District popped revenue growth of about 4.5%, and our Chelsea and Murray Hill properties came in north of seven.","So we're feeling it a little bit more in the Financial District. And then if you go up to our MetLife JV property in the Upper West Side, Columbus Square, that one is definitely feeling the effect of the supply in the Upper West Side, and have revenue growth of about 1%-1.5%. So I don't think you'll see us -- that the slowdown that I talked about in '17, I think is going to be more rate-driven than occupancy.","John Kim","And how comfortable do you feel in your 2016 outlook in New York given, as you mentioned, we're heading into the busy leasing season?","Jerry Davis","Yes, New York, actually, it's doing about as well in April as it did in the first quarter. I mean, I would've hoped it would've accelerated, but it hasn't yet, but new lease rate growth in April is about 2.5%-2.6%, but renewal rate growth has jumped up to 6.7%. So I think we did a good job pushing those into the stronger periods, but we feel good about where I expect now. I think I said on the prepared remarks that we've revised our expectations there from being high-fives to low-fives. I guess there is the possibility if we continue to encounter more significant supply pressures that could come a bit lower, but right now, pretty comfortable in that five range.","John Kim","Okay, thanks Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","I'll go next to Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Jerry Davis","Hey, Rich.","So just a quick question on the schedule of new and renewal rates in the press release, really appreciate the detail there. As it relates to the different markets with different factors sort of offsetting one another, is there a way for you to peg the likes of hitting above the midpoint of the same-store range that didn't really change the several puts and takes during the quarter, in that sense?","Jerry Davis","I guess I would say this, overall, and maybe -- hopefully this will answer your question. Overall, first quarter came in where we thought it would. So far, in April we're right on track also. You're always going to have some markets that perform a little bit better than expectations. Some that are below, and obviously, the three that we spoke to in the prepared remarks that are currently under are San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. And the reason for this under performance really is the effects of new supply. We've talked for years that continuing to get 10% revenue growth in San Francisco wasn't long-term sustainable. And I guess the developers and city officials also took notice of this. And this previously undersupplied market is getting a slug of new supply right now.","Fortunately for us, it's going to peak this year, then start to decelerate next year. But what we notice too, and I had this in our remarks, is success of new lease-up properties that are putting some of this pressure on us. That our 399 Fremont lease-up is well ahead of leasing velocity. We're getting rental rates that are above pro forma rents, which were $6 a foot. And we're giving away one month free. So what really shows up is there is demand, and there is traffic for apartments. But we have a lease-up property that's basically getting discounted down 8% because of one month free. You're going to find it harder to push rate on thanks to our properties. But yes, those -- we do have the three underperformers. We also, as I stated earlier, we've got about a third of the company that is exceeding expectations. And those are Orange County, which is I won't say significantly, but it's ahead of where we expected. Our two markets in Florida, Orlando and Tampa are significantly ahead of what we would've expected when we did our business plan. As is Nashville, Portland, and Monterey. And I think the big difference between the ones that are underperforming and those that are outperforming is which ones are being affected by new supply.","Those that I just said that are outperforming tend to be B product, which doesn't compete as much against new supply, and they're in markets that really are not getting heavy doses of supply.","Rich Hightower","All right, that's very helpful. And then maybe as one quick follow-up there as it relates to the A\/B strategy and Bs outperforming on account of new supply, is it entirely a function of less supply with the B assets versus A, or is there also an element of trading down or anything else on the demand side of the equation that might be leading to outperformance there in general?","Jerry Davis","I think it's predominantly lack of new supply. I mean, there could be some situation of trading down. We've seen the reasons for move-out being rent increase. We're to about 9%, that's stable with where it was about a year ago. We've got two markets that are above 20%, and those are San Francisco, and Los Angeles. And even though you could sit there and think maybe it's because they're getting priced out of the market. When we really see forwarding addresses on where these people move to, they're frequently moving to that brand new supply down that street that's offering the one-month free. Or in the case of Marina del Rey, a month-and-a-half to two months free. The price is then similar to what we were asking them to pay.","So we're able to trade up, if you will, into a brand new community, but it's at the same rate. So I don't think it's price-fatigue. There's probably a little bit of that that's inching in there, but I think it's predominantly supply.","Rich Hightower","All right, great. Thanks, Jerry.","Jerry Davis","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Can you give us an update on the West Coast Development JV, and it looks like a few of the assets are now in lease-up, and what you're seeing in those markets?","Harry Alcock","Sure. I'll start, and then Jerry can jump in. Two of the assets are in lease-up, CityLine in Seattle, and Katella I in Anaheim. And as Jerry mentioned in his prepared remarks, they're both leasing up very well. We just started leasing 8th and Republican, and South Lake Union near Amazon. We've at least, I don't know, 10% or so of the units\u2026","Jerry Davis","16.","Harry Alcock","16% of the units at this point. The next ones are going to be Downtown L.A. asset that will be in leasing in the third quarter. And then the second phase of the Katella project, which would be in leasing early next year.","Jerry Davis","Yes, but Nick, I'll give you a little more color on how well those lease-ups are doing. As Harry said, they're all at or above what we expected. Katella Grand has probably been my biggest surprise. It's up in the Platinum Triangle. And we're getting rents that we anticipated, and call it the $2.25 to $2.30 a foot range. Then able to drive that thing up to 37% leased and 36% occupied using, typically, less than a month free. So that one's been a big surprise, to me, how strong it was. But I think it is a special project.","CityLine up in the Columbia City location, that one got off the ground a little bit slow. And we cut rate a bit to get velocity going in the first quarter. But we caught back up to our budgeted occupancy level. And today, that property is 66% leased, 52% physical. And we've gotten rents back above market rate. And we brought concessions in at about a month free now. And the third one that is doing real well right now is 8th and Republican. And we opened the doors to that one about two weeks ago in a very, or as I've stated a minute ago, we're about 16% leased and 6% physical. One extra benefit that we found out a month or two ago, we thought we were getting dropped right in between Amazon land. Google announced recently that they're going to be putting a few offices up within several blocks of this property too and they will be out a couple of years.","Tom Herzog","This is Herzog, too, Nick. I'll add one other thing. Keep in mind, with the West Coast development JV that we do get a 6.5% pref [ph] until such time as the assets are stabilized as defined. And they absorb any operating losses during that time period. So, in the meantime, while these are stabilizing, we're earning a 6.5% on our investment.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, and then just on the new development in Boston, can you talk about the desirability of that project and expectations in terms of the spread over existing cap rates that you expect to achieve?","Harry Alcock","Sure, Nick. This is Harry. I'll talk about this for a couple of minutes. First, we're building a project in a location that will appeal to a broad range of renters. I'll talk about the neighborhood first, and then economics. This is a new location within the South End, which is one of Boston's most desirable neighborhoods. It's primarily a residential district with old 19th century brownstones. But this particular location is only a 10-minute walk to the Financial District, the Back Bay, and GE's new headquarters that'll bring 800 new employees to Boston. There's tons of restaurants, bars, galleries, and boutiques along Fremont Street. Our side is located directly across the street from a new Whole Foods Market that opened last year.","There's been some recently built apartment projects, ink block in the Troy totaling more than 800 units that are nearly fully leased up. The first condo building across the street sold out. And prior to completion of more than a $1000 a foot, they have just started construction on a second condo building related companies purchased a site, kitty-corner from ours, and is into the city for approval of 175 apartments and 100 condos.","In terms of economics, yield based on today's rents is about 5.5%. If we get 3% revenue and expense growth for the three plus years, the yield will grow to above six, and more than 200 basis points above today's cap rates. Rents today are more than $400 below our Pier 4 deal that we leased up in seven months last year. When you are comparing similar unit types and like similar assets in Boston, the cap rate for this asset would be very low like lease-up 4% cap rate.","We believe in fact that this location could outperform Boston overall, which according to Axial averages nearly 4% per annum through 2019. In addition to Whole Foods and retail and residential construction, our units and our 40,000 square feet of retail will help complete the transition of this new location within a very established and desirable overall neighborhood. Downtown Boston expects to average less than 1500 unit deliveries per year through 2020, and we also believe supply is manageable.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Tom Toomey","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","We will go next to Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good morning out there. So if you are doing 8% same-store NOI growth this first quarter, and it sounds like you're going to have a good second quarter, and your guidance is 6.75% still, should we be assuming that you're expecting a supply-induced meaningful deceleration in the second half of the year? Is that how we should read this at this point?","Jerry Davis","Rich, I will start that. This is Jerry. I mean, really when you think about what makes up your revenue growth, it's really the -- it's any change in your occupancy year-over-year and then it's really the weighted blended average of increases for renewals and new leases over the preceding 12th period. So when you really look at how our revenue growth will decelerate over the years, you're really having to look for example in second quarter what did we do in second quarter last year on blended growth and what do we expect to do this year in second quarter on blended growth. And because last year the second and third quarters were extremely strong, and as we go into this year's second and third quarter, the rate growth is going to be less than it was last year. You have a natural deceleration.","Now, I guess you could say accurately that it is primarily coming from new supply deceleration that is predominantly occurring in those three markets I talked about earlier, because they have the heavier weighting on our total revenue growth, but I guess long story short, I think you kind of hit it on the head, but I just wanted to make sure people really understand what the components are that really drive the rate growth. For example in first quarter of this quarter what we achieved in the third quarter of 2015 adding more of an impact on first quarter revenue growth than what we achieved as far as rate growth in the first quarter.","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Tom Toomey","Let me add to that. One of the things I'd have you keep in mind is we obviously had a good start to 2016 from a same-store perspective. And as we look at guidance for the balance of the year, it's still too early to make any modifications in our view. We want to get more into peak leasing season, but we do feel good about where we are at, and we will revisit again next quarter.","Rich Anderson","I appreciate that. Thanks, Tom. And then, one of the little tidbits I find interesting is that your development pipeline is at the top end of your kind of range of incremental yields, close to 200 basis points and yet you're worried about supply all around you. I mean, why do you suppose that those two opposite sort of things are happening right now? I would think maybe with elevated level of supply, your own development pipeline would be at least underperforming a little bit in that environment. Can you just kind of walk through that?","Tom Toomey","Rich, this is Toomey. I think it's a testament to Harry and his team. I mean, they have found very good site. They've done a good job of reading what the market opportunity is, and providing a hell of a good product. And I think you're seeing that both last year with Boston and this year with San Francisco. So I think it's a little bit of that aspect of it, if you will. I think it's a fair question. We're probably new to it, and we wanted it little bit more, and try to come up with reasons. We're really focusing on the forward aspect of the business. And we want to stay discipline about allocating our capital and sustaining that type of gap or accretion, if you will. And normally that's -- people wander into the subject of would you expand it? And I don't think we will. I think we're going to stay very disciplined about our development and keep going forward.","Rich Anderson","Okay, sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I was hoping you could shed a little bit more light on why the joint venture assets are underperforming so much on a same-store growth basis they did; 1% same-store NOI growth versus 8% for the rest of your portfolio, I guess you talked about in New York what else is going on there?","Jerry Davis","Yes, Nick, this is Jerry. When you really look at it, and I think we stated this earlier, A and especially A plus product competes more against new supply than B. We stated before that the spread between As and Bs in your same-store pool is probably about 100 basis points. But when you do look at the MetLife assets, and there is -- again, there is 24 assets I believe in the same-store pool in MetLife. There's five of them that are in urban course where heavy new supply is hitting -- that's definitely hitting A plus product. One of those is in downtown Seattle. One is in Washington D.C. One is Columbus Square, up in the upper West side. One is in uptown Dallas, and then the last one is in downtown Austin. Those five properties make up 41% of the total NOI for MetLife JV, and they have a revenue growth of 0.6%. So, you know, under 1% because they're going head-to-head against so much new supply.","When you look at the expense side, you have situations where I believe last year in the first quarter we had pretty good real estate tax, the appraisals have benefited us, but it's predominantly because of those five properties that are in the urban core of heavy new supply urban locations.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Yes, that helpful. I guess my follow-up on that was, you know, if I go through your proxy and I look at some of the short-term compensation metrics for executives, one piece is that same-store revenue growth in market versus your peer group, and then I'm wondering why then it makes sense to be carving out, I think that calculation causes out the MetLife JV assets, which seems like it would actually be that beneficial if you're thinking about how your portfolio is being comp versus your peers which often have less JVs or don't have as much exposure with the JV in a market like New York or Boston?","Tom Toomey","Nick, this is Toomey. It's a good question. First, when we manage and set forth budgets with Met, we have them as a partner in the room, and they weigh in on how they want to be asset run, and we weigh in on it. And we usually somewhere in the middle of that arrive at how we're going to manage the assets. I think, second, we saw the pressure that Jerry alluded to, with ultra A assets, and we really have that conversation run those assets in that manner, and we have since day one disclosed it transparently.","With respect to the comp point on the issue, we're very comfortable, we have deliberation with the Board internally that we've got the right comp plan and we launched the right action, which is to win our market. And I think we do that pretty darn consistently, and I think it's a testament to Jerry and his operating team and the innovation that they drive. So we're comfortable with our plan, and how we treated the Met JVs and disclosed them.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","We will go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First question, just kind of going back to Nick's question on MetLife; the expense growth was relatively high in that JV, to your point about kind of working with MetLife you control the expenses, is there anything in that you might do differently if you're in 100% control of the property, or is there anything that can be done on the expense side, or is that kind of just an outsized impact from 421 in New York?","Tom Herzog","Some of it's outsized impact, some of it's also is real estate tax, timing of real estate tax refunds last year versus this year, and you really need to see a full year and not judge it purely on a quarter. But you will find also in some of these locations where there is heavy new supply, things like personnel growth, because in places where there is heavy new supply, you're constant competition to get the best employees to work for you. So that can drive that number up to. But I can tell you this, we typically attempt on any initiatives that we're rolling out for expense reductions, whatever we do for UDR, we typically do UDR wholly-owned we typically do with MetLife portfolio also.","Drew Babin","Makes sense, and then secondly just looking at private equity appetite for real estate assets, obviously there's been a very strong bid for theoretically more stable suburban properties with home properties and associated states being bought Starwood buying to our portfolio et cetera. What are you seeing in these eight markets in TBDs in terms of who is looking at assets, are you receiving any interests externally from any of the large private equity players, was their appetite kind of more geared towards stable, more stable assets with theoretically higher yields?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. I think on the -- you have a sort of a by and large a bifurcated buyer class between the main and main class A assets, which are going to be pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and we're starting to see an influx of investment from Canada from the Middle East and Asia. And perhaps to a lesser degree the private equity funds typically have slightly higher IRR hurdles than these others. And therefore while they do they buckets of money that would lend itself to buying A properties, they tend to buy kind of buy A minus properties primarily. At least that's what you've seen historically. That's what we're seeing now that, that there is both asset classes we are seeing very deep buyer pools, which has obviously positively impacted asset pricing.","In terms of others sort of reaching out to us, that's something that happens routinely, whether it's from private equity firms or sovereign wealth firms or other buyers, and that happens routinely at really at all points in the cycle.","Tom Herzog","Nick and Drew; if Nick you're still on the call, I want to loop back on the Met thing, a couple of points occurred to me and I was just looking at this notes. Just a reminder, that's 10% of our NOI, you know, we're consistently treated at, and sometimes it's better and sometimes it's worse than the wholly-owned portfolio. But what I look at and we go over every year with our Board, our IRR is going to returns on our investments from beginning to the end. And it's a good thorough review, and I'm just looking at the math coming up on its sixth year that we've been co-investing with them in this JV, and the IRRs are now at better than 15.5%. So I think it's been a very good investment, a very good relationship, and one that we look forward to continuing in the future.","Drew Babin","That's helpful, thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Jerry, thanks for the operating update for April in New York; could you share a new lease and renewal growth trends for April in San Francisco, and what you're seeing heading into May?","Jerry Davis","Sure. I don't have May on me right now, but in April, San Francisco's new was 2.8%, and renewals were fairly stable with where they were in the first quarter at 7.5%.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. And lastly, what drove the decision to sell the two land partials in California?","Harry Alcock","This is Harry. Two projects are in Santa Monica, they both had sort of retail type operating assets on the partials, and as we pursue the re-entitlement of those sites over the past several years, it became obvious to us that the city was not going to sort of cooperate and allow a re-zoning of those assets, and so we sold them to retail units.","John Pawlowski","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will now next to Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan","Thank you. Jerry, I really appreciate the market outlook for supply and job growth. Do you think that we also need to see wage growth accelerate to continue the success you had in your renewal increases?","Jerry Davis","I don't think it would hurt obviously. I still think even with the wage growth that we've been having over the last several years, we've seen, and with going on with the rent growth we've had. We still have rent to income level that's pretty consistent with where it has been at about 23%. And we haven't seen a huge spike in turnover. So we're not driving many more people out because of rent growth, but yes, I think anytime you can see some wage growth improvement, that's helpful. I'd say a couple of things that have helped somewhat is for our suburban, especially B renters, lower gas prices have kind of supplemented their wage growth.","And I think when you look at the more urban dwellers, I don't think again it's so much wage growth that's affecting us there. It's their ability to jump to new lease-up, but I'm never going to argue against wage growth. When you see indications that whether it's California, or different cities in California, or Seattle has done rents in the minimum wages to $15, even though to put a little bit of expense pressure maybe on operators like us, because it will drive -- even though we don't have many people that makes below $15 an hour for an unskilled job. When you have skills that will spread that gap up, I think overall -- I think wage growth like that's going to be good for our sector, and would help us continue to drive rate.","Jana Galan","Thank you. That's it from me.","Jerry Davis","Thanks, Jana.","Operator","We will go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Thanks. Jerry, in Tampa and Orlando, at this rate, how long do you expect to be able to keep this up and is there is a situation where you worry about -- now, it's sort of $1200 a month rent for largely class B products that you're getting into the point where people can afford townhouses and condos in those markets and you could start seeing some move out and accelerate?","Jerry Davis","I mean, you always worry about that, and you have worried about that in the past. Today, about 15%, little over 15% of our move outs in Tampa are to purchase homes. So it's not huge. That people that qualify for the homes want to have to own a home, and I do think in that market you can see high single-digit new and renewal growth for a long period of time. I don't think it's going to last forever. I think it's been a very good multiyear run. I think it can use to run for another year or two, because we're not been affected by new supply.","Job growth has been better than in the past. It's been higher quality biotech and medical jobs that have been coming to places like Orlando. But now, do I think it can continue at the levels that it's at today for multiple years? I don't think so, but I don't think it decelerates rapidly in 2017 either.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then Harry\u2026","Tom Herzog","On a lighter note, I think Jerry is going to give all our existing residents a Netflix account and send them the big short movie.","Rob Stevenson","Harry, in terms of land, I mean, how aggressive have you guys been these days, and is there anything reasonably priced in your core markets, or is it now sort of going to condo developers and other bidders at higher levels that you guys are comfortable buying land for future development?","Harry Alcock","Well, I guess there's a couple of things; one, we're continuing to look at land size in markets where we historically have built on the coast, and in addition we're continuing to work through the MetLife land bank and we've got projects in Seattle and in L.A. in the East Bay, and expect it will continue to grind through those and expect to start some of those over the next couple of years. Really you should think about it, the sites that we are looking at, these are going to be sort of late '17, and 2018 starts. And so, when we are looking at the fundamentals of these markets, where we have declining supply, really in '17 and '18, these are going to be '19 and '20 deliveries.","But to answer your question specifically it is somewhat more challenging. Clearly, the number of percentage of projects that pencil today is much lower than it had been historically, but we expect to continue to find enough projects both externally and within our MetLife JV, using consistent underwriting standards without any type of aggressive rent growth assumptions. So we'll continue to maintain similar development pipeline as we have historically, and fit within our 900 million to a billion core type target.","Rob Stevenson","Does this force you to do more sort of Santa Monica type of things, where you have to buy stuff on the anticipation that you could try to get re-zone and take that sort of risk out there these days in order to find site?","Harry Alcock","Not necessarily. It doesn't mean that we won't a little bit of that. Again, we try to manage the amount of sort of preconstruction risk we take, but for example, if you look at a market like Boston, where we just started a project and therefore we would expect to start the next project sometime in two or three years, clearly, if we found that an adequate site, it's conceivable that we would take some entitlement risk. But we don't necessarily think that's something that we are going to have to do a lot of.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will go next to Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","Hi. Thank you. You talked quite a bit about supply peaking everywhere, but New York in 2016, and I was just wondering how comfortable you are that 2016 will be the peak supply year, because as long as you have strong fundamentals, higher occupancy, positive rent growth, low cap rates, it may entice more people to build, it's working for you right, so it might work for others. So, just curious what your thoughts are on that?","Tom Toomey","Michael, this is Toomey. A very good question, and one thing that we alluded to a couple of years, when we saw the banking industry becoming further and further consolidated and regulated is we realized the impact would be -- as the Fed would have the ability to choke off construction loads. And what we are currently seeing in the marketplace and if you talk to private developers is securing a loan for new development in the multifamily space is getting very, very difficult. And you are going to see them less in deals, because it's going to require more equity, there is going to be less proceeds out of construction, and tougher underwriting.","I think that combined with the transparency of operating environment and cities difficulties around zoning and entitlement processes is going to slow it down a great deal. And I didn't hear any development in the last three months, talking with a lot of private guys that said, \"Hey, we think we are going to do more business in '17 than we are doing right now.\" Everybody looks at it and says, \"We are pulling back. We will be enforced to pull back, and we will have to re-look at our numbers and come up with more equity.\" So I think that's going to be the biggest choke point about new supply and it's certainly not the demand side of the equation, it is certainly there, and we will persist for many more years. It's the supply is going to choke down.","Michael Lewis","Thanks. And that's actually a good -- your answer does lead into my second question, which is you have an outlook out there through 2017, do you think by the time we get to the end of that outlook, this dynamic between the suburbs outperforming the center city and B's doing better than A's, do you think that dynamic will start to shift by the end of 2017, or do you think will still be an environment like that?","Tom Toomey","Well, you are asking a very broad question, and it's hard to draw a blanket over the whole U.S. We can take individual markets and probably take it offline and go through those, but my view on long-term is that a lot of developers are moving out to the suburbs, where they are building kind of an A minus product to a price point sensitive customer, and they are going to be able to put up a lot more doors quicker in that type of environment. And the suburbs by the time '17 arrives will be probably turning over. I think they are going to be a good spot for '16 and '17, but after that I would suspect that they are going to start seeing the same supply pressures that we are seeing in some of the urban markets today. And so, they will probably start turning over then.","Michael Lewis","Great, thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey. Thank you, and sorry, I hopped on late this busy earning day. So if you answered this, I apologize. But on the Santa Monica land, did you guys say how long you owned that land for?","Tom Toomey","Alex, we bought it in the second half of 2012; so, about three and half years.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And just given that you guys, you know the coastal markets well, was it just something, did -- was the pushback on the entitlement changed much -- was it much different than you originally thought, or you always thought it would be a difficult one to get done and you were just willing to buy it and see if you could get it done?","Tom Toomey","Well, Alex, at the time that we acquired it, that was a -- Santa Monica was granting these re-zoning types of projects that would allow for a certain density in a lot of these sites. Shortly after we acquired it, the city basically shutdown, and I remember in the year 2014, they issued something like 50 total building permits. And so, basically over the three years, it became obvious to us that we were not going to get these sites re-zoned anytime soon, given that they had existing retail uses, and we had retail buyers available, we decided to get rid of them.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And do you have any other in the rest of the portfolio, any land positions, anything that's sort of comparable?","Tom Toomey","No.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Tom Herzog","Alex, I should add one thing.","Alexander Goldfarb","Sure.","Tom Herzog","Just keep in mind on those two small land assets that had a little bit of retail on top of them. We did ultimately sell them both at gain. So, for what it's worth, there were some gains, but it was more gain.","Alexander Goldfarb","Gains are good. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hey, guys, it's Austin here again. Just one quick follow-up, Jerry, I was wondering if you could give a little color, your thoughts on some of the rental rate moratorium and other regulations that we have seen in Northern California, particularly with regard to the vintage of your Northern California portfolio.","Jerry Davis","Yes, you know there have been a few things that have come up, there were some meetings last week, or the week before in San Mateo that talked about properties built I think before 1980, or -- it's 20 to 30-year-old product, but it seemed like it got shot down pretty quickly, but I can tell you this, our two deals in San Mateo are older than that. So if it's passed, those potentially would be affected. The other ones that we've heard about, but we are not directly affected are -- I think it was a 90-day restriction on renewal growth in Oakland, and not positive effect, past just talked about, just directly affect us.","And then the other one that was getting talked about I believe was in San Jose, you know, putting a -- moving the cap on renewals on rent control buildings, I think was going from 8% to 5%. Ours is not a rent control building. So I don't think it would have any effect on us in San Jose, and our asset there is a little bit newer. So at this point, I think the only one that potentially in the future could affect us if it did get passed, but again it seems like it shot down pretty quickly by City Council in San Mateo.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","At this time, there are no other questions in the queue. I will turn it back to Tom Toomey for any closing remarks.","Tom Toomey","Well, thank you all of you for attempting, for being on this call today, I know it was a long call, but I thought it was very fruitful to have a good dialog and go through the markets in detail. A reminder to you as I listen to the questions and reading the call notes, a lot of you is right now on focus on the short-term, and really we are focused on the long-term aspects of the business, which do not remain anything, but positive. The demographics are on our side. The supply\/demand curve is on our supply side to be able to execute our strategy, deliver solid growing cash flow and paying dividends.","And so, I think the construct of the business is great, where we're from a strategic standpoint of being in the markets we're in, the mix of portfolios and the management team to execute on that. And so, we think the future is very bright. We think just as we've always tried to be very transparent about the operations of the business, when you back up and you look at the end results of the cash flow growth, the prospects for the balance of the year in '17 as well, we're very excited about those prospects and eager to just keep working on those.","And so with that, I will close, and we thank you and look forward to seeing many of you in the next conferences over the next couple of months. Take care.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation."],"20757":["UDR (NYSE:UDR) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 29, 2014  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Christopher G.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Chris Van Ens. Please go ahead.","Christopher G. Van Ens","Thank you for joining us for UDR's Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Our third quarter press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to our website, www.udr.com.","In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. I would like to note that statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met.","A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in yesterday's press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","[Operator Instructions] Please note that there is another multifamily REIT call that begins at 2 p.m. Eastern so our call will be kept to 1 hour. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.","I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tom Toomey.","Thomas W. Toomey","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","First, all aspects of our business continue to perform well in the third quarter and remain in line with or ahead of the key targets outlined in our most recent 3-year plan. With 2014 largely wrapped up, we're fully focused on setting the company up for a strong 2015.","In short, but without providing forward guidance at this time, we expect 2015 to look relatively similar to 2014, meaning that operating fundamentals should remain very favorable and development highly accretive. Both of these will help drive cash flow and NAV growth in 2015.","Nationally, multifamily fundamentals remain strong. The vast majority of our markets continue to experience outsized demand relative to supply, while single-family housing challenges persist due to changing demographic trends, strict credit standards and low inventories.","We do not expect these dynamics to change anytime soon, but we'll be monitoring the recent news that the GSEs may loosen credit standards.","Against this backdrop, and in conjunction with our strong 2014 results to date, we raised our full year earnings and same-store revenue forecast in today's press release. Tom will discuss the details in his prepared remarks, while Jerry will address the success we achieved pushing rental rates during the quarter to benefit 2015.","In fact, even when faced with higher supply in many of our markets than at 1 year ago, our advantageous product mix and strong submarket locations resulted in combined new and renewal lease growth of 4.8% this quarter, 30 basis points above that achieved in third quarter 2013.","This acceleration is more noteworthy when considering that Jerry and team accomplished this, while maintaining high occupancies during the quarter.","Moving on. The third quarter was successful for UDR in a number of fronts. First, and as previously announced, we closed on $97 million of noncore multifamily dispositions at better pricing than originally contemplated. Proceeds will continue to fund our accretive development projects.","Second, we are under contract to sell all the communities in our Texas joint venture or approximately 3,400 apartment homes, of which we own 20% plus a promote and fees. We have received hard money and the sale is scheduled to close in January 2015 for approximately $400 million in total proceeds. We expect to achieve a strong return on this investment although the loss of the management fees will negatively affect our 2000 earnings by around $0.01. We will provide additional details when the transaction closes.","Third, we completed $121 million of 1031 acquisitions in Seattle, a market where we were under-allocated from our NOI perspective. The addition of the newly constructed high-quality community satisfies our acquisition guidance for 2014.","Fourth, we issued approximately $100 million of equity at or around consensus NAV during the quarter, which will primarily be used to fund our accretive $92 million Steele Creek participating loan investment in Denver. This use is consistent with our past commentary, that is we will consider issuing equity to fund accretive growth opportunities when our shares trade at or above NAV after fees.","Fifth, we started $125 million, 381-home development during the quarter in Irvine, California and a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife. We will continue to develop with Met as we work through the remaining 6 land parcels in joint venture 1. In the fourth quarter, we will complete the development of 2 wholly owned projects for a total cost of $183 million. Jerry will speak on our pre-leasing progress, which is going quite well.","Sixth, we've received a credit upgrade from Moody's to Baa1 and changed outlook from S&P to BBB+. Tom will provide additional details on these items in his prepared remarks. However, from a bigger picture perspective, these achievements continue to advance the strategic initiatives outlined in our 3-year plan and emphasize our ongoing commitment to generate long-term, high-quality cash flow growth, while also continuing to improve our portfolio and balance sheet.","In conclusion, I'd like to thank all my fellow associates for all their hard work in producing another strong quarter for UDR. We look forward to the remainder of 2014 and to a great 2015.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Herzog","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: first, our third quarter 2014 results; second, a balance sheet and credit ratings update; third, ATM equity issuance during the quarter and intended use of proceeds; fourth, a development update; fifth, an overview of third quarter transactions; and last, our fourth quarter and full year 2014 guidance.","First, our third quarter results came in at the high end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.41, $0.38 and $0.34, respectively. Quarterly, same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 4.4%, 2.9% and 5.1%, respectively.","Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our financial leverage at an underappreciated cost basis was 39.2%, and on a fair value basis, it was around 31%. It will trend lower by year-end. Our net debt to EBITDA was 6.7x, and we are on track to reach the mid-6s by year-end. Given this ongoing improvement, Moody's recently upgraded our senior unsecured credit ratings to Baa1, and S&P changed their outlook to BBB+. The improved ratings will result in approximately $1 million in annual savings on our revolver and term debt, in addition to tighter spreads on future unsecured debt issuances.","Looking forward, we have $325 million of 5.25% unsecured debt maturing in January 2015 and another $188 million of 5.9% secured debt maturing in December 2015. Current rates look very attractive, and we continue to feel good about our ability to refinance this maturing debt.","At quarter-end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $755 million. Next, as Tom mentioned, we issued approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock during the quarter, using our at-the-market equity program. The shares were issued at a gross price of $29.95 per share and net price of $29.36 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $100 million. The net price stacked up well against our consensus NAV during the quarter, and the proceeds will be used primarily to fund our accretive $92 million participating loan investment in the Steele Creek development property located in the Cherry Creek area of Denver.","Turning to development. At quarter-end, our under construction and recently completed pipeline totaled $1 billion or 73% funded. Inclusive of our $422 million of stabilized, non-mature developments for wholly owned and JVs, the estimated trended spread on our development projects was 190 to 195 basis points at quarter-end. During the quarter, we started 1 development project in a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife. The Residences at 2801 Kelvin is located in Irvine, California, where we have 381 homes at a projected cost of $125 million at 100%. In the fourth quarter, our Beach & Ocean development in Huntington Beach, California, and our DelRay Tower project in Alexandria, Virginia, will reach completion. These projects consist of 505 homes at an aggregate cost of $183 million. Both projects are actively pre-leasing and will enhance the quality of our existing portfolio.","As to future development projects, we continue to underwrite opportunities and will take advantage of our land bank. In the fourth quarter, we expect to start 2 additional development projects, at least 1 of which will be in a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife. Both will be in core California markets with aggregate projected spend of approximately $200 million to $220 million and have trended spreads in our targeted range of 150 to 200 basis points.","Next, transactions. In July, we closed the sales of an Orlando community, 2 communities in Norfolk and a small commercial asset in Glendale, California, for an aggregate $108 million. In total, the multifamily communities were sold at a weighted average cash flow cap rate of 6.2% or $101,000 per home, contained 963 homes at average rent per occupied home of $1,050 and were on average 20 years old. Our 2014 guidance currently contemplates an additional $115 million to $165 million in dispositions by year-end. We're making progress with these transactions and will provide further details as they become available.","A portion of our third quarter dispositions were classified as 1031 transactions for tax planning purposes. With these 1031 proceeds, we purchased 2 newly constructed Seattle communities, Lightbox and Waterscape, for a combined $121 million. The communities were acquired for a weighted average stabilized cash flow cap rate of 4.5% and contained 358 homes. Lightbox is in the University district adjacent to our existing Kennedy community, which will result in operating efficiencies. And Waterscape is located in Kirkland, near Google's expanding Seattle campus. Both assets represent excellent additions to our portfolio.","Onto fourth quarter and full year 2014 guidance. Third quarter earnings and same-store sales growth remained strong, and we're increasing our full year 2014 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance by $0.01 each at the midpoints. FFO per share guidance was raised to $1.52 (sic) [$1.54] to $1.56, FFO as adjusted to $1.51 to $1.53 and AFFO to $1.34 to $1.36.","For same store, we are increasing our full year 2014 revenue growth guidance to 4% to 4.5%, up 25 basis points at the midpoint and increasing our expense growth guidance to 2.25% to 2.75%, up 50 basis points at the midpoint. The 5% midpoint of our NOI growth guidance did not change, although we did tighten the range by 25 basis points on both ends to 4.75% to 5.25%.","Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 27 of our supplement.","Fourth quarter 2014 FFO and FFO as adjusted per share guidance is $0.38 to $0.40. AFFO per share guidance is $0.33 to $0.35.","Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.26 in the third quarter or $1.04 per share when annualized. This represents a yield of approximately 3.6% and will be our 168th straight quarter of paying a dividend.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry.","Jerry A. Davis","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon. In my remarks, I will cover the following topics: first, our third quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the success we realized in pushing rental rate growth this quarter; second, the performance of our primary core markets during the quarter; and last, a brief update on our recently completed and in lease-up developments.","We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. Our same-store revenue growth of 4.4% was driven by an increase in revenue per occupied home of 3.8% year-over-year to $1,619 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.8% was 60 basis points higher versus the prior year period.","Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,779 per month, including pro rata JVs. Our revenue growth through the first 9 months of the year has remained strong at 4.4%, as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 3.8% increase in revenue per occupied home. We see this strength continuing into the fourth quarter.","Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8(NYSE:G) of our supplement. As Tom mentioned earlier, blended new and renewal lease rate growth was 4.8% during the quarter, 30 basis points higher than the 4.5% growth we generated in 3Q 2013. While a portion of this acceleration was due to the tailwind provided by still robust market fundamentals, our elevated occupancy of 97% at the end of the second quarter allowed us to push new and renewal rate.","Our 5.1% third quarter renewal rate growth was comparable to previous quarters, while we grew new leases by 4.5%, approximately 80 basis points above 3Q '13's rate. This is a complete reversal from what we experienced earlier in 2014 when our first quarter new lease rate growth lagged the first quarter of 2013 by 120 basis points. As such, our greater focus on pushing new lease rate growth in 3Q, when combined with sticky occupancy and annualized turnover that declined by 450 basis points year-over-year, has set us up well to take advantage of further pricing opportunities in the fourth quarter and in 2015.","During the fourth quarter, we expect the typical seasonal slowdown to occur but believe there's plenty of gas left in the tank to continue pushing the rate as evidenced by our current same-store physical occupancy of 96.8% and October new lease rate growth that is 100 to 150 basis points higher than that of October 2013, all with comparable renewal rate growth.","Market-wise, San Francisco, Seattle, the Monterey Peninsula and Portland performed well, while the Mid-Atlantic region continued to struggle. On the expense front, we increased our annual same-store growth forecast by 50 basis points at the midpoint. This was primarily the result of higher-than-expected insurance claims at a couple of our communities and higher property-level incentive compensation as a result of our strong rental rate growth and increased bonus compensation related to the ongoing successful implementation of our repair and maintenance efficiency initiatives.","Next, rent as a percentage of our residents' income held steady at roughly 19%. Move-outs to home purchase were up 50 basis points year-over-year at 14%, still below our long-term average of approximately 15%.","Moving on to quarterly performance in our primary core markets. These markets represent 66% of our same-store NOI and 71% of our total NOI.","Orange County and Los Angeles, which combined represents 16.5% of our total NOI, continue to slowly improve. On our call last quarter, I discussed our strategy to lengthen the average lease term at our largest property in Orange County, which represents roughly 50% of our same-store asset pool in the market. This strategic move had a negative effect on 2Q occupancy and new lease rate growth. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter occupancy increased by 100 basis points to 96%, and our new lease rate growth improved to 4.5% from second quarter's negative 0.5%. We will benefit in 2015 from this move.","New York City, which represents 13% of our total NOI, generated new lease and renewal lease rate growth of 4.5% each with occupancy of 97.7% during the third quarter. New York remains a good market, and with occupancy currently above 98%, we are anticipating a strong fourth quarter.","Metro Washington, D.C., which represents 13% of our total NOI, had occupancy of 97.1% and revenue growth of 0.1% in the third quarter, a strong result considering the ongoing concerns many have for this market. As we have stated throughout 2014, we believe our relative outperformance versus peers results from our 60% B portfolio in D.C. and less direct competition from new supply in our submarkets. We expect these factors will continue to help us to fare better in the fourth quarter and 2015.","We are still expecting positive full year 2014 revenue growth of just under 1% in Washington, D.C.","San Francisco, which represents 12% of our total NOI, continues to generate extremely strong results due to high-quality employment growth and a general housing shortage in the city proper. For the quarter, new lease rate growth exceeded 10%, with renewals up 8.6%. Our October numbers remain strong.","Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI, is a high new supply market that has held up well due to elevated employment growth. New lease rate growth exceeded 8% in the third quarter, and renewal growth continues to be toward the upper end of our portfolio.","Austin, which represents 5.5% of our total NOI, had good third quarter revenue growth of 4.7%, driven in part by high third quarter seasonal new lease and renewal rate growth of roughly 7% each. We expect our suburban locations will continue to outperform as they are less directly impacted by new supply that is being delivered in the downtown core, although move-outs to home purchase have recently been affecting us in the south shore markets.","Lastly, Dallas, which represents 5% of our NOI, is performing in line with our initial budgeted expectations, but we have recently begun to feel the effects of new supply in uptown and in North Dallas. Fortunately, Dallas continues to enjoy strong job growth.","Turning to our recently completed and in lease-up developments. In aggregate, our California developments continue to perform well. Demand at our 467-home, $150 million Bella Terra community in Huntington Beach and our 315-home, $147 million Channel Mission Bay community in San Francisco remains fantastic. Both properties hit 90% leased in less than 7 months, with rents well ahead of pro forma estimates. 13th and Market, our 264-home, $73 million lease-up in downtown San Diego, and Los Alisos, our 320-home, $87.5 million lease-up in Aliso Viejo, California, are generally on plan but have been battling new supply. Beach & Ocean, our 173-home, $51 million lease-up in Huntington Beach, ended the quarter 35% leased and we welcomed our first residents in mid-October. In D.C., both our 256-home, $63 million Domain College Park lease-up in College Park, Maryland, and our 332-home, $132 million DelRay Tower lease-up in Alexandria continue to perform below expectations due primarily to ongoing market weakness. Despite this, we remain confident in these communities' long-term prospects and for D.C. in general.","With that, I will open the call up to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the ATM usage in the quarter. You mentioned -- obviously, you used it for Steele Creek, which you consider to be an accretive use of the capital. Do you guys see additional accretive uses for ATM capital based on where you could issue stock today? And should we expect to see more ATM issuance in coming quarters?","Thomas M. Herzog","Karin, this is Tom Herzog. Yes, good question. As far as accretive uses, there will be other accretive uses. I mean, the fact is, from a development perspective, we've always spoken to that being accretive, but that's funded through noncore sales. But as we think about just funding sources in general, there are really 3 different types of funding sources, as you know. There's equity, there's debt, there's sales and there are merits to each depending on market conditions. So as we look out into the future, certainly, we have to take into account market conditions at those times as to which of those funding sources makes the most sense for us and our shareholders. So we still like funding development with noncore sales. We like the match funding aspect to it. But we don't rule out the possibility that with the right market conditions, that we would consider other sources of capital as well, including equities. So we have to wait and see what it looks like as circumstances dictate in the future.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My second question is, you mentioned the sale of the Texas JV. Could you just talk about what drove the decision to make the sale at this time and what your expectations are for your remaining Texas portfolio?","Thomas W. Toomey","Karin, this is Tom. With respect to that sale, what drove it, the debt maturity is coming up for prepayment. We looked at the value and the IRR returns that we saw we're achieving at this point in time. And with the partnership with Fannie Mae concluded, it would be best to expose it to the market and we had a price that was very attractive to us and to them. And so we think it's going to be a good execution and a good benefit for UDR.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Do you expect to exit those markets entirely over time?","Thomas W. Toomey","No, I think we're very comfortable with our exposure in Austin and Dallas and then see those as dynamic markets. We like our submarket and product fit. And we're all very comfortable about where we're at on the investment side, but we do like those markets.","Operator","And the next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions on the operations, I guess, for you, Jerry. The gap between new and renewal has narrowed from about, let's see, 190 bps at 2Q to about 60 bps this quarter with a meaningful pickup on the new lease side. First, what was that gap for October? And then also, how do you think that relationship evolves over the next new weaker seasonal quarters? And perhaps can you give us some regional insight on the October numbers?","Jerry A. Davis","Sure. I'll start with the gap in October. It's actually our current new lease rate growth rate in October is projected to be probably a hair under 3% and renewals will be about 5.1%, so it's about 200 basis points. This is normal seasonality, as you know. New lease rate growth tends to fluctuate with the bell curve and below in the first quarter and fourth quarter and then it peaks up in the second and third, so you would expect the gap to compress. Probably more importantly, I mean, you picked up what was it last quarter and what was -- what is it in October. But when we looked at what the gap was a year ago, because we think that's more important to look at, last year in the third quarter, the gap was 180 basis points, and this quarter, it was 60 basis points. And really, what we're trying to do, Haendel, we may have spoken about this before, is we've been focusing more on driving up new lease rates because we think that sets a new market rent for our properties. When you set those new market rents, we think it makes it easier as you go forward to achieve higher renewal growth. So it's hard to continuously have a large gap between renewals and new and it will eventually put a ceiling on what you can get on renewals. We thought this was the best strategy to have. And I think when we look at our total revenue growth and when you look at how much better new lease rate growth is doing, both in the third quarter as well as so far this quarter, we're pretty optimistic about strength as we go into the remainder of the year and especially into 2015. The part that really surprised us, we said last quarter on this call that we were willing to take a reduction in occupancy to achieve this higher new lease rate growth that's at higher markets. And what we saw was we had no drop-off in renewal -- in occupancy. Part of that was because turnover dropped the 450 basis points and it gave us the ability to continue to push new rate. Even though our closing ratios came down a bit, we didn't have to close on every one. People that were just price shopping chose to go live somewhere else and we were able to elevate that. So we think it's going to pay off in the long term. Now you had another question about...","Thomas M. Herzog","Some regional insight...","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Some regional insight into the new versus renewal for October.","Jerry A. Davis","Yes, you've seen -- again, I told you October versus 3Q is down about 140, 150 basis points in total. You've seen less of a drop in the West, where it stayed -- the total western part of the United States is at 5.3%. There were probably at about a 6%, 7%. So it did drop but it's still very strong. The southwest, which is our 2 Texas markets, are coming in closer to a 2%. The Mid-Atlantic region is the one that's suffering the most right now. It's at a negative 2%. That's made up of Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Norfolk and Richmond. All of those are negative with the exception of Richmond. Currently, in Washington, D.C., we're showing new lease rate growth that's about negative 2.7% and that compares to negative 1% in September. So you're seeing that typical seasonality of drop. Baltimore has probably turned more negative than we would have expected based on how well we did there last quarter. Last quarter, we had new lease rate growth that was positive 1.8%, and today, it's down at negative 3%. So we have been feeling the effects not only of the seasonality but of also some new supply. Then the other one that drops and I think this is predominantly seasonality, maybe a little bit new supply, but -- is Boston. Boston went from being up on new lease rate growth in the third quarter at 6.9%, and in October, it's 1.8%. While that seems alarming, when I go back and look at how I did last October in Boston, it was sub-2% also. So that's a typical seasonality. Everything else has stayed pretty much the same or has had that typical 150 basis points drop with 2 exceptions to the upside. New York City stayed stable with where it was in the third quarter at 4.5%, and our Orlando market actually picked up its pace. It was at 5.4% in 3Q and it's up to 6.3%. And then on renewals, like I said, Haendel, those stayed fairly stable year-round. So the 5.1% has stayed exactly the same in October.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And you brought up occupancy, which is sort of my follow-up. You guys ended the quarter here at 96.8%, unchanged from last quarter, your highest level in, looks like, 15 years of operating data that we have in front of us here. Despite your turnover being -- your turnover is down about 250 basis points, as you noted. You're pushing new leases more aggressively as you mentioned during the quarter. So my question is, looking back, perhaps do you feel like there is some opportunity left on the table in retrospect by not pushing more? And then I guess heading into, again, 4Q, 1Q, do you expect to maintain a similarly low turnover, high occupancy levels?","Jerry A. Davis","I think occupancy will probably drop a bit. We do have 1 or 2 seasonal markets like our Monterey Peninsula that will just naturally bring it down. I think renewals, did we leave money on the table? We had a strategic -- we made a strategic decision really to go after new to reset that mark that would help us on renewals later. I think you're going to see renewal growth probably strengthen a bit as the rest of this quarter goes and not drop from its 5.1%. But we are definitely more focused on taking care of our existing residents, watching probable effect of what it does to our NOI stream. But we do feel the strategy, more than anything, Haendel, sets us up for 2015. It's paid off better than I expected in 2014 but it definitely set us up to go into 2015 probably as strong or stronger than we finished last year.","Operator","Next will be Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What was the difference in performance of A and B class assets across the portfolio? And then you mentioned D.C., but are there any other markets where that variance was pronounced?","Jerry A. Davis","Really, Bs for the quarter, Nick, in new and -- a blend between new and renewal growth was about 110 basis points better than As. As we look at the month of October, that compressed to about 60 basis points. And again, we think that goes predominantly to the effect of new supply on A and not on B product. D.C. was probably the most pronounced. I will tell you, in our Seattle markets, we got A product both in the city of Bellevue as well as downtown Seattle. While they've done well, our suburban product that's more of a B-caliber asset in Renton as well as down south near Tacoma and some of the suburbs up north that cater to the Boeing plants have done a bit better.","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about the Seattle acquisitions and increasing your exposure there after being underweight. Are there any other markets that you're either over- or underweight relative to your longer-term targets?","Harry G. Alcock","I think -- Nick, this is Harry. I think if you look at the markets where we're allocating capital and you'll see markets like Boston in particular where we're completing a large development project, San Francisco Bay Area, again, where we're developing 399 Fremont, we tended to allocate capital to markets in which we want to grow our presence and we're selling out of the markets in which we want to reduce our presence.","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But nothing jumps out other than kind of that slow growth through development or selling on the margin, not new markets jump out as either overweight or underweight kind of where the portfolio is today?","Harry G. Alcock","That's right.","Operator","And our next question -- [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Tom, in your opening comments, you alluded to Fannie and Freddie's plans to expand mortgage credit. But can you share your thoughts on the potential impact to your business?","Thomas W. Toomey","David, it's really early to tell what's going to come of this. As we look through the portfolio of things that come off on the surface, we have a very small 3-bedroom portfolio that would be probably potentially exposed, but I don't feel that -- I don't feel much exposure at this point to political rhetoric. We've got 4 months after the election to seat Congress. They're going to have time to sit down and look at this and think about what they really want to do. They have to answer questions about risk retention and how that will be handled. And so this is probably going to be a story for the third quarter of next year is about time they get their act together and come out with some clarity.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as it relates to dispositions, you -- it looks like you'll exceed your disposition plans for 2014. And now that we have a potential reacceleration in single-family housing plus more multifamily activity in the second half of this year from Fannie and Freddie, is this a ripe environment for you to go beyond the 6, I think you have -- sorry, $400 million to $600 million dispositions penciled in for 2015 and '16, given the risks on the single-family side plus a robust disposition environment, might we see you go nicely beyond that range?","Thomas M. Herzog","Dave, this is Tom Herzog. Our disposition guidance, obviously, for this year came in about where we expected it with a couple of minor adjustments that we've made. As we look to '15 and '16, again, we're really looking at it, that we've got 3 different sources of capital. We have to -- as we go forward to make the optimal decisions for our company, our shareholders, we have to look at where equity prices out at, what debt looks like, what the different objectives around those are and then look to sales proceeds additionally. And with that, do we have assets that are noncore that we would like to liquidate early or recycle? Those decisions come into play. So we're not ready yet to specify how much each of those different buckets we'll include. And I don't even think that's something, when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, that we want to get too specific on. I think that there's a general capital need and it's more directional and then decisions are made throughout the year as conditions become known. So we'll certainly start the year with the type of capital need that we have as a whole and some directional guidance. But as far as specifics, that probably comes later.","Operator","And we'll go on to Jana Galan with Bank of America.","Jane Wong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jane Wong for Jana. I was wondering if you could provide some outlook for 2015 in Washington, D.C., what you're expecting there.","Thomas M. Herzog","Well, I'd say this -- and again, this is Tom Herzog and I'll turn it to Jerry for something directional. But as far as providing guidance for 2015 at this point, that's something we're going to save for our fourth quarter call. We've got great momentum going into the end of the year. And as Tom Toomey has indicated, we expect '15 as a whole to look a lot like 2014. So we're very optimistic, but not providing specific guidance. But kind of directionally, Jerry, any comments you'd make on D.C.?","Jerry A. Davis","Yes. I guess, generally, I would say we would expect D.C. next year to be slightly worse than this year. I'd remind you this year we're going to have positive revenue growth of somewhere between 0.5% and 1% with meaningful decline. We think it's a submarket-by-submarket situation in Washington, D.C., and just as we've outperformed there, really, over the last several years because of our mix of A and B product with B staying about 60%. While we are affected by supply, it's not quite as much. We're optimistic that next year we'll see more job growth that will help to absorb those new units that are coming on. But I don't think you're going to see it be meaningfully different than what you saw this year.","Jane Wong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just one more quick question. Thank you for the color on the spreads to cap rates for your development yields being towards the upper end of your range, but can you talk a little bit about prevailing cap rate trends in your markets, any changes? And for the 2 starts in California, you expect the 150 to 200 basis points spread. But kind of what are the prevailing market cap rates there today that you see?","Harry G. Alcock","This is Harry Alcock. I think that, in general, in the types of markets where we're developing cap rates of -- remain the same to perhaps come down slightly. The types of cap rates that we're looking at for our California starts, the Irvine property, for example, is around 4.25%. Most of them are going to be between kind of in that 4%, 4.25% cap rate type range. So these are quality properties in high-quality locations as measured by having very low cap rates.","Operator","And we'll go to the next question from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jerry, just going back to your positive comments about leasing strengthening in October, the uplift you're getting from the leasing efforts. As we think about the earn-in going into '15, is it reasonable to expect the earn-in in 2015 to be actually higher than it was going into '14? And then Tom, is your -- I know you're not providing guidance for '14 -- I mean, for '15 rather. But as you think about the preliminary budgeting, just on the expense side, anything that stands out to you at this point?","Jerry A. Davis","This is Jerry. I'll go first. We've looked at it and it's -- the earn-in to '15 is very similar to what it was last year, which leads back to what Toomey said in his initial comments, that '15 to us is looking quite a bit like '14, both -- as far as job growth, supply and all that stuff coming to hit us. But where we are in the ground right now is, again, we're doing better on new lease rate growth. We've been pushing that over the last 4 to 5 months. We're going into the year with probably higher occupancy than we went into last year. So you probably won't see next year us get as much of a pickup in occupancy, if any, but we do think we're going to see the same type of strength in pushing the rate as we saw last year.","Thomas M. Herzog","Okay. Mike, Herzog here again. As far as budgeting on the expense side, we're well through the process so I have a feel for that. There's nothing dramatic coming up on the expense side that you need to be concerned about.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And just as my follow-up question. As we think about dispositions, any governor on that just related to taxable net gains just because you had the 1031s in the quarter? I know you're working through some of those noncore and warehouse assets; you've held them for quite some time. How do you -- can you talk about kind of how you manage the process of tax gains versus issuing equity as we think about funding kind of going forward?","Thomas M. Herzog","Yes, good question. The 1031s in 2014, those are mainly sales out of the TRS, so that avoids any cash taxes as we're recycling some of those assets. As far as sales out of the REIT, we have to take care to watch our gain capacity and that is something that the team here is very tuned into, and it is a limiter on how much, frankly, we can sell or any REIT can sell. So that does definitely enter into our calculus.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Tom Toomey for any additional or closing remarks.","Thomas W. Toomey","Well, again, thank all of you for your time, and as we started this conference call, we feel really good about the business. We feel great about the business plan. '14 is a good year for us. We're very focused on '15 and the execution. It looks, at this point in time, to be a very similar year to '14, and we feel very proud about that and that's driven by solid fundamentals by a team working very well together on a good plan and execution. And we know that we'll see a lot of you next week at NAREIT and we'll let you get to your next call. Thank you for your time again today.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation today."]}}
