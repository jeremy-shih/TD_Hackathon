Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of the call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.","Now I'd like to introduce Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.","Kathleen Valentine","Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K.","A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Thank you, Kathleen. Before we get started, I'd like to say a few words about our leadership transition. Last week, we announced that Steve Rusckowski will become the President and Chief Executive Officer of Quest Diagnostics effective May 1. Also, Dr. Dan Stanzione, currently our leading independent Director, will become non-executive Chairman at that time. We are pleased to have someone of Steve's caliber join and lead Quest Diagnostics. Steve is a strong leader with a proven track record of success. His experience and expertise will benefit the company as it looks to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.","I know that all of you are anxious to hear about Steve and his plans for the company. However, please hold your questions until after he arrives. Now to the results.","We had a very solid first quarter. Our 6.3% increase in revenue was driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. We generated a 7% increase in earnings per share. We increased guidance for adjusted EPS to between $4.45 and $4.60. We saw strong growth in esoteric and gene-based testing as a result of our focus on cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders. In addition, we saw improved growth in routine testing.","We also are making good progress in our previously announced $500 million cost reduction initiative aimed at improving operational efficiency. Let me briefly comment on long-term and short-term market trends.","The long-term fundamentals for our business remain strong. The population is growing and aging, prevalence of chronic conditions is on the rise, early detection and wellness are increasing in importance, the pace of medical innovation is accelerating and we are seeing much greater engagement by payers, employers and patients in improving health outcomes and reducing costs.","However, in the short-term, the current market environment continues to be challenging. Published data indicates physician office visits have been weak in spite of mild weather. Reimbursement pressure from government and other payers continues. Against this backdrop, we continue to execute our growth plans and while we have made good progress, we have more to do. As we have said before, our growth strategy is based on 3 factors: One, driving innovative new tests and service to improving sales performance and towards strengthening our relationships with health plans and other payers.","Demand for esoteric and gene-based testing continued to grow faster than routine testing. In the quarter, esoteric and gene-based testing grew 20%. Volume for SureSwab gynecological testing was up more than 50% and ImmunoCAP allergy testing was up more than 10%. Vitamin D testing also continued to grow.","Anatomic Pathology Testing continues to be affected by physician in sourcing. However, the impact on revenues has continued to moderate. There have been recent developments which we believe may lessen the impact and potentially reverse this trend over time.","Last week, Health Affairs published a study on physicians who refer biopsies to pathology labs in which they have a financial interest. The study found these physicians billed Medicare for 72% more evaluations, but find fewer cancers. This study highlights the adverse impact of unnecessary procedures on patients and the need for Congress to end the loophole in the Stark legislation that currently allows it.","In addition, we are encouraged to see health plans taking actions, including changing reimbursement policies related to in-office testing. In science and innovation, we continue to focus on bringing innovative tests to market that will improve patient care and help health lower healthcare costs. Last week, the FDA cleared out new test for C. Diff, a common and dangerous hospital-acquired infection. This test uses proprietary technique to deliver faster results for hospitals and clinical labs.","Also last month, we launched the first molecular test to help physicians detect rejection in kidney transplant patients weeks before conventional tests. Our renal transplant monitoring test enables doctors to adjust therapy based on each individual's genetic makeup. It has the potential to improve patient care, while helping to reduce the significant cost of failed kidney transplants.","This test is the latest example of how we are driving personalized medicine. We are the only major laboratory to have these unique end-to-end capabilities, from biomarker discovery to laboratory developed tests at LDTs to FDA-cleared IVD test kits. These capabilities are attracting interest from pharmaceutical companies and resulting in new companion diagnostics and new business.","We are seeing greater traction in our sales efforts. The sales organization has made gains in important focus areas. We have returned to growth in women's health testing and are seeing continued strong growth in prescription drug monitoring. Additionally, health plans and employers continue to focus on reducing out-of-network spending and work that's going to high-cost providers. Some of these actions include: Implementing stronger policies that benefit lower-cost in network providers like us; others include expanding educational outreach to employers and employees to emphasize the importance of using lower-cost in-network providers.","Regarding our cost structure, we are committed to reduce it by $500 million over a 3-year period and we are on track. ","Now, Bob will provide analysis of our performance and then we will take your questions. Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","Thanks, Surya. As noted by Surya, revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, reflecting strong growth of 6.3%. And adjusted earnings per share was $1.07 compared to $1 in the prior year, a 7% increase. The earnings improvement is principally driven by top-line growth.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter excludes $0.05 per share associated with restructuring and integration costs and $0.03 associated with the CEO transition. Adjusted EPS from last year's first quarter excludes items totaling $1.33 per share, associated with the impact of the Medi-Cal charge, severe weather and restructuring and transaction costs. These items are further detailed in Footnote 2 to the earnings release.","Consolidated revenue growth was driven by the acquisitions of Athena, Celera and SED, which contributed 3.2% to growth in the quarter. The favorable impact from weather about 2%, and about 1% growth in the underlying business. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew 6.4% in the quarter with acquisitions contributing 2.8% growth and favorable weather comparisons contributing about 2%.","Volume in the quarter grew 3.4% from the prior year. We estimate the impact of weather helped the year-over-year comparisons by about 2%. Adjusting for the favorable impact of weather and the contribution from acquisitions, underlying volume growth was almost 1%. This continues the positive trend which began in the fourth quarter of last year.","The market, in terms of estimated physician office visits, continues to be soft. In the quarter, the published data reflects about a 2% decline compared to the prior year. While our most recent improvement in volume is encouraging, the year-over-year comparisons are favorably impacted by weather and as such, we continue to believe it is still too early to conclude the market has turned the corner.","Drugs of Abuse Testing volume has continued to rebound and grew about 5% in the quarter, in line with the growth of last quarter. Revenue per requisition was 2.9% above the prior year with the improvement principally due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera. Note; the impact on revenue per requisition, associated with the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, will anniversary next quarter.","Revenues in our nonclinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and Healthcare IT grew about 6% in the quarter, driven by the products business acquired as part of the Celera acquisition. Adjusted operating income, as a percentage of revenues, was 16.5% compared to 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring, integration and CEO transition costs totaling $20 million reduced the reported operating income percentage by about 1 percentage point from the most recent quarter.","Both reported and adjusted operating income percentages were reduced by about 50 basis points due to costs associated with a legal settlement and costs associated with changes in assets held in deferred compensation points.","In last year's first quarter, the Medi-Cal charge and other special items, together totaling $270 million, significantly reduced reported operating income. Last July, we announced a multi-year initiative, the goal of which is to reduce our cost structure by $500 million by the end of 2014. As we shared with you last quarter, we expect to deliver about 20% of the $500 million goal by the end of this year with the remainder in 2013 and 2014. While it is still early in the year, we are on track to meet our 2012 targets.","As we've previously shared, common themes across most areas include standardizing systems, processes and databases, increased use of automation and technology and centralizing and selective outsourcing. The next few years, this will require some increased level of capital spending to standardize systems and upgrade IT infrastructure. We are fully committed to realizing the planned benefits from this program which will not only make our company more efficient, but also serve as a platform for accelerated growth.","Currently, we continue to produce industry-leading performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, which is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with unmet deductibles and co-pays was 4.2% in the quarter, unchanged from the prior year. DSOs were 44 days compared to 45 days last quarter.","Cash from operations, which is generally lowest in the first quarter, was $161 million and is comparable to the prior-year level. Capital expenditures were $30 million in the quarter compared to $39 million a year ago.","During the quarter, we repurchased 847,000 common shares at an average price of $59, for a total of $50 million. We also reduced our outstanding debt by $105 million in connection with our stated objective to delever by $500 million to $700 million this year.","Turning to 2012 guidance. We now expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenue to grow between 2% and 2.5%; operating income to approximate 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion; capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $225 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.45 and $4.60 compared to previous guidance of $4.40 to $4.55. ","Now I'll turn it back to Surya.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Thanks, Bob. In summary, we had a very solid quarter. We are making progress in a number of areas to drive growth and reduce our costs. We have named a new Chief Executive Officer for Quest Diagnostics, Steve Rusckowski, with a proven track record. I will be here through April 30 to ensure a smooth transition.","Finally, I want to say how proud I am of Quest Diagnostics and my 42,000 colleagues in what they have accomplished so far and what they will accomplish in the future. Quest Diagnostics is strong financially, medically and technologically. It's a unique company with a very bright future.","We're now ready to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Adam Feinstein of Barclays.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just, maybe just get you to talk a little bit more about the margin outlook. I know you guys have been talking about the 18% and clearly more focused on managing costs and everything here. But maybe just go through the thoughts in a little bit more detail on the margin outlook and the ultimate drivers.","Robert A. Hagemann","Adam, as generally the first quarter is the lowest margin percentage of the year, bad debt tends to be the highest as a result of the higher patient responsibility for co-pays and deductibles. The volumes tend to be softer than the latter quarters. And as we saw last year, margins continued to improve as we went through the year. We're expecting the same thing this year. And if you look at the adjusted margins, they did expand from a year ago on what's relatively modest underlying organic growth. I think we've mentioned in the past that generally we need about 2% organic growth in order to hold margins and offset the inflation that we've got to the cost base and that this year the margin expansion that we are expecting, given that we're expecting pretty modest organic growth, is really coming from the cost reduction program. And as we progress through the year, we expect to see more benefits from that and we also expect that we'll continue to expand the margins as the year progresses. Remember too, as I pointed out in the script, margins, the adjusted margins were depressed by about 50 basis points or so this quarter because of a legal settlement and because of the adjustment assets in deferred compensation plans.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And just maybe a quick follow-up if I may here. So maybe just a quick update just in terms of the CEO transition process. I guess just thoughts in terms of just how the process will take place and what, I guess, from the outside looking in, what does the transition process really entail? So any high-level thoughts?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Sure, Adam. First of all, Steve Rusckowski is a veteran of healthcare industry and he is not new to what is important for patients and for payers and also for providers. So we are really excited to have him lead this company. I have had a number of discussions with him. He is -- we are helping him to get some material, as much as he can read, before he comes to the company. He still has to finish his jobs, but I am very pleased with his knowledge and also his engagement so far. So I think the transition is going to go very smoothly, and I will be here until April 30, the last day, and he will join on May 1, the first day of his, rest of his career.","Operator","Our next question is from Dane Leone from Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","So my question, my first question here is on the organic volume growth, you mentioned that you stripped out weather. I was curious, did you have an extra day in the quarter from the leap year? And if so, what was the effect on volume growth?","Robert A. Hagemann","It's a question a few people have asked, and maybe we should have been proactive in addressing it. But the answer is no. If you look at the way the New Year's holiday fell, this year the New Year's holiday fell in January, whereas the prior year, it actually fell on December 31 and didn't impact the quarter. So that's really what's offsetting the benefit of leap year this year.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","But wasn't --","Kathleen Valentine","If you recall, I mean, last year, we did call out that the first quarter in 2011, we did have the benefit of an extra day as a result of how the New Year's holiday had fallen.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Right, but I thought the, then Easter, Good Friday fall outside of -- in April versus March last year, is that right?","Robert A. Hagemann","I think they were both in April.","Kathleen Valentine","Yes.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay. On the guidance for the year, could you maybe parse out the operating assumption variation for the EPS, because looking at the low-end of revenue guidance at 2% around an 18% operating margin and not including any capital deployment for debt paydowns over the remainder of the year for stock repurchases, it's a little difficult to get, I guess, below the high-end of your EPS guidance. You come out around $4.60 so yes, maybe just a little bit more color on some of the variation and assumptions for sales growth and operating line.","Robert A. Hagemann","As you can imagine, Dane, whatever model you're using is pretty sensitive to just minor changes in revenue or just a few basis points in operating income. And we have provided a range for revenue. We've indicated approximately 18% in operating income, which means that it could be slightly below that at the low-end of the range. And as you noted, we're not necessarily expecting the weighted average shares outstanding to be significantly different from last year. We are doing some share repurchases this year, but a little more modest than we would otherwise, because of the delevering that's going on.","Operator","Next question is from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just have a question as we think about your guidance going forward on revenue. So if we think now about revenue in the second to fourth quarter, we're now going to be modeling 1% to 1.5% in order to get within your guidance range. Can you maybe just talk about your expectations around it's slowing down? Is it just that you don\u2019t expect utilization to continue where it is? Or is it something else that we should be thinking about?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, Lisa, as you think about our outlook for the back half of the year, there's really nothing fundamentally that's changed there. As you know, we're going to have the acquisitions essentially anniversaried in the second quarter. And when you look at the underlying organic growth adjusted for weather and all the noise that's in there, it was around 1% or so this quarter. We're expecting that over the course of the rest of the year. As you look out at physician office visits and you see how they performed this quarter, it indicates that the market continues to be soft. So we're not necessarily expecting the market to pick up significantly as the year progresses. We're expecting it to remain soft, and that's what's built into our guidance at this point.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then secondly, can you maybe just talk about market pricing in general? There's been a lot of comments out on our side and in the market where people have been concerned about what pricing looks like and what it's going to look like going forward. Can you just add any comments as to what you're seeing right now?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, I think it's no surprise that we continue to see pressure on reimbursement. We expect that to continue for the foreseeable future. And that's frankly one of the motivations behind us reducing costs and launching the program that we did. But despite that, we are indicating that we expect margins can expand this year.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Congratulations again on the completion of the CEO succession process. Surya, just going back to the utilization comments and physician office visits remaining weak. In your prepared remarks, you made a comment about routine testing improving. Just wondering what type of information and analytics you guys have that validates this, what's driving it? And I don't know if you can add any more color on the utilization improving?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, I can tell you that there is no one-to-one correlation about physician office visits and laboratory testing. But having said that, there's 100 million people in the United States suffer from chronic disease and 40 million people are suffering from more than 3. And as you said, we invested quite a bit of time and money in training and creating an effective sales force. And what we are seeing that we are gaining in ground in women's health and some routine testing that goes along with esoteric testings and so all parts of our business are growing, and that's actually an early indicator of the investment we have put in sales and marketing.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Do you think the improvement that you've seen in women's health and the like is coming from the marketing expanding or market share gains?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Again, it's a little too early to say, but my feeling is that usually we consider diagnostic testing is a very safe industry unlike Pharma and devices where things can go wrong. This is the safe investment for the investor, because it's very steady. So the market need to grow 4% to 6% a year, 2% to 3% in price and 2% to 3% in volume, but over the last couple of years, my feeling is and what we see is falling flat of 1%. So in some areas, in new areas, expanding areas like esoteric and gene-based testing, I think the -- we are developing market, and market is growing in some areas we are -- started to gain some market share.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then Bob, I just wanted to clarify the comment to Dane's question about no extra day for leap year. Is that because leap year -- New Year's fell on Sunday, so was Monday a day off for testing?","Robert A. Hagemann","Correct. That's when the holiday was celebrated. It was in January whereas in the prior year, the holiday was actually celebrated in December.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then maybe could you guys just expand a little bit on the commercial pricing environment? Do you have any major contracts coming up? And if so, could we get an update on that?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, there are no national contracts that are up this year. We do have one up in 2013. And we always have contracts, smaller contracts coming up in any given year. But as I said, none of the big national ones are up for renewal. With that said, we're always having conversations with the plans, regardless of whether or not contracts are up. And as I said earlier, I expect that reimbursement will continue to be under pressure, particularly from the health plans. But on the flip side, I think we're making more progress in working with the health plans in driving more work to us to lower-cost in-network providers like ourselves. So hopefully that will be one of the ways that we're able to mitigate some of the continued price pressure, along with what we're doing on the cost side.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That makes a lot of sense. And then could you tell us which contract comes up in 2013, Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","The CIGNA contract is up in '13.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","In terms of -- as we think about the organic revenue growth, I appreciate your sort of conservative view given one quarter in the bank here. But just to make sure I understand the numbers, Bob, you're talking about a little bit under or around 1%, I guess, adjusted organic volume growth. And it seems like maybe the deals added, acquisitions added a little over 2% to your revenue per requisition so maybe without the deals, you're just under 1% as well. Is that fair?","Robert A. Hagemann","The acquisitions did add in excess of 2% to revenue per requisition, driving the vast majority of the increase there.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, so your adjusted or your organic revenue growth, adjusted for weather and whatnot, is probably around 1.5%, is that a fair rough range?","Robert A. Hagemann","You're not far off, yes.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then, could you give us a little bit more on the cost-cutting program? I mean, you've outlined some higher-level initiatives, but can you give us a little bit more tangible examples of the things you did in the quarter that you're working on right now, so we sort of understand what's going on the ground, if you will?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, and Tom, I detailed all of these last quarter. But yes, as a reminder, some of the things that we're working on certainly on the client support side, which include customer service and billing include the leveraging technology to eliminate manual work. We're implementing more self-service for customers, allowing them to supply insurance information, make payments online, check bill status, get test results which, at the end of the day, the more that can be done online, the more efficient it is for us because we're not handling all of those calls. On the procurement and supply chain side, we talked about further consolidating suppliers, rationalizing SKUs. Examples that we gave there were reducing the number of choices for gloves, specimen bags, labels, urine collection cups, et cetera. All of those things are in process at this point. On the SG&A side, we talked about flattening the organization structure, simplifying some management processes and beginning to centralize certain activities and consider outsourcing others. And then on the IT side, we talked about moving our connectivity solutions to ones that will not require hardware that we'll need to service in the field, it makes the installation more efficient and it makes the cost of servicing that connectivity a lot less expensive over time. And then we talked about things that obviously are not yet impacting this quarter like the labs and specimen acquisition as we start to look at the lab footprint capacity utilization, automation being further leveraged in the labs and the like.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just one clarification, Bob, if I could. You had mentioned a couple of other unusual items in the quarter, I guess a change in the assets in the deferred comp plan and another. Can you just highlight that again to make sure we got that?","Robert A. Hagemann","Sure. One was legal settlement that cost us about $5 million and that impacted margins. And then we've talked about this in the past as well, but not recently, and that is the assets in our supplemental deferred compensation plan. The gains and losses on those show up below the line in Other Income Expense. And to the degree it's a gain, that gain shows up below the line, but the offsetting charge shows up above that line as an increase to compensation cost. It's a quirk in the way the accounting works. And given that the market had a very strong return in the first quarter, it really accentuated that in our results this quarter.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, so that nets each other out. So you're just highlighting that second one so we can get a better understanding of the actual margin trends.","Robert A. Hagemann","Correct.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And that legal settlement though, I guess, is an unusual item that would add to your operating profit and your EPS if we wanted to exclude that, is that right?","Robert A. Hagemann","Correct, if you want it to. Unfortunately, sometimes those do happen and we decided that it was not unusual enough to call out for purposes of adjusted EPS.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, so those 2 items together are like between $0.01 and $0.02?","Robert A. Hagemann","Actually, a little more than that, it's about $10 million in total or about 50 basis points. So closer to $0.04...","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Well that's to the margin, right? But the --","Robert A. Hagemann","The one item is about $0.02.","Operator","All right, the next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to go back one last time to the organic growth trends. On the clinical lab testing side, work's sort of shaken out to 1.6, you said volume up about 1%. Pricing roughly up 50 bps. And you mentioned sort of the comping out of some of the deals, so I guess as we think of the model going forward, is that sort of a level that we should be considering when we think of kind of the pricing growth for the rest of the year?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Ralph, as you know, we don't give guidance for the components of revenue growth or the revenue per acquisition or volume. But yes, implied in our guidance for the remainder of the year is about 1% organic revenue growth.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, can you give us what your, what the Anatomic Pathology volume and\/or revenue growth was for the quarter?","Robert A. Hagemann","We don't break that out specifically on a quarterly basis but yes, as you heard in the prepared remarks, it did continue to be under pressure. It was below the prior year, but that impact is starting to moderate. So it's not as severe as it was.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just going back to Surya's comments on the health plans changing policies around that. Can you give us any more color there? I mean is that, is it something that's starting in 2012 or what's the magnitude, is it one plan, is it multitude of plans? Where are we there?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well you know, Ralph, first of all, any changes, that will take some time. But we are very encouraged because the Health Affairs article really show something so critical that the people who have a financial interest, they're billing Medicare more, 72%, and they're finding less cancers. But apart from that, there are lots of effects on patients. So obviously, the plans are very focused on these things. Some plans are denying reimbursement. Some plans are reducing reimbursement. And some plans are asking the laboratory to be clear and approved or CAP accredited. So these are all good things for the patients and good thing for AP business, and we are very encouraged. I for one know that you cannot do cancer testing without anatomic pathology. And this is not going to be long before there is potential that this trend will be reversed.","Robert A. Hagemann","And Ralph, it is multiple health plans that are implementing these changes and hopefully now with the health affairs report being out, it will prompt others to consider changes. And frankly, I think those changes have been contributing to the moderation of the insourcing.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And any more details, I mean, what are they actually saying? Are they saying it can't be done? Are they monitoring? Or is there preauthorization or what exactly is happening?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Some of the [indiscernible] are particularly saying that they will not accept results from the labs which are not CAP accredited.","Kathleen Valentine","Ralph, what they're doing is they're implementing policies. So they're notifying their providers of policies and as we alluded, in some cases the actions that, and the policies that the health plan has implemented is, they notify physicians that they'll be denying reimbursement for this discrete range of CPT codes, pathology testing CPT codes when they're performed, when the claim is submitted from a physician office setting.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just my last one, our understanding is that Aetna recently made Genzyme Genetics out-of-network. Do you guys have a sense at all the potential benefit to you and maybe remind us of your capabilities for those specific tests?","Robert A. Hagemann","Certainly, yes, if their network is narrowed, that's going to be a benefit for us. And there is nothing that Genzyme's doing that we can't offer today and don't offer.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you guys have any sense of size?","Robert A. Hagemann","No, I don't think that we would start to cull out specific opportunities from other competitors.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Bonello of RBC Capital Markets.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So before I have a follow-up question, I want to clarify a number that you said. I thought you said that the SureSwab growth was 50, 5-0 percent in the quarter. Is -- did I get that right?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, you did.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And should I think of that as the rate at which trichomonas volume is growing? Or is that really reflective of a change in the actual collection device, but not the underlying test volume?","Robert A. Hagemann","Bill, you have to understand that SureSwab was introduced just recently last year. So we're operating off a relatively small base. But the point is yes, it's a test that's getting some good traction here.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then on just back on the operating margin question and particularly on the SG&A. So it's helpful to get the 50 basis point adjustment that you talked about with the legal settlement and the asset adjustment. I assume the legal piece was all in SG&A, but was the asset kind of split between cost of services and G&A?","Robert A. Hagemann","The 2 items that we talked about impacted SG&A in cost of sales almost equally, I would say, Bill.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so if even with that stripped out and even with sort of the bad debt, if we back that out, it seems like SG&A expense is still growing faster than revenue growth, which in this time of sort of cost savings initiatives is a little bit curious, and I was just wondering if you can talk a bit about maybe what's driving that growth and at what point we might see the same kind of leverage or more leverage on SG&A like we've been seeing on gross margin?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, well, one of the things you need to consider is the impact of the acquisitions that we did. And I think I was mentioning this several times last year. The Athena and Celera acquisitions had a very positive impact to cost of sales, but increased the SG&A percentage just because of the businesses and the way that they operate. And you're going to see that SG&A impact as well as that cost of sales impact anniversary next quarter. But that was driving changes in both of those metrics.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just on the well, never mind, I was going to ask can you try and take another crack again at pricing, but I think you -- well, let me ask it a different way. You're not going to give a sort of percent increase or project where revenue per requisition is going to go. But I guess I'm having a hard time discerning from your comments whether as we look forward, if we strip out Medicare, because we all know Medicare's a big challenge in 2013. But if we strip that out, whether the pricing environment on the commercial side you're actually expecting to get worse over the next 6 to 18 months? Or are you just commenting on what has sort of what has sort of always been a difficult pricing environment?","Robert A. Hagemann","Bill, as I think about it, it's a very difficult pricing environment today. I don't expect that to abate and in fact, as I've listened to other healthcare providers yes, I'm consistently hearing the same thing, that reimbursement pressure has ratcheted up and most expected to stay something that is under significant pressure as we go forward. Employers are looking for ways to reduce costs, health costs, healthcare costs are a significant piece of that. They're, in turn, putting pressure on their payers who are in turn putting pressure on providers. And we don't see that abating anytime soon.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so I promise this is the last question, but just as part of that, if we go back to the middle of 2010, you actually had a considerable step down in revenue per requisition because of recontracting and whatnot. I mean is there something going on where we need to be worried about that kind of a movement again?","Robert A. Hagemann","Bill, again, I would tell you that yes, we continue to see pressure. We're going to do what we think is appropriate to maintain access here, provide competitive pricing. And I'm not going to get into specifics about what we may or may not do on a particular contract, though.","Kathleen Valentine","And it also points out...","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I asked one in different ways.","Kathleen Valentine","Bill, one other comment is when you look at going back to 2010, if you recall, what also impacted our revenue per rec was the change in business mix, that's when we saw kind of the significant step down in anatomic pathology revenues, which carries a higher revenue per requisition and that decline put pressure on revenue per requisition and we also saw a step-up in drugs of abuse testing. So you had some business mix impacting revenue per rec trends back then.","Operator","Next question is from Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just have a couple of things here. The first, just going to back to the organic growth that's embedded in, I guess, Q2 throughout the remainder of the year. Bob, I think you said 1%. So I just want to clarify, we can do the math, it's implied at around 1%. Are you including S.E.D. in that number? Can you just clarify what you're saying here?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, remember, S.E.D. obviously is included in that number, but it's relatively small. We're talking $20 million to $25 million in revenue for S.E.D. So when I talk about organic revenue growth, with or without S.E.D., it's still about 1%.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. I just wanted to make double sure what you're saying there. All right, and then the next question, I guess, is just a couple of strategic ones for you. The first is I want to just get a quick update on how you're thinking about the market relative to patient service center, access points versus embedded client phlebotomists in the office. And just if there's any notable change relative to what you need to be doing in certain markets relative to the latter, which I'm assuming is, can be a little bit more costly for you to get that kind of access.","Robert A. Hagemann","Darren, I would tell you that there's no specific trend or development that we're seeing there. In each case, we evaluate what's required market-by-market and respond to that accordingly.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then the other question I have is just relative to your hospital strategy. We obviously saw you enter somewhat of a new market with S.E.D. and that seemed to be a logical way by buying a good hospital lab network. How is your hospital strategy evolving? Should we be expecting more joint venturing? Is there anything that you can say just updating us on the developments there, certainly against the trend that we're all seeing of physician employment?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well certainly, as we think about hospitals, they're going to continue to be important customers for us. And hospitals are going through some significant changes themselves. In many cases, they're evaluating whether or not they want to continue to be in the lab business and as we saw with S.E.D., they concluded that, that was something that was not strategic to them and that it's better left to someone that's got more experience in that area, particularly given the fact that as a hospital, I think they saw the reimbursement pressure coming, knowing that some of the pricing differentials that exist today may not exist in the future. And as such, it will be very difficult for them to maintain their margins given that their cost structure was higher than ours. I'm hopeful that we'll see more of that as we go forward. There are cases, as you know, where we do have joint ventures in certain markets. I would tell you that joint ventures are not necessarily a strategy. Again, it's something that's driven by the circumstances in that marketplace, the partner that you're talking to. But I do think that there are opportunities for us to work more closely with hospitals, whether it be lab management agreements, acquiring their outreach business, potentially joint venturing with them. But each market is a little different, each hospital thinks about the way they're going to execute their strategy a little differently. And I think we need to be flexible in each of those cases and will be. But rest assured that the hospital market is important to us, and we expect to continue growing there. A lot of our growth actually on the esoteric testing business is coming from sales to hospitals.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, and then just to clarify what you've said, Bob, is it safe to say that your development pipeline, your acquisition pipeline does now include more hospital outreach lab deals?","Robert A. Hagemann","It always has, yes, whether or not includes -- it's tough to say whether or not it includes more. It's a pretty dynamic pipeline all the time. But yes, I'm hopeful that we'll see more of those opportunities. As you know, they're -- I think of them as fold-ins, we get to take a book of business, fold it into our existing infrastructure; we can do that very well. You tend to get good incremental margins on those types of things and effectively further strengthen the distribution network that you've got. So certainly to the degree that they're available, we will look at them. At this point though, I wouldn't tell you that there's a lot of them in the pipeline or any more than we would typically have. But hopefully, we'll see more as we go forward.","Operator","Next question is from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Surya, best wishes and I can't believe it's been 10 years.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Thank you, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It did go by quickly. I have a couple of follow-up questions at this point. First of all on the pricing environment, just to get a better understanding of how commercial plans think about pricing, when we think about Medicare that's going to be down next year, does that automatically impact commercial rates, i.e., what percent of your commercial book prices off the Medicare benchmark?","Robert A. Hagemann","Ricky, very little of our business automatically adjusts with, very little of our commercial business automatically adjusts with changes in the Medicare fee schedule. As you know, though, it's used as a reference point in negotiating contracts. So that doesn't necessarily help us when we see Medicare reimbursement reduced, but it doesn't necessarily automatically trigger a lot of changes in our commercial contracts.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so just to clarify, it's not as if it's priced off Medicare plus or Medicare minus?","Robert A. Hagemann","Not as a floating amount, no.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then secondly, on the cost cutting initiative. I know that you've provided us a lot of detail. But just so to help us in how we think about modeling going forward, what percent should we allocate to cost of goods versus SG&A this year?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, and Ricky, look, we've never gotten into the business of giving guidance for cost of sales and SG&A. We operate the business, then manage the operating margin. And in some cases, we spend in one area to further reduce costs in another area. But what you should expect is that both the cost of sales line and the SG&A line over time will be favorably impacted they what we're doing here.","Operator","The next question is Amanda Murphy of William Blair.","Sylvia Chao","It's actually Sylvia here for Amanda today. Just have a couple of quick follow-ups. So just wonder, is it a possibility or is it a part of your consideration that you would kind of do an early renewal with the larger national contract and take the heat this year?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, I think we have to be responsive to what our customers are looking for, and we're always having dialogues with them and I wouldn't rule anything out in that regard. But I'm not going to specifically comment on it.","Sylvia Chao","Great, okay. So if there is any impact, it's not baked in yet the 2012 guidance?","Robert A. Hagemann","Anything that we are aware of or that we're contemplating is built into our guidance this year.","Sylvia Chao","Okay, got you. And just as a follow-up on the acquisitions. So it looks like it was becoming stronger than expected. What drove the outperformance on that segment specifically?","Robert A. Hagemann","When you say it performed better than expected...","Sylvia Chao","Just on the revenue per rec on its volume side?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well again, we tried to break out a lot of this in the prepared remarks. The acquisitions now include the benefit of S.E.D., which we did not have in previous quarters. And as you saw, both Celera and Athena were contributing in excess of 2% previously. So that's really the difference now is that we have S.E.D. in the results. And then the other thing that we pointed out was the benefit of weather in the year-over-year comparisons.","Sylvia Chao","Okay, and could you remind us if those newer acquisitions had been consolidated into Quest in our contracts?","Robert A. Hagemann","I'm sorry, can you repeat that?","Sylvia Chao","I'm sorry, if -- could you remind us if those acquisitions such as S.E.D. in our contract, have they been consolidated into Quest?","Robert A. Hagemann","S.E.D. certainly will be, yes.","Operator","All right. The next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Unknown Analyst","It's actually Justin for Isaac. First on the CapEx guidance. You guys lowered it slowly. Could you maybe talk to what was pushed out or pulled out of that at all?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, nothing specific. We looked at the level of spending in the first quarter and revisited the plans that we have for the remainder of the year. And all of the programs that we planned we're continuing to move forward with. It looks like some of them, though, will just get started a little later. But it will have no impact on what we expect in terms of the cost-reduction program.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then looking at the cost-reduction program, you guys said about 20% of it this year. Have you talked about the pacing at all, how you expect that to come through the back half of this year?","Robert A. Hagemann","We have not, and that 20% is really a run rate as we exit the year, that's how we've talked about the $500 million that -- it'll be a run rate as we exit 2014. So as you'd expect, it ramps up this year. And it ramps up more slowly than it will in '13 and '14, and '13 and '14 is really where we start to see the more significant benefits from that.","Unknown Analyst","And then lastly, looking at volumes, assuming they stay at the rough organic level that they're at now, I mean how do you guys look at the ability to extend operating margins in the out years, combining that with the $500 million reduction program?","Robert A. Hagemann","As we've indicated earlier, generally we think about needing 2% organic revenue growth for us to be able to hold margins and offset the inflationary cost that we have in our cost structure. Half of that being salaries, wages and benefits which generally going up around 3% a year. And the expansion that we're expecting now is really coming from the cost-reduction and hopefully as we get into the out years and we start to see some pickup in the market, we can see further expansion and the acceleration at that point. But the cost-reduction program will allow us to expand margins in this sort of tough market that we're in right now. And that's essentially what you see in the guidance that we put out there for 2012.","Operator","All right. Our next question is from Gary Taylor of Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple, and both have been touched on. So just on the CapEx, Bob, you've described as a relatively small change, I guess it's almost a 10% reduction but your comment is basically that's entirely related to just timing of spend?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on the G&A, I guess I've been trying to follow, I'm maybe a little confused about maybe some references to first quarter of '11, when you were explaining some of the spend. So maybe the way I'd like to ask the G&A, how should we be thinking about G&A on a dollar sequential basis into the 2Q?","Robert A. Hagemann","Gary, I -- we don't give that kind of guidance at this point. And yes, as I told you, we don't give it in terms of dollars or percentages for cost of sales or SG&A. And yes, I'd encourage you to think about it more as margins. As I said earlier, often some levers that we're pulling impact cost of sales or SG&A, but we see benefits show up in the other line.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So just to clarify then, I kind of got lost. There was a comment where you mentioned a legal and an asset impact on the G&A line. Is there something in the 1Q G&A line that you're calling out as nonrecurring that...","Robert A. Hagemann","There's probably about $5 million in each the cost of sales line and the SG&A line this quarter that are somewhat unusual, but not big enough for us to include in the adjusted results.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then just quickly, I just want to point out maybe for Kathleen. When I click on the PowerPoint presentation, it's only coming out as a one-pager instead of a typical 12 or 13 and a couple of other people have mentioned that to me. So...","Kathleen Valentine","Okay, thank you, I'll look at that. Yes --","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good thing to look at.","Kathleen Valentine","It is more than 1 page. Although maybe not 12, but --","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm sure, okay.","Robert A. Hagemann","It shows what, the disclaimer?","Kathleen Valentine","It probably is. I'll take that. Thanks, Gary, for pointing that out.","Operator","All right, next question is from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I think you might have said it, but can you just remind me to what was the growth in drugs of abuse testing in the quarter?","Robert A. Hagemann","About 5%, consistent with what we saw in previous quarters.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, is it possible for you to give us any kind of update about the progress that the existing Quest sales force has made, specifically with regards to the sales of the Athena product line?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, you know, Gary, first of all, as we said that we don't -- Athena and Celera, the special sales force, and there is no chain there. But the important thing is that we take some products, like SMA, and it is sold through our physician sales channel and hospital sales channels so that we are seeing more traction in SMA. And also, it's now almost 12 to 18 months since we started investing and training our salespeople in physician sales and it's difficult in the beginning, but I'm very pleased to say that we really have a stable sales force and they're trained and they are very focused on some areas like Women's Health, prescription drug monitoring, and we are seeing results.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Is there any way to parse out how much of the growth in the, in volumes from Athena and Celera came from the Quest sales force versus the preexisting sales force?","Surya N. Mohapatra","We really don't break it down that way. And also, it's going to be very difficult because we integrate some of this business. So the way to look at it going forward, we have these 4 pillars, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurology, they will have their special sales force, but we also have 2 channels, actually 3: Physicians, hospitals and international. And we want to maximize our distribution channel depending on where the products are coming from, but it's going to be difficult for us to really exactly break down how much is coming from physicians and how much is coming directly Athena.","Operator","All right, our last question is from Robert Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erin Wilson","This is Erin Wilson in for Bob today. Just one quick one. Are you anticipating any other management changes now that you have a CEO in place?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, I am not expecting any, but I think you have to ask Steve.","Robert A. Hagemann","I think we need to give him a chance to get here.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, you know in closing, I want to say again that it has been an honor and a privilege to serve as President, CEO and Chairman of Quest Diagnostics. This is truly a great company with dedicated people who always put patients first, a strong management team and a very bright future. I look forward to following its progress in the years to come.

I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures.

Rusckowski","Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates to our 2017 guidance.","We turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Here are some highlights. Revenues grew approximately 2% on a reported basis and 2.3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS of $1.37 was flat from 2016, and adjusted EPS grew approximately 16% to $1.55, which includes an increase of $0.08 over the prior year of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Based upon our progress in the first half, we have raised our outlook for revenues, EPS, and cash from operations for the full year 2017.","Before I describe the progress we've made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, what I'd like to do is briefly discuss PAMA. This month, a number of ACLA Board members met with the executive branch as well as key members of the Senate Finance Committee, that means energy and commerce held subcommittees, reiterating our belief that the current regulation effectively excludes hospital outreach labs, which are a significant segment of the laboratory marketplace.","Last month our trade associations sent a letter to CMS recommending postponing the calculation of publication of the new clinical and fee schedule redefining the definition of then applicable laboratory to ensure in a good hospital outreach laboratories and upon gathering data from hospital outreach laboratories publishing new clinical and fee schedule rates effective not earlier than July 1, 2018. While we support reform of the Medicare payment system, we believe any modification should be market based and appropriately include all applicable independent and hospital outreach laboratories.","At this point, we have made a strong case to CMS and Congress. While we continue to believe that CMS has not carried out the congressional intent of PAMA, we recognize that a new clinical and fee schedule could be in place by January of 2018 and we will be prepared.","Now let's review progress we've made executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. In the second quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions, which we expect to achieve for the fifth consecutive year. We built out our leadership position in advanced diagnostics with our recently completed acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point.","Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospital health systems. On May 1, we completed our acquisition of the outreach operations at PeaceHealth Laboratories and began managing 11 PeaceHealth Laboratories serving medical centers in three states in the Pacific Northwest. We began to recognize revenues from this acquisition in the POS agreement in the second quarter. Our existing professional lab services relationships with hospital systems such as RWJBarnabas, HCA, Montefiore, also continue to perform well and drive revenue growth.","The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Our acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point will not only accelerate Quest growth in U.S. oncology diagnostics but also host the promise of improving cancer care. Quest will become the preferred provider of the U.S. oncology diagnostics for the U.S. oncology network consisting of more than 1,400 independent community-based physicians. In addition, Quest will be a preferred provider of a full range of in-patient and out-patient diagnostic services for 12 hospitals of Baylor Scott & White Health in North Texas.","Advanced diagnostics, including genetic and molecular-based tests as well as general diagnostics, grew in the quarter. Drivers of advanced diagnostics growth include Q-Natal, which is our offering for non-invasive prenatal screening, core infectious disease testing and Quantiferon TB testing were part of the growth. Within general diagnostics, prescription drug monitoring and Hepatitis C screening continued strong double-digit growth.","We recently expanded our tumor profile offer through IBM Watson Genomics for Quest Diagnostics to include a 50 gene panel. With this enhanced insight, doctors can take more informed actions for treatment and feel more certain about the best path forward. Finally, last week we launched QHerit, a new genetic screening service that provides women and men with insight into genetic risk of passing on heritable disorders on to their offsprings.","We also made significant progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Our relationship with Safeway continues to expand as we are now operating in over 100 stores. We still have clear line of sight to be operating in 200 stores and now expect to reach that number by mid-2018. Patient satisfaction and convenient scores are above 90% for our Safeway locations and feedback from these sites remains overwhelmingly positive.","We can't say it any better than two recent feedbacks we have received from our customers on our Safeway locations. One from a network member from Alexandria, Virginia recently wrote, 'I really like the location of this Quest center at Safeway, it saves me time, grocery shopping, pharmacy, plus blood test, all in the same location.' And my personal favorite is one from Longmont, Colorado where a customer goes on to say, 'the best blood draw I've ever had, you rock.'","Now this is an exciting era of the empowered healthcare consumer. More and more people are taking control of their health and asking to receive their lab results in the palm of their hand. More than 4 million patients are receiving their lab results through our MyQuest mobile application, and we are on track to reach 5 million users by the end of 2017.","And then finally, in late June we announced our collaboration with Walmart to help improve access to care and over time help lower healthcare cost of providing basic health care services. The collaboration will initially launch at approximately 15 Walmart stores in Florida and Texas by the end of 2017. These cobranded sites will initially provide laboratory testing services and over time offers are expected to expand to include other basic healthcare services. In the future, these services will help us deliver on the fifth element of our growth strategy, which is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services.","Turning to the second part of our two-point strategy to drive operational excellence, we remain on track to deliver $1.3 billion in invigorate run-rate savings as we exit 2017. As we indicated at our Investor Day last fall, we also believe we will be able to generate additional savings beyond 2017.","As we drive operational efficiency, we continue to improve the customer experience. We are e-enabling our processes behind the scenes as well as in our patient service centers. More than 600 patient services are now live with e-check-in. We plan to deliver this digital experience to over 1,000 patient service centers by the end of this year. At these locations, patients use a tablet to sign in for their appointment, and are provided with an estimated wait time. They know they are in the system and when they will be seen. So that's good for patients, it's good for us too. On the back end of this system, data provides us real-time insight into patients' flow, enabling us to direct phlebotomists to the locations where they are needed most. Since we introduced this service earlier this year, more than 7 million people have utilized this service to date.","Finally, 2017 is our 50th anniversary of empowering better health with diagnostic insights. We've had numerous events around the Company to mark the occasion, and our employees have enjoyed engaging with former leaders and learning more about our history. We are proud of our 50 year legacy and look forward to promoting a healthy world, building value, and creating an inspiring workplace over the next fifty years.","So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark and he will take us through our financial performance in more detail. Mark?","Mark J. Guinan","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.94 billion were up 1.9% versus the prior year on a reported basis, while equivalent revenues grew 2.3%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew by 2.5% compared to the prior year, with approximately 40 basis points attributed to the PeaceHealth outreach acquisition which was completed in May.","Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.8% versus the prior year, of which 1.4% was organic. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter grew by 70 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue-per-req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, test mix and test per req.","Unit price headwinds in the second quarter were less than 100 basis points. While price fluctuations can vary from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain moderate in 2017 and consistent with the last few years. Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our POS partnerships, other mix elements including test mix contributed between 100 to 200 basis points, which is consistent with the trends we've observed for several quarters.","Reported operating income for the quarter was $319 million or 16.4% of revenues, compared to $422 million or 22.1% of revenues a year ago. Keep in mind, our reported operating income in 2016 included a one-time gain related to the divestiture of our Focus Products business. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $343 million or 17.6% of revenues, compared to $324 million or 17% of revenues last year. Our Focus Diagnostics Products business contributed approximately $4 million of adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2016, which adversely impacted the growth in our operating income year-over-year by approximately 1% point. Excluding the impact to Focus Diagnostics, operating income grew approximately 7%.","Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter, flat with the prior year period. As noted previously, our second quarter 2016 results included a large one-time gain associated with the Focus divestiture. Adjusted EPS was $1.55, up 16% from $1.34 last year. The Company recorded after tax net charges totaling $11 million in the second quarter or $0.08 per diluted share, representing restructuring, integration and other one-time costs, partially offset by gain on the sale of an equity interest.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 32%, compared to approximately 48% in the prior year. The prior year tax rate was unusually high as a result of the Focus divestiture. The decrease in the effective tax rate was also driven by $13 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the quarter of excess tax benefit associated with the stock-based compensation, compared to a $2 million or $0.02 per share benefit last year. The benefit was almost entirely related to the exercise of stocks options which is impossible to forecast.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, flat year-over-year and 20 basis points lower versus the prior quarter. For the first half of 2017, cash provided by operations was $490 million versus $464 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $107 million, compared to $104 million a year ago.","Before turning to guidance, I'd like to remind you that we now have annualized all of our portfolio changes as part of our efforts to refocus the business on Diagnostic Information Services. Therefore, the quarterly year-over-year comparison will no longer refer to equivalent growth, but the year-to-date comparisons will refer to equivalent growth for the remainder of 2017.","With that said, we are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenue is now expected to be between $7.69 billion and $7.74 billion, an increase of 2.3% to 3.1% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 2.6% to 3.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.90 and $5 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.62 and $5.72. Cash provided by operations is now expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. And finally, capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million.","Our increased revenue, EPS, and cash from operations outlook is based on first half performance and reflects the completion of two previously announced acquisitions, including the PeaceHealth outreach deal in May as well as the Med Fusion and Clear Point labs which closed last week. In addition to our first half performance, our raised EPS outlook reflects the higher than expected level of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation.","Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks Mark. We turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Based on our progress in the first half, we have raised our outlook and are well positioned to meet our expectations. So with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Amanda Murphy","I had few questions on the volume side if I may, so I know that you have said in the past in terms of organic volume growth that you're not going to kind of parse out the specific drivers, but I was just curious as we've seen some weakness in pharma scripts and whatnot, so what are you guys seeing just in terms of basic utilization patterns at this point if you think about per capita usage if you will at this point?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","First of all, as we said in the past, we look at a lot of different external measures. Then we do an internal measure where we look at our same account measurement where we do a measurement where we know we have a good account and we look at year-on-year comparison of volumes. And what we've said in the past remains this quarter, we think the underlying volume in the market is stable, is the best way to summarize it.","And then to your second point about volume in the quarter, as you know we don't guide on volumes, we do guide on revenues and it's important that we continue to drive revenue growth, it's what we are entirely focused on. So I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little bit of color around what's in the mix. Mark?","Mark J. Guinan","So Amanda, as Steve said, I think we test in our imperfect fashion through the tools we have but the market is pretty stable. We haven't seen significant utilization declines and we certainly have not seem anything significant in terms of [indiscernible]. So, we are pleased with our volume, our advanced diagnostics, as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. Certainly volumes, and importantly revenues, wer4e up strong, our general diagnostics was solid, and then certainly POS is giving us some lift.","Amanda Murphy","And then I thought I could follow up actually on the POS side, so maybe a bit early to ask this, but you talked about the opportunity potentially to leverage from the POS agreement to sort of expand the relationship beyond that and maybe some reference work and things like that, so wondering if you have any insights there again, recognizing maybe a bit early, but\u2026?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","I appreciate that. As we've talked about and raised the case, when we engage with a healthcare system integrated delivery network, we talk about three things. First of all, what we can do to help them with their in-patient laboratory, and that's what we refer to as professional laboratory services engagement. The second part of this is the inside diagnostics that I referenced, testing, and we believe we could be very effective provider of more and also help them with what they do, so a significant part of the discussion. And then the third case is that we are in that discussion to decide what their strategy is from hospital outreach, and [indiscernible] is a good example of that where we bought their operating [indiscernible], we're helping them with 11 of their hospital in-patient laboratories. And to your specific question, in that relationship we are also helping them with the reference work as well. So, in all these engagements, we typically become a stronger presence in that account for reference work.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Kevin Ellich","Just wanted to kind of follow up on the hospital outreach comments, you guys announced a number of good deals. The one that is more interesting to me is the [indiscernible] has gotten wide. I think you are in 12 hospitals now with kind of partially due to the U.S. [Oncology's] announcements. What potential to expand that since they are still big down in Texas and do you see additional sales in any of those markets?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks for asking. We are quite excited about it as well. There are a lot of different reasons. That goes down there last week, we had our date one [indiscernible] with a town hall meeting and spent some time with the management team. So this acquisition actually kicks four elements of our accelerated growth strategy. First of all, obviously it's part of our growth through acquisition, so that's good news. Second is in terms of innovation, it brings to us a nice [indiscernible] up our portfolio around what we could do around oncology and precision medicine, so we are encouraged about that. Third is to your point, it brought it to present in the second largest state in the country, Texas, where we already have a strong presence. And then with this, it's all about providing better health care at better cost levels, and we think with some of the work they've done in the engagement for instance with U.S. Oncology, we can help with the data and understanding what we would do to form better cancer care, so four elements of our strategy. So we are encouraged by that.","And the relationship in Texas is strong, and so we are deeply engaged how we continue on what they built with that engagement and continue to grow from that given our broader presence now with us at Quest Diagnostics. So we're excited about it and we think it's a great acquisition as well. So thanks for the question.","Kevin Ellich","Great. And then just a follow-up on Walmart, I might have missed some of the commentary, Steve, but what measures or metrics will you be looking at to [indiscernible] how quickly you want to expand and what other [indiscernible] clients do you guys plan to add as I think it's going to be more toward the more [indiscernible] patient service centers [indiscernible] in the Walmart stores?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Absolutely. So first of all , we study with two of the largest states, Texas and Florida. We also have a strong presence in Florida, so two nice states, second and third largest state now in the country for us to make progress in the large states. Yes, we will look at some of their sectors for our patient service centers, but as importantly, what I said in my introductory remarks is, we are actually going to use this strong metric to provide some of the basic healthcare services that help with what we could do with population [indiscernible] to cost curve. So what are some of those things?","Now can we help with people dealing with hypertension and do blood pressure checks, can we make sure that people are staying out their [indiscernible] beyond a diuretic suffering, congested heart failure, that we help you with that by periodically taking your weight, making sure you stay in your diuretic staying range.","We can also help with diabetes management. We're also working with some of the healthcare insurance companies where we could close gaps in care to help them with their quality scores so they get reimbursed by the healthcare that we all know is the best healthcare.","So those are the basic healthcare services, and fortunately at Quest, we have the world's largest laboratory, so we'll be, absent for the last five years, we are in the field of diagnostic information services. We have over 20,000 health care workers, 10,000 [indiscernible] with 10,000 other health care workers that provide services already for wellness services from Florida that help insurance companies. We are also providing health checks for life insurance pre-qualification physicals and checks. So, we are leveraging those resources and its relationship as well. So, we are excited about it. We think it's a great opportunity for us to just expand our already unsurpassed access to the marketplace, but also engage with the ecosystem healthcare with some of these basic customer services that can in our mind really help them to cost curve for healthcare in populations that are difficult to get access to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMC. Your line is now open.","Lisa Gill","I just had a follow-up question on your comments on PAMA. As far as timing goes, when would we learn that they have decided to postpone this as an incremental data on the hospital outreach?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","So the current schedule as you know, we submitted the data already. That was delayed by two months because their portal was not available and so we recognized they'd listen to us and postpone it. We have put it in our data. Those people that are submitting the data have done that by the end of May. The current schedule thereon is to publish tentative rates in September, so the schedule that they currently have published.","However, we have shared with them that we believe that several things are going on with the data they had collected. One is they haven't included all the data from those laboratories that they are buying from, typically hospital outreach. We believe their approach still limits the size of the sample, and we shared that. And also this has been reinforced by the officer and Inspector General that [indiscernible] that only 5% of the laboratories are being asked to submit data will submit data, which is about 69% of what they actually buy from.","The second is what we have heard from some of the smaller laboratory association that affect some of the data input. So we have shared this with them because some of the smaller laboratories did not have good access to retrospective data. And while our concern is that they use that data for the basis of publishing at tentative [indiscernible] fee schedule in the fall, it won't be right. So our strong recommendation to them, and we have got word from Congress broadly, many different leaders of Congress as well as the center [indiscernible], we believe the best thing for us all is to take some time to get it right. So our recommendation is to postpone it.","We have made a recommendation of how we believe they could collect the data. That will take some time. We think if they work in that aggressively, they possibly could publish the due clinical and fee schedule no earlier than July of 2018. So that's the path we are on, but the current schedule we have is that they are going to extend the schedule to get out some rates in the fall with the refresh clinical and fee schedule in the first of next year, and as we said in our introductory remarks, we are prepared for that but working hard because we believe it does not reflect the impression or intent to get a full sampling of the marketplace and get that data in a good form and get good quality data to establish a rate for itself. So we are pushing that in a big way across the trade association.","Mark J. Guinan","I think the key is there still remains a lot of uncertainty around PAMA. I'm sure you drew that from Steve's comments. And fortunately, we don't have the data to determine what the projected outcome will be, whether it's the timing or the impact. I do think it's good to go back to the final rule periodically and just remind everybody that the methodology is that CPT code by CPT code calculation, and so weighted median based on the data that they have collected compared to the rates that they are currently paying, and that any CPT code can be cut as much as 10% per year for the first three years and then beyond that for 2021 to 2023 the final rule dictates that any CPT code could be changed by as much as 15%. So that is the final rule in terms of the application of the rule and the outcome. I'm sure as you drew, there's still a lot to be answered.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker from Keybanc. Your line is now open.","Donald Hooker","Just kind of a broader question on the POS deals, which seemed to have great momentum over the past year or so, I understand they are all structured differently. I guess on the one hand you have the full service outsourcing where you takeover all the employees and supervisors, and then on the other hand I guess it's just maybe one or two people one side and they are buying off your contracts. How do the deals break across that continuum and maybe can you talk about the different revenue that generates across that continuum for these deals and is there evidence that maybe over time as you add more and more of these that people start on the low end and kind of move up towards the higher end, if you will?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","We continue to be excited about the prospect here. And again, to start at the highest level of possible systems, and I have shared in the past their lab strategies are on the shortlist of strategic things they are talking about. And so they welcome meetings with us to help them think through this. And in that context, a big part of this is how we can help them become more efficient with their hospital in-patient laboratory, and it is that spectrum. The broadest capability is we help them manage it, the leverage of our procurement. They also learn from our best practices of running the world's largest laboratory.","And to answer your question about across that spectrum, where is that set, I would say it's equally distributed across the lowest level of involvement, the most no predominant necessarily of one end of that spectrum. But to your last question, once we get in the account and we begin to develop the relationship, we do see increased levels of engagement by the customer with us and we do broaden our services broadly and we do spend more time on what we'd do to help with them their reference work, and then also in that context, we do continue the conversation about their outreach strategy if they are in the outreach business.","So, the way we see it is we start with an engagement but that's just the beginning of engagement. And then we also use this as a discussion broadly of what we could do for them in terms of what their mission is and their strategy, which gets us into discussion about population health and what we could do in data analytics. We've got a lot of capabilities there, we have talked about that in the past, we've seen a nice value-added. These new extended care services are of great interest, particularly those integrated delivery system, that are taking on risk [indiscernible] they are quite interested and probably can leverage these access points for putting in place with our two [indiscernible] with Walmart is one example.","So, this strategy is really a strategy of how we serve possible systems in a bigger way, and one aspect of what we could do with them is around their professional answers is engagement in their in-patient laboratory, but it's much broader than that.","Mark J. Guinan","And I would just add, Don, you asked about the revenues and as you implied, directionally, the deeper the relationship, the higher the revenues before actually on-site running their in-hospital laboratory and having those employees work less than we have to build that out for them. So that would be a higher revenue type arrangement. But I'm sure as you can imagine, there's not a lot of margin in that stop. So a greater part of the margin is really driven around rationalized and test menu, moving a subset of that off-site where we can drive not only better costs but shorter cycle time because we are running those tests every day. That's one of the [indiscernible] when we have a POS type arrangement, it's not just about cost, and that's where preponderance of the revenue and the margin comes. It's really just driven by I'd say hospital preference. As you have heard Steve say in the past, we have seen one hospital, lab strategy we have seen one. It's really nothing endemic to the particular hospital structure that dictates the POS arrangements. It's really just our comfort level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Tanquilut","Congratulations. Steve, when you first came on board, you guys first started the hospital strategy and that was sort of new for the industry and now you're doing the retail strategy with Safeway and Walmart. So, do you think this is the wave of the future in terms of where the lab will be and what do you think, as you look down your pipeline in terms of other retailers or other opportunities to get closer to the end user or the consumer, I mean how should we be thinking about the future strategy as you pull from your traditional [indiscernible] into more retailer or consumer-oriented settings?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Now what we talked about five years ago just for the world's largest laboratory, but the business that we want to focus on is Diagnostic Information Services. And so, the information and the services portion of our portfolio is the big portion of what we've really put our shoulder into over the last several years, and you are seeing some of the contributions in the way of business in the last few years. So let me just walk through what that means and where do we see this going.","So in that strategy, we believe that hospital systems were becoming stronger. We knew that hospitals were acquiring physician practices. And therefore it was quite important for us rather than thinking about the hospitals as primarily a competitor, we thought [indiscernible] partner with them with their lab strategy, and that has worked well. They are all over trying to become more efficient. They are trying to understand how they can provide better patient care. And then finally, they are realizing that being in the outreach business is not necessarily something that they all want to focus on and therefore they can team up with us and we're a good provider of that. So it's a nice service [indiscernible].","And then as we get in, similar to what I said to Donald in the last question, it's all about their strategy and their strategy is to be a broader provider of integrated health services within a geography, and we could help them with that. So we have brought out a broad line of information products. We launched this a couple of years ago with the [indiscernible], we call it Quanum. And in that portfolio of products, we offer capabilities to take a look at your utilization for diagnostics, allows the data to be put on the table to ask questions about are we doing a proper work-up to make sure we have an informed decision that happens, that [indiscernible] what happens next in healthcare, which is an important part of delivering good health care at lower cost.","Second is we also served up with a nice access to the workflow within the physicians workflow, the ability to look at all past data from our relationship with [indiscernible], and that data we think is valuable to get a full view of what happens to that patient. So those data analytic services I think are helpful. So that's the conversation we also get into.","And as we work on this discussion, they are all interested in how they retain their current patients and grow the patient population as well as their membership, and we all see that there is a sea change happening where the consumer is much more engaged and that's why we think it's very important for us and we put a lot of energy on broadening and expanding our brand and what we believe our brand stands for. As a matter of fact, we have talked about our brand and our tagline being action from inside. Our vision is to have better health with diagnostic insight, not just [indiscernible].","So in that consumer strategy, which is part of our growth strategy, there's multiple aspects to that. One is the migrating access. So we believe our retail strategy helps us with that. We started with Safeway, we said we're going to do more, we recently announced our relationship with Walmart. So we think that's expanding our access.","Second is to provide products that are consumer-oriented. We have talked in the past earnings call about what we're doing to be a provider of testing directly to consumers. We have launched a pilot, we're doing some of that in Arizona. We are now expanding that pilot of selling testing where states allow it to be done, to Missouri, to Colorado. We have a great business that's growing around wellness. We have a product coupled for wellness. We have expanded that to the field of sports where we have the sport diagnostic product. We have done the work with [indiscernible]. So there's a whole portfolio of more consumer-oriented products that we've rolled out as well.","And then we have also improved on the access and consumers remarkably want to have all their health information, and frankly we're quite surprised by the pickup of our MyQuest application, I mentioned in my introductory remarks over 4 million of people have registered with us. We believe we are tracking to be on track to get above 5 million users.","So, if you look at all those elements, we believe that this positions us nicely as that diagnostic information services company that's thought of when the consumer will have [indiscernible] the diagnostic testing, and over time we believe with better transparency, because we do offer we believe one of the strongest [indiscernible] proposition in the marketplace, the physician will ask the consumer which laboratory do you want to test and to go to and they will remember this great experience that they had at Quest Diagnostics. They will have information that's provided to them. They will have access to products and they will be able to easily access our capabilities, and so the choice will be given to us, and that's our strategy. We picked up the powerful element of our strategy and it's where healthcare is headed. Consumers will have more choice and consumers will direct more at healthcare.","So we are making a lot of progress, we're excited about it and we think that's going to help us with our core business today but over time it will become a larger piece of our portfolio over time that we really do direct healthcare in a better way where it is needed, which is not necessarily only in hospitals but throughout the health care system and communities that are touched not by traditional healthcare but other places like our retail strategy. So that's where we are going with it.","Brian Tanquilut","I really appreciate that. Mark, just a quick follow-up, what are your assumptions and guidance for the back half in terms of tax rate and buybacks or capital deployment?","Mark J. Guinan","So in terms of capital deployment, it's really dependent on whether we have strategically appropriate deals that create value for our shareholders. So really that will depend on our deal pipeline and what might come to closure. In terms of your expectations for share buybacks, we talked about keeping our way, so pretty flat to the extent that we wouldn't execute more M&A. You've seen more share buybacks but I think you shouldn't consider pretty much flat share count.","And certainly from a tax rate, as we mentioned it's impossible for me to predict option exercises. So outside of the stock base comp piece, you should expect the effective tax rate that's pretty much on the historical level that we've seen in the upper 30s as opposed to the rate we saw this quarter in the low 30s, really driven by the stock based comp.","Now if we were to have significant exercises in the quarter, that obviously could depress it, but that's why we've been very intentional in calling out what that impact is year-over-year so that you can understand that it's really not operational.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro","Wanted to come back to PAMA for a minute, I appreciate your comments around the idea to caution process. I'm interested in the commercial side of it, in particular how you think the competitive landscape is going to evolve as we approach implementation, whether it's delayed or not? And specifically about sort of overall battle between the in-source labs within hospitals and sort of the commercial labs, is there a material tug of war starting to brew here between where a lot of that volume gets done, I'm interested in what's happening out there in the commercial and [indiscernible]?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Part of our discussion with these hospital systems were on their lab strategy, they see pressure on rates broadly. They are feeling pressure from their commercial insurance relationships, but they also are looking forward and realizing that the clinical and fee schedule will be refreshed. And as we talked about in the past, they have more exposure than we do to that. Roughly 12% of our revenues is a much more meaningful percentage of their laboratory revenues. So, when we engage in these conversations, one aspect of their consideration of what they are going to run [indiscernible] is they are going to be under pressure both on the commercial side as well as on Medicare.","But the other aspect as you know is related to what their strategy is, do we want to put more capital and increasing more complicated area, and in some cases they decide not to. Second is they realize that our scale is significant and as we move away from a fee-for-service model to a much more value based reimbursement model, it's still longer to be in activity, it's going to be making sure we have the best cost per service unit and our cost structure is far superior than any other cost structure.","So, in many of the cases we are engaged around this and in some cases where we have bought their [indiscernible] business, it's because they see reimbursement changing and they believe that they have to move to team up with someone like Quest that has a very efficient model delivering the necessary diagnostic services, so as part of that overall strategy for the integrated delivery system, a part of this is looking at pressure and range, but it's more comprehensive than that as well, Issac.","Isaac Ro","That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, if we look at sort of the rest of the commercial market, clearly the majority of your competitors are very, very small. How do you think they are going to react to PAMA over the next say 12 months, is there a meaningful opportunity there to consolidate more share from commercial labs?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so we shared this at our Investor Day. Look at the market we compete in, ourselves and the nearest competitor, less than 25% share. We have a very compelling value proposition where we offer some of the best pricing and we believe best service and quality on the planet, and we believe we should have more share. We're working hard at gaining that organically but we are also believing that we can consolidate more of this marketplace and that's why we have the strategy of 1% to 2% growth through those strategic [indiscernible] acquisitions. We have announced a number this year with [indiscernible], we're moving forward down with Med Fusion and also we also announced recently [indiscernible] in Massachusetts. So our march continues to drive that strategy. So we think the commercial rate pressure on the rest of the marketplace will help accelerate the strategy we are on and we should over time take up more share both organically and through acquisitions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William Quirk","So I hate to keep coming back to PAMA but obviously it remains a pretty hot topic. I guess, Steve, certainly understand [indiscernible] position here, help us think about as we get closer to the initial implementation date, or the initial preliminary rate date, how do you handicap the likelihood of [indiscernible] at this point given all your conversations with folks up [indiscernible]?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","I can't handicap it, but I will share that we are actively working the communication with CMS, and when I say we, it's the Board of Directors and all members of ACLA are actively talking to our Congress members both on House side as well as the Senate side. We have also met a couple of times with the leadership at CMS. The leadership at CMS understands this well, understands that the current approach has issues associated with it, and our simple messaging on this is take the time to get it right. We continue to support the idea of paying or having CMS pay market-based pricing. To get the right data, take the right approach to bringing on those rates is important for all of us.","And what we remind them of is the reason why we have PAMA is reflective of the work that's to protect access to Medicare Act, and it's important for Congress and it's part of their congressional [intent] [ph] not to just pay at the lowest rates but to make sure that they pay for what they use, and the reason for this is there's many parts of this country that are not served by the large national laboratories. And the concern that they are now aware of is if in fact, if this is not done in the right way, rates could be cut, smaller labs that are very necessary in smaller rural areas, in some segment of the marketplace the majority of what the testing is has provided the Medicare marketplace could be substantially cut, and the example of that is what's happening in nursing homes where a majority of their single testing is basically the most routine tests that are done for many small laboratories all over this country.","So we remind Congress and we remind CMS of where we started and why we believe paying market based price is quite important. So, what I'll share is we think they are very, very responsive to listening to our concerns. We realize there is an element of administration. They realize that what was put in place was put in place over the last couple of years. They realize there is an opportunity to work with us to get it right. So we remain hopeful but I can't handicap it.","William Quirk","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, the pace of deals has increased and obviously you talked quite a bit about that here in the Q&A today. Can you talk to us a little bit about how much capacity both your deal and integration teams have?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","We have been at a point where we don't have the capacity to do deals that make sense and we spend a lot of time looking at deals, we say no to more deals than we say yes to. It's important. We continue to go back to our philosophy on doing acquisitions. They have to be strategically aligned and also we have to make money on those deals. And a key part of making money on those deals is making sure we have the right integration plan. And so, as we integrate this, we have a small structural team that helps us with the integration but also a large part of the integration happens in our regions as well.","And so, if you look at the distribution of some of these deals, they have been distributed throughout the United States. We have done a number up in the north. [Indiscernible] being one example of that, Harvard Health Care being another example, but most recently we are doing this deal out in our western region with PeaceHealth and we are working on that with enough capacity to pull that off. So, our capacity has not been [indiscernible] at all. It's more the [indiscernible] factor to making sure we have deals that we believe are strategically aligned and we could make money on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky Goldwasser","The first one, if you can elaborate a little bit more on your relationship with Walmart, you talked about 50 stores by the end of the year, so how should we think about the revenue contribution and your earnings contribution between volume and price? And then does the relationship with Walmart preclude you from entering additional partnerships with others and do you think that over time will the market split in two verticals, you have the relationship with Safeway and Walmart and potentially others where your competitor has a relationship with Walgreens?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","I appreciate that. First of all, the relationship is getting nowhere near. We said we are going to focus on two largest states, Florida and Texas, and we're going to pick 15 sites that will be our initial pilot sites. And what we'll provide at those sites are some of our patient service center capabilities like we've done with Safeway, but we believe there's more we could do on those sites with basic healthcare services.","And what will specifically get done is really dependent upon where we forge relationships with healthcare insurance companies, their integrated delivery systems for ACOs within those geographies where we think there could be some value of providing with basic healthcare services in those great access points that Walmart has.","This will be a joint venture. We are the majority holder of ownership in that joint venture. We have not provided visibility or guidance of how large this will be, but we are hopeful that this year we'll be off to a good start and we'll share more in due course as we get into it.","The second part of your question, as we said when we announced Safeway, Safeway was an excellent relationship. We are proud of what we have done. We are half way into what fully we can realize, about 100 stores, we've got another 100 to go to get to 200. What we are doing with Walmart we think is complementary and every one of the retail strategies that are \u2013 retail companies that are in our space have a different strategy.","So we continue to enjoy a nice good working relationship with [CBS] [ph] [indiscernible]. We believe Walgreens has a different strategy as well. And what we will do is \u2013 Walmart and what we will do with Safeway, we believe there are other ways we could work with other retailers that could be complementary to what we agree to do with these two that we have announced so far.","Mark J. Guinan","Just to add, Ricky, the impact this year is immaterial. I mean as you can imagine, it's 15 stores where we're really just going to be ramping up over the balance of the year. The value creation is well in front of us and it goes beyond just having a blood draw center. It's really those additional services that Steve talked about. So Walmart certainly has the foot traffic, millions of people every day. We have not only got the ability to do the laboratory testing, but as Steve mentioned earlier, we've got the on-call specialist and actually do a lot of in-home assessments, biometrics and things well beyond laboratory testing that can supplement our ability to provide additional services.","So more to come on Walmart, it's not exclusive. We mentioned that the links with Safeway was not exclusive. There are many, many retail centers available. Even though we have over 2,000 patient service centers, approximately a little over half would kind of be candidates for retail outlook. So it wouldn't be all of our patient service centers, and so if you look at 1,000-plus potential patient service center opportunities, certainly between Safeway and Walmart and potentially somebody else, we are going to barely cover a small portion of their footprint. So this is not looking at blocking up and excluding other people, it's really just partnering and finding a way to get more efficient on our capital deployment and where we will [indiscernible] and other services.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay, thank you. And then one follow up just on your second-half guidance. So when we kind of like look at the contribution from acquisition, is it fair to say that second half acquisition will contribute around 100 basis points, and if so, it seems that you're looking for an acceleration in organic growth rate in the second half of the year, I mean based on our back of the envelope second half is over 3% top line growth, so are we in the ballpark and how do you think about where is the acceleration on the organic side is coming from?","Mark J. Guinan","So yes, Ricky, you are correct, the increase in guidance on the revenue side is almost exclusively from M&A. We're very pleased with our organic revenue performance for the first half. It's certainly not out of our original guidance range. So the increase in revenue guidance is really driven by the deals.","As I mentioned on the earnings side, we actually strongly enough from the first half that there is some organic impetus in the increased guidance, and then the other piece is really around the stock-based comp reducing our effective tax rate in the first half. M&A, our new deals, is not expected to contribute anything meaningful on the EPS side in the back half of the year. So it's really driven by organic health and by this tax benefit.","And then back to the question that was asked earlier about assumptions for the back half, right now that guidance assumes a tax rate that is more in the going-in rate in the high 30s. We shared that there was $0.06 of excess tax benefit last year. That was in our original assumptions and guidance for this year. Obviously we have exceeded that greatly in the first half but I am not counting on any extraordinary excess tax benefit from stock based comp in the back half. So should that happen and it's not really forecast, something we can forecast, then that could lower the tax rate.","Operator","The final question on today's conference comes from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Steven Valiquette","So most of my good questions have been asked already, but just curious on that retail strategy, what is the right number of partners over time just from a retail co-branding perspective and is that critical, is this a situation where you might be comfortable having 5 to 10 retail partners over time or do you want to keep the numbers smaller to maximize the co-branding awareness?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","We are working our way through that. The Safeway relationship is different than what we're going to do at Walmart and we already have working relationships with some other retailers. I mentioned CBS and Walgreens, different strategies, all these have different strategies. And frankly, I think we'd like to have a handful of strong national brands that we work with. We'd like to make some progress with those before we expand too broadly. So we have two now and working relationships with others.","So, we are totally focused on executing against what we've said we would do with Safeway. We feel good about that. We just launched this new relationship with Walmart. We want to make sure we make progress in 2017. And as far as others, in due course we will talk about that as we work with them on their own trend, [indiscernible] how we could be helpful, but a good way of thinking about this, we started with one, we've now moved to two and a handful will be a good number that we could then manage over time to provide what we do and help them with their health strategy.","Steven Valiquette","Were you ever in deep discussions with Walgreens? You just mentioned Walgreens and CBS, but was that one kind of a tossup at the end and who would be the partner or is there still a possibility that you could still also partner with Walgreens in addition to the lab provider based in North Carolina?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","So we are open to working with others. We want to make sure that what we do doesn't in any way contradict what we are doing with some other partners. But as you know, Walgreens continues to broaden their health presence. They have a working relationship as you know with Med Express. Med Express will provide healthcare services and that strategy will change over time. And as you know, most of these retailers work with all different brands, no matter what category and laboratory services are going to be different. So, they are selling all different bands in their stores, so therefore they are open to different brands and we believe that this strategy is good for us to think about how we could team up with different people in the ecosystem in healthcare and every one of these players has different strategy. So, we think there is an opportunity here as well.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Okay, so that concludes our day. We had a strong first half in 2017. We look forward to continue to meet our commitments by executing our two-point strategy, which is to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We appreciate your time on this call and we hope you have a great day. Take care.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.","Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.","Shawn Bevec","Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now here's Steve Rusckowski.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our updated guidance.","During the third quarter, revenues were up on reported basis and grew 2.1% on an equipment basis. Reported EPS decreased 43%, primarily due to the gain from our 2015 contribution to the Q Squared Solutions joint venture.","On an adjusted basis, EPS grew 7%, cash from operations were $301 million up 42%. Now let me discuss highlights of the progress we're making in several areas of five-point strategy, which as you all know is to restore growth, drive operational excellence to simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So let's start with growth..","We continue to make progress with our expanded hospital systems relationships. In professional lab services, HCA began to contribute to growth in the third quarter. As we announced earlier this year, we're managing an inpatient laboratory operation for six Denver area hospitals in HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare. Revenues from this engagement will continue to increase throughout the end of the year.","Our Professional Lab Services agreement where RWJ Barnabas Health in New Jersey and Clinical Laboratory Partners the outreach lab business we acquired from Hartford Healthcare in Connecticut, both contributed to perform well and grew revenue this quarter. Beyond our hospital systems relationships, we also continue to deliver solid growth in prescription drug monitoring in infectious disease testing including Zika.","In prescription drug monitoring we remain and industry leader with strong growth in the quarter. Providers and payers appreciate our unique ability to help manage the epidemic of prescription drug abuse with appropriate test utilization.","In infectious disease, we continue to see solid growth in the fourth generation HIV testing as well as Hepatitis C testing for screening and genotyping to help doctors determine the type, dose or duration of treatment.","Turning to Zika we complemented our proprietary PCR test with a new antibody test license from the Center for Disease Control. Quest Diagnostics is proud to be among a group of select national reference laboratories, selected by the Center for Disease Control to aid the response of the Zika emergency in the United States.","Looking forward we're excited about our new agreement with Ancestry. Quest will become Ancestry's first CLIA approved lab partner to provide DNA testing, enabling Ancestry DNA subscribers to build their family based on the origins.","Over time we intend to support additional opportunities with Ancestry to guide people on building and understanding their family health tree. We're also very excited about the recent launch of the IBM launch of genomics from Quest Diagnostics, a new service that helps advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The service helps oncologists match patients with cancer therapies and clinical trials based on the tumor's unique DNA.","Quest expertise in genomics and cancer as well as our broad market penetration to have the country's physicians and hospitals means Watson power tumor sequencing is accessible for the first time to the community and oncologist to provide 70% of the nation's cancer care. Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Broad institute will contribute their data and research expertise to further augment the offering.","The next element of our strategy I'll highlight is driving operational excellence. Our collaboration with Optum will help us reduce cost and complexity of our billing processes and also increase transparency of healthcare cost for patients, physicians and employers.","Employee engagement in our Optum alliance has been positive and the integration is on track. Quest employees will transition to Optum team in mid-November. We expect to begin realizing savings from this relationship next year.","We view this agreement without Optum as the start of a long-term relationship and it builds on our long-standing relationship with Optum's parent the United Health Group. For decades Quest has served the United Healthcare plan participants to help them take action to improve their health based on insights from diagnostic testing and information services.","Also in the third quarter, we opened 12 patient service centers in five states in Safeway supermarkets. In just the first months patients are finding it easier to access testing in a more convenient location and we've seen volume increases in these retail settings. We remain excited about expanding patient access through retail partnerships.","We continue to execute on our last element of our strategy was to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We completed our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program announced in May, using the proceeds of the sale of Focus Diagnostic business.","Through this ASR we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares, additionally bought back another $50 million of company stock, bringing the total repurchases of 2016 to $440 million through the end of the third quarter. We look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day at the Intercontinental New York Barclay Hotel in Midtown on November 11. Registration information is available on our Investor Relations webpage.","Now Mark will provide an overview on our third quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook, Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 0.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.1% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short, grew by 2.1% compared to the prior year. Of this growth, approximately 1% was organic.","Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 2% versus the prior year. Approximately half came from organic growth including our Professional Lab Services or PLS engagements and the other half from recent acquisitions. Revenue per acquisition in the third quarter was flat versus a year ago. As a reminder revenue per req is not a proxy for price and includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per requisition.","Unit price headwinds moderated in the third quarter, down roughly 50 basis points compared to the 100 basis points headwinds we observed in the first half. Consistent with previous quarters our PLS engagement such as our WJ Barnabas Health and HCA carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing and lower the revenue per req calculation.","In the third quarter, the impact of our PLS engagements was slightly larger than the 120 basis points we highlighted in the second quarter, which is representative of the strong growth we are seeing in this business. With HCA coming online in the third quarter and ramping up through the end of the year, we expect PLS to continue to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business in Q4.","After considering the impacts of unit price and PLS, other mix elements including test and payer mix contributed nearly 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. Reported operating income for the quarter was $322 million or 17.1% of revenues compared to $631 million or 33.6% of revenues a year ago.","Our reported third quarter 2016 results included a $334 million pretax gain on the contribution to Q Squared joint venture with Quintiles. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $320 million or 17% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.3% of revenues last year.","The impact of our former Focus Diagnostics and Celera products businesses in the third quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $16 million or 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have grown by 20 basis points year-over-year.","Reported EPS was a $1.34 in the quarter, compared to $2.35 a year ago. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the net gain on our Q Squared contribution mentioned previously. Adjusted EPS was $1.37 up from $1.28 last year.","The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $10 million in the quarter, representing an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, which was partially offset by restricting and immigration charges. The net impact of these items benefitted our reported EPS by $0.07. ","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, 20 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate.","When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. Quick comment on our new billing relationship with Optum, to reiterate, expense savings from this relationship will not begin until 2017. We expect modest savings on our billing support cost during each year of the 10-year agreement and Optum will work with us to help lower our bad debt rate as well as reduce our denials over time.","Income tax expense in the quarter benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly $0.02 in Q3. The new standard also results in a change in weighted shares outstanding by increasing the effect of dilutive securities which slightly offsets the EPS benefit.","Our DSOs were 46 days, two days higher than last year, but one day better than the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to higher levels of patient responsibility. For the first nine months of 2016, cash provided by operations was $765 million versus $549 million last year. Capital expenditures were $165 million through the third quarter compared to $169 million a year ago.","Before moving to guidance, I'd like to highlight that operations in our Southeast region were impacted by Hurricane Matthew earlier this month. Our updated guidance reflects the impact we currently know. Additionally, I want to provide some color on a few notable items, which will impact our full-year operating cash flows.","The first relates to after-tax charges for the full-year 2016 of $29 million from the retirement of debt. Second, we will incur a full year cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the focus to register that will be recorded in our operating cash flow, while the associated $275 million from the sale is reported in our investing cash flow.","We paid $68 million of this liability in Q3 with the remainder to be paid in the fourth quarter. Third in Q3, we realized $54 million of proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements. In aggregate these three items are adversely impacting our full-year operating cash flow by a net of $66 million.","Now turning to guidance, based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 outlook as follows. Revenues to be approximately $7.51 billion, an increase of about 0.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2.5% on an equivalent basis. This compares to previous revenue guidance of between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion.","Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.47 and $4.52 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.07 and $5.12. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.18 and $4.33 on a reported basis and $5.02 and $5.17 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1 billion, which compares to previous guidance of approximately $880 million.","And finally capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million compared to between $250 million and $300 million previously. Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks Mark. To summarize we continued our success in 2016 with another good performance in the third quarter. We continue to generate strong cash from operations and we remain on track to meet our commitments for the remainder of the year.","With that, we would be happy to take any questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Bill Quirk","Thanks and good morning, everyone. First question is just thinking about the, final clinical lab fee schedule for 2017, I guess we've been thinking or expecting rather that it was likely to be flat when the final adjustment comes out here in about lesser month now, but recent hearing some chatter that we may actually see a small inflation update to that. Any thoughts on that guys? Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes thanks. So as you know we don't really know and last year we had a small adjustment as well to it. So hopefully your view of what you've heard is right, but at this point we have nothing to add to what you're saying.","Bill Quirk","Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up, I guess kind of bigger picture question, help us think a little bit about some of the health exchanges. Obviously there has been some pressure on managed care. We've seen some people pull out of this and so how are you thinking about this over the coming couple of years here, thanks?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah I think we're all trying to understand how those lives will eventually get healthcare insurance. I think state by state will sort its way out. We can't speculate at this time how those lives will be picked up but as you read and you know as well as we do, that the number of the particularly national providers have decided to pull out of the exchanges, but you would -- you have to believe that those lives that might be impacted will be dealt within the appropriate way state-by-state, but it's too early to speculate on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ashley Craig","Hi. Good morning. This is Ashley on for Ricky. I just wanted to -- I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color into some of the partnerships you highlighted in the press release. We noted that PLS agreements are positive to volumes, the headwind to price, the Optum agreement is supposed to help with curving bad debt expense, but could you talk a little bit about Safeway and Ancestry and IBM? Where are we with the impact of those relative to the core business?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah. Thank you very much. Well first of all, we're encouraged with our continued growth that we're seeing in our professional lab services business. We've highlighted two in my opening remarks. One is the relationship with HCA, the second is related to a relationship with Barnabas here in New Jersey.","They're often running -- they contributed to growth in the quarter. We're optimistic about their prospects and also we've a good funnel with us. They made one comment that I would like to react to. We've been very, very careful to make sure that we described how this business affects the calculation of revenue per acquisition and what we've done carefully is to talk about in the script and I am sure Mark will provide some color, is that we actually provided in the script the unit price impact of this quarter to our performance and that is when you freeze all other characteristics of our business what the true pricing impact is on our business, where there is other characteristics of our business like and peer mix that affect the calculation of revenue per req.","So we feel very positive about the growth prospects for professional lab services business. It's a great growth opportunity. It's great return on invested capital. The report is greater for shareholder value creation, but it does affect the calculation because it's at a lower price point. That is not to be confused with price reductions. So I want to make sure that's clear sure and I am sure what I've done here Mark will comment on that as well to make sure it's absolutely clear.","As far as partnerships, we believe that being a company that work with others in healthcare is an important part of what we do. We obviously are demonstrating. We know how to do that. Number of things we talked about already have to do with us former relationships. We talk about professional lab services.","I'll also mention that when we buy outreach businesses like I referred to is the Hartford Hospital outreach business that we bought. We're working on building on that to have a strong relationship. Couple that with what we announced this fall with Optum. Optum will allow us to work with one of the leaders in healthcare analytics, leaders in healthcare services to work on understanding what we can do to improve the billing process and thereby helping us with our bad debt exposure as well as making sure we get paid for a lot of the more sophisticated testing that we do.","We think of them working with us is better than us working independent and that's a good opportunity for our shareholders going forward. So we're optimistic about that opportunity, but also what you also see in my introductory remarks, we believe this continues to build on a strong working relationship we have with the United Health Group and this new working relationship with revenue cycle management will only enhance that relationship.","We actually do the -- we have a strong collaboration to do their wellness work within Optum. We have an existing relationship with some of their physician groups that they're buying in terms of laboratory professional services and then finally as we continue to be a big supplier of laboratory professional services for United Healthcare membership today and we believe that will continue to grow. So we're optimistic about the prospects there.","We also announced recently the relationship with IBM. This builds on our relationship and our product that we introduced a couple years ago with Memorial Sloan Kettering. It's a growing new field to Precision Medicine as you know and we provide in this relationship a product called OncoVantage, which basically provides visibility to oncologists what can be known with 34 actionable jeans.","From that data we'll say what drugs will work and what drugs will now work, but as importantly what clinical trials that could potentially roll their patience in. This work will expand with the relationship with IBM and also Memorial Sloan.","We also mentioned that this is collaborative work once again and the broad Institute is involved as well which we're optimistic about, because as I said at the beginning, healthcare is really a much more collaborative game going forward and quest we're all about working with others when it comes quite clear of the work we've done and is how it's helping our business.","So let me just stop there and let me turn it to Mark to make sure I properly addressed the question about the PLS business and how we think about revenue per requisition as a calculation, Mark.","Mark Guinan","Thanks Steve. I think it's important we clearly have not done enough to get everybody clear on this. When you think about the work we do, we do tests. Now we use requisitions as a surrogate for volume, but in fact we do test. So if a patient comes forward with a single test and would say a standard routine test and another patient comes forward and has two of those, there is going to be a different value to the requisition, but it has nothing to do with price.","So the reason that people have and we have shared requisitions is there is a margin implication to some extent because of the front end and the back end is somewhat of a fixed cost per patient engagement or requisition. So specimen acquisition and billing you say the more testing we can get on our requisition, the more efficient you can be, but again that's on the cost side not the price side.","However with PLS as we've explained, the specimen acquisition is incredibly efficient. We don't do the draws and from a logistics perspective, we're picking up dozens and dozens of tests at a single point in time instead of a handful as we want to at an office position park.","So the logistics is very efficient. We don't incur the draw cost and then the billing is incredibly efficient because there is no third party billing, there is no patient responsibility of the single bill for a large volume to client. So I just want to make sure we continue to do what we need to do that people are clear that the mix calculation is the calculation and it's not price.","We actually call out price very specifically so to understand apples and apples are headwinds and we're actually getting paid less per test.","Ashley Craig","Got it. That makes sense. Thank you for the color.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you..","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citibank. Your line is now open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe","Good morning. So just going back to the PLS, I just hope and I guess on the two fronts, on volume and price, first on the volume side, just hoping whether you could give a little bit of sense of what it may be contributed specifically HealthONE and Barnabas to volume growth this quarter and maybe help us is it in the run rate at this point. Is there some sort of ramp we should consider in the fourth quarter and in 2017 any help there.","And then just on the pricing side as you just explained, I guess I guess what I'm still grappling with is just understanding so on a test by test basis, is the price the same or is it lower in PLS right, because I would think you'd have more tests per acquisition on the hospital test than you would and the normal business.","So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the absolute dollar per test and effects lower because of a willingness to give up on that because of the benefits on the cost side that you explained.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So thanks for the questions. There were a couple there Ralph. Let me try to address them all. First off Barnabas is pretty much largely implemented. We may expand that relationship beyond the current set of hospitals, but at this point the initial phase of Barnabas is in a run rate and BTA is a relationship that we said is ramping up. I mentioned that half of the volume growth in the quarter was attributable to PLS and we don't call out specific relationships. So we're not going to share Barnabas per se or HCA, but we are hearing what PLS is contributing in total.","And then contrary to what you may have thought, the test for req for PLS actually tend to be fewer not greater. When you imagine something ongoing in for their annual physical, which is quite a bit of our volume, obviously some of it is acute conditions that people go into their primary care physician for, but you're doing a battery of tests and your annual physical much more than you might for an acute situation going in as in-patient or an outpatient at a hospital. So there's actually fewer tests.","And then finally on price, it is priced differently because it's not the commercial rates that we have for the core business, it's a negotiated direct rate with the hospital where we price it a way that we can save them money, and we can make a margin ourselves. So, it is different pricing, but not necessarily lower or higher, because we have pricing relationships all over the board for any given tasks depending on the situation.","So it gets a little bit complicated, but in general, fewer tests per req we have definitely future momentum, we expect from our PLS in terms of its volume contribution, definitely from HCA and so you should expect more of our growth coming from PLS certainly in the immediate future.","Shawn Bevec","Ralph, this is Shawn. Just one point of clarification, half of our volume was organic of what some of that was PLS.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Very helpful and then just one more follow-up. I was hoping you can give a little bit more detail on the U&H deal in terms of the economics and potential savings, so there anyway to quantify what billing and collection function cost to you guys to run maybe some percentage of what may be saved and may be help us if there is some level of guarantee on the other side.","So, if bad debt expense for whatever the reason to actually go up as opposed to go down, are there certain protections in that contract that you that you there are guaranteed savings?","And then just any other read through on this relationship and potential for you all to get back in network on the lab side with U&H, have you had any of those discussions at this point. Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks. Let me start and I'll ask Mark to provide little more color on the back end of this. First of all what we've committed is continued march of making their business better and when we see better, we want to improve our quality service and at the same time making it more efficient.","And our goal, as you for that is what we call our Invigorate program, which we have committed to improvement of $1.3 million by the end of 2017 and that's run rate savings if you recall that versus a benchmark of 2011 and as you know we've been on a great march of showing progress on that and what we have shown with this relationship is we're far from done.","We have a lot more opportunities to improve this business and we think this relationship with Optum again underscores our commitment to continue to make bold changes in this business to become better. Okay. And so I keep on saying better because it's both quality and cost.","So this relationship with Optum will allow us a couple things. One is we're going to become more efficient. So how do we become more efficient? One is that by working together with them our building operation, which is part of our expense structure. Our SG&A cost will become more efficient over time and we have, we do have commitments around improving that together going forward.","That is all part of our commitment for to Invigorate. So, it allows us to achieve our goal and also it extends beyond 2017 obviously since this is a 10-year relationship.","Second is as I said in my introductory remarks, part of the opportunities we have, is to provide better transparency to the patients, better transparency to patients as far as what prices are and also what is covered and so they can pay us more often, and more and more quickly and we believe by providing that with the help of Optum will serve both bad debt, our denial rate and just generally our cash flow. So that is part of the relationship as well.","We don't disclose the specifics of the agreement. You wouldn't to expect that we would, but it's part and parcel of what we -- part of what we believe we need to continue to do, continue to drive progress of this business.","The last part of your question is how does this affect our relationship with United Health? What I said when we announced this relationship and I know United Health will say the same, is it can't hurt and again that builds on our existing relationship. We currently do a lot of work for United already. This is substantial piece of building on that. They are very committed to it. It's a big opportunity of us to them in a much broader more significant way that ever.","We're obviously going to use this to build on that relationship with Wellness that I talked about earlier, what we could do around their healthcare businesses that they're building with Optum Care. We believe we could do more than help them with their analytic services.","So there's a lot more that we can do with them and we'll do with them as we go forward because as you know they're a big player at healthcare and we need to work with all the big players at healthcare. So we're encouraged about what we're doing so far. We're off to a good start. As we said, we're going to move the employees over in the November and we'll start to see savings from this next year. So Mark anything you would like to add to that?","Mark Guinan","We have shared that billing is about 5% of our headcount. So it's not an insignificant portion of our cost structure and then just to be clear on the relationship, we're not relinquishing responsibility. So there are a number of initiatives we had already planned to work on but we think are going to improve bad debt and reduce denials. It was part of our Invigorate program in which really generating the incremental value here is that Optum is going to bring incremental or activities and supplement what we're doing to get us to even a better place we could have gotten on our own or certainly faster than we could have gotten on our own.","So it's not as if we're just thrown it over the wall and having Optum pick up what we have been working on and what we had planned to do. We're actually going to continue to do that. A lot of that's involved in our IT organization, our commercial organization etcetera and we're going to partner with Optum to make that even better ","Mark Guinan","Just to round that off once again, if you look at our 2014 debt from our Investor Day, we talked about this as being the opportunities we see. We've been we've been Invigorate and hopefully will review on this one will come to our Investor Day. It's November 11 and we'll provide more color beyond what we've said here about this relationship and how it helps us with our efficiency goal on Invigorate. So next question.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan","Hi guys good morning. Mark wanted to start with the pricing comment that you made, you know the unit price headwinds they moderated 50 Bps in the quarter, were there any notable changes there, just less of a headwind for certain codes.","Mark Guinan","Yeah, what it has to do was obviously is the timing of any sort of price changes and so we obviously annualized either in a positive way on some price increases or annualized and got behind us some negative headwinds between the second and third quarter. So it's really just the year-over-year compare and the timing of any price changes from our contractual negotiations.","Steve Rusckowski","Jack, I think it underscores what we've said for many years now that we\u2019ve being very disciplined and very thoughtful in our pricing to the market. We believe we have a great value proposition out there in the market. Our value proposition we believe is second to none. Just the value add and the chip price we charge for that and we want to continue to reinforce that going forward.","And I think this quarter's performance when you look at really unit price effect of 50 basis points, I think it's a good reflection of the good work we've done to apply that price discipline to our business and the results are shown.","Jack Meehan","Great, yeah that\u2019s helpful and then I just had one bigger question for Optum, you obviously have a real wealth of diagnostic data that you have built up over a long period of time, one of the conversation that's been around trying to find ways to monetize that, do you think you could find ways to use it with clinical trials, like one of your peers or are there any other interesting ideas that you had around that front? Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","We talked about in the past however monetizing the data we have. We see about one third of adult Americans in the course of three years. We keep that data for about 10 years and if you go through the map, that's about 20 billion data points of laboratory data.","So we have nice bird's eye view of what\u2019s happening with the American population and we\u2019re trying to use that in the most responsible and also the best way for our shareholders. We have talked about them using that to understand how they manage or monitor the performance of what's happening with Hepatitis C by way of an example.","We have also have sold that data to Pharma companies. We\u2019re building in that relationship. We have talked about -- we\u2019re trying to bring to the market and possibly with our collaboration with Quintiles and now Quintiles has merged with IMS. We continue to have a dialogue of how we could use that data to help with the recruitment of patients for clinical trials and that's something that we'll talk about once again as we get into our Investor Day in November because there is lot of opportunities for it.","It takes longer to get some traction with them but the prospects are good and specifically with Optum, as you know Optum has a broad perspective on the market and they\u2019re helping many integrated delivery systems.","One of the products we do provide today for integrated delivery system is around population health and how you can use this data to help manage that population that you're managing and how do we try to identify those patients that are costing the risk taker, the most of about each year and by looking at performance versus laboratory results what we could do about that to help those gaps security that we have. So lot of opportunities again come November and we\u2019ll share more with you.","Jack Meehan","Great, looking forward to it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Isaac Ro","Good morning guys. Thank you. I wanted to start with just a minute on guidance and hoping you could put a little more color around the underlying assumption you\u2019re making around the utilization and volume backdrop in 4Q relative to what you guys expect to show in your own growth?","Steve Rusckowski","So we don\u2019t assume a change in utilization from quarter-to-quarter when we look at the guidance we've put out there. We want guidance that's reasonable but very achievable and as we mentioned we did take into account the impact of the Matthew which happened in October. So that\u2019s a fourth quarter even.","So with that said, we have basically not changed the midpoint of our earnings guidance and we haven\u2019t changed the midpoint of our revenue guidance despite Matthew. So either -- we\u2019re not assuming any significant changes anything in the marketplace really basing it on what we\u2019ve seen pretty steadily for the first nine months of the year and then our historical experience in Q4.","Isaac Ro","Great. And then just may be a second question on margins, you guys have spent a lot of time talking about all the work you have done with PLS and then with outreach deals. Curious as you put those initiatives here in context with profitability, is there a timeline you could share or a path to when we should expect those programs to be accretive to overall corporate margins? Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so and when you talk about margins, I want to make sure whether you\u2019re asking dollars or percentages so I'll address both, but typically what we said is an outreach purchase it takes 12 to 18 months to get to its billing or profitability when we can get all these synergies achieved and then outreach businesses are typically at our corporate margin percentage. So we usually get some margin dollars pretty quickly on those outreach, but get to our going percentage and ratio profitability takes 12 to 18 months. ","For PLS it's somewhat similar to an outreach and that there is a transition period of time a lot of the savings is driven around moving the test menu partially off the hospitals site to ours. It doesn\u2019t happen in the first day. The second piece is really the procurement savings. So it's either changing out the platform or burning through their agents, which typically are higher cost than ours. So takes it a little while before and we get to that going profitability, but I\u2019d tell you the same thing probably a little closure to 12 and 18, but we get to the going rate of profitability for PLS within the first year to year and half.","Those margins are going to be lower than the corporate average slightly, but as I said before still at excellent return on invested capital and they are still double digit margins.","Isaac Ro","Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you, guys. ","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nic Jansen of Raymond James and Associates. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning Nic.","Nicholas Jansen","Hey good morning. Two questions, first on operating income growth, I know when you adjust for some headwinds last year tied to Celera, you're talking about 3.5% or so equivalent operating income growth based on the disclosure that you gave on the call and I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of how that can accelerate absent M&A.","It feels like I felt that your Analyst event two years ago you were talking about 8% to 10% operational EPS growth. So there is a pretty sizable delta between that operating income and that kind of operational EPS aspiration.","So I just wanted to flush out how we think about -- I know there is no chance for '17 guidance yet, but what are some of the drivers that might help accelerate that organic operating income growth as we think about the next six to eight quarters? Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","So Nic any given quarter, it may bound around. So the outlook that we provided in 2014 and we're planning how do it personally update you that on that comment at our Investor Day on November 11 and so look back at how we\u2019ve done and give you a general idea of what you can expect going forward.","It is really a annual basis or a CAGR basis. It's not necessarily what you\u2019re going to see in any given quarter. So, the things that are going to contribute to growing earnings faster than our revenue are unchanged. So it's really going to be as we return to organic growth that has a high drop through and then we have the Invigorate program, which certainly is large enough in this period of time to offset price and our cost pay for us which is our annual merit inflation and things like that and still have enough to expand margin.","As you look at some of the PLS relationships that we have talked about, those have really started up this year and as I mentioned earlier to the question that how long does it take PLS to get up and going in its profitability. Its generally 12 to 18 months.","So you would expect those deals to be contributing more to the bottom-line and helping to expand our margin more than they did this year. So it really gets down to the fundamentals, which is the growth in the high drops that we get there our Invigorate program which continues to drive efficiency and then all of those things more are on an annual or a CAGR basis as opposed to any given quarter. And year-to-date we\u2019re up 5.4%, so that's a higher number than the third quarter.","Mark Guinan","And the other thing is as you're well aware we\u2019re accelerating organic growth and we couple that with our acquisition of 1% to 2% growth and that allows us as they said it through our numbers to also get some lift in the operating income going forward.","Nicholas Jansen","No, that\u2019s very helpful perspective and then my follow-up would be on the M&A front, it does feel like you might be a little bit light relative to the 1% to 2% contribution hopeful in every given year and I just wanted to get your thoughts on the broader deal pipeline as we think about your appetite given your leverage profile today is certainly capable to do more. Thanks.","Mark Guinan","We have actually contributed about 1%. So at the low end we're re still within the 1% to 2% and in terms of our appetite, it hasn\u2019t changed, but we\u2019re very diligent about the deals that we move forward with and as we've shared, we walk away for more deals than we execute. It's not as if it's not in interest signs that we're not investing a lot of time and valuating assets and potential outreach deals.","But we do have a lot of rigor around our financial metrics and we don\u2019t execute a deal. We don\u2019t see a path towards value creation importantly. So really it comes down to our capital allocation strategy, which is once you get beyond the 50% that we grantee of our free cash flow to our shareholders.","It comes mostly through the dividend, but also through some share repurchases and the decision is what\u2019s the best value creation strategy and we have to feel very comfortable that we\u2019re going to create more value through M&A than we will with share repurchases and therefore it's really a situation. So it's not a change in strategy, it's not a change in appetite and certainly there has been a number of assets we\u2019ve been evaluating and there is lot of things we\u2019re looking at and we are driving success with 1% growth from M&A within the range and really nothing has changed than we're at the low end of the 1% to 2%.","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah, Nic recall we announced our five point strategy back in 2012. Part of that in terms of restoring growth was to accelerate our organic growth, which we are doing and then second is couple that with acquisitions and if you look at '13, '14, '15 and now '16, we\u2019ve been achieving that 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions and so we\u2019ve developed credible track record of being able to do that in the past and as Mark said, prospectively our views haven't changed.","And then you couple that with our strong cash position, we feel good about the cash we generated this quarter and our using that cash wisely with our capital deployment plan. So going forward we think we have a solid strategy continuing to build shareholder value and the growth prospects both organically and through acquisition remained encouraging. ","Nicholas Jansen","Thanks for the color. See you guys in a few weeks.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Plagman","Hey guys this is Jason Plagman for Brian, just a quick question, can you provide any update on the progress with the Squared partnership and how that\u2019s progressing?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah, sure it\u2019s doing well. We lapped it already one year anniversary in July. The initial work for both companies is to put both of our laboratory clinical trials business together and then operationally integrate those.","By integrating those, we'll benefit from that. Our equity earnings we get 40% since we own 40% of the joint venture. So, we believe we've made some excellent progress and there is more opportunities in front of us in terms of the yield we see from that joint venture because it will take some time to get the integration completed, but we're starting to see some of that already this year.","Jason Plagman","Great, thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Bonello of Craig Hallum. Your line is now open.","Bill Bonello","Hey good morning guys. I\u2019m wondering if you might be able to give a little bit more color on the collaboration with IBM, obviously in the press release and in the call today, you talked about what it is you\u2019re trying to do, but I\u2019m just curious in terms of things like indications is a lot that this service would be broadly utilized or is it limited to patients where may be first or second line therapies have failed, what type of clinical data you are going to be publishing to support the validity of the information you are providing maybe the regulatory and reimbursement considerations?","And then finally whether you\u2019re building out some kind of a service or database where you can connect patients to clinical trial based on what you learn.","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah, thanks Bill for the question. Well fist of all as I said, we\u2019re excited about the opportunity and it's an embryonic field, its building, its evolving. The field of precision medicine or personalized healthcare is just -- is very new and it continues to provide opportunities, but it also -- it takes time to develop.","So, we believe once again that we in this field need to work together with others. Two years ago, we announced relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering. We brought a product to the market called OncoVantage.","The opportunity we're going after Bill is to get to those community oncologists, which is as I said in my remarks about 70% of cancer care is there and what we realized is that Memorial Sloan is very strong and we have a strong presence in the United States, but by working together with some other once again, we could even enhance what we've done already. And so the IBM opportunity allows us to use their platform and also their data capabilities in a much broader way.","Second is as you know IBM is building out their go to market plans for IBM Watson in general, IBM Watson Health and IBM Watson Genomics and we\u2019re hopeful that that sales force coupled our sales force will drive some additional demand as people become more aware of this.","And the other part of this Bill, is we believe there is an opportunity for patients to become more aware of what they should gain access to in assessing what they need to do with their cancer care and IBM is a very powerful marketing machine and we\u2019re hopeful that their working -- their visibility around computing and particularly in healthcare will help with this effort.","Now as far as future products, we have the existing products today. We\u2019re offering that various plans for us to expand that capability with a number of actionable genes and then also an expanded panel, which will touch close to 400 genes that will look at.","Yes we do believe that this will help us in terms of depending diagnostics with those cancer drugs to rule and rule out patients that can affect and also making sure that we can support it the right way in connecting patients to the right clinical trials through their oncologist with this information.","So this is works in progress, a lot will be introduced in time and it is a good example of the evolving nature of this real effort across the world, but we\u2019re lining up with some of the best, Memorial Sloan Kettering, IBM. We\u2019ve talk about Broad institute and obviously their relationships they have with them IT and Harvard. So we have a good team working on this and we feel very, very encourage about prospects there. ","Bill Bonello","Excellent. Thanks a lot.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Massaro from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Mark Massaro","Hey guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask more about the hospital side. You mentioned that HCA started to contribute in Q3, when do you think we'll know to the extent that you can help HCA manage their lab operations in terms of cost benefit to HCA and I guess what I\u2019m getting at is how many quarters do you think it will take before you think you might be able to expand that within HCA and then related to that, can you just discuss how active you've been talking to other hospital systems.","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah, well first of all once step at a time. We announce this relationship with HCA with their Denver-based division. They have six inpatient laboratories that we will manage for them. When we do this, we make them more efficient. If you understand how they work and I would argue a lot of hospital systems work for profit corporations.","Then we'll see how it goes and we expect to deliver and so we're hopeful when we deliver that we can then expand that discussion to say can we help you in some other areas, but first piece of business right now is to do what we said we\u2019re going to do in Denver and do that well and that we'll grow the account as you grow any account going forward.","And we would also say that this discussion around hospital interest and what we\u2019re doing is building what we find is that to [C Suite] of integrated delivery systems and hospitals CEOs and CFOs are quite interested in anything anyone could do to make them more efficient.","I personally get engaging in this in a very active way and I could tell you that when we go in and have a conservation with the CEO and the CFO and share with them that we could save them 15% to 20% of their hospital in patient laboratory cost, our batting average if you will, of getting to the next conversation to start sharing some data is quite good. Very few times do they say we're non-interested. Most times they say interested and we should take a look at this and we understand how you can help us and let's see if the numbers work.","When we go in there, we also talk about their lab strategy and usually when we have a discussion around their in-patient laboratory cost, we then have a conversation around their reference testing, their most advanced testing that we provide to about 50% of hospitals.","We talk about us being able to provide more of that for them and then the third leg of the stool is they then start to question if they\u2019re in an outreach business essentially competing with us do they want to remain in that business and the best interstate for us is to become their lab partner or its Quest inside.","So we do all three, We're helping them with their inpatient labs making them more efficient. We're providing the most advanced testing for their hospital operations and then the third is we're their laboratory for their -- for their non-hospital proportion of the care they're provided within their geographic area and we have a number of examples of that and probably some of the best examples is where we've actually formed joint ventures and we have a number of long-standing joint ventures in Pittsburgh Medical Center probably the most recent large one is University of Massachusetts.","We have a joint venture up in Massachusetts around that and there is others to that we've build. So I would argue that this is a growing trend. It's a trend that we're head on. It takes a while to grow the services business, we built the capabilities, we're now executing and now we're starting to see the results in our growth.","Mark Massaro","Excellent and then quickly on capital deployment, you repurchased almost 0.5 billion of stock for the year, where are you on the authorization and should we think about a similar run rate next year?","Steve Rusckowski","Mark, you want to take it.","Mark Guinan","Yes so the year-over-year on the -- what you should expect is not -- I can't give you anything specific, we are not giving guidance for next year, but you should expect us to inherit our capital allocation policy, which is basically half of our free cash flow is committed to shareholders and then above and beyond that depends on M&A and\/or additional share repurchase.","In terms of our authorization $532 million left on the current authorization.","Mark Massaro","Great. Thanks so much.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our last question is from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [Archo] in for Amanda. I was wondering if you could give me some color on the relationship of esoteric testing and routine testing growth and then I guess the pricing in esoteric and what trends have you seen and then I've a follow on question after that.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes first of all last year the end of the year, we said that our advanced diagnostics grew by about 5%. It's a sizable portion of our portfolio of $1.8 million. We do not share quarterly performance related to that portion of our business but it continues to grow.","There is some of the mention that had in my introductory comments show that we continue to get good growth of some of the more advance testing and particularly our last question around our work with IBM and working genetics and in that field continues to provide nice growth prospects for us. So we're continuing to get growth and once again we'll share the growth from the business in due course as we announce our results.","As far as pricing, it's already in that 50 basis points headwind if you. We don't share specifics of what's happening with commercial contracting or what's happening per test but it's implied in the 50 basis points. So it's very manageable that we believe that it's always going to be some ups and downs in our portfolio of test and we're bringing new products to the marketplace as well which have new price points. So it's in that overall aggregate measure that we provide.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it and then esoteric testing continues to grow, I was wondering if you had any updated thought for the sales force. I am wondering do you have now and do you think you're the right size to service the market more broadly, particularly as esoteric becomes a bigger portion of the pie.","Steve Rusckowski","We continue to build our sales and marketing capabilities and the way we have addressed the market is really to make sure that we capture the right level of focus around accounts and with 65% of physicians now working for hospital systems, we believe it's important to have a geographic orientation to our sales force.","And so we have about 108 sales districts and they have full responsibility for the whole portfolio of Quest into the market. The charge of separate hospital business from physician to just given where healthcare is today, how it's organized, at the same time, we all know that healthcare is very specialized and so we also in addition to the geographic orientation to our sales force, at dedicated specialized sales forces.","So we have a specialized sales force or for our neurology business we have a specialized sales force for our anatomic pathology business and a specialized sales force for women's health business and we believe we appropriately staff that for the opportunities in the marketplace.","And we're always trying to optimize our investment in our go-to-market plan with the opportunities we see in the marketplace and we think we've struck the right balance to deliver on our goals of growth in 2016 and we believe we'll do so also as we go forward with accelerating growth as well in the future.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time speakers, we don't have any other questions on the phone. I would like to hand the call back to you.","Steve Rusckowski","Well thanks again for joining the call today.

Go ahead sir, thank you. You may begin.","Dan Haemmerle","Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.","A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today, in the Investor Relations 'quarterly updates' section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. This morning what I would is provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends and also review progress we are making against our five-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through the guidance. This quarter we did restore growth revenues grew 5% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 2% to $1.8 and then finally cash from operations was strong at $280 million, which is up 34% from 2013.","So let me start with the industry trends where actually reimbursement outlook has been improving. First, we saw some signs that healthcare utilization improved during the second quarter. Also in April, the Congress passed so-called doc fix legislation that delayed adjustments to the clinical IP scheduling until 2017.","This provides for a rule making process to define new rates, based on a market weighted medium of commercial rates from a broad range of labs, which includes both large and small independent labs as well as hospitals, out reach labs. And it also restricts the authority of CMS to make discretionary cuts. And right now we are working through the rule making process.","Earlier this month, CMS released the proposal for the 2015 physician fee schedule, that proposal provides a modest improvement from the current fee schedule, which is much needed after the significant cuts experience over the past few years. And then last week we learned that Tricare committed to restoring payment for 40 molecular codes that had previously been denied in some cases.","Finally, our trade association has been getting the message out about the value of diagnostic information to healthcare. We are making progress as an industry but reimbursement dynamics continue to evolve and there is much more to do. As we have said diagnostic information is a powerful lever for transforming healthcare. And we are determined to be paid appropriately for the value we provide.","We did see continued sequential progress on reimbursement during the quarter. Being appropriately reimbursed for the value provide is critical to our success. We compete on a compelling value proposition, not solely on price.","You\u2019ll hear more about this later in the call from Mark. Regarding the Affordable Care Act, the enrollment through the exchanges ramped up late in the first quarter. While it is still early, we did see modest shifts from the uninsured patient volumes at the certain payer types during the second quarter.","We continue to expect that the Affordable Care Act will be neutral to slightly positive for our business in 2014 and net positive over the long run. I would expect to update you further on reviews on the market and the competitive landscape at our Investor Day, which will take place on November 5th in New York City.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the progress we are making in executing our five-point strategy. Our top priority is restoring growth and we made solid progress in the quarter. The investments we\u2019ve made in efforts to improve our sales effectiveness are starting to yield positive results. We are seeing continued improvement in sequential trends and revenues, organic volume and organic price. We are seeing continued improvement in sales productivity. We saw a strong revenue growth in several product categories driven by clinical franchises including prescription drug monitoring, health and wellness and infectious disease.","In addition, the clinical franchises are positioning us for future growth. What I would like to do is to share a few comments on two partnerships that we established during the quarter. First, we are very pleased to be partnering with Memorial Sloan-Kettering to use molecular testing in next-generation sequencing to improve physicians' capability to treat patients with a variety of solid tumor cancers, which account for about 90% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States every year.","The goal is to give local community-based oncologists access to these strengths of Quest and Memorial Sloan-Kettering to improve their ability to treat their cancer patients. Initially, physicians who order Quest OncoVantage tumor panel will benefit from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering data through a co- branded clinical annotation report to have access to a patient's prognosis, guide treatment selection, and monitored disease progression. Over time, the goal is to build on this partnership to develop new diagnostic solutions in addition to more research in clinical trials.","Second, we also partnered with Sequenom to offer national access to its MaterniT21 PLUS noninvasive prenatal test. Beyond these two collaborations are clinical franchises are also delivering insights from our extensive database to improve health.","Let me show you a couple brief examples. You many may have seen that The Wall Street Journal covered our latest health trends report showing that about half of the patients complied with their prescriptions for pain medication. In addition, we continue empower patients to manage their health information through what we call our MyQuest application, which is powered by our Care360 which now has nearly one million users.","These are great examples of how we delivering on our vision, of empowering better health with diagnostic insights. We are also continuing to focus on opportunities to work collaboratively with hospital systems and integrated delivery networks. Last quarter we announced our fourth professional lab services relationship all these are now operational and generating revenues. Our pipeline of new opportunities continues to expand in this area.","Additionally, our M&A program enable us to restore growth in the quarter. We completed the acquisition of Summit Health to bolster our growing wellness business. We also completed the acquisition of Steward Health's outreach business and made progress on Solstas integration. In total acquisitions added approximately 7% of revenues during the quarter and also is better way for us to add some very talented people to the organization. ","We are also making progress on other key areas of our strategy. We made the number of advances in our effort to improve our customer experience by driving operational excellence. We opened our two new national operation centers; one in Kansas and one in Tampa, to enhance extend customer services for clients and employees throughout the United States.","We have added jobs in each of these markets and put in state-of-the-art technology to enable these teams to deliver a superior customer experience. We also began moving into our new state-of-the-art facility of Marlborough, Massachusetts, which we use advanced automation technology to improve the quality and efficiency of diagnostic testing for the New England healthcare community.","And finally overall, our Invigorate program remains on track to deliver the expected cost savings this year. We planned to provide you additional details on our plans to not just meet, but also exceed our long-term goal of $1 billion in cost savings at our Investor Day later this fall.","The third element of our strategy is to simplify the organization to enable our top priorities of growth and operational excellence.","A simplified strategy extends well beyond our organizational redesign it also includes organizational capabilities, culture, and processes. We continue to imbed capabilities in our organization aimed at building a high performance culture and we\u2019ve been driving transformational change for about 18-months and we have made a lot of progress, but this type of work as you all know actually takes time and we\u2019re still in the early stages of the process.","We have strengthened capabilities in our management ranks and also we\u2019re building capabilities on our Board. We\u2019ve recently welcomed Vicky Gregg as a new director. She recently retired as CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee. She also has held a series of senior roles at Humana and serves on the board of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Her healthcare intern perspective and also her deep experience in healthcare information technology will strengthen our board.","Finally, we continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment and refocus on our core diagnostic information service business. We generated $200 million of cash from operations in the quarter which reflects progress in our approach to delivering and managing working capital. Inline with our plan we made investments in our business, made two acquisitions and continue to return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Well we\u2019re on-track to meet our commitments for 2014. Now Mark will provide you with an overview on our second quarter financial performance and update you on our latest view on guidance. Mark.","Mark J. Guinan","Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were 4.8% ahead of the prior year. Our diagnostic information services revenues which account for over 90% of total revenues grew by 5.3% compared to the prior year. Revenue per acquisition in Q2 was down 2.3% compared to the prior year. The impact of recent requisition negatively impacted revenue per requisition by approximately 1%. The remainder is attributed to changes in our business mix and price erosion.","Pure price erosion was less than 1% in the quarter; we recognized that price erosion has been a challenge for our business; we will remain focused on receiving appropriate reimbursement for the value that we provide. Part of my focus will be on ensuring a disciplined approach to pricing and along those lines we will and have already begun to make prudent portfolio decisions as we move forward.","Volume for the quarter was 7.7% favorable to the prior year; recent acquisitions added approximately 8.5% to volumes. As I mentioned, we have already begun to make prudent decisions regarding pricing, and in some cases that means walking away from existing business.","During the quarter, such decisions reduced our underlying volumes by approximately 1%, excluding acquisitions and these deliberate portfolio decisions, our underlying volumes were slightly favorable in the quarter compared to a year-ago. Again, we are making sequential improvement on volumes.","Q2 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses were down 1.1% compared to the prior year, the decline is entirely due to the divestiture of Interex last year, excluding the impact of this divestiture our diagnostic solutions business would have improved by approximately 1%.","Adjusted operating income at 15.5% of revenues was about 1.4% below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to reimbursement pressure and recent acquisitions which carry lower initial operating margins. Of note, this was the first full quarter of integration for Solstas. As we shared previously, we expected Solstas to be dilutive in the first half of the year, given the magnitude of that business and the fact that we haven\u2019t yet fully realized the synergies, it had an impact on our margins, we estimate that Solstas eroded our margins by more than 50 basis points during the second quarter.","Additionally, we continue to make progress on our Invigorate program which offset increases in our wage bill as well as price erosions. As we indicated on our last call we continue to expect to achieve approximately $200 million in realized savings during 2014 and approach approximately $700 million in run-rate savings as we exit 2014, with a longer term goal of greater than $1 billion overtime.","Adjusted EPS of $1.84 was 1.9% better than a year-ago, as a result of the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to restore growth, drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, reported operating income was reduced by $34 million principally restructuring and integration costs. This reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1.7% and reported EPS by $0.16.","Last year\u2019s second quarter included $19 million of cost associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1%, and reported EPS by $0.07. As expected bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved 40 basis points from the prior quarter an increased 20 basis points from the prior year to 3.9%. Our DSOs improved by two days from last quarter to 47 days.","Cash from operations was $280 million in the quarter, compared to $208 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $49 million in the quarter compared to $56 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $25 million of our common shares at an average price of $57.74. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As well as meet our debt repayment commitments which we discussed on the last call.","Turning to guidance, we expect full-year 2014 results from continuing operations before special items as follows; revenues to increase 2.5% to 3.5% compared to a year ago, versus prior guidance of an increased of 2% to 4% compared to a year ago, adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4 and $4.10, compared to prior guidance of $3.95 to $4.15.","Cash provided by operations to approximately $900 million and capital expenditures to approximately $300 million. We took another positive step forward to restoring growth this quarter and continue to make nice progress against our integrate targets. With that in mind we remain committed to providing guidance that is realistic and achievable.","Finally, I would like to remind you of some data points to help put our guidance into perspective. Regarding reimbursement certain commercial contracts will anniversary later this year. On volumes we anticipate that are focused on pricing discipline will create some additional headwinds that will continue through the remainder of the year.","Ensuring that we are paid appropriately for the value we provide will enable us to build value over the long run. Regarding acquisitions you should assumes Solstas will continue to benefit our revenues in the back half of the year by approximately 5%. But also keep in mind that we have two acquisitions, Dignity Health and ATN, that anniversaried in the second quarter.","With that said, we expect our recent acquisitions to begin the benefit EPS gradually through the year as we realized synergies. As a result of these items we now expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be better than the 2013 level and closely approximate our second quarter performance.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Mark. So to summarize we restored growth in the quarter. Trends improved across the Board and pricing, volume and revenue we continue to make good progress executing our strategy and have more to do. And then finally, we are on track to meet our commitments for 2014.","Now, we would be happy to take any of your questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Lisa Gill. Thank you your line is open.","Gavin S. Weiss \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you, this is actually Gavin Weiss in for Lisa. So you talked about seeing some positive benefit from ACA volumes and I just wanted to get some more color on what type of payer mix you are seeing there. I assume it would be Medicaid, but can you talk about how that is impacting revenue per requisition and the profitability on those tests.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","","Sure, thanks Lisa, first of all, your guess on that is correct and we did see an increase in Medicaid activity in volume in the quarter and we are trying to track this, as I said in my remarks it is early. We\u2019re trying to understand the ins and outs so what\u2019s happening with our volume and where the lives are going. So and we trying to market down to go growth the revenue per req effect as well because there is a mix change here as well.","Mark J. Guinan","At this point, Lisa, it is still early there is small changes, I wouldn\u2019t say there was anything material enough to impact revenue req in a quantifiable fashion. As Steve mentioned we saw some increase in Medicaid though not in all of the states that you would have expected. So it still is early and we also saw a slight decrease in our uninsured volumes. So there are some early signs of the ACA, but certainly not anything material enough to give you the kind of depth that you are probably looking for at this point.","Gavin S. Weiss \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that is actually helpful. And then in terms of the business that you are walking away from that is not profitable, is there a specific type of test or is it certain payers that you are walking away from?","Mark J. Guinan","It is more of the client bill area so we have some client bill accounts where as we look at it we\u2019ve decided like you do in your products portfolio and other things as we have to make business decision around how we create value that it doesn\u2019t make sense continuing with those clients. So we understand and agree that there should be a lot of focus on volumes, but also want to make sure people understand not all volumes creased equal, and just like we needed to reshape our portfolio along our products and business we also need to do some clean-up of our portfolio around our customer base.","Gavin S. Weiss \u2013 JP Morgan Securities LLC","Okay great, thank you very much.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","So we've also taken a look Lisa, some of our practices and a variety of our businesses and pathology will be a good example, we are just taking a look at some of the practice has given a substantial changes that\u2019s we've had a reimbursement as you know in the last year and made deliberate choices to reduce some in some areas that we thought were not the best interest of building value overtime. So that\u2019s what we are referring to in our remarks.","Gavin S. Weiss \u2013 JP Morgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Brett Jones. Your line is open.","Bret Jones \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Hey Bret.","Bret Jones \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co","I wanted to start with the organic price comment where you said you saw some organic price improvement, was that primarily a managed care contract which to me sound like they were going to anniversary in second half or was that really around the client bill as you were talking about walking away from clients?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so we saw a sequential improvement in what we define as real price erosion and so sequential improvement is the decline and our price erosion is better in the second quarter versus Q1. We've indicated going into the year, we expected to have less price erosion in 2014 than we experienced in 2013, we\u2019re still standing behind the guidance, we provided it in the fall of 2012 which that on a \u2013 we believe our price erosion over a three year period would be 1% to 2% and we feel good now that in fact what we believe would happen is happening and we have reasonable visibility. So I\u2019ll turn it to again Mark and Dan to give a little more color on exactly what's happened with the price erosion in the quarter.","Mark J. Guinan","Yes and just to build on what Steve shared, right the price erosion we are looking at it from a sequential perspective some things anniversaried was a good example, sequestration which I think we all knew is going to anniversary at April 1, so the year-over-year comparisons are getting better, now less than 1% if you thought about it more from an absolute basis on a sequential basis revenue per acquisition is inline with what it had been running at, but that year-over-year comparison is getting better.","Dan Haemmerle","Yes and just on your question about the customer portfolio decisions we would not capture that in price, that would be in mix, so any decision to move away from certain business would be in the revenue per rack mix rate are not in the price calculation.","Bret Jones \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co","All right great that\u2019s helpful. On volumes, is there anyway to tell if there was a rebound of volumes due to weather that you saw in the first quarter, were there regions that were hit hard in Q1 that were especially strong this quarter?","Dan Haemmerle","Yes, you know that\u2019s a great question and its something that we constantly ask ourselves is when weather happens is it\u2019s a deferral or is it actually a reduction and there is not a lot of evidence to suggest that Q2 benefitted greatly from the decline in Q1 and we picked that up. I really think as we look at the quarter, we feel it\u2019s a true run rate of demand in that quarter versus being some sort of the pick up from that depression in Q1 and a lot of that Q1 weather happens fairly early, some was January, some was February but March wasn\u2019t all that bad of a weather month. So you would have expected probably if you got some pickup, it may have been in March.","Bret Jones \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co","","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Willoughby.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Good morning Bob.","Mark J. Guinan","Good morning Bob.","Robert M. Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","","brought the high end of the revenue range down despite a pretty healthy beat here on the second quarter. Can you give us any indicator as to what kind of fell out of the high end of the expectation there?","Mark J. Guinan","","Bob, you got cut off in the beginning, could you repeat your question please?","Robert M. Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","","Yes, you had a healthy revenue beat here in the second quarter, yet you brought that revenue range, the high end of the range down for the year. Was there anything in particular that kind of fell out of your expectation for the year?","Mark J. Guinan","","No, Bob as you know that the beat was against external I guess projections, not necessarily against what we were expecting. So I mean we feel pretty about Q2, it\u2019s pretty much on plan and I think your take away should be based on the updated guidance. What we\u2019re really same as the year tracking as expected obviously we had some disruption in the first quarter with the weather, but once we've gotten beyond that we feel like we\u2019re on-track to the guidance at the beginning of the year and we\u2019re comfortable and therefore we\u2019re hoping you will confident that things are looking good. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much quote into the beat in the first quarter, we really pretty much we landed right about where we expected which is good.","Robert M. Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","","Okay. And you referenced possibly exceeding the $1 billion of cost savings numbers here and I just kind of compare that with the comment that you are walking away from some business that is poorly price or that isn't paying you well. We've heard about that since about the mid-90s for the lab companies. I\u2019m always amazed that this business finds its way into your portfolio. And if you are cutting the cost as dramatically as you can, why aren't retaining that business or frankly, poised to grow faster here if those cost savings do come through?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","","Yes. So we\u2019re doing this is in a prudent way Bob. There are some business they obviously might've been on the margin in the past; because of the strong cost improvements it\u2019s still highly attractive for us so to your point we\u2019re looking at this in a rigorous way. But at the same time, we transact a lot of activity in a variety of businesses and so what we are making sure we do is prudently go through our business portfolio by regions and price appropriately. And in some cases, if we decided to, decide that is not the best interest to continue with the client.","So that\u2019s what we are doing. But our price opportunities along with the opportunities to retain business have been helped as you\u2019re pointing out, with our Invigorate program. We are ahead of our plan. The initial goal was $500 million. We increased it in the fall of 2012 to $600 million. We have said this year that is going to approximate $700 million. We are teeing up or share with you a glimpse of the future. We see actually more opportunity, so we are deliberately going after that to make sure that we are stay in the marketplace is aggressively as possible and make money and build value as much as we can.","Mark J. Guinan","And Bob as you know not all volumes created equal and it\u2019s both on the revenue and the cost side, so the difference between a capitated payment and a fee-for-service arrangement can be dramatic. The other thing is the cost to serve can very dramatically depending on the what kind of payer situation it is, whether it\u2019s in bad debt or it\u2019s in billing or it is in logistics.","So, I think what we are doing as we are doing a detailed rationalization to try to figure out, where we can create shareholder value and focused and then some other areas where maybe where better half moving our focus away from that business. So that\u2019s what we are talking not given up on volume growth, this is kind of a short-term get the portfolio right and then really focus from that new based going forward.","Robert M. Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","","Mark, what is a reasonable share repurchase assumption for the second half?","Mark J. Guinan","As I\u2019ve said previously, with our $900 million of guided operating cash flow and $300 million of capital spend is about 600 free cash flow and that we\u2019re committed to returning a majority to our shareholders. Now we\u2019ve done a couple of acquisitions that we are funded out of our operating cash flow most recently Summit and Stewart. And then I also have a commitment to repaying some of the debt we took on incrementally for Solstas.","So, at this point, what I\u2019ve really talked about is doing enough share repurchases to prevent dilution and not gotten specific, but certainly with our dividend a little less than $200 million and our commitment to delivering at least half of our free cash flow. You can back into something north of $100 million in share repurchases, but I\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to do anything near the level we did in 2013 and probably not significantly more than just preventing dilution.","Robert M. Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro. Sir, your line open.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Good morning. Thank you guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Hey Isaac.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. So on the ACA I know we are obviously still early stages trying to figure out all the moving parts, but I would be curious if you could may be try and tie in the impact that you got from ACA relative to the trends that you saw in bad debt. Was there a direct benefit to bad debt, because of the ACA coverage?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","No. On bad debt again I don\u2019t think the movement yet is significant enough for you to see it, its less than rounding at this point, so it very, very early. When I look at bad debt historically there is a seasonal variation as you are very aware so as you progress throughout the year you expect some sequential improvement. We referenced that. In terms of the year-over-year increase on bad debt, it actually was driven really by Solstas.","So we took on a business that had a higher bad debt rate than our rate and we consider ourselves and I\u2019m sure you look at the numbers to be one of the best-in-class, if not best-in-class. And part of those synergies we are going to drive to the Solstas business is improving the rate of bad debt. So initially that mix drove it up a little bit, but if you look at the core organic bad debt, the work that we are doing on improving that area and some of that is within Invigorate, really that organic business bad debt rate would have been down as a percent of revenue year-over-year.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That was helpful.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","But really through our effort and our work, not through the benefit of ACA.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up on your cost savings targets. You guys raised the goals there, but I don't think we got a lot of color on exactly, first of all, where you expect those cost savings to come from. And then secondly, if you could maybe venture if in fact the pricing and volume environment tracks in line with your expectations, what kind of a margin benefit we should expect from these incremental savings over the next couple years. Thank you.","Mark J. Guinan","Yes, so thank Isaac so we\u2019ll provide you more color on this at our Investor Day in November, as we said in New York so hopefully you will be there for that. You should expect that we\u2019ll get out of the new forward looking goal is a continuation of some of the work we already have done. We have more opportunities to do more work related to the streams we have talked about before, what we do around procurement, what we do around functional excellence, what we are doing around just across the board looking at improvement opportunities and how we do our work in all the different complicated areas of our operations.","So some of it\u2019s a continuation, but I have shared in the past as a matter of fact we shared it at our first Investor Day in 2012. Is that there will be a second tranche of improvement that we see an opportunity to really take a harder look at re-engineering our processes, streamlining activities and then enabling them with the right IT to allow us to get to the next level and that\u2019s what we are going to provide more color in November Investor Day, and that\u2019s where a second piece of the improvement we see will come from.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Got it guys, thanks so much. See you in November.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Massaro. Sir, your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Good morning, Mark.","Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.","","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thank you.","Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.","So you had a nice job lifting the volumes organically on a sequential basis. Could you help us kind of walk through when you see that kind of more meaningfully lifting? And I know you talked about certain aspects that helped your organic volumes, but could you maybe just walk through what you think some of the largest contributors to that would be?","","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yeah. Sure so if you go through and think about what we\u2019re doing as far as, our strategy for restoring growth, first improvement we\u2019re gradually same and you have to see the sequential is what we\u2019re doing about our sales force last year, we actually we put in place in organizational structure we put in place better tools we\u2019re build the capabilities to that organization and we feel much better today that we did year ago whether go to market organization we started to see some results from that.","On that across the board that we have a very comprehensive salesforce. They call on primary care physicians they call on the variety of specialty areas that we call on. They call on hospitals. They call on integrated delivery networks and across the board we\u2019re much stronger today then in the past. And in the service business as you know Mark this takes time and you gradually get new accounts and we\u2019re starting to see some of that in what we called sales productivity.","Second is part of our change as a company as we create a clinical franchises, we actually made modest investments in those clinical franchises which is a lot of to introduce products and solutions in a different way than we\u2019ve ever done before probably the most notable example of that is what we have done with BRCA which we introduced in the fall of last year, it\u2019s a good example. We are bringing solutions to the marketplace and then commercialize and then in selling those in a much better way then ever before and so we\u2019re seeing improvement in our volumes from those solutions start to take hold as we sell this solutions in the marketplace.","And then third, as we have built laboratory professional services business and I\u2019ve said in my introductory comments that is building momentum, we announced in the first quarter that we had four deals that were operational and we are executing against those I will share you that we have significant conversations going on with significant systems throughout the United States.","I\u2019m often in front of hospital CEOs and integrated network CEOs and hospital chain CEOs about what we can do to help them with their lab strategy and how we can partner. And that\u2019s helping so the sequential improvement we saw as well in the second quarter. So all three had opportunity improvement we are seeing and that will continue to help us as we go into the second half. So let me pause there. Anything else, Mark, you would like to add to that?","Mark J. Guinan","Yeah, I think you recognize that when you look at the overall growth rate really what it is, is mathematical calculation of many sub businesses that are growing in our some cases declining and when you look some of the drivers that have been headwinds for us over last several of quarters, we felt utilization was certainly an issue. So the marketplace overall was down and we are starting to see some positive signs. Again, we have imperfect information like you, we look at many things hospital admissions, physician officers and some of you look at scripts..","And what we have started to do is look at what we call same-store sales are equivalent when we look at accounts that have some sort of stability. So that not accounts where either dramatically they are up and down, which is probably driven by changes in membership or something like that and try to look at the overall volume year-over-year to get a field for how is utilization, how is the market. And as we look at that it looks like we have some stability maybe some slight growth and certainly not the decline that we felt like we experience last year.","So that\u2019s one of the drivers certainly that we feel the market it is improving and we all hope that the ACA will accelerate that if anything. The other to get when we had obviously is in area Paps guidance. Guideline change is really impact to that that\u2019s not gotten completely behind us that\u2019s been a major headwind for us. But on the other hand, the guideline change in the industry it doesn\u2019t be offset the path guidelines certainly is a tailwind.","We talked about our prescription drug monitoring business being the growth engine or wellness business to being the growth engine certainly in the tox area we are seeing some uplift. And then certainly in the gene-based areas, most notably our BRCA business we are seeing growth. So, when you look at the mix that\u2019s where we are feeling optimistic about a growth and volumes moving forward.","Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.","","Thanks. Just one quick follow-up. You mentioned prescription drug monitoring. Do you know what your drugs of abuse volumes were in the quarter and do you think that that could accelerate going forward?","Mark J. Guinan","","We did see a nice growth in the drug abused area this quarter. I believe overall at least near double-digit growth for the quarter to having provided any guidance relate to that business going forward though.","Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.","Great, thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from A.J. Rice. Sir your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Good morning A.J.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","","Hi, thanks. Hi everyone. Maybe just to ask a little bit more about the comment you made on being pleased that Tricare has come out with this announcement. Have you had any feedback from them as to when you actually might start seeing some payments from them or whether confirmation on the comments about retroactive catch ups and Then I guess I would broaden that out and my sense is there are some states that have been dragging their feet on paying for some of the molecular diagnostic testing. Have you had any positive discussions there? Maybe just some update on that general area.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Dan do you want to handle that?","Dan Haemmerle","","Yes. Sure. A.J., thanks for the question on Tricare. First part of your question was related to when we\u2019ll see payments and any details related to the retro. Don't have a lot of detail on that front so it\u2019s a little bit of wait and see. We are having dialogue on that front though and working with the trade association and as soon as we know we will be sure to talk more about it. We would say, though that on Tricare and molecular coding we have seen some reimbursement in the past on certain codes.","So when we do see some lift, we expect to see some lift but keep in mind we have seen some payment for some testing. With respect to different states we're seeing some progress and we saw some progress last year with different states and I think couple of states that had not been paying specific tests. One state in particular was not paying cystic fibrosis testing for all of their population. So they have put some edits around that so we continue to work through that with different states, but it\u2019s one at a time and we continue to have dialogue and hope to get to a better place than we are today.","A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay. And then maybe just broadly re-contracting. You are talking about some of the things you are doing proactively on price. But can you just remind us, are you pretty much done with the major contracts that need to be renewed for this year, however you define major? Are there any opportunities out there that you are bidding on that may be things that you could potentially pick up?","Dan Haemmerle","Yes, hundreds of contracts out there so it\u2019s just only some level of dialogue going on in terms of major contract we shared earlier this year that we did renegotiate and extend our relationship with Humana is the major contract that we spoke into.","Mark J. Guinan","","And A.J, we look as Steve said earlier, we feel very comfortable with the guidance we've given on price the 1%, 2% over the three year period of time which obviously implied something lower and this year and next year given the 3% that we experienced in 2013. So we certainly have contemplated all of the contracts we need to renegotiate the other thing is at the last call I mentioned and we reaffirm that I expected peer price erosion to mitigate and decline throughout the year. So hopefully that will give you an envelope for confidence and where price might play out for the balance of the year.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","","Okay, great thanks a lot.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Taylor. Sir, your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Good morning, Gary.","Mark J. Guinan","Good morning, Gary.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc.","","Couple of question one we\u2019ve been hearing about some pretty significant Aetna out-of-network lab cuts and some renewed efforts to on the doc fix side and I wondered if you had seen any benefit from that or expected to.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","First of all we don\u2019t comment on specific relationships we have, but we are working proactively with Aetna. As you know we are their national provider for lab services and they have an ongoing active program to drive as much volume into our business as possible, given what we offer in terms of value to them. So we feel good about that and they are helping us making sure that we do the right thing for their membership. Would you like to share anything beyond that in.","Dan Haemmerle","","Gary, not sure exactly which price points you are referring to. I did see some trade publication to put some news out there I think it was limited to non-contracted providers and certain sub-specialties and certain smaller geographies is our understanding on some of what we had read on some of those cuts. So the pricing that was out there, to the extent people had a question about, did not impact us, but was pretty limited from our understanding.","","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc.","Right. Second question, I think people tried to dig into this a little bit. I am just going to ask it a little bit different. I had followed Mark's comments kind of walking through the total volume and the acquisition impact and then the deliberate contract exits to getting to a statement where organic volume was up slightly year-over-year, which is certainly better.","What do you guys think when you see a Labcorp reporting a plus 3 organic volume number? Certainly part of that answer is probably mix of services, but what does is that make you think about just kind of how you are performing in the marketplace and share gains, share loss? Or do you think that is purely a mix differential driving the apparent reported difference?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yeah, so I appreciate the question Gary, obviously not going to comment on anybody else, so I will talk about how we think we are doing. The other thing to notice not everyone calculates organic volume consistently and I am sure you guys work to try to tease that out and get an apples-and-apples comparison. So when we offer up organic volume, it is true organic volume. We don't make any exceptions no matter the size of the deal, so you can feel comfortable that when we call it organic it is organic. In terms of share, it is very difficult because of the lack of market data.","So as I mentioned, one of things that we are really trying to figure out ourselves is how is the market growing and to both assess ourselves how we are doing and also be able to share with you. When we have started to look at, what I mentioned was kind of our same account sales levels.","But there is also mix differential, so some of the businesses that have been impacted by guideline changes and by other changes in demographics might disproportionately impacted various labs and providers differently. And as we have mentioned in the past, we have the largest pathology business and certainly those pathology cuts disproportionately impacted us. So we don't think we are losing share overall.","Obviously the national labs and even independent labs have a sub-segment. There is an awful lot of providers out there, including hospital outreach, so it is kind of hard to just look at the small segment and the national labs and look at each of those two and determine where the share might be coming from, if there are share changes and differential.","So not trying to be evasive, but it is a very difficult question to answer, and I think the best answer I can give you as we don't feel like we are losing share. We feel like last year a lot of impact was utilization in the market and some of the impacts that were driven by the guideline changes and by the pathology business being really hit by those cuts and that this year we are starting to recover some of that. So that\u2019s kind of how we view our performance. And as we committed, we want to return to growth. And as several people have noted and as we have said, we are not there yet but we feel like we are making progress.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yeah, so let me just add to that. So, we feel good now that we are making sequential improvement and in our services business it builds. What he outlined is what we are doing to restore growth has started to show its merits so step-by-step we will see progress. As we have said, it is complicated when you look at the volumes. We had noted that we actually took some actions that affected that.","When you adjust for that we saw a slight improvement in organic volumes and that is an improvement versus the prior quarter, which is good. I will also share with you that we noted some clinical franchises that are growing, but if you look at broadly when we take a look at our volumes for gene-based and esoteric testing it did grow. We already talked about drug of abuse growing.","And even when you look at the routine volumes, and some of it gets back to Mark's comment about the same account or same-store analysis we do, we actually have started to see some improvement in that as well. The other thing that we need to think about so there is continued to have softness in TAP volumes given the guideline changes that have been in place for a few years now. And we continue to see softness in TAP volumes what offsets these improvements we see in the big areas that we are focused on, genetic testing and then the core platform business of what we called routine. So across the board we feel good about the progress made in the quarter.","We are building on all the work that we have done in the past and we have more opportunities in front of us. And it\u2019s a big market out there, so we focus on the entire market. We compete with hospital outreach, we compete with regional labs. We compete with many laboratory providers. So when we look broadly at this industry we think there is plenty of opportunity to grow in this market. We are focused on the right areas that are growing and we will continue to restore growth as we go forward. And I think this quarter is a good example as we are proving that we are showing sequential improvement this quarter and we will show more sequential improvement as we go forward.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup","Sure. That is a pretty comprehensive answer, so I appreciate that. One last quick question for me. Certainly you have achieved some success in the cost cutting. You can look at either COGS or G&A per a session and see that is declining over the last couple of years. But along with that obviously you have had to spend a fair amount on restructuring and integration. Just quick count, I think roughly $115 million in 2012 and 2013 and on pace for over $100 million of restructuring charges this year, so there is kind of $0.40, $0.50 of earnings impact that we have routinely been excluding from normalized results. So the question was just do you have some visibility? I know Invigorate is expected to continue in the next few years. Do you have some visibility on the trajectory of the restructuring and the integration expense?","Mark J. Guinan","We will quantify that to some extent in the Investor Day. So, certainly as we are developing our detailed plans that we are intending to share last this year and obviously start implementing, we are looking at the savings side but obviously we are also quantifying the investment. So we certainly will be sharing that later this year.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","I will just add that one of the strategies of our five-point strategy is to deliver on disciplined capital deployment. And so any place we put money on the table we, and Mark and I in particular look through the business case that justifies it. That is included in what we do around capital investments, it includes what we do around Invigorate savings, and it also includes, as you would expect, a business case that will give us good shareholder return for any acquisitions we will do. So everything is well underpinned with good returns based upon the goals that we have for the company.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. I will wait for some more detail on that, thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thank you.","Mark J. Guinan","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Lieberman. Sir your line open.","Mark J. Guinan","","Good morning Gary.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, you mentioned hospital outreach in part of the answer to the last question. Could you maybe characterize the overall hospital outreach environment? Are hospitals increasingly getting to the business? Are the managed care payers doing anything incremental to try to steer physician volumes away from the hospitals and to you guys?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so Gary its interesting, and the reason why we are so optimistic about our dialogue with the hospitals and its great delivery networks and hospital chains is, as we thought what happened as there become a larger patients responsibility with high-deductible client when we have. And patients are starting to look at their out-of-pocket cost and then with the dynamic of physicians joining integrated delivery networks and as we all know in the past two or three years some portions of our volume has moved to hospital outreach and as we all know their prices in the industry, their commercial rates are higher than ours. Its drawing some attention from patients, from physician and also the systems are evaluation is this going to be sustainable.","So we have engaged with many different system you see one lab strategy, you see one lab strategy, in some cases they decided to rely on us for those service. So we bought University of Massachusetts, we bought Dignity Health, then we bought Steward Outreach. Examples were in fact they decided that\u2019s in the best interest to rely on us as Quest to provide them with their laboratory services. ","So I would say that the momentum on that topic continues to build and I think the strongest dynamic that\u2019s helping force this is transparency around price, and the patients starting to feel the impact of price increases because of decisions that have been made in the health care system and the most notable is they are going to a physician for number of years, their physicians sold their practice to a hospital and lo and behold instead coming place, coming to Quest with some of the great value we offer.","They get told to go to the laboratory inside the hospital and what they find is a much bigger bill than they had in the past and they have to pay for it themselves. So this is getting back to the systems and getting back to the physicians and in general that\u2019s starting to turn and that\u2019s part of our dialogue with these systems.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, thank you. Then I guess just going back to your comments in terms of the business that you exited. It wasn't clear if there was sort of a characteristic that applied to that business. Was it more fee for service, was it more capitated? Maybe a little bit more color on it.","Mark J. Guinan","","Yes. Actually you are correct I didn\u2019t provide that so all I said was it\u2019s in the client bill area but really didn\u2019t provide any more on that I\u2019m not going to get into any more detail.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Then maybe finally if you could just give us some color on the progress you are making with BRCA and maybe any challenges or early successes there?","Mark J. Guinan","","Yes. First of all, we are encouraged. We keep on building. We introduce the products as you know in the fall last year. We think there is a tremendous market in front of us. We have a compelling value proposition. We have good reach with our channels. We are putting in place even more comprehensive salesforce to go at the market, getting to the right call points, we feel good about commercial contracts that we have. So encouraged by the progress we made and also this is a part of where we expect to get some growth in the second half.","","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Mark J. Guinan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Hey. Quick question regarding your net cost savings year over year. Did you provide that? And if I missed it, I apologize. But I'm just trying to get a sense of adjusted EBIT was down about $12 million year over year. I know about half of that is higher bad debt. You acquired Solstas and a couple of other acquisitions over the trailing 12 months, so I am just trying to get a sense of how much the underlying business is down when we normalize for the cost-cutting savings? Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","","Dan do you want to answer it?","Dan Haemmerle","","Yes, we didn\u2019t provide that reconciliation. And just to remind you that we also have a cost headwind this year that we mentioned going into the year, which is really restoring our management incentive accruals at this point with the hope and expectation that we are going to achieve our objectives. Last year, unfortunately, given the year, we ended up not spending a lot in that area and so that was a headwind this year. Certainly don't take the margin change as being an indication that Invigorate is not delivering its cost savings. It is just that this year, as we mentioned upfront, there were a couple of things in addition to the wage increase, the annual low single-digit wage increase that we give, and then the price erosion we also had this management incentive headwind.","Nicholas M. Jansen \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay, that is helpful. And maybe just kind of a broader speaking question. Maybe this is an analyst day type question, but are you guys able to grow EBIT when rev per req is flat to down? Is it too much of an uphill battle given cost inflation? I'm just trying to get a sense of, if there was no cost-cutting programs going on, would this be an industry that can grow EBIT if test mix and payer mix remain under pressure from a rev per req standpoint. Thanks.","Dan Haemmerle","","Yes. Appreciate the question and we will provide a little more color on the industry and what is going on with our margins going forward. The interesting part of the revenue per req calculation is that it is an interesting aggregation of a lot of different aspects of our business. We do provide visibility on what we call our price erosion where we try to freeze all variables and say what is the real price change year on year related to commercial contracts and what we are getting from CMS.","And that is one aspect. As you know, there is other aspects. There is payer mix, there is business mix, there is geographic mix. You put that all together, so when you look at revenue per req you get some \u2013 you can draw some conclusions that aren't necessarily the conclusions that are quite clear directly related to margins.","You can actually have a high revenue direct business that has low margins and you can have a lower revenue per req business that has high margins. And so it is an industry metric that we have used and there is a lot of variables within it and we have seen a decline in it, but I think going forward, as we think about describing where we are going to get our margin lift, we also need to talk about the real margins embedded in a variety of businesses, geographies, payers as we go forward. Mark, would you like to share any more around that?","Mark J. Guinan","I think you have captured it well Steve, which I understand why revenue per req is used as a proxy for profitability and margin, but to Steve's point, it is not true in all cases and actually, as we have talked about some of the mix impact, that should not be deemed to be a hit to profitability. We have done some acquisitions in the past, including one about a year ago, that had a lower revenue per req but is quite profitable. Again, I know you guys have less than perfect information but don't always take revenue per req, either an increase or a decrease, as necessarily an indicator of an increase or decrease in profitability. There is more to it than that.","Nicholas M. Jansen \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Thanks for the details guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Amanda Murphy. Thank you, Ms. Murphy, your line is open\/","","Amanda L. Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC","","Hey, good morning, guys. I just had a follow-up to something you mentioned earlier on the pathology side. So I\u2019m just curious; it sounds like maybe that is becoming a benefit for you just given some of the reimbursement challenges there. So, I guess I'm curious, just given the exposure you have to AmeriPath, is that something that could become a more meaningful tailwind for you going forward? And then just how are you thinking about that market from an M&A perspective now?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks for the question. First of all, with all the reimbursement cuts that we saw last year in pathology we have gotten a lot of questions about does this help you. And I would say this: we haven't seen a meaningful change in hospitals systems thinking about potentially outsourcing or redirecting some of their work. Second is, we do characterize our Pap volumes as part of our AP business and pathology business. As you know, Pap continues to decline. I mentioned that as part of the offset to some nice growth we saw in some product categories and categories of our testing. So Paps, given the guideline changes, continue to decline. We haven\u2019t bottomed out yet in terms of Pap volumes based upon the new cycling of when those exams should happen.","So I would say, Amanda, overall we haven\u2019t seen anything meaningful yet but we are watching it because the reimbursement changes were significant. It is a clearly different business and it is in the area that we do see and we expect nice growth, which is in our whole oncology and clinical franchise.","And so, therefore, in the future there will be more volume related to the tissue business and we expect that that would be a nice opportunity for us to take advantage. But the example that we brought up brought up of working with Memorial Sloan Kettering is a great example. We are trying to leverage our presence in pathology, leverage that over to genetics and also molecular diagnostics to really have an effect on oncology and cancer care. And we think that is promising as we go forward, but in the short run we haven\u2019t seen a notable change.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company","Got it, okay. And then just a question on the Medicare side. Obviously there is a lot of uncertainty just in terms of how they might implement the private-pay side of things going forward, and you mentioned a bit about this. But how do you think about this in terms of how it impacts Quest and the larger labs? What are the puts and takes there and how should we \u2013 I guess what should we be looking for from an investor perspective about how you guys might be positioned long-term in Medicare reimbursement?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, right in the middle of what we are calling \u2013 what they call the rule-making process. And I will share will share with you the trade association that I am now the chair of is actively engaged in this, so I will tell you my colleagues that sit on the Board with me are also very active engaging in this, I feel very good about we are doing as a trade association to make sure that we are quite involved and how they will eventually develop which will be a median market-based price approach to the clinical lab fee schedule.","So rule-making is happening as we speak. They eventually do the sampling in 2016 to reevaluate codes in 2017. To support this as a trade association we actually had a third-party do a sampling of the marketplace, which goes back to the wide variation we have around prices in this industry. In fact, what we showed for a variety of codes that CMS pays for, but if you look at the wide variation they include hospital outreach, which is the highest price, and then you have large nationals, like ourselves, which are, in most cases, some of the lowest prices have best value in this industry. CMS is actually in the middle of the fairway from that early sample that we did. So we have to do the rule-making first. We want to make sure we have a representative sample of the market which will include large players like ourselves at our nearest competitor. Second is regional players, and then finally outreach.","And we have had public hearings on this. We are doing our fair share of lobbing to make sure that we approach it with realistic pragmatic sampling technique that has a true representative sample of the market, and that will gather that data. In some cases, yes there might be some market adjustments done, we don\u2019t until we get the data but actually in some case we believe that we are under reimbursed by CMS, and that\u2019s the facts demonstrate this. There might be some modest increases as well.","So we are in the middle of the process we feel good about that we are going to make sure it\u2019s done in the right way or trying to help CMS come up at the right approach. We will get the sampling done in 2016 and then we will see how that affects the clinical lab fee schedule in 2017. So that\u2019s where we are? But we are on top of it and we think its good approach that were active engaged.","Amanda L. Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC","","Okay, thanks very much.","Stephen H.

Go ahead.","Shawn Bevec","Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.","For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. ","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, this morning I'll discuss the fourth quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results, then take you through our 2020 guidance. But we had a solid fourth quarter and ended the year by delivering record revenues, earnings and cash from operations. Strong volume growth from expanded health than planned network access, combined with outstanding execution of our operational excellence strategy helped us offset significant reimbursement pressure.","For the fourth quarter, we grew revenues 4.8%, reported EPS was $1.86 and adjusted EPS was $1.67, up nearly 24% from the same period in 2018. Volume growth remained strong at 4.1%. For the full year of 2019, revenues grew 2.6%, reported EPS grew 16% to $6.13 and adjusted EPS grew 4% to $6.56 and volume grew 4.3%. In addition, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 6%. And this is the ninth increase since 2011.","Before getting into the more details of the fourth quarter, I'd like to discuss how Quest is squarely within healthcare's AAA, as well as covered on PAMA and the recent passage of the LAB Act. So many providers within healthcare are focusing on healthcare's AAA, which is all about improving medical quality and the patient experience, while reducing the cost of care.","Quest is dedicated to provide a great medical and service quality. One example is that we drive six input quality in our logistics performance by tracking specimen pickups. We're proud that our quality enables us to become a member of UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network.","Second, over the past several years we've made great strides on improving the patient experience. Investments in digital platforms and our patient service centers, as well as our partnerships with retailers such as Safeway and Walmart are helping to drive patient satisfaction scores above 90%. Also our Net Promoter Score exceeds 80%, which is very high particularly in health care services.","Finally, Quest offers the best value in the lab industry. Test prices for many of our smaller boutiques and hospital competitors can be two to five times higher than our prices and sometimes even more. So taken together, our medical quality, patient experience and competitive pricing delivers a value proposition that is second to none in our industry.","I'd like to update you on three fundamental changes to the marketplace, which I believe favor Quest. First, PAMA. This is the largest hub in Medicare reimbursement this industry has ever seen.","Second, receive health plans focusing on the wide variation in price for health care delivery. And they are looking at opportunities to work with fewer higher value providers. Our expanded network access with UnitedHealthcare and the implementation of the preferred lab network are perfect examples of this.","And then third is the increasing consumerization of health care. Consumers are shouldering more and more of the cost of health care and they're looking for the best value. We believe Quest Diagnostics is the best deal in town.","I'd like to quickly comment on PAMA and the latest development regarding the passage of the LAB Act. We were pleased to see the LAB Act become law in late December. And it is the first step in fixing CMS's deeply through data collection process. The Lab Act will delay the data reporting period for one-year to the first quarter of 2021. It will also require MedPAC to identify a better way to collect the data that reflects private market rates as Congress initially intended.","As many of you know the one-year delay now means that CMS will delay on the existing fee schedule for the basis of cuts in 2021. Despite the increase in reimbursement reduction caps from 10% in 2020 to 15% in 2021, we expect the PAMA headwinds in 2021 to be relatively consistent with 2019 and 2020.","Additionally ACLA, our trade associations continues its legal challenge against HHS. Both sides have submitted their briefs to the courts and the matters in the hands of the judge. We expect a decision sometime this year.","Now, turning to our recent performance and progress. The first part of our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth, which has five elements; grow more than 2% per year through accretive strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We're recognizes as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services. And then finally, support population health with data analytics and extended care services.","Now let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our acquisition pipeline remains strong. During the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Boston Clinical Laboratories, a small regional laboratory in Massachusetts.","We also recently announced two new acquisitions. The first, Blueprint Genetics. It strengthens our leadership position in advanced diagnostics, through proprietary bioinformatics, which is often a bottleneck in next-generation sequencing. Blueprint's proven platform and specialty genetics, especially, variant interpretation and reporting is expected to significantly speed the average rate at time of interpretation.","We also announced a multifaceted long-term collaboration with the Memorial Hermann Health System, one of the largest not-for-profit health systems in Southeast Texas. As part of the agreement, Quest will acquire Memorial Hermann's outreach lab services business and manage all 17 of its inpatient hospital labs in Greater Houston under our professional lab services agreement. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.","And then finally, we recently signed a professional laboratory services agreement with an eight hospital health system in Tennessee. We continue to see accelerating revenue and volume growth as a result of our branded health plan network access.","The sequential acceleration in volumes demonstrates our ability to drive continued market share growth. We look forward to the further rollout of United's Preferred Lab Network, featuring $0 out-of-pocket cost for members. The test growth drivers in the quarter and full year include drug monitoring, tuberculosis testing of both QuantiFERON and T-SPOT, hemepath, our blood cancer test and Cardio IQ. Each of these test categories posted solid contributions to revenue growth.","Overall, our G-based and esoteric testing grew approximately 5% for the year, an acceleration from low single-digit growth a year ago. And then, our second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We delivered on our 2019 goal to reduce our cost base by 3% by continuing to drive increases in productivity. We see more opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains, while enhancing the customer experience.","So here's three examples. First, our immunoassay platform consolidation is expected to provide brief throughput, autonomy and more efficient footprint, while saving us approximately $35 million annually when fully implemented. Second, we are optimizing our lab network through investments in our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey. When operationally active in 2021, our new lab is expected to consolidate three regional hub labs, double our average throughput and provide 30% more capacity.","And then third, we're using digital technology to enhance the customer experience. Nearly nine million patients have downloaded the MyQuest digital platform, which enables them to make appointments and receive their results.","Now let me turn it over to Mark to go through the results. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks Steve. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.93 billion, up 4.8% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 5.1%, compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth an easy compare and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure.","Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 4.1% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 3.4%. Importantly, we continue to see a sequential acceleration in organic volume growth in the fourth quarter after considering the benefit of the extra revenue day in the third quarter.","Revenue per requisition increased 1.2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by an easy compare, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of nearly 120 basis points.","As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the clinical lab fee schedule, as well as modest indirect price changes primarily from Medicaid. Reported operating income was $363 million or 18.8% of revenues, compared to $220 million or 12% of revenues last year.","On an adjusted basis, operating income was $329 million or 17% of revenues, compared to $295 million or 16% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our invigorate initiatives, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure.","Additionally, patient concessions were down approximately 40 basis points year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.86 in the quarter, compared to $0.92 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.67, up approximately 24% from $1.36 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.24 billion in 2019 versus $1.2 billion last year and capital expenditures were $400 million in 2019, compared to $383 million a year ago.","Now turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2020 is as follows; revenue is expected to be between $7.8 billion and $7.96 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than $5.51 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.6; cash provided by operations is expected to be between $1.25 billion and $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be between $375 million and $400 million.","There are several considerations that I will review as you think about 2020 and beyond. First, we will continue to face significant reimbursement pressure this year in large part due to the ongoing headwinds from PAMA. Total reimbursement pressure in 2020 is expected to be slightly more than 200 basis points, of which PAMA and associated impacts are expected to be approximately $80 million to $85 million. We estimate a similar impact from PAMA in 2021.","Second, it's no secret that the tightening labor market has resulted in rising wage pressure. To remain competitive, we are investing in employee pay and benefits. The incremental cost is included in our guidance. Third, despite the continued reimbursement headwinds, we are making disciplined strategic investments in our advanced diagnostics capabilities that we expect will be slightly dilutive to our earnings in 2020 by roughly $0.15. A portion is related to our acquisition of Blueprint Genetics. The remainder is related to investments in liquid biopsy and next-generation sequencing automation.","Fourth, our revenue guidance contemplates some M&A carryover, plus the two deals we recently announced. And finally, our revenue guidance includes contributions from the PLS relationships that Steve mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that revenue and volume contributions from PLS typically take a couple of quarters for rent.","I will now turn it back to Steve. ","Steve Rusckowski","Well, thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we had a solid fourth quarter and ended the year by delivering record revenues, earnings and cash. Quest is well positioned in 2020 to grow revenues and earnings despite another year of meaningful reimbursement pressure. And then, finally, our guidance for 2020 is realistic and achievable.","Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Shawn Bevec","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open up for questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. M&A, obviously, is an important component of your guidance. And when we think about the transactions that you announced recently. It seems the pace has slowed down in the last 12 months. What are you seeing in the environment that you think is driving the relative slowdown? Is it that you're seeing less in the pipeline? Or are the labs waiting to see what PAMA results is? Or is it more on your end?","And then, one follow-up to that is, just, given the headwinds that you're going to see this year around reimbursement wage pressure in the additional investments, should we still assume that the cost cutting the integrate program would drive a net benefit to the top line \u2013 to the bottom line.","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah. So thanks, Ricky, for the question. So to remind everyone, we have a long-term goal of having 1% to 2% of growth through acquisitions as part of our five strategies to accelerate growth. What we have shared is that we made good progress against that over the last several years. And because of the three elements that we see at play in our marketplace, we do believe that it affords us an opportunity to consolidate the market.","So last fall, we did increase our expectation and our goal to get to about 2% through acquisitions. And if you look at 2018, we beat that number. If you look at what we just reported for 2019, we're a little light. But if you look at 2018, 2019, we're about that 2% level. And that 2% is a CAGR, because as you know all acquisitions are somewhat lumpy. We're going to have some stronger quarters. We're going to have some weaker quarters in terms of acquisition growth, but we're shooting for that 2%. So what we just announced in the last several weeks we think are good indications that we continue to work on our pipeline. We play -- Blueprint Genetics is a good opportunity to invest in advanced diagnostics that will provide some growth and some capabilities to organizations that we think are helpful to accelerate growth.","And then second is what we also announced around Memorial Hermann is a great example of what we have done in the past and we'll continue to do more of. And we're actively engaged with many other integrated delivery systems around that concept. And to remind you it's comprehensive where we're helping them with their hospital laboratory, making them more efficient. In that regard we're helping them with their reference testing for the hospital. And then finally in the Memorial Hermann case we bought their outreach business.","And so what we have shared in the past our funnel is strong. But these deals become more complicated. They're big systems. They have many hospitals as many stakeholders. So this is just taking more time. So funnel is good. And we just announced two deals. And so we think we're starting 2020 with a good pop of acquisitions and we're also hopeful there will be more to come throughout the year. So Mark?","Mark Guinan","And on your integrate question, Ricky. Thank you. When you think about the pieces that are headwinds and tailwinds, you mentioned the headwinds certainly we've got the pricing pressure we talked about 200 basis points, we've got our typical way to inflation on about $3 billion wage bill and then we said there's incremental pressure on that. And then you've got the investments.","So the 3% productivity, we drive in order of magnitude through our invigorate program alone would not be enough to offset all of that and drive bottom line growth. But importantly the other tailwind is organic volume growth and the contribution of other acquisitions between -- besides Blueprint. And so that's really -- it's all fungible. But that's how we're able to grow our bottom line.","So invigorate alone about 3% productivity, it take 2% price, it take a couple hundred basis points against our wage bill of $3 billion, it take the advanced diagnostic investments. They're larger than just invigorate. So it's really the organic growth of our business and the contribution of the profitable outreach acquisitions that really help us to grow the bottom line.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.","Mark Guinan","Good morning, Kevin.","Adam Noble","This is actually Adam Noble in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question. I know it's still pretty early in the year, but could you talk to what type of share gains, volume growth you're seeing from United and some of the other 2019 new access plans year-over-year so far in January? And are you still seeing them outcome the rest of your book? And if yes, do you have any visibility where those share gains are still coming?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah, let me provide a little bit of color then Mark will add to it. So what we shared throughout 2019. Given our volume growth and what we just reported the volume growth we're picking up share. And, yes, we're picking up share from United as we had expected. And then second we'll we pick up share for United, we believe we're actually picking up share from other payers and other portions of the business.","We also have managed our Aetna relationship quite well. It continues to be a strong partner of ours with them letting back into the network of one of our competitors -- as well. So we feel good about the progress made in 2019. And what I say it was implied in our guidance for 2020 is a continuation of that market share gain program and our acceleration of growth strategy. As we said back in Investor Day 2018, we believe that the new access changes that we now have afford us about $1 billion worth of opportunity.","We have a good start on that in 2019. And clearly we have more opportunity in 2020 and beyond. Incumbent at all that assumes that we're going to pick up share. And as I said, there's a lot of aspects of that and we're just getting started with \u2013 for a lab network for United. And so therefore finding our guidance is picking up share again and some of that will come from the United. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So when you look at our performance last year, we would say that the typical non-network access piece was probably similar to our historic and historically over the last couple of years or get roughly 50 to 100 basis points of growth. And so the growth beyond that you can pretty much attribute to network access.","And I want to remind is that it's not just United we also got into Horizon Blue Cross in New Jersey. We got into a portion of Anthem in Georgia. And as Steve mentioned, while the United and the other two plans access increased helped those, specifically it also helped us grow and other payers as well.","So we are definitely growing share and that share is coming from multiple competitors not just our chief competitor. The other thing I'd say, you asked about January, well we're not going to comment on January, specifically obviously. we're almost 112 of the way through 2020. And if we were in any way concerned about that progress we certainly would have built that into our guidance. So we're considering January performance thus far as we communicate guidance today.","Adam Noble","Got you. And if I could just sneak in one more. Is there anything you could share at this point with regards to the assay vendor consolidation any timing of that? And it would just be super helpful.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, sure. We actually did a very thorough job of evaluating all the different alternatives. We have selected a vendor for that. And we've started the deployment of the systems that we have to deploy to allow us to achieve that eventual $35 million in savings. And so we've started to deploy those as some of our larger facilities.","Adam Noble","Got you. Thanks for the questions.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Mark Guinan","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Hi, thanks very much.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, Lisa, good morning.","Lisa Gill","Good morning. I just wanted to follow back up on the comments around continued reimbursement headwinds. I know when I saw you a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco, you did talk about pressure on the commercial market as we think about that? And Mark, I think you talked about continued reimbursement headwind when being roughly $0.15. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color around where you're seeing that from a commercial market perspective? And then I just wanted also just an update on how you're thinking about your retail strategy?","Steve Rusckowski","Mark do you... ","Mark Guinan","Yes. So Lisa, I don't recall $0.15. I don't think that's something that would represent the reimbursement pressure. So when you're looking at non-PAMA related headwinds. As we've shared over the last 18 months or so, a lot of that is not coming from third-party, the traditional payer reimbursement but it's increasingly coming from the portion of our business that is direct to client bill. And the largest piece of that is hospitals, it's the high end testing we do what we typically refer to as reference work. And we've described how when you think of the set of criteria that a hospital like basis decision in terms of relationship, test, menu, quality, history and price there's been more of a shift to price over the last several years. And we're speculating a lot of that is driven by some of the pressure they're under.","So, whereas, in the past you might extend the contract with the understanding that you had a good reasonable price and they had good quality and all those kind of things. More and more of these are going to RFP where there's an opportunity for price competitors to come in and compete on price very highly. So that's one of the dynamics that have definitely increased is the hospital-based client build.","The other one we've talked about is in several states where there are no any markup laws. Physicians can actually send work to us. And build a third-party themselves. And you basically mark up the work that we do. And that is a direct build this an office that we compete. And you can imagine that if there's profit mode for those customers. Any nickel they can say from any lab is something that's attractive to them.","So that is definitely a source of a lot of our pricing headwinds. And then there is a small piece in third-party payer as well as some older contracts are getting renegotiated and getting more in line with the current pricing environment.","Lisa Gill","That\u2019s helpful.","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah, on the retail strategy, it goes back to as I outlined our five strategies to accelerate growth. And it's all part of our consumer strategy and the consumer strategy is those multiple strategies. And one piece of it is, we want to have better physical presence. And so we've been working on getting better physical presence for a number of years.","To remind everyone we have about 2,100 patient service centers. We have over 4,000 lobotomists and physicians' offices, so in excess of 6,000 access clients. And with those patient service centers what we started on this strategy, we had about 20% and we're retail like settings, more strip walls convenient locations, not in medical office parts. And our goal is to get to 50%. So we want to have 50% of our centers in more retail like settings. And so to help us with that, we actually have formed some partnerships with Safeway, relationship has gone well. We're in about 150 stores. We then added to that our joint venture with Walmart. We continue to make progress there with their patient service centers. You also might see that Walmart is making some other loans in health care. We're engaged with them on that.","And then finally as we continue to talk to you and have relationships with other retail like partners in health care as they continue to advance their strategies as well. So you're building at 20%. We're about 30% now with retail like settings. We've got more work to do to get the 50% but that's our goal.","We believe it's important that we have more retail like settings, because as I said in my introductory remarks, this market is getting more and more consumer oriented every day. We believe that the consumer will look at the value proposition we'll look at the triple aim. So I remind you it's great health care, it's great experience at great pricing, and we think our strategy delivering really points us to the right direction.","The physical presence and the convenience of walking into a Quest diagnostic facility, we think, is part of that. So progress made, but more work to do and we're really fortunate to have some of the partners we have and we think we're on the path of getting to that 50%.","Lisa Gill","Great. Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Ivy [ph] on for Derik today. Thank you for taking my question.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi. Good morning.","Mark Guinan","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. I appreciate the color on the guide so far. While you talk about the incremental headwinds on the weight fill from the labor cost, can you help us size the pressure on margin from that labor cost? Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. To give a little bit of color, operational mark, we view some of the -- than what's implied within our guidance within reason. First of all, it's a very strong labor market and separate our exempt workforce, our professional workforce from non-exempt.","Our non-exempt workforce is where we feel the pressure. Non-exempt workforce, there's various areas of our value chain. We have about 12,000 lobotomist. We have over 3,500 couriers running our logistics operations in automobiles. We have thousands of what we call specimen processors. And so, if you look at the front end of our value chain, that's where we see some pressure.","So what we're finding and it's all very local, is that we have pressure in some of those geographies to up our wages more than we have historically, because we have to be competitive with other competitors, if you will, for those resources. So that's putting pressure on our wage bill. So, Mark, do you want to give a perspective on what that means in terms of scale? ","Mark Guinan","Yes. So we're not going to size it specifically. But as Steve mentioned, this competition for those areas doesn't just come from the lab industry or specifically for healthcare. Obviously, with lobotomist, it's healthcare. But when you think about couriers, people drive vehicles are desired by multiple industries.","And then, the same thing for the specimen processing, which generally is, I don't like the term, but unskilled labor. And so, there's many, many other industries as well that might be a target for that labor. And so, we are not really responding. I'll answer a question that you didn't ask, but might be in people's mind to increases in minimum wage.","We don't generally have people at minimum wage. It's really more responding to market forces in the specific markets where we were finding higher levels of attrition and finding it harder to attract the talent that they need. So, really, as we look at this in the near term, it's an increase to our annual wage inflation. But in the longer run we see the value coming back in lower turnover and higher quality employees.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. That's helpful. And then just on the $0.15 dilutive from the investments in advanced diagnostics, can you help us unpack that impact? And then, just a bit more details on how to think about the margin trends for FY 2020 and beyond? Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","If I heard the question correctly, you're asking for some color around Blueprint Genetics of the $0.15. And just provide a little bit of strategic logic and operation and how this will work? So, again, we're investing in advanced diagnostics. We have shared that we want to continue to accelerate it.","We just reported that if you look at our genetic and esoteric testing was up by about 5% last year. We continue to invest in that in a number of areas. And, specifically, we believe the acquisition of Blueprint Genetics bring some nice capabilities and a proven commercial organization into Quest. It brings us some nice capabilities atypically related to the variant interpretation that I talked about in my remarks. And then also specifically applying that to some of the specialty categories. They have over 200 panel tests today.","And so, if you look at their coverage, okay and their depth of interrogation of the data. It provides us a nice capability to leverage what they've already done but also bring to that where we want to do more, typically around rare diseases where we like and interrogate the data to find the insight. So we're really encouraged about the capability we're just onboard. And Mark? We talked about the impact on our earnings in 2020. Want to provide some color to it?","Mark Guinan","Yes, sure. So I would differentiate these investments from the wage inflation and arguably the wage inflation has increased in our long-term cost structure all other things equal. And the reason we call these out is because we don't expect these to be long-term dilutive, certainly Blueprint not only will turn from being dilutive to accretive over a period of time but as Steve mentioned, the capabilities that it brings to us to actually create value in other areas including being more competitive winning more business but also reducing the cost structure and other work that we do in this space.","The work we're doing on liquid biopsy is something that will come to a point within the next couple of years. And so either we will stop investing or hopefully self investing and be successful. So it will no longer be a drag on our earnings. And then certainly the work we're doing around low-cost sequencing is also a short-term investment and we're highly confident that that will be successful and certainly will no longer be a drag on our earnings. So these are really temporal investments, that doesn't mean that there won't be other things that we invest in in a couple of years. But these specific investments will be fairly short term.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Erin.","Erin Wright","Hi, good morning. Are the preferred lab networks at this point really helping to steer volume? Can you describe some of the efforts that UNH is implementing to incentivize physicians and patients to actually use the lower cost preferred providers here under the PLN? And then my second part of the question would be, can you elaborate on your lab stewardship program and how that's helping to position yourself as a strategic partner with the hospital labs? And can you give us some metrics maybe how that traction is going with that program? Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So Preferred Lab Network, we've said in the past it really got started in the fall where UnitedHealthcare where their fully insured books starting to pull some of the principles of deferred network. And then beyond that it's really just getting started in 2020. And we're optimistic that that will provide us again to gain share. So Mark specifically to...","Mark Guinan","Yes I'd say thus far what's publicly shared by United and we've talked about is they're starting last August. They're really focusing on how to network usage. And they've done a number of things to try to reduce that including sharing that information with members of the PLN, where we can go out and target some of those accounts and explain to the physician why there's a benefit in steering that to a preferred lab member including importantly the quality and other things that really limited the number of people that were included in the preferred lab network.","But they're also doing some other things with the physician directly that you probably should ask United about as they've shared with us that they're giving incentives for them to above and beyond what we might do when we go and call on them and explain why it's in the patient's best interest, we're also doing some things to make in the physician's best interest to move away from using out-of-network providers. And there's a fair amount of out-of-network amongst all of the major payers that is a source of higher cost and quite often not the quality that you'll find in the members of the PLN.","In terms of the PLN itself as we shared there were a couple of states that were rolled out in their fully insured book. Beginning in January they're small accounts, they expanded more broadly. And in the middle of the year there's going to be pretty much a full rollout including their larger members and they're fully insured book throughout that time they still have to sell the members where ultimately even though it's fully insured over time have to agree because it could have implications for premiums and so on all of that takes time.","And then there's the sponsored plans, which is the next step. So this is a long-term initiative that certainly is reaping some benefit. But it's not in terms of the step change where this is going to overnight move on dramatically. And that's why we talked about multiyear tailwind for a lot of the efforts because some of this is going to take some time. So all in the right direction, but something that is going to take a while to get to where its ultimate level would be.","Steve Rusckowski","So Erin you asked about the lab stewardship program. And let me bring it back to, again we're actively working our strategy to build relationships with health systems, hospital health systems. We've been actively working on this for a number of years. And when we go into a health system and it is at the C-suite. We talked about our ability to help them meet their hospital more efficient and effective in diagnostics.","And then secondly, as part of that the sophisticated testing that is sending out, we could do more for them and we can do a better job of how we manage that.","And then thirdly, when we always get into those conversations, we then now with PAMA. And with the pressure for commercial sales, we have conversations around their outreach business. Does that continue to make sense for them to have it? In the case of more there was an example where again a hospital services business. So as we get in there it's all about building a relationship. We help them manage their diagnostics.","And our last stewardship program is being deployed through many of our good accounts, it's going quite well. And this is all about getting smarter about diagnostics. And it goes back to the notion of a triple lane, it's about better health care, it's about better experience that's at lower cost. And what we're finding is as you get more analytics like everything, what you find out is there's over utilization and we need to get rid of that to make them more efficient. But what we're also finding is there's under utilization. And so we become more of a consultative adviser in terms of diagnostics. And one thing that we like to talk about is there's nothing more expensive than a bio-diagnosis for a hospital setting.","And so with their last stewardship program and where the relationships, we're working proactively with our partners to be able to deliver a better answer for the specialist. And again Memorial Hermann is a great recent example of the listening to our story, understanding what we're going to do for them and now we have a new partner in one of the largest cities in the United States. So we're really encouraged about the progress we've made over the number of years in the prospects in front of us.","Mark Guinan","Operator next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.","Mark Guinan","Hi, Bill.","Bill Quirk","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Bill Quirk","I guess, a multipart question here, Steve. So first, we appreciate that there's considerable pullback by some providers, concerning the executive order around hospital pricing transparency. However, since this does include diagnostics, should we be thinking about this as a potential added risk from a long-term reimbursement standpoint? And then also, and separately, given the interest in the preferred lab networks by a number of payers, not just United, should we expect additional announcements in 2-20 concerning some of the new formation of these? Thanks, guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So, thanks, Bill. The first part of your question has to do with transparency and surprise bills and pushback from providers, about that, and its complex, as you know. But going back to my prepared remarks, we believe, if you just look at the value proposition we bring into marketplace, we'd like to get more and more exposure to the prices that are out there for us.","Because as I said, with the full confidence, we believe, we're the best deal in town. And so, making sure consumers see that, making sure physicians see that, making sure that plans are working with us to move more of their laboratory services to a great value provider like Quest Diagnostics is what the strategy is all about.","And so, the more visibility of that is a good thing for us. And we're doing this with the plans and the preferred lab network is part of that. We're also doing this with employers with the plans, because as those employers look at their employee cost of healthcare, they're looking at what they can do to help their employees out and we believe our category is a good example of where they can do that. But if they do it for us, they could do it also with other healthcare services like radiology and physical therapy. So, we think it's a good opportunity for us.","And then, finally, you asked the question about preferred lab network. We continue to work with other partners. We have the nationals, but we also have a number of regionals. And as you know, we enjoy a large presence in Florida. If you look at Florida Blue Cross Blue Shield, even though they haven't announced a preferred lab network, we are very strong in Florida and we have a great relationship with them.","So in essence, you could say they are our preferred labs, even though we haven't announced it. So as we work through where we go with this long-term, you'll see what others are willing to provide publicly. But this will continue to be a trend that we'll keep on working. Mark?","Mark Guinan","And when you think about the preferred lab network, whether or not another major payer is very overt in announcing a preferred lab network or not, you will see. But some of the elements within the preferred lab network, we already had for some payers before our relationship with United. And some of them have actually expanded some of those.","So when you touch on what are some of the advantages of the preferred lab network, one of them is, when I described the out-of-network usage and having the payer actually partner with us to educate physicians around the cost of prescribing high -- the high price out-of-network labs and how that impacts our patients with deductibles and how it could impact denials and so on and so forth. So we're doing that with a number of payers.","There's also a plan, a very large managed Medicaid plan that had put in some pre-authorization requirements for certain test categories, where they were concerned about the size of the panels and the appropriate clinical appropriateness of some of the offerings. And because we -- and then, some others, it's not us alone, do it appropriately, they've actually created, in essence, what they call a gold card, which means that we're exempt from that pre-authorization.","So not only does that avoid a headwind for us, so that\u2019s the second thing, is it makes it easier for physicians to order from us. They don't have to go through perhaps. So actually in essence it should steer more work to us. And then finally another one I'd comment is in the past as we described it what we do outreach acquisitions. It was a huge windfall for everybody. Other than us, certainly we would still get great economic benefit as I've laid out in the past at Investor Day is about how they're very, very accretive despite the pricing dissynergies.","And so what we've partnered with a number of payers on is that actually we share in some of that price savings initially. So it's not all a windfall for the payers and others. But actually some of that value comes to us. So a less severe pricing dissynergy headwind for the first couple of years.","So that's just a couple of examples that you may not hear a very, very over an announcement about a preferred lab network and where the payers are partnering with us in the areas that they know we bring critical value to really drive more volume towards us.","Steve Rusckowski","Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","How are you, Donald?","Donald Hooker","Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Mark Guinan","Good morning.","Donald Hooker","Yes. So on the heels of this sizable Memorial Hermann PLS deal. I just was hoping to maybe get a sense kind of maybe looking back and looking forward of kind of the momentum you're seeing in the PLS business? I think a couple of years ago, you loosely sized it for the investor community saying it would be maybe 50 basis points of top line growth that might be just question I'm wrong but that was a couple of years ago. Maybe can you update kind of what your thinking there and the current conditions?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, yes. So, thank you for the question. And our professional lab services business is something we've built over time. We've got a nice referenceable book of business and clients that we continue to build on. We actually did say in our prepared remarks that we announced another relationship in Tennessee.","Memorial Hermann is yet another example. And what I'll share with you \u2013 you'll hear more about more professional and lab services business going forward. In our 2019 results we did have some growth from it. I'll Mark comment on the specifics around that.","But we believe it's an important element of again walking in and having an engaged conversation with good delivery systems around their lab strategy. And helping them make their hospital laboratory better, more efficient and more effective as an important part of that. And so now we have a proven trucker being able to do it. We have augmented that with their lab stewardship program and then we also have logged with that with our clear ability to be able to acquire outreach businesses. It will provide more of the sophisticated testing, particularly around advanced diagnostics. So it's moving along nicely and it's becoming a real stand for us and delivering the growth that we expected. Mark?","Mark Guinan","And I think the 50 basis points is plus or minus a reasonable number. Certainly as we look at the last couple of years the contribution that could accelerate because we do do some PLS deals, as we mentioned this morning state of Tennessee that are just PLS deals stand-alone. But then as part of what we really still believe will be increased indices broad deals with hospital partners around selling the outreach around getting that reference work and doing the PLS deal, especially if some of these are larger systems.","And we have a very deep pipeline. PLS contribution could grow to be larger than that. Certainly we'll talk about that as we see that happening. So yes, the 50 basis points is reasonable, very happy with it and that's something that we're hoping and certainly could see accelerating down the road.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes the interesting thing too that we mentioned in the press release for Memorial Hermann, but many of these systems also have their own plans -- their own health plan. So what we're finding is kind of a secondary benefit has become their preferred or their exclusive provider laboratory service within their plans, and Memorial Hermann is a good example of that. So it's an added benefit of having these relationships.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.","Mark Guinan","Hi, Matt.","Matt Larew","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the retail side. As that footprint continues to grow, could you characterize with that volume in terms of just site shift versus incremental market share shift as you alluded to on the network access side?","And then in the past you've described potential opportunities to expand the relationships with some of those retail providers in terms of the services that you're involved in any progress that you anticipate there?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah absolutely. So first of all if you think about our value chain. We actually do the draws for about 40% of our volume, okay? That's not through our true bottoms that are even each in service centers or in physician offices. That trend is actually moving more to our site. So we're doing more and more to us. It's a small gradual shift to us, which says 60% is still provided by physicians or our clients and hospitals. So think about the our front end if you will of the value chain that way.","What we believe is if we have a better experience and in better locations, we're going to be able to get share. And so we believe that we're we are growing the front end that we deliver ourselves faster than our overall growth because of this shift in the marketplace and also the experience being good as well.","And as far as other relationships all -- this is a health care service providers are looking at their strategy. We mentioned Walmart earlier, they're a big player in health care. They're getting bigger with the opening of some clinics. We have great partnership with Aetna, and onwards with CVS, CVS Health is building up pumps, which is an extension of what they've done with their MinuteClinic. We were a partner of theirs with MinuteClinic.","And as that strategy evolves we'll have a presence with them and others as we go forward. So -- and also we will continue to organically to do some of the retailization if you will of our fleet of patient service centers, because we do see opportunities within local druggists to do some of it ourselves. So it is a multiyear strategy that we keep on making progress against and partnerships continue to be an important part of it.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey good morning, guys. Yeah, so my question is on Memorial Hermann. So do you think that with this it's one of the largest hospital systems out there? Do you think this is finally the proof that outside of UMASS you're starting to get traction on the hospital side?","And then I guess if you guys don't mind just giving us kind of a view on what the tail benefit is from these comprehensive PLS deals where you're buying the outreach, you're getting the reference and basically the whole lab business for the whole hospital system?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah. So first of all as we said, I think we have a lot more interest today than we did two or three years ago with integrated delivery systems. But what we just announced with Memorial Hermann is complex and so these deals just take a longer period of time.","We do already have over the years a number of significant systems. If you remember when we bought the outreach business from Dignity, which is a major player on the West Coast. PeaceHealth is another example. I'll remind you we have a long-standing relationship with UPMC in Pittsburgh. We have a long-standing relationship with INTEGRIS in Oklahoma City.","So we have a long history of working actively with these great delivery systems long before the deal before -- with UMass. And I would argue this is a good example of a large system in a large city coming in our direction. And a good proof point that there will be more like this to come.","And the reason why Memorial Hermann chose us is because we have this proven history of being able to pull it off. We can help them with their hospital. We can help them with the reference work, we can buy their outreach business. We can integrate it. We could tie in to their physicians, we can help them with their health plan. So we have a long-standing history and credibility with a referenceable book of clients that serves us well.","Because laboratory testing is an essential part of running an integrated delivery system, it's 2% of costs, 70% healthcare decision-making. It's critical that we're working with a partner, they get it right. So, Brian, I think, we do continue to see this as a good indication that there will be more to come. And this is a major system that we're happy to be able to announce.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe","Good morning","Mark Guinan","Hi, Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe","Just, I was hoping you can give a little bit more on sort of the underlying volume and pricing mix assumptions just embedded in guidance? And then, secondly, just quickly, I wanted to clarify the wage pressure comment. I though, Mark, I heard you say a couple of hundred basis points higher, just want to make sure I heard that right? Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Yeah. So let me address the wage piece and then I'll turn it back to Steve on the volume of the guidance. So no, a couple of hundred basis points of the total wage pressure. So what we're saying is that, historically, it was at a given level. And we were pretty consistent with how we did our annual merit increases. And then, this year we're funding more increases. So, in total, it's several hundred basis points.","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah. And so, if you look at our initial guidance of 1 to 3, contemplated in 1 to 3 growth are the acquisitions that we've talked about, which we historically have done, which says that there's organic growth in there. We've also said that we have less reimbursement pressure in 2020 than we had in 2019. We've sized that to be about 200 basis points of an idea of the scale. That helps us some. Okay?","We then have these new deals that we just talked about, they're going to provide PLS. As we said, they're going to start to ramp particularly in the second quarter. So that will help us with some of the growth. And so, therefore, when you go through all the math, we have to have volume growth. And we have to pick up share and that's implied in our guidance.","So entirely consistent. Okay? What we've told to you before, is that 2019 was a good start. But it doesn't start with 2019. We're going to continue to build on that momentum. And we will continue to see access improvement of gains and share with the preferred lab network, with the other payers that we brought into it, our full last year and that implied in our guidance as grow through acquisition. And growth through market share gains related to work with the payers and other parts of our strategy.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Newshel with Evercore. Your line is open.","Mike Newshel","Thanks. Can you just comment on seasonality for 2020? We obviously have the extra day from leap year in the first quarter, but are there any other calendar effects or comp issues just to call out?","Mark Guinan","Yes. I mean, it gets a little bit complicated. So there's an extra calendar day in Q1. But it's actually not really a full day because of the data we could it is. So it gets a little bit complicated. So there's \u2013 in the year there's definitely an extra day. There's a chunk of that in the first quarter. If you recall in 2019 we called out an extra day in Q3. So you should think about that when you size Q3 because that will not repeat the way the calendar is falling.","And then there's the typical seasonality around some of the floating holidays. And then the last thing I'd point out is that some of the fixed holidays in terms of the day of the week matters. So when you look at where things like the 4th of July and Christmas and New Year's fall, there can be a difference, the worst being if those are a Tuesday, Wednesday and the best thing if those are weekends. So I'd point to those being some of the things. But you \u2013 I'm sure you can imagine that within a 200 basis point range of revenue guidance we've contemplated all the scenarios that might play out there.","Steve Rusckowski","Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Stephen Baxter","Hi, thanks for the question. So obviously a lot of moving parts in the guidance today including the investments you're making. I was hoping you could help us understand a little bit more explicitly what the guidance is embedded from an op margin perspective? If I looked at this year and took out the United out of network impact, I would have seen margins I think roughly stable year-over-year. So do you think that's achievable again as we go into 2020? And if you can add on any expectations for below the line items, the interest expense, tax rate anything we should be considering there that would be different than 2019 in our models? Thank you.","Mark Guinan","So let me address the latter. Interest expense and tax rate will be pretty consistent. The other area where we've had a number of people ask questions recently as equity earnings. And that growth has been certainly largely driven by our JV with IQVIA our Q Square JV that we set up several years ago that have been continuing to drive earnings growth.","One of the investments that we called out our liquid biopsy investment actually comes to us through an investments that we have with a third party. And the accounting rules dictate that we have to take our share of those losses and even months an investment in this company. That will be in the equity earnings line so that will dampen somewhat the equity earnings growth but it's all again in that $0.15 that I called out earlier. So I'll turn it back to Steve for the other part of your question margins.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, margins, we've been consistent where we haven't guided around margins because we have a mix of businesses. We're driving growth and we're driving a return on invested capital. And we had provided outlook around growth and earnings per share. We think that's the best way for us to drive shareholder value. So we're not going to really comment on what the margins will be year-on-year. But we go through the math, you can get it from private markets could be based upon the top line growth and what we have guided as far as our EPS growth.","Mark Guinan","And the other thing is that margins are not given. So if we're at the low end of that revenue guidance versus the high end, it will have the impact on margins because as we've shared previously that organic revenue growth comes through a higher drop-through than our fully loaded margin. And we're depending on that as I shared with Ricky with her initial question. Our invigorate program alone can offset in a large proportion of the headwinds. But really the bottom line growth and the margin -- any margin expansion will come through that organic revenue growth.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark Guinan","Good morning, Jack.","Jack Meehan","Hi. One clarification and one strategic question. Clarification on the fourth quarter, I was curious if you could weigh in on how much you might have contributed? I know that Hooper Holmes acquisition last year had a little bit of that?","And then strategically just given the dilution associated with the Blueprint acquisition that's, obviously, unusual in terms of the framework of deals that Quest has done in the past. I'm curious if you could just weigh in just the appetite for deals like that versus -- I guess what we're accustomed to in terms of tuck-ins on the outreach side?","Mark Guinan","Yeah, the Blue was a small competitor. As we've shared in the past in this point of care, we certainly get some flu testing when the flu season spike. So yeah it was a little bit of tailwind, but not anything notable.","In terms of our strategy, I want to ask Steve\u2026","Steve Rusckowski","So Jack we're always looking at aligning our adjustments around our strategy and having a balanced approach. And related to acquisitions we shared, typically what you're seeing for us is acquisitions falling in one of three categories. One is regional laboratories. We've talked about Boston Clinical Labs that\u2019s a small regional laboratory we just acquired. We did one in Missouri last year. So we'll continue to pursue those.","Second hospital outreach business is Memorial Hermann is a good example of that. We like those deals are accretive to our earnings. They provide real growth. We really like the stickiness if you will of the customer relationships we take on board and it keep capability building. And so Blueprint Genetics is an example of capability building.","We thought it would be prudent for us to make an investment there. We think it's very consistent with our strategy. It's modest in size, but it's going to give us a nice capability around bioinformatics, around the variant, interpretation that I spoke to. It'll allow us to achieve that strategy of accelerating growth in advanced diagnostics, which is a category we shared in the past, our definition in genetics and molecular we do over $1 billion. And we believe that that is prospectively a great opportunity for us to continue to invest and that's why we made it.","So we will continue down that path of a balanced approach consistent with our strategy with deals that we can make money for shareholders and trust that will make any deal including the ones we just announced, we have a path to value creation for our shareholders.","Mark Guinan","And just one final comment. I mean typically Jack with our acquisitions the value creation has to come directly from the book of business we're buying. And while certainly the book of business we're buying from Blueprint will become better from a profitability standpoint. Really the value creation goes well beyond that book. And as we've mentioned earlier capabilities it brings will benefit everything we do in that space. And so the capability, a description that Steve gives really means that it's going to create better margins and better competitiveness in space outside the specific test menu and book of business that we're acquiring.","Jack Meehan","Thank you.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, last question.","Operator","Yes, our last question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Mark Guinan","Hi, Ann. Good morning.","Ann Hynes","Hi, good morning. So, I just want to ask about cash flow beyond 2020? I know your CapEx is a little higher, just because of the new facility, should we assume that CapEx run rate goes down after 2020?","Steve Rusckowski","Typically, I don't give any kind of guidance beyond the current year, Ann. But what I will say is that, this is the largest year for Clifton, 2020, we're expecting to be operational in 2021. The Clifton facility has been the driver certainly this year, last year and even back into 2018 and the increase in our relative level of capital spending. We haven't announced any similar plans like that. So you might infer from that that capital spending might come down a little beyond 2020.","Ann Hynes","Have you disclosed how much you've been investing in CapEx for Clifton?","Steve Rusckowski","We haven't by year, what we have disclosed that it was about $0.25 billion investment over three years.","Ann Hynes","Okay.","Mark Guinan","You might have seen as well that we recorded a gain on the property sale with self focus\u2026","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So we sold our Teterboro property and we're going to lease back right now until we exited and moved to Clifton and that was a big contributor to the year-over-year GAAP earnings gain. We adjusted that out of our adjusted income, but it was a nice cash inflow.","And as you know, Ann, that goes into financing, not into operating cash flow. And actually the tax on the gain actually goes against operating cash flow in 2020. So from an accounting perspective, it's a little bit disconnected. But we actually got quite a bit of cash from the sale of Teterboro at the end of fourth quarter of 2019.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So when we built the business case on Clifton investment, we assumed a certain sell price for the Teterboro facility. We really exceeded that expectation. So we feel good about the business case and what we're putting our capital budget against.","Ann Hynes","All right. Great. Thank you.","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Ann.","Steve Rusckowski","Sure. So thank you very much. Appreciate your engagement. We appreciate your support and look forward to seeing you in our travels. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.","Now, I like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please, go ahead.","Shawn Bevec","Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected.","Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense.","As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Additionally, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior year comparisons to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that became effective January 1, 2018 and was adopted on a retrospective basis. ","Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility, which we will refer to as patient concessions, as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within SG&A expenses.","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I\u2019ll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on third quarter performance and give you an update on our outlook for 2018.","We grew revenues and continued to deliver strong earnings growth in the quarter. Revenues were up nearly 2%, despite the effect of industry headwinds we called out last quarter. Reported EPS was up more than 32% from 2017. Adjusted EPS grew more than 25%. As you saw, we have revised our full-year revenue guidance to reflect lower than expected revenue","performance this year, which was affected primarily by two factors.","First, as we detailed in the second quarter, we faced headwinds in the areas of prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C, and vitamin D testing. While we made some progress, these testing areas continued to impact revenue growth in the third quarter. Second, in the third quarter, we also saw a rise in patient concessions, which Mark will touch on later.","Before getting into the details of the progress we\u2019ve made in the quarter, I'd like to provide context on some market trends, starting with an update on PAMA. Last month, a US District Court judge dismissed on narrow procedural grounds our trade association\u2019s lawsuit over the implementation of new Medicare pricing for lab tests under PAMA.","The Court\u2019s opinion, however, acknowledges that ACLA\u2019s arguments on the merits raise important questions, about HHS\u2019s actions. This is, of course, disappointing for our industry; and it is potentially harmful to Medicare beneficiaries.","Last week, ACLA appealed the District Court\u2019s decision, demanding a hearing on the merits. At the same time, the industry continues to pursue a legislative fix. Additionally, CMS and our industry continues to work together on addressing the current PAMA issues. So, as we sit here today, PAMA is having an impact on Quest and the rest of the lab market.","Increasingly, smaller independent labs and hospital outreach labs are struggling financially, due to lower Medicare reimbursement, not only directly due to PAMA, but also under contracts with pricing indexed to Medicare. Some have begun to exit the business, citing PAMA as a factor. We\u2019re continuing to plan and manage our business as if PAMA is here to stay.","At the same time, there has been increasing scrutiny of the wide variation in health care pricing in the popular press. Consumers and employers, who pay for most of healthcare, are becoming more price sensitive. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that health plans that exclude costly providers can be much less expensive for consumers and employers. ","Quest offers a great customer experience, and coupled with our scale and efficiency, it makes us an exceptional value in the market, compared with hospital outreach labs, which often charge two-to-five times more than Quest. So, in short, there are three reasons we believe the market will continue to consolidate and therefore afford us an opportunity to accelerate growth.","First, reduced reimbursement through the Medicare Clinical Lab Fee Schedule is beginning to have an impact on the laboratory industry. Second, health plans are embarking on a new strategy, looking to national labs to help drive efficiency in lab spending. And the finally, consumers and their employers are more attuned to the variation in healthcare pricing.","Turning to the third quarter, I\u2019ll review our execution against the five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions. We announced three acquisitions in the third quarter, which strengthen our capabilities in several key areas.","First, our acquisition of PhenoPath, which has a strong record of innovation, provides several capabilities that complement and extend our own, particularly in the area of pathology and molecular oncology. It also expands our presence in the Pacific Northwest.","Our acquisition of the U.S. laboratory services business of Oxford Immunotec will extend our capabilities in infectious disease diagnostics. It will also bring us greater choice to physicians who seek innovative blood-based tuberculosis and tickborne disease testing. And then finally, our acquisition of ReproSource expands our expertise in reproductive diagnostics.","Since the third quarter close, we have also announced the acquisition of Hurley Medical Center\u2019s outreach lab operation in Flint, Michigan. In this case the seller indicated reimbursement pressure as a factor in deciding to exit the business. Additionally, we acquired the assets of Provant Health to strengthen our employer wellness business.","So, the acquisitions we have announced and will close in 2018, already position us within our 1% to 2% revenue growth target for next year. And, as I indicated, PAMA should further contribute to our strong M&A pipeline. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems.","We continue our preparations to take advantage of the opportunity to offer a first-class customer experience for UnitedHealthcare providers and their members when we become an in-network lab provider on January 1. Our commercial team has already been proactively reaching out to educate physician customers about their ability to use Quest for their UnitedHealthcare members.","The revenue opportunity presented by the United contract will ramp over time. We do expect some portion of this new work to transition quickly. However, the larger opportunity to help UnitedHealthcare drive lower lab spend is expected to be realized over the next several years.","The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Our announced acquisitions in the quarter mentioned earlier will enhance our capabilities in advanced diagnostics, especially in the areas of Women\u2019s Health and Infectious Disease.","We continue to see strong growth in prescription drug monitoring and Quantiferon tuberculosis testing. Additionally, this quarter we saw solid growth in Cardio IQ, as well as testing for sexually transmitted diseases.","On our second quarter call, we highlighted several market headwinds that impacted growth in prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C and vitamin D testing. We saw modest improvement in the third quarter. For example, PDM denials have steadily improved each quarter this year. We\u2019ve also started to lap hep C headwinds we began to experience roughly a year ago.","In aggregate, the issues we have mentioned related to these three tests contributed approximately 100 basis points of headwinds this year against our original revenue expectations. We continue to make progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers.","Quest Walmart locations continue to see increased traffic and generate great feedback from our customers. In fact, for locations open more than 6 months, we\u2019ve seen an uptick in volumes compared to the patient service centers they replaced. We are currently operating inside 21 Walmart stores in Florida, Texas and now Illinois. ","We combined with our partnership with Safeway, we expect to have well over 200 patient service centers in retail store locations by the end of 2018. Consumers continue to embrace our digital experience. We now have more than 6 million users on our MyQuest app that lets them view and analyze test results, schedule their appointments, see patient service center wait times, and then finally pay their bills.","The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health with data analytics of extended care services. We\u2019re seeing continued interest in Quest Clinical Trials Connect, which we launched in June. This is a new patient recruitment service to help pharma companies and CROs increase the speed of commercializing new therapies. We\u2019re working with several pharma, biotech and CRO companies with this new solution.","The second element of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. At the end of September, we launched a new appointment scheduling system for our patients. This new system utilizes best-in-class technologies to help patients schedule appointments at a convenient location. In the second week of deployment alone, we saw appointment-related calls into the National Customer Service center drop by more than 10%.","Our Online Specimen Pickup option has been a big hit with our physician customers with nearly 20% of routine pickup requests now handled electronically versus making a call. Physicians have given us positive feedback on the ease, efficiency, and simplicity, compared to waiting on the phone and writing down those confirmation numbers.","And then finally, our Invigorate program remains strong, and we\u2019re on track to over-deliver on expected savings for 2018. Overall, we continue to make excellent progress on our operational excellence strategy and our leaders will be sharing more insights, successes, and plans with those that attend our Investor Day, which will be held November 29, in New York.","Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the financial performance. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve. Consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 1.8% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we now report patient concessions as a reduction of net revenues instead of as bad debt, due to a required change in revenue recognition accounting. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew 1.9%, compared to the prior year, driven by acquisitions and an easier compare, due to the hurricane effect last year.","Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. Revenue per requisition in the third quarter declined by 80 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It also includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix, and tests per req.","During the third quarter, unit price headwinds remained consistent with our expectations for the full-year with a headwind of approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and approximately 100 basis points from all other factors. As we\u2019ve shared previously, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019, due to PAMA. Other mix elements remained positive in the quarter and partially offset the impact of reimbursement headwinds, as well as growth in our professional laboratory services business.","Reported operating income for the quarter was $304 million, or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $298 million, or 16.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $311 million, or 16.5% of revenues, compared to $325 million, or 17.5% of revenues last year.","The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to several factors, including: investments related to tax reform savings, which had a 60-basis point adverse impact on operating margin; integration efforts of acquisitions, which take time to deliver a full margin contribution; and the impact of PAMA.","Reported EPS was $1.53 in the quarter, compared to $1.15 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.68, up approximately 25% from $1.35 last year. During the quarter, patient concessions, previously recognized as part of bad debt, were up as a percentage of revenue year-over-year.","We continue to see an increase in patient revenues as a percentage of total revenue, due to the ongoing trend of rising patient deductibles and an uptick in uninsured patients.","Cash provided by operations year to date was $905 million versus $852 million last year. Capital expenditures year to date were $232 million, compared to $170 million a year ago, which is in-line with the higher CapEx spend planned for 2018.","Now, turning to guidance. We are updating our outlook for 2018 as follows. Revenue is now expected to be approximately $7.62 billion, an increase of approximately 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS to be between $5.57 and $5.64, and adjusted EPS to be between $6.53 and $6.60. Cash provided by operations continues to be approximately $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures continue to be between $350 million and $400 million.","Our updated guidance reflects the industry headwinds we\u2019ve experienced versus our expectations in 2018. While we aren\u2019t prepared to share 2019 guidance, there are some elements I\u2019d like you to keep in mind. First, we have a significant opportunity to grow with our new UnitedHealthcare contract.","However, moving in network comes with lower reimbursement versus the out of network services we provide to UHC patients today. Second, as Steve mentioned earlier, we are already on track to deliver 1% to 2% revenue growth from M&A next year. Third, as you are already aware, the impact from PAMA is expected to increase from a headwind of approximately 50 basis points this year to more than 100 basis points in 2019.","And finally, we expect approximately 150 basis points of reimbursement pressure beyond PAMA from our third-party payers, which includes the impact of becoming an in-network provider for United and other health plan contract changes; as well as hospitals and physicians that we bill directly. After considering all these headwinds and tailwinds, we are well- positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at Investor Day.","I will now turn it back to Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, revenues grew and we delivered strong earnings in the third quarter. We're excited about our M&A activity in the quarter, and are well-positioned for top and bottom-line growth in 2019. Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 29. ","Now, we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Hi, good morning, gentlemen. So, it seems like one of the incremental updates, Q-on-Q was sort of the concept of patient concessions being an incremental headwind, could you just give us a little bit more color, just sort of how that\u2019s playing out and why that sort of incrementally was sort of a surprise that popped up? And then, as we think about, sort of, in the next year, just a little bit more color, I know you don't want to give guidance on sort of the headwind you are expecting vis-a-vis sort of some of the network pricing pressures, inclusive of sort of the added networks United business getting repriced just kind of put the full picture together on, from what you were trying to get across in maybe those two points?","Mark Guinan","Well, Ross, on patient concessions, you know we have a larger percentage of our revenue coming from patients. And as we\u2019ve shared in the past, the un-collectability, so it is bad debt for other sources what we call patient concessions from patients proportioned is much, much higher from patients than it is from any others source. So, we all have almost 0 bad debt from all the other revenue sources.","So, really what was previously bad debt and now is patient concessions is largely a factor of collecting bills from patients. And again, a little bit of it is from the uninsured and most of it really comes from patients who have insurances, who are in the deductible and so they are paying a large proportion on all of their medical cost or it is from their coinsurance. And so, as that mix changes, unfortunately even though we are improving and continue to improve the bad debt rate or patient concession rate, through some of the things we\u2019ve done such as putting in our Easy Pay in our office phlebotomist and also our patient service centers also giving more transparency of price ahead as we talked about with our transparency tool with large amount of payers or patients know the cost, know the responsibility they have and it gives us a chance to collect upfront.","Just because of mix that has been a headwind and as you know now with the accounting changes it\u2019s not just a headwind to operating margin, but it\u2019s a headwind to revenues as well. To your question why we couldn\u2019t see this coming, I mean we really don't know until we start doing collections and so given the cycle itself of performing the service, and then billing the payer, potentially having some back-and-forth claims on the adjudication, and ultimately billing the patient and seeing our collectability, you know it takes some time.","And so, we obviously don't know if there is any definition of what\u2019s driving this, but when you look at some of the recent information that\u2019s come out from several sources around deductible, amounts are actually going up on average, so patients are paying a greater proportion of their healthcare, especially the patients that use a lot of our services because large majority is for healthy patients who go to the physician for a regular checkup. ","Therefore, we believe that that\u2019s a factor and a second one, there has been a small increase in the number of uninsured patients that we\u2019re serving. Obviously, we don\u2019t know whether that was driven by some changes in the Affordable Care Act recently or what\u2019s driving that, but we definitely have seen that. So that\u2019s on the patient concessions. On the pricing, that\u2019s what I was trying to do, was to give you all the moving pieces. So, when you look at the totality, obviously we\u2019re looking at a very attractive volume opportunity from network access with United, and it does come with a lower price, it comes to more of a market price for in-network laboratory. So, it\u2019s a good price, but it is lower than we were being paid previously. ","We just wanted to make sure people have that understanding in their models and then the other price, which we talked about of being 100 basis points or less will continue. A fair proportion of that is not from third party payers it is coming in very competitive hospital market, and also from physicians where we client bill or directly bill that physician and they bill the third-party as opposed to us billing the third-party. So, we wanted to make sure that people understood all the dynamics that are driving price.","So, when you add all those pieces up, they said, PAMA is going to be approximately 100 basis points and we\u2019ll have about 150 basis points from other sources in 2019. However, given the M&A pipeline that we have and the deals that we\u2019ve already signed and have closed recently, and along with the access and continued improvement in some of the market headwinds that are hitting competitors, as well as I ended that section we\u2019re very confident of our ability to grow revenue and to grow our earnings in 2019, and I\u2019ll shed some more color on that at the Investor Day.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. And this is something on the patient concession thesis. I\u2019m reminding everyone that close to two years ago where we teamed up with Optum and UnitedHealthcare around our revenue cycle management or building operations. So, we're working hand-in-hand with Optum on what we could do to affect bad debt, as well as denials. We have really enjoyed the working relationship. Matter of fact, this week I\u2019ll be with that team. We\u2019ll talk about what we\u2019re seeing and how they can help us here as well. So, that relationship continues to be strong and that\u2019s going to help us as there is more and more pressure on this side of our business.","Ross Muken","Thanks. And maybe just quickly on the offset side, you had some incremental investments you made this year that offset some of the tax benefit, and there is also the potential to maybe push back a bit on the supplier side, so I guess how are you thinking about, you know those are the pushes, the pulls that you have to try to maybe recapture some of that margin you are seeing hit by both PAMA and the other [indiscernible]?","Steve Rusckowski","Well, I will take that at the beginning of this which is related to investments. We continue to make those investments we think are prudent for the capacity we're going to need giving what we anticipate is volume increases in 2019. This is as we would expect at the real granular level thinking about where we are at present, where we are going to pick up lives with United and therefore where we will pick up some shares. So, that\u2019s happening and it\u2019s in our numbers.","Second it is we continue to honor our commitment to our employees paying out a bonus that will come up in November, that is an investment to share with our employees, we feel good about making sure we have a good workforce that feels good about working at Quest and that continues. And then finally, the opportunity to continue to grow the business in the five growth strategies outlined continue to be a promising opportunity for us as we come out of this year and we enter 2019. So, none of that is changing and we\u2019re making excellent progress on all those elements.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, Ross when you walk through those three, you know the bonus was a one-time bonus, so that\u2019s not going to repeat in terms of the investments for network access expansions. Those become cost of sales. So, when you\u2019re adding [indiscernible] people from the laboratory adding patient service across centers then all of that is investment ahead, but then it becomes our cost of sales. And then finally, on the other investments that Steve referenced, we will make those decisions along with everything else. We decide in terms of long-term, short-term results and also affordability to get into that year. And of course, I\u2019ll turnover over to Steve the most important piece.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. You asked also about the offset of working with our providers, excuse me, our suppliers and yes, this is all in an ongoing approach we have had with our invigorate program. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we exceeded our goals for this year, part of that is what we do with our suppliers. Our suppliers are well aware of what\u2019s happening with PAMA, matter of fact they are working with us on a legislative solution. This is through the AdvaMed organization, which is the device trade association. So, they are actively working this with us and are very much aware of the pressure there will be on this industry.","And beyond what we do with our suppliers, we continue to look at efficiencies and we hope that many of you will come to our Investor Day, because we\u2019ll be outlining more of the opportunities we see beyond 2018 into 2019, 2020 and 2021 with more efficiency gains, because as we shared over the past several years, even though we did hit that $1.3 billion goal, we see more opportunities in front of us to continue to run a higher quality more efficient operation going forward. So, we look forward to you joining us to secure more about that.","Mark Guinan","And just very quickly, two of the items that Steve referenced in his prepared remarks about appointment related calls dropping by more than 10% and specimen pickups being ordered online versus call, those are part of the efficiency and obviously we expect to continue to reduce the amount of phone calls we get and actually drive you the more efficiency going forward.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","AJ Rice","Hi, everybody. Maybe I will ask about the retail initiative. I know Walmart recently had an Investor Day where the just talked about the 15 locations that you work with them on expanding to the Midwest and envisioning over 100 location, ultimately in place, any comments you guys have about timing of that? And then also I know you're working on some pilot stuff with Aetna CVS, any update on that? And then how much is the retail? At this point, is it enough to move the needle in terms of its contribution to revenues, how would you describe where you are at on that?","Steve Rusckowski","First of all, AJ thanks. I mentioned in the script, we continue to add stores. We're happy with the progress there. We are at 21 stores now and it continues to build and I tell you that that number will be much higher than that by the end of this year. And we focus on the big states of Florida and Texas and also, I said that we moved into the Illinois as well. So, there will be other states beyond those throughout the rest of this year. So that continues to build. So, what you heard from Walmart is aligned with our view.","Second is, the experience has been quite good. It\u2019s been good for our patients; those patients are also Walmart consumers. Walmart likes the volume in the stores or volume is like the experience as an employee serving their customers better. And in fact, when we look at the volumes that we see in those sites that have been open long enough, we think it actually does have an effect on our market share within that geography. So, all around good presence, but we're not stopping there, the opportunity we talked about continuing to work with this joint venture with Walmart is how we provided other healthcare services and some of those locations, in fact we were detailing that out with Walmart and you will hear more about that. ","We hope to provide more color around those services at our Investor Day in November. And then equally, what CVS, now with the planned merger with Aetna will do with their strategy is a continuation of what we\u2019ve done with them in the MinuteClinic, and we're hopeful, as well as they continue to walk on those integration plans with Aetna given our great relationship with Aetna, great relationship with CVS, they do see an opportunity with the brick and mortar they have and with some of our capabilities of providing basic healthcare services.","So, when we come to Investor Day, what we will do is, walk you through what we call our diagnostic services, which includes how we use our data and how we use the services and capabilities of Quest to help bend the cost curve. And some of that will be done with our Walmart joint venture and some of it will be done with other partners like CVS, but we do believe it\u2019s a great opportunity for growth in the near-term, but also for the long-term because we're just getting started frankly. So, more to come on that and we hope that you show up for the Investor Day in November.","AJ Rice","Alright, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Guinan","Hi, Patrick.","Patrick Donnelly","Hi, how are you? Maybe just on the three headwinds, PDM, hep C, and vitamin D, you know headwinds persisting here throughout the end of the year, can you maybe just update us on the trends and visibility on that turning around, I'm just trying to figure out how much that could leak into 2019 as we think about numbers kind of going forward for next year?","Mark Guinan","Sure. On the hep C as we mentioned, that is starting to mitigate because we\u2019ve lapped year when, you know the [indiscernible] drug started to take significant share. So, at some point, most of that business goes away or it stabilizes or maybe even the drugs make a comeback, I know there is some pricing competition and an area that might change the competitive landscape. So, that should not continue to be significant into 2019. ","On PDM, I want to be clear as Steve mentioned, it continues to be a growth engine for us. Unfortunately, we\u2019re doing more volume than we are - revenues. So, revenue is growing, the following is growing faster and that\u2019s because of some of these denials. I can't put a stake on the ground at this point as how quickly we\u2019re going to address that. I guess the important thing is that even though that headwind may or may not get addressed in the near-term future. ","As Steve also referenced, it\u2019s stabilized. So, we're not growing in denials. So, we are reaching a point where the denials are still much higher than it should be and much higher than we find acceptable. It\u2019s not going to be continuing to be a year-over-year headwind. And certainly, we make some progress there could actually be a tailwind moving forward. And then on vitamin D, I\u2019d say it\u2019s still early.","As we mentioned, we still believe that a number of these denials are because of miscoding based on a long history of physician coding practices, and not necessarily denials to patient eligibility. And so, how many of these things will be rectified when the physician community understands. For instance, either of these patients is now eligible for vitamin D and I need to use the appropriate code versus now this was just a screening and now it\u2019s other others including, as we mentioned, Cigna starting to apply Medicare type of approaches to their coding that this actually would be a denied task. But at some point, again, as you mentioned, you get that behind you and it all continues to be a headwind once the market adjusts and patients are appropriately getting prescribed with the right diagnosis code and then vitamin D continues to move with the market as it has been doing historically.","Steve Rusckowski","So, as just to reinforce what we said in the script is that, we have the three together, we looked at our expectations for this year and how it has affected us. It\u2019s about 100 basis points and that\u2019s our business and I\u2019ll just to remind everyone, we\u2019ve talked about this before. We are the market leader on prescription drug monitoring. So, very strong in that category, continues to grow, but we clearly have more exposure than a lot of people on that space. So, therefore, any effect of those three have a bigger impact on us.","So, the 100 basis points is our estimated. And as Mark said, we continue to work this. We started working this in Q2. We\u2019ve made some modest progress. As I said in my remarks, we will continue that throughout this year and then again as we start to lap it, we'll have less of impact year-on-year, but different than what we expected, but still growing in these three categories.","Mark Guinan","And then just to add to what Steve mentioned, those three had about 100 basis point negative impact versus our expectations and then the patient concessions were another 30 basis points.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a quick one on the payer shifting with United, you\u2019ve talked about a few different buckets of customers, just framing that opportunity, I guess now that we're a few months in, and you\u2019ve done more work on the market on United itself, what fragment of that market do you think you're kind of viewing as early adopters, you know shifting quickly in 2019, just trying to frame that opportunity?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. The business opportunity we have is, those customers of ours that have the majority of their laboratory testing coming to us already, but might just have another laboratory because we are not in network with United. So, those are the accounts we\u2019ve already knocked down their doors, we have shared with them the great news that we\u2019re going to be in network starting January 1. We have worked on what we need to do of anything in terms of IT integration, we get those orders in-house and those will come to us early in 2019. ","Those types of customers. The second group of customers that I\u2019ll broadly put in this category is that might have multiple laboratories, and our job is to make sure we gain share. And given the access that we have starting in 2019, which is really remarkably better, we believe there is also an equal opportunity for us to gain share beyond those great customers we have for all customers to pick up share. Particularly some of the large states we\u2019ve talked about this, when you look at Florida, Texas, California, New York, our access is going to be north of 95%. So, great access in the marketplace, great value proposition or quality service, and also pricing, we believe we have an opportunity to pick up share in those accounts.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. One, first on housekeeping, if I missed it, my apologies, but what is the all-in organic revenue growth number for the quarter and the specific contribution from M&A?","Mark Guinan","So, the revenue growth was pretty much all M&A in the quarter.","Derik de Bruin","Got it. Okay. And if you \u2013 two follow-up questions, I guess, did your volumes get effected this quarter by some seasonality and consumer genomics testing? I know that\u2019s been a tailwind for the business, I know there is some \u2013 this is a weak quarter for that one and then follow-up on that one is going to be just on deal valuations, are things coming in? Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Yes, so we didn\u2019t experience any meaningful change, due to seasonality in the quarter around genetic testing. And then, sorry your second question Derik?","Derik de Bruin","Basically, just valuations on deals in the fact that people \u2013 people are they getting involved a more bit attractive?","Mark Guinan","Yes. No, I think the valuations really haven\u2019t changed materially. Obviously, you\u2019ve got to price in the PAMA headwinds. Although, we are hopeful that we can positively impact that at this point. More pricing things as if those PAMA cuts will happen, that\u2019s the way we are valuing things. So, therefore, if anything, valuations have come down, and the seller, or potential seller recognizes that as well.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, just, I believe your question is around consumer genetics. Just to remind everyone, we do have a relationship with Ancestry and we provide a genotyping for their ethnicity offering. It\u2019s a modest portion of our business and continue to get growth, but it is modest for us. We\u2019re optimistic about the opportunities with the Ancestry because we still believe it is an opportunity for us to work together with that around building awareness overall, around the importance that everyone knowing our family health history, and that\u2019s an opportunity for the future, but just with the context, in terms consumer generic testing it is a small portion of business with modest growth this quarter.","Shawn Bevec ","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Hi, thanks. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the volume commentary, so I think you mentioned that it was around 70 basis points when you excluded M&A, how much did weather contribute to the year-over-year growth? And I guess just my math would suggest the underlying utilization was down year-over-year? I know you have talked about some of the issues, but what\u2019s your level of conviction that that can improve in the fourth quarter into 2019?","Mark Guinan","So, most of the fourth quarter \u2018improvement\u2019 is really coming from the M&A we did, so that\u2019s giving us some lift. We don\u2019t expect a step change improvement in utilization what we call same account volumes. And then in terms of weather, we have some impact, but it wasn\u2019t material enough to call out, but certainly it was a slight headwind to us in the quarter.","Jack Meehan","Sorry, weather was a headwind?","Mark Guinan","Sorry, I was talking about the hurricanes this year. So, we talked about the fact that versus last year we had a favorable compare, I thought you were asking us weather the hurricanes that took place in Carolinas in the third quarter were significant factors? So, we did call out that we had a favorable compare and it was about 150 basis points in the quarter, but there was a slight negative impact this year from hurricanes in 2018.","Jack Meehan","Great, and then just as my follow-up, I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit more on your pricing comments at the end of the script Mark? Can understand the PAMA stepping up, but the 150 basis points beyond PAMA, I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about 100 bips normal unit price, is that 50 bips kind of incremental related to United and then as you size it all up just do you think mid-to-high single digit earnings growth is doable for 2019?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, the 50-basis point isn\u2019t tied directly to the United, but certainly directionally United is one of the major drivers there, and I\u2019m sure you are familiar with the way pricing works. So, we had significantly higher reimbursement from United as an out of network provider than what typical in-network takes on and what we negotiated with United. So, yes that\u2019s a big driver, but it\u2019s not entirely United. And at this point, I\u2019m not going to give any guidance for 2019.","So, what I will reconfirm is that the Investor Day outlook that we provided of having a 3% to 5% topline CAGR, and a mid-to-high single digits EPS CAGR from 2017 through 2020, we still stand by that. Obviously, we have got one full-year and three quarters of a year behind us and when you look at our guidance, it so puts us within that range and so what we\u2019re saying is that we work through the next two years. We are certainly still confident that we can deliver within that CAGR range without giving any specific guidance for a given year.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Just to reiterate, we will grow topline and bottom line in 2019. We have said that. What we have also said is that, the M&A that we have already shared will get us to comfortably in that 1% to 2% growth in 2019 and when you couple that with the United opportunity that we\u2019ve speaking about gives us confidence on our ability to say, yes, we will grow top and bottom line next year.","Jack Meehan ","Thank you, Steve.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi Bill, good morning.","Bill Quirk","Good morning. First question, Mark, just not to beat a dead horse here on 150 basis points that you signaled for 2019, but is any of that related to additional plans kind of following or trying to follow some of the PAMA rates down, I know historically you\u2019ve indicated that you don\u2019t have a lot of contracts that are tied to Medicare, but just trying to tease any nuances out here?","Mark Guinan","No, it isn\u2019t. There are some small changes in some Medicaid rates that states have made, specifically Ohio. I mean, you can argue whether that was in any way related to PAMA. I think they actually had a budget issues, they wanted to fund some Women\u2019s Health initiatives and they slammed the laboratory reimbursement rates. There certainly was some dialogue around where Medicare was going in some of the states, if not many of them look at Medicare as a signal for where the Medicaid rates should be, but in terms of commercial plans, no, there isn\u2019t any incremental headwinds because the commercial plans are trying to take advantage of PAMA. ","In fact, as we have shared the dialogue we\u2019ve been having with the commercial plans as they see that as an issue for them because the more pressure we get from other sources, the more we need to get from them, and therefore it\u2019s in their own best interest not to see that because they know in the next collection period that the potential recalculation could be even more severe if we give lower commercial rights. And so, they are very sensitized to that and I can assure you that we are holding very firm in those discussions and make sure that they understand the world where you have a significant difference between commercial rates and government, and certainly Medicare rates is going to go away.","The whole intent of PAMA is to move go rates to a market type rate, which says that we need to talk about other ways to create value beyond price and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Increasingly, we\u2019re walking in and talking about all the other ways we differentiate ourselves positively, but then I fully appreciate and then some of the things that Steve highlighted in his remarks, around the patient experience, the technology we\u2019re putting in our patient service centers, the ability to build a relationship through the MyQuest app schedule appointments make things easier. Because at the end of the day, the payers want their patients to get appropriate necessary testing done, and so therefore that\u2019s definitely a good thing. It\u2019s also our data the way we feed data and the more critical mass we have the easier it is one them to do the analytics in a world where data is increasingly important for population management. ","So, there is a lot of ways that we talk about our value proposition. And then finally it is as Steve mentioned or where they recognized that they have a cost curve. They need to start working with the best value providers and certainly will want those and starting to move volume as a high cost less attractive value providers into the better laboratories and that\u2019s the way they are really going to save money and drive better value for their members versus continuing to look to extract price out of those who already have the best prices in the market. ","Bill Quirk","Got it. Thank you.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi, good morning and thank you for all the details. So, one question that I have, if we go back Steve to your comments about the UnitedHealthcare converting from out of network high price to in network lower price, I think something that would be very, very helpful for us is we think about the opportunity next year in longer term, if you can give us some sense of your share as an out of network provider with United ?And I understand that you might not be able to give us the United data, maybe some sort of a framework for us to think about, what type of share do labs typically have in an out of network relationship?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so let me do this. I remind many of you on this call of what we talked about of the opportunity we see with the United, which if you go back and you recall, we\u2019ve talked about the opportunities that many of the health plans see, it is by working with one of the nationals as ourselves we can do a better job of helping them reduce their laboratory cost. And what we talked about with the United define the opportunity in front of us is, we have talked about Untied estimates that they spend anywhere from $7 billion to $8 billion in laboratory spend a year, and most people have estimated that the nationals maybe providing about a billion of that. ","So, therefore, there is a big opportunity as they think about how they do a different job and a better job of serving their membership with Quest and at least one other national provider to reduce that spend. So, when you look at that 1 billion versus the 7 billion or 8 billion you see the opportunity in front of us. And the biggest opportunity in the short run is, as I said earlier is to go after those great Quest accounts, we will do that early, but this is why we believe that this affords us a nice growth opportunity, not just for 2019, but for 2020 and 2021 because it\u2019s going to take some time to gain that share and move that work away from the more expensive labs, and this is true for United, but I will also argue, we will be doing this with other health plans as well. So, it\u2019s an opportunity to continue to pick up share.","So, we will again be coming back together in November, we'll help \u2013 provide more visibility to what we believe the opportunity would be within reason, but hopefully at least those remarks will help you kind of size the opportunity in front of us given where we sit today.","Mark Guinan","And Ricky, it's a little more complicated being with United and Quest because we had some in network volumes. So, as we shared historically, in our pathology business, we had a couple of states that have been in in-network. And then obviously if you're trying to look at a model for out of network labs' share within large national payers, the fact that it's such a strong business of United a decade ago, we never lost all of that because of the loyalty of some of the providers, and the fact that they could look even out of network, our prices were still better than hospitals and many others.","So, it's a little bit different than if you want to look at other payers and say, hey, how much volume is there out of network. I think Quest had a disproportionate share of volume relative to what other labs might have out of network, but it's still not huge because you are an out of network provider, certainly when they have only insured patients, we don't get paid at all. So, it's really only their administered plans when they have out-of-network benefits where it makes sense for us to keep that volume and continue to try to compete.","Ricky Goldwasser","Understood. So, just as a follow-up, and I understand that you had more share than a typical out of network, but it would be really helpful for us if you can give us a data point for a typical out of network is, at least it will help us establish a floor from which you can build on. That's one. And then the second question that I had is regarding the acquisitions, can you remind us how long does it take for an acquisition to reach company margin? And if you can quantify what was the negative impact on margin from acquisition integration?","Mark Guinan","So, let me answer the acquisition question. We've shared in the past 12 to 18 months. I'd say on the outreach purchases, they tend to happen a lot more quickly. They're more simple and straightforward. It's really just integrating them into our local laboratory, and then the cost of serving those patients is basically the cost of serving all the other patients we currently do in those markets. So, those might even happen a little quicker in the 6 to 12-month window. And some of these other, I'll call them technology acquisitions, and that could involve site shutdown, it could involve moving the test menu to multiple locations. ","Obviously, it's working through the sales force issues, reimbursement issues and so on and so forth. So, those tend to be on the longer end, and you'll notice that number of the deals that we did in the latter part of 2017 were more like that as opposed to outreach purchases. So, we take a little bit longer. And then on the volume question, Ricky, I know you'd like some great specificity. All I can share is that typically there is a tiny share for an out of network lab in terms of their share of volume within a national payer and we were not tiny, but we certainly were not large.","Steve Rusckowski","And just on the acquisition, remember, we had this feathering going on that we have a nice slug of acquisitions in 2018. We're again giving you some perspective on the outlook that we have for 2019. The acquisitions would definitely be in that 1% to 2%. Those 2018 acquisitions, another year under their belt, 2019 where we get some of the integration done that helps us, and you layer that on top of the new acquisitions we bring in 2019. But we're hopeful we have a more regular cadence around that 1% to 2% that you already see in our numbers. So, as they come in, they take some time to mature with the integration coupled with the ones that are just showing up, that's already in our numbers for past years as well.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Lisa.","Mark Guinan","Good morning, Lisa.","Steve Rusckowski","Lisa, we can't hear you.","Lisa Gill","Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Thank you for all the detail. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. You've talked a lot about revenue growth as we think about 2019, you talked about having EPS growth. When we think about some of the efficiency gains that you think about in 2019 and beyond, how does the retail strategy fit into that? Can you remind us if that is more economically better for Quest versus your own patient service centers? And two, are you seeing incremental test volume through that? I just want to better understand how you're thinking about the retail setting as we think about 2019, 2020 and beyond.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So, what we said about the retail strategy, it's a better location in these sites. So, it serves our patients in the market better and therefore it's beneficial to the patients, it's beneficial to our employees, and our partners. In one case, it's Safeway; in the other case, it's Walmart are happy as well. Now, with all that, we've shared in the past, from a rent perspective, the cost of using that space, there is not a big difference between the two. ","However, we're getting much better space. Many of our patient service centers that we could collapse or patient service centers with one or two phlebotomists. This affords us an opportunity to take down those locations and put them into a better location, and that's better again for all stakeholders. And so, it's not a cost savings, but what it provides us is a better quality and better patient experience. And what I said in my remarks, what we do now have enough data points where we look six months of what we close versus what we open, we believe the volumes are better in those locations. ","So, it is positive financially for us and it's one of the ingredients of us gaining share. Now, we said, again, this is for our core business. We also believe this is an opportunity for us, particularly with the Walmart JV to tag on to those physical locations more healthcare services that we'll be working with Walmart, with local partners to be able to bend the cost curve for whatever partner we're working with. So that just affords us another opportunity beyond our core diagnostic service business. So, hopefully that's helpful.","Mark Guinan","Yes. And just to add, we have shared in the past that in Safeway, because we've leveraged some of the overhead, there is some cost savings, the greatest cost is the phlebotomists and that doesn't change when we go into a retail setting, but there is some cost savings despite the fact that the rents generally is somewhat comparable, smaller space, higher rates for more attractive market, but the overall footprint costs us relatively the same. But this is a business with small details. So, little bit of cost savings combined with, as Steve mentioned, some volume upside certainly can make a difference, especially as we continue to expand. And then Walmart is a JV.","So, it is different. It's not just putting a phlebotomist draw center within a retail outlet versus one of our independent patient service centers, and what we are starting with phlebotomy, we are definitely intending to add more healthcare services together with Walmart to build their presence within the healthcare. And it is a JV. So, therefore we've got a majority position to who are going to be sharing the economic value creation of that venture with Walmart.","Shawn Bevec ","Operator, next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Donald Hooker","Great. Yes. I'll just ask one real quick question here. Maybe just a little bit more elaboration on the M&A environment. I know you guys target 100 to 200 basis points of inorganic growth annually. It sounded like from your comments, just to clarify, you are already there for next year. And we still have obviously a lot of time. So, maybe kind of an update on your acquisition pipeline. Is there potential for you to potentially exceed that 200 basis points of growth next year? Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski ","Yes. So, what we said is what we've announced so far, puts us in that 1% to 2%, which, you know it is a good place to be at this point. We also said that given the environment and given the pressure that we see on hospital outreach operations, we think that's a catalyst to afford us a nice pipeline. We just announced another deal of buying an outreach business this week, an outreach activity called out of the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan, and there will be more to come. So, yes, we will share this point 1% to 2%. We're comfortably there for next year, but we do have a funnel that can add to that going into 2019.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Hynes","Good morning. Hi. So, two quick questions. One, obviously in 2019, you said you expect top line in EPS growth and that is in the face of 200 basis points of, I guess, incremental pricing pressure. Can you let us know how much market share gain from the UNH contract and some of the Aetna loss you're assuming in that to get to that? And I guess my second question would be around cash flow and share repurchase. Obviously, your stock is very weak today, but it's been down since the last earnings when you had to reduce guidance slightly. You have a great balance, you did enhance cash flow. I guess, at what point will you go into the market and do some incremental share repurchase? Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Sure, Ann. So, first off, let me clarify. We don't have an incremental 250 basis points of price going into next year. What we talked about was a total of 250 versus something that's more in the lines of 150 this year. So, I want to make sure that I'm clear on that. And about 50 basis points of the increased pricing pressure is PAMA related and the other 50 basis points related to other things.","In terms of share, obviously we don't get into that level of detail. We're very cognizant of the need to retain our Aetna business. We've got people who have been actively working for the last several months. We continue to work to make sure that we serve those customers appropriately and we retain as much of that Aetna business as possible and certainly have United, as we mentioned earlier. We're very excited about the opportunity. Steve mentioned, we expect that in some of these very loyalist accounts who would be sending us to United, if we were in network and would have been sending it to us, we'll flip very quickly.","There are those accounts that have multiple providers and we believe together with our value proposition, all the things we've walked through, which does differentiate us from almost all the other providers in a meaningful way around the patient experience, with our app, with certainly the pricing transparency, which is a huge win-win for the physician and the patients to be able to go into one of our draw centers at no upfront, whether something is covered and how much of cost, it\u2019s just there aren't many labs that can do that. And therefore the \u2013argument around simplicity, why we want to do business with multiple labs, you got five or six labs you're sending work through today, we could do almost all that if not all of that, we've got more lives covered in a given geography.","So, you don't have to worry about problems with the patients for the high cost out of network work. And we think that's pretty compelling, but that's not going to happen as quickly as the first piece. And then obviously the third piece is where we don't have business today. So, now we feel very strong with that same value proposition that we can go in and we can compete more strongly than we could have in the past and flip some of those accounts where we may not have any or very much work at all. So, that's going to take even longer. So, this is a multi-year growth opportunity. It's not all about 2019, and we have plans in place and we have strategies to go after each of those, and we're working hard to make sure that that all comes. So, certainly excited about that and very confident about that.","Shawn Bevec","And just to clarify, that incremental 50 basis points of price pressure next year outside of PAMA, that's primarily going to be coming from the United price headwinds.","Ann Hynes","Okay. So, the total incremental is 50 or 100?","Steve Rusckowski","100.","Shawn Bevec","50 from PAMA and 50 from primarily United.","Ann Hynes","Okay. And just on share repurchase question, please.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, obviously I can't talk about any specific plans around share repurchases, but given the fact that we have announced and are closing a number of transactions this quarter, we're going to be spending a fair amount of cash on those deals and we certainly are excited about the pipeline coming up. So, at this point, we haven't announced anything specific. We'll continue to follow our strategy, which says with half of our free cash flow that's not committed to our shareholders every year, we're going to make situational decisions depending on the M&A opportunities and the attractiveness of those returns versus share repurchases.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut","Hi, good morning. Mark, just a quick question on United. Thanks for all that color. So, as we think about 2019, putting it all together, out of network, going in network and then the volume expectations that you have in the ramp, is United a net positive revenue contributor in 2019?","Mark Guinan","Yeah, absolutely.","Brian Tanquilut","Okay. Got it. Alright. Thank you.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Hi, guys. Just \u2026","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Kevin Ellich","With the strong M&A pipeline, hi Steve, given what you've done, do you have any, I guess, strategic focus at things that you'd like to add, Steve as we think about your pipeline?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah. Continue with what we've been focused on. One is, the opportunity to run hospital outreach. We think it's a \u2013 of course it's a nice opportunity to continue to consolidate the market and we do believe that we'll continue to build. And as I said, we just announced another deal this week. Number two, you saw that we just announced a number of acquisitions that afford us new capabilities. The Immunotec acquisition gives us blood tuberculosis testing capability with tick-borne capabilities. That was a nice add. ReproSource gives us nice women's health capability and then we also talk about PhenoPath up in the Pacific Northwest that has some capabilities around pathology and molecular. So, we'll always look for new capabilities.","And then the third piece is, there's still regional laboratories that we believe we are going to have difficult times than \u2013 more difficult time than hospital outreach, and you'll see some regional opportunities. So, if you look back in the last five years and you look at the acquisitions, they fit in those three categories. There's been ebbs and flows of each of the three, but generally, that's what we continue to look and they're all strategically aligned to what we do and we have to have a path to value creation and hopefully you agree with us that we've built up credibility around that. So, we will continue to work on that and go into next year. We already hit that 1% to 2%, and we've got a nice funnel to continue to pursue ideas that we can make money of.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Just one final one on the UnitedHealth volume opportunity. I think previously you talked about some potential increased volumes flipping into 2018. Is that something you're contemplating in your guidance for the year or no?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, there is certainly some early transitions. It's not significant enough to call out, but I didn't want you to think we're waiving on everything till January 1. So yes, we absolutely already have some accounts that have moved and some accounts that are committing to move, but at this point, it's still relatively small.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Thank you.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.","Eric Coldwell","Hi, thanks. Most of mine have been covered, but there is one in your footnotes, which is, obviously M&A is a big piece of the call today and I'm seeing that you're writing off the fair value contingent consideration on MedXM. I'm just curious if we can get an update on that acquisition and then maybe just kind of a broader swath on how other acquisitions have been doing. You've announced quite a few here in the last few months. Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Sure. So, we're happy with MedXM. As I'm sure you're familiar, the reason you put in an earnout into a deal was when the buyer and the seller have markedly different views of the potential, it's one way to get two transactions coined that shares the risk appropriately. So, at this point, not quite 9 months into the acquisition, we feel from an accounting standpoint that it's highly unlikely to pay out the earnout. That doesn't mean that we haven't achieved what we were expecting to achieve.","It just means that the seller had a very different view of where that might go. And so that's all you should read into there. We're very happy with MedXM thus far. It's been a great addition to our portfolio, and I can tell you that as we're talking to payers about our laboratory testing, this is another opportunity to talk to them about ways that we can really help them beyond just the laboratory testing we're doing with great reach and population health and so on. So, it's another point why they want to do business with Quest.","Eric Coldwell","That's great. Thanks very much.","Steve Rusckowski","Okay. I think we've handled all the questions. We thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your support. You have a great day and hope to see many of you at our Investor Day in November.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics third quarter 2018 conference call.

I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures.

Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now here's Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates on our 2017 guidance. We began 2017 with a strong first quarter across the board drawing revenues, EPS, operating income, margins and operating cash flow.","Here are some of the key highlights -- revenues were up approximately 2% on a reported basis and 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS of $1.16 increased 63% in 2016. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 18% to $1.33 which includes $0.11 of excess tax benefit associated with the employee stock-based compensation; more on this later from Mark.","Cash from operations increased 28% to $196 million. Now before I describe the progress we've made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, I would like to briefly discuss PAMA. CMS postponed the deadline for labs to report private commercial payer pricing data under PAMA for 60 days until May 30. We fully support the decision. However, we continue to have some concerns about the current definition of applicable laboratory, which are those laboratories per quarter to report private commercial payer data.","According to the office of Inspector General's analysis, the current definition of applicable laboratory would cover only 5% of laboratories, representing only 69% of Medicare payments for lab test in 2015. While we support reform of Medicare payment system, we believe any modification should be market-based and appropriately include all applicable independent and hospital outreach laboratories.","Now let's review progress we've made. As we detailed at our Investor Day at November, our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We grew revenue in the quarter empowered by continuing to expand relationships with hospital health systems. Our existing professional lab services relationships including RWJ Barnabas in New Jersey, HCA in Denver and most recently, Montefiore in New York City are performing better than expected and our pipeline for new relationships remains strong.","So in the first quarter we announced the acquisition of an outreach operation of PeaceHealth Laboratories and expect to close in the second quarter. In addition after the close, we will execute a professional laboratory services agreement to manage 11 PeaceHealth Laboratories serving medical centers in three states in the Pacific Northwest.","We are hardening with health plans to improve the patient experience by improving price transparency which will also reduce bad debt. Our real-time payment determination which we begin piloting in early 2016 enables us to get patients an accurate picture of their financial responsibility or lab testing while those patients to pay at the point-of-care. We are currently live with Aetna, Highmark, UPMC, Florida Blue, and we expect to have more payers in place by the end of the year. The service benefits Quest and the entire healthcare systems; patients, providers and payers.","Avis [ph] Diagnostics which generally includes our genetic and molecular based test grew in the quarter along with non-routine testing. Major drivers included neo-natal genetic carrier screening, prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C and QuantiFERON TB testing.","In the quarter we also announced the launch of the new test service that helps physicians evaluate the patient's response to the drug therapy used to treat infection with hepatitis B virus, HBV; this is the first test of its kind available in the United States. Physicians can use it to tailor more effective treatments for up to 2.2 million individuals infected with HBV.","We're also making progress executing our strategy through provider-of-choice for consumers. In late January, we began providing genotyping for ancestor DNA, a service that today identifies and quantifies individual's ethnic origin based on results of DNA testing. We are pleased with the initial execution of this program and look forward to building on a relationship with ancestors. We continue to expand our relationship with SafeLink that are now operating at 65 stores. Consumer and employee satisfaction remain high and we are on-track to open a total of 200-patient service centers and Safeway stores by the end of 2017.","We continue to drive operational excellence and remain on-track to deliver $1.3 billion of run rate savings as we exit 2017. Our revenue services partnership with Optum is on-track in helping us to drive down bad debt and denials. As we have often said, quality and efficiency go hand-in-hand. We continue at near Six Sigma levels of many areas and in the quarter of mid year-over-year gains and many quality measures including reduced patient service center wait times and approved test turnaround times.","We expect our commitments to enable our processes will deliver results. We expect to cut paper acquisitions by 50% by the end of 2017. It will enable patients to check-in electronically at roughly half of our patient service centers by the end of the year. Additionally, we expect our lab systems to be 85% standardized by the end of the year. We received some meaningful recognition in the quarter, once again being named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine. Quest was one of only six companies in healthcare, pharmacy and other services industry and the only diagnostic information services company to attain most admired status.","Looking forward to the remainder of 2017, we are well-positioned to continue to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We have the right strategy and the right team to execute and create value for our shareholders.","Now, let me turn it over to Mark who will take us through our financial performance in detail. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were up 1.9% versus the prior year on reported basis while equivalent revenues grew 3%. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 3.2% compared to the prior year. Most of this growth was organic with approximately 90 basis points attributed to the 2016 acquisition of Clinical Laboratory Partners. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 3.5% versus the prior year, of which 2.6% was organic. The year-over-year impact of weather was negligible in the quarter.","Revenue per requisition in the first quarter decreased by 20 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue-per-req is not a proxy for price, it includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req. Unit price headwinds in the first quarter continue to be moderate in less than 100 basis points. We note that price fluctuations can vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain consistent with the last few years. Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our POS partnerships, other mix elements including test and fair mix contributed more than 1% to revenue-per-req in the quarter.","Reported operating income for the quarter was $279 million or 14.7% of revenues compared to $257 million or 13.8% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $297 million or 15.6% of revenues, compared to $281 million or 15.1% of revenues last year. Please keep in mind our focused diagnostics products business contribute approximately $8 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact to focused, adjusted operating income would have grown approximately 9% and adjusted operating margin would have increased 80 basis points year-over-year, consisting of 30 basis point of operating margin tied to focused in 50 basis point of adjusted operating margin growth.","Reported EPS was $1.16 in the quarter, compared to $0.71 a year ago. The prior year a quarter included a charge of $30 million after tax or $0.21 per diluted share related to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted EPS was $1.33, up 18% from $1.13 last year. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $11 million in the first quarter or $0.08 per diluted share, representing restructuring and integration cost. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 32%, compared to approximately 39% last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was a result of $16 million or $0.11 per share in excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, compared to a $2 million or $0.01 per share benefit last year.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.4%, 20 basis points better year-over-year, but 80 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, bad debt expense rate typically increases sequentially in the first quarter due to the reset of payings in health insurance deductibles at the beginning of the year. As in the prior years, we expect the bad debt rate to improve gradually throughout the year. Note that the year-over-year compare was also negatively impacted by the fact that our products business had a lower associated bad debt rate.","Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $196 million versus $153 million last year. Recall the retirement of debt lowered our operating cash flow by approximately $47 million during the first quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $42 million, compared to $47 million a year ago.","Now turning to guidance. We are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenues unchanged to be between $7.64 billion and $7.72 billion, an increase of 1.7% to 2.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.73 and $4.88 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.45 and $5.60. Cash provided by operations is also unchanged and remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and finally, capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million.","Our increased EPS guidance reflects the higher expected level of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and was included in our previous guidance. Note that our original EPS guidance assumed a similar benefit in 2017 as we recognize in 2016 for the full year which was about $0.06. As you are well aware, our share price appreciated substantially in 2016, which yielded a significantly higher tax benefit in Q1 2017 based on equity vesting and auction exercises. Our updated reported and diluted EPS guidance for 2017 assumes another $0.03 of benefit over the remainder of the year. However, fluctuations on our shared price and auction exercise activity could add volatility to this figure.","Going forward, we would expect to experience some level of excess benefit over the next several years. However, the time frame and absolute benefit is difficult to forecast given its dependence on our share price and the timing of option exercises. Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we delivered strong growth across the board in the first quarter with gains and revenues margins, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow. Our agreement with PeaceHealth will further booster our growth later in the year and we are laser-focused on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and to drive operational excellence.","I'd like to now open up for any questions you might have. Operator, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, sir.","Ross Muken","Good morning, gentlemen and congrats. Underlying organic volume, I know you called out a few other pieces, but certainly better than we would have suspected, even given that relatively to what we've seen in general on volumes across the market. So maybe could you help us understand how much some of those entities you called out sort of contributed to the strain versus sort of underlying market, and how you're thinking about the pacing for the remainder of the year given what's implied. ","Stephen Rusckowski","You know, so thanks, Ross, certain I'll start and Mark will add to that. Sure, first of all we're off to a good start, we're pleased with our first quarter performance here. Yes, there's up a number of elements that contributed to the growth in the first quarter, we highlighted some of those in our script. First of all we do believe that will continue to get growth from our professional lab services work that we're doing. We saw some growth from that. Second is we continue to get nice growth from our advanced diagnostics portfolio and some of the more advance, what is typically referred to as esoteric testing that we do would call about some of those, and we've mentioned in the past the prescription drug monitoring and the work we're doing with the TV coiffure opportunities drive serious growth for us. ","We also got some nice growth through some other areas of the business, like our Wellness business, some or other -- some of our other services business. Across the board good balance growth consistent with our strategy that we had to focus at hospitals. That focus on our clinical franchises and bring new products to the marketplace to commercialize those better than we have in the past. And finally just good execution across the board. So let me turn over to Mark, to give some color round this and throughout the rest of the year.","Mark Guinan","Sure, thanks for the question, Ross. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks we got about 90 basis points in volume and revenue from M&A, largely that was CLP, work lapping CLP at the end of the first quarter, so we no longer have in that a tail wind. Part of this pretty largely ramped up so that annualize in the first quarter as well. So those are behind us in terms of strong year-over-year drivers of growth.","Now what we do have in front of us is continued ramp up of HCA, we are just in the early stages of Montefiore, and then obviously we announced Peacehealth which has an outreach element and also in professional laboratory services element that we expect to execute have not close that yet. When we give our original guidance 2% to 3% to the global in growth. The only M&A included in that was CLP because that been executed, and while we are very optimistic about the closing piece and there's the heat pipeline of other potential M&A opportunities. Given the fact that we got a pretty broad range of 100 basis points in the work, cautiously optimistic after the first quarter we didn't feel this point compelled to change our revenue guidance yet. ","Ross Muken","Thanks, and maybe just a quick update on sort of how the Optum relationship that sort of progressing and any further thought, obviously a lot of market chatter or at least financial community chatter on sort of that relationship as a whole and just maybe talk about how you're thinking about obviously the longstanding relationship with the United. ","Stephen Rusckowski","First of all it is going well, we announce it in the fourth quarter of last year. And a big component of it is what we're going round revenue cycle management and our billing operations and as a I said in our opening remarks it's going very well, we're pleased with that. Like you said this is a relationship so there is multiple areas beyond what we're doing around billing, we continue to build on that relationship and it's -- it's going well as well. We have a good relationship around our wellness business, we are their partner for wellness along with other -- other partners that we sell-through. ","Second is we continue to work with them on what we do with clients around data and population health and if you think about what we're doing with our professional laboratory services business, we're calling on the same people that are trying to become more efficient and better in delivering integrated delivery system and so that areas is promising as well; so often good start, doing what we said what we would do and the relationship will only get stronger overtime.","Ross Muken","Great, congrats again, guys.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. I was hoping you could comment further on the yield pipeline whether you're seeing any increased competition for yields of hospital outreach programs or otherwise, and whether you expect that the impact of PAMA timing whether that changes at all would impact the yield pipeline? Thank you. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you. First of all the pipeline as we said is the support of our long-term goal of 1% to 2% of growth through acquisitions; we're hopeful about that going forward. As far as competition -- I would say the competition is stable versus what we've seen in the past. And finally is in regards to the PAMA, I think PAMA in general is changed that some would argue -- could look more catalyst in hospital outreached business as considered their strategy going forward. So when we engage with hospital systems run their lab strategy, many CEOs that are engaged with do understand that both the commercial rates as well as the clinical lab fees schedule rates will be under pressure. And this is one of the considerations that they think about as far as potentially selling their business or partnering with us in their business going forward.","So if in fact there is some price pressure related to the refresh of the clinical fee reschedule that could be a further catalyst to accelerate some of this going forward but as you know, PAMA -- the data submission has been postponed by 60 days, we're still believing based on what they've told us so far that they are committed to trying to refresh the clinical lab fee scheduled by the beginning of '18 but we'll see on that. But there is another fact that we think is helping us with our discussions with hospital systems around their lab strategy.","Mark Guinan","So if I could just add two pieces of color to that Dan, one is that -- recall that when Medicare changes reimbursements we're equally impacted. So the buyer and seller are both equally impacted in terms of the value. If they get credit from commercial rates that doesn't matter to us, it doesn't change our evaluation because obviously we value it as our own commercial reimbursement. So while it might be more of a catalyst, it also reduces the value to both the buyer and the seller. And then in terms of competition, if you recall these outreach skills are largely cost synergy value creation opportunities, and so at any given outreach is likely to not be work the same to multiple competitors because it's highly dependent on where your laboratory is located, where your logistic routes are, where your patient services are currently located and there are geographical differences amongst any competitor who might be looking at purchasing an outreach.","So in term -- there is always -- you know, larger opportunity likely to be a couple of parties at the table but it's not an auction because quite frankly, we're going to value them differently because it's based on that the infrastructure.","Dan Leonard","All of that color is very helpful, thank you. Just one clarification, so if the update of the clinical lab fee schedule were postponed to 2019; would the deal funnel soften or is it not that directly linked?","Stephen Rusckowski","It's not that directly linked. I think it's a fact out there that CMS is looking at refreshing -- we couldn't let fee schedule as we often talked and so we get all the data, we don't know what's going to happen with that, but it's just a fact out there that is going to be pressure on rates. And therefore hospital CEOs are thinking about their options for outreach. ","Dan Leonard","Understood, thank you. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ricky Goldwasser","Hi, good morning and congratulations on a very good quarter. I have two questions; the first one on PAMA. I'm just trying to understand the product from your perspective; one, is there anything that you need to do in order to be prepared if PAMA were to be implemented in January on 2018? So how that uncertainty impact you? And then on PAMA you talked about the applicable lab definition; where is that -- what's the status of these conversations and did you quantify the impact? If you [indiscernible] changed for you and should we assume that if this is something that's really kind of like in process that -- that were to happen the January 2018 start date seems unlikely?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes, so thanks Ricky. Let me give you some color around PAMA, now first of all the data put in all the data has been pushed out for 60 days and yet, CMS still is holding to the goal of refreshing the clinical lab fee schedule by the beginning of 2018. Now with all that said, we just took two months of really tight schedule and the way this will work is they'll get all the data by the end of May - let's call it June. They have to work through that for four months in of which in those four months, two of those months are in the summer months and then publish their rates that they will look to comment on in the September timeframe. And then they'll publish upon the rates in the fourth quarter for that beginning of January 2018. So as you think through this, the two-month delay in data reporting clearly is putting pressure on the schedule and that's why people are saying, 'Okay even that they still have the goal, it's impossible that they can get there.' I'll share with you exactly what we're hearing, but there is more pressure on them to put that altogether.","Now with all that said, as trade association, we continue to be actively engaged with CMS. When we're down there for our annual meeting of UCLA several weeks ago, we've met with CMS. This is many members of our industry. They're very, very responsive to us, they listen to our concerns about data. Part of the response to see would postpone of the data collection is because we are engaged with them and we're also having discussions with them and members of congress about the definition of applicable laboratory. In the way CMS is implementing the approach right now is excluding a fair percentage of outreach which is a large portion of this market. So there will be another meeting next week with CMS and this is at the highest level CMS with [indiscernible] to talk about two issues; one is the timeframe and second is applicable laboratory. And we hope to engage as we've done so far as a trade association of being constructive and helpful to get the market-based approach right, which is the intent of the congress with this bill. We continue to work it with them.","You also need to understand that this also has the backdrop of them having a lot on their table in the number of positions across the board in HHS and CMS not being filled. We also know that they've got to work through a lot. I'm giving you some of the color, but we're actively working this trade association and we believe that by doing so, it's going to serve this industry well.","Mark Guinan","Rick, just to answer your specific question about is there anything we need to do to get ready, the answer is most of what we need to do is behind us. There is quite a bit of work to get the data together and we got it all together by the end of the first quarter when we needed to. Now, really what's in front of us is just once they publish the proposed rates, for us to take a look at it and obviously respond to that if appropriate and then as Steve mentioned, through our trade association, continue to push through what we think is appropriate, which is expanding the definition of an applicable lab. But there's not a lot of work per se between now and when everybody might decide to implement the new rates.","Stephen Rusckowski","And just to round this off, we also said in our Investor Day in the fall that if in fact it is implemented in 2018, given the size of this business for us, the effect it could have based upon some of the estimates that we're going to be able to absorb that, given the opportunities we have around operators [ph] going forward in normal course of running our business. That's our position. We believe it's already implied in our outlook that there could potentially be some reduction here, but we don't know for certain until we get all the data collected. But we're managing this proactively going forward and we'll see what happens.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. That is helpful. One other question just regarding the guidance, a question we received this morning. If you think about the guide, very nice leading the quarter and you had the text benefit, you raised by less than your feed. And I noted you said a little bit earlier in the year to change guidance, but is there anything that you see from operating lines, to the fact of the expense side that is making you wait for time being?","Mark Guinan","Well, Ricky, as I said earlier, it's just early in the year. We're cautiously optimistic, but its one quarter and obviously, we're optimistic, we're going to continue with strong performance. At this point, you're correct. The entire change in guidance reflected the excess tax benefit over and above what we have built into our original guidance. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now move to our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jack Meehan","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Jack.","Mark Guinan","Good morning.","Jack Meehan","I want to follow up on the volume side. Just even after you may call the adjustments around M&A and new business, leap day [ph], it appears there is a real step change in the first quarter for the underlying trend. Was there anything else worth flagging or the insourcing, outsourcing tug of war with hospitals? Have you seen any change just on that dynamic as well?","Mark Guinan","I don't think there's any step change in the environment. If anything, I think we've comment that utilization has improved directionally over a couple of quarters, so we are seeing some good signs in utilization. We've mentioned in the past that we monitor what we call our same source name account performance and certainly, we're seeing improvement in that over the last couple of quarters into the first quarter. These things can happen as well. We don't know whether that's a trend and it will continue, but in the first quarter, if there's anything I could point to outside of the things we talked about, certainly a lot of good deals we've done including things like Ancestry, et cetera are helping to drive some of that growth. I'd really say it's the utilization seem to be a little stronger than it was in the past year.","Stephen Rusckowski","And Jack, just to remind everyone, it's this the march we're on with growth. Back when we started with our strategy at 2012, we simply just restore growth and business that was shrinking organically. We have reduced that decline, we stabilized the business, we started to get some organic growth in '16 and our two strategy focus right now is number one, to accelerate growth. So what you see in Q1 is the continuation of that march of improvement and we believe a lot of the investments and capabilities and focus that we've put over the last several years is due to yield the results we expected. We're pleased with Q1. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, the results are a number of areas that led to the growth that you saw in Q1, but we believe we're off to a good start for the year.","Mark Guinan","And the only other thing I'd add is that the timing of Easter probably mitigated in some of the pack that we lost at the extra day from leap year last year, so it's hard to predict how much that's going to impact you because it's not consistent every single year, but definitely the calendar shift on the Easter into the second quarter certainly helped Q1.","Jack Meehan","Great. And then as my related follow up, one of your early scenes from earnings has been around payer mix, so I was wondering, have you seen any changes on the government side and just how that impacted the business in the quarter?","Stephen Rusckowski","Something notable, Mark?","Mark Guinan","No, there's nothing notable, Jack.","Jack Meehan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Mark Guinan","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Yes, sir. We will take our next question from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Amanda Murphy","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Amanda.","Amanda Murphy","Sorry. If I just snap one more on the volume side, just given all the comments because there's a lot of moving parts. But I just wanted to confirm. I thought one thing that PLS volumes, those would be done included in the 2.6% organic? Is that correct?","Stephen Rusckowski","That's correct.","Amanda Murphy","Okay. And then is there any way just thinking about all the different points you've made around PLS dynamic, Ancestry, et cetera, versus this basic underlying utilization? Can you quantify if you want those into two different buckets, sort of underlying utilization versus everything else in organic, what the impact was in the quarter from both of those sides?","Mark Guinan","Amanda, we've decided that we're not going to break out PLS every single quarter. What I did say at Investor Day was that I would expect over the three year period to 20 that we would get about 100 basis points of less from PLS would be our expectation. So we do have a deep pipeline. It's going to vary quarter-to-quarter, given the timing of deals and so on and so forth. We're not quite there yet, but we're building toward that, so we got some good solid growths from our new PLS businesses and over time, we're expecting a keg [ph] around 100 basis point lift, but we're not going to break it out every single quarter.","Amanda Murphy","Okay. So I'm going to count that as one. But thinking in one more, this -- just last slide, I guess I just had a question given your comments on the pipeline that you have and how strong it is? How you're thinking about forecasting or guidance this year? Just given PLS growth potential versus sort of the potential operating margin impact there, or is there a right way to think about the pipeline more like the 2018 benefit?","Mark Guinan","There are absolutely assumptions just like we would in winning accounts in our guidance for the year. We have to make some assumptions around how we're going to perform. So we've got a deep pipeline of PLS opportunities. Unlike anyone would, we do some sort of probability adjusting against that in terms of getting those complete, the timing and so on. So there's absolutely an element of PLS in that original 2% to 3% organic guidance that we gave on an equivalent basis and depending on how things progress, that's why we give a range. It could be slightly more or less than we assume, but we're confident enough to build in the guidance and then on M&A, just given the fact that that's a lot less in our control. We just thought the prudent thing would be not betting on the com and having any unexecuted M&A specifically in that guidance.","Again, the way I would encourage you to think about PLS is like winning a new account, a new hospital system for our core business, something we go out. It may not be quite as co-competitive because there's only a handful of labs that could actually perform the PLS deal, because it really takes economies of scale to drive that savings and quite often, these are so complicated, it's not even more than one part negotiation. It's just us alone talking to a hospital system. In summary, yes, we have some assumptions around our pipeline getting executed this year in that organic growth and we're very confident just like we've done in the past about our ability to hit that.","Stephen Rusckowski","Just to make sure it's clear, PLS, it is a business. We're managing a portfolio of professional laboratory services accounts and like for any business, these accounts are different stages of the revolution. In that business, we have a number of accounts that have been with us for some time and like with any business, you're managing those accounts to make sure you have a referable account going forward. That's in our base as well. Second is we're growing new accounts, they're turning on. There might be some more opportunities to expand it into other hospitals so we've got growth within the install base as well with some growing accounts and then we're bringing on board some new accounts.","So the highlights we've talked about at those new accounts, you put those three together and that has a business in its aggregate growing, but don't forget, we still have this install base of existing business that we could hear ourselves as well. We need to think about it as an existing business with managing accounts, growing accounts and then executing brand new accounts. But with all those three components, this is a growing business for us, it's a good business for us and it positions us nicely with integrated delivery systems.","Mark Guinan","Next question, operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice","Hello, everybody. I'd like to first just ask about the revenue cycle; a couple of aspects of revenue cycle management and issues. You talked about in your prepared remarks an issue around some payers like Aetna for better price transparency and that might help collect a co-pays in deductibles upfront. Can you give us the read on what your experience has been there and then you mentioned Optum obviously, once you go there on the revenue cycle management. I'm understanding if the benefits on the revenue cycle management were probably going to take two or three years to realize. Is that true? But there was also a cost-savings initiative of transference of employees over to them. Is that fully reflected in the first quarter results?","Stephen Rusckowski","Let me start. First of all, the relationship with Optum for revenue cycle management has three components. First of all, we believe by working together with them, we can continue to become better and more efficient in our building operations and the efficiency associated with that, A.J. is part of our $1.3 billion bigger rate savings and efficiency goal that we have. So this is parts of many programs we have to drive efficiency. So a portion of our results and a portion of our achievement against that goal will include what we're doing here. Second is we believe by getting smarter with them around the interaction between class and patients and payers, we can go a better job of bad debt and denials and specifically, they will help us with what we talk about as far as real-time adjudication with patients that we've mentioned, four [ph] payers that are initially working with us on that, but we expect with Optum's help, we could get some more. And then finally, it's just completing the data set and their relationship with payers in general we think will be helpful of getting paid both from a standard perspective of bad debt, but also with the denials associated with more advanced diagnostics. Mark, anything you like to add to that?","Mark Guinan","A.J., as we've shared before, we signed a 10-year agreement with them to manage our revenue cycle management and we do have commitments for them on cost savings to run that operation and yes, that started in Q1, but it gets feathered in over the life of the contract. And then the second element is Optum helping us reduce denials and bad debt as Steve mentioned. Although we started the real-time adjudication prior to the relationship, Optum is helping us to drive that faster and more deeply and maybe we could have done on our own. We feel very good about what they're doing and I can tell you that early on, we've seen a reduction in patient bad debt in the areas where we roll this out. So we're feeling good about it, we're seeing what we would expect. It's still early because at this point, it's largely just the patients who are engaging our patients service centers. We're working on solutions that will be available in obviously the change managements plan to roll it out in the physician office where about 60% of our volume comes from.","So today, it's really patient service centers moving in office phlebotomist and then eventually moving into the physician's office where ultimately we'll get the full benefit. But we're very encouraged and we're absolutely seeing a reduction in the rate of patient bad debt where we've rolled out this real time adjudication.","A.J. Rice","All right. And if I might ask you about one other initiative as my follow up. You said you're in 65 Safeway stores. Can you sort of update us, is this mostly having a benefit from the perspective of patients who are getting higher patient satisfaction? Are there other benefits to you and I know there has been on and off discussions with urgent care clinics, medic clinic type of entities. Is there any update about working with them for a similar type of program?","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks, A.J. Safeway relationship, we believe is the beginning of our consumer initiative working with retailers in a bigger way and part of this is around providing better access. We believe we have unparalleled access in the market, we're 2,200 patient service centers, we have 2,800 phlebotomist and physicians' offices, about 6,000 access points, but we believe some of these retailers we could be working with and safely as one had better locations and there is anywhere from 15% to 20% of laboratory requisition orders that go unfulfilled. So we're helpful by having better access. We're going to get more fulfilled requisitions and that's going to help our growth and also help some share if we have better access. We hope when a patient has a choice and who ask the question, 'who do you like to go to?' for their laboratory testing, that the patient will remember a better experience in a more convenient location for that experience and they'll choose Quest based upon our movement here. That's both growth, but also as you would expect as we start to come on board with some of these centers, we rationalize our presence in a zip code and we might shut down some of our smaller patient service centers and saves us some money as well. It's both growth and efficiency.","And we do continue to have relationships and we do continue to have pilots with some of the other players in this retail space. We continue to have UBS [ph] as the client and we're optimistic about other retailers as they continue to evolve their health strategy. They see it as a nice expansion from what they do today around pharmacy and also it helps these retailers for getting traffic into their stores as well. It's a multi-faceted program for us that directionally, we're very, very optimistic about and I think we're off to a great start.","Operator","We'll move next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Good morning. This is Alex Nolan [ph]. I got in for Bill today. I was just hoping if you could - good morning - when you're looking at deals for the future, I was wondering if you could just rank priorities. Between esoteric testing to gain access to different technology, looking at core testing labs to build geographic positions and then finally looking at hospital business partnerships. If you could just rank those three on what your priority is looking for doing a deal with one of those three in the future? That would be great.","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes. All that you mentioned are strategically in-lined with our direction. So we have for the last several years cleaned up our portfolio, we're entirely focused on diagnostic information services. Our first filter for any deal is does it fit into our scope of our strategy and from what you just mentioned all do. Second is we do believe that there's our growth strategies and we've outlined in the fall five areas that we're focused on for accelerating growth. One is related to partnering with hospital systems and so, the hospital average deal fits in that strategy as well. Second is to continue to invest in advance diagnostics and bringing new capabilities to the marketplace. So some of the potential acquisitions we could do there would fit there as well. As part of these priorities, what we have shared in the past is we continue to be very, very rigorous in making sure that if their strategically in-lined, that we have the thresholds we expect to make for our shareholders with any acquisition. I would say that's generally more of the cut we have is we're the strategic in-line where they fall out in terms of use of our cash and are they getting acceptable returns of invested capital, providing us with the growth we expect and at the same time, become accreted to earnings in a reasonable period of time. That's generally how we rack and stack acquisitions and it served us well so far. That fits into the strategy that we had or 1% to 2% growth of acquisitions.","As you can see from our prior acquisitions over the past four or five years, do you see all those categories and it's more of a matter of when that come in and when we can execute it and less to deal with the sorting of what we'd like more of a priority than others. But we haven't had the problem having not enough cash to execute things. We think we should do strategically and also that we think has a good return for our shareholders. So Mark, anything you like to add to that?","Mark Guinan","No, I think you covered it.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's very helpful and then just a quick follow up. Could you just remind us what the margin profile is of your hospital relationships and just comparing that to your core business? And then what's the opportunity to expand the margins in the hospital business? Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Right. When you say hospital relationships, that's multi-faceted. I think it might be specifically time about special laboratory services where we're actually serving them for the work that is not explicitly billable. So it's the laboratory work they have to perform in order to get paid under the DRG for inpatient outpatient et cetera. Those margins as we've shared are lower than our core, but double-digits. That's as explicit as we've been and then in terms of our relationship and that word is really important, when we have our relationship with a hospital and we do professional laboratory services, we typically get most - if not all of the reference work. So we've talked about the fact that we do reference work for half the hospital in the country. That is the high end at more esoteric type work, but either they are not able to, or have made a rational decision not to perform given limited size and scale, so there's a handful of people that do their work. We have the largest reference work at any laboratory.","So that's another part of our relationship with hospitals and then certainly the other part of the relationship is we've got other businesses that [indiscernible] hospitals their large employers, we've got our wellness business so we can help them keeping their population healthy. We've got some of our diagnostic tools that certainly can help them manage everything laboratory spend to benchmarking their clinical practice of utilization of diagnostic. So there's a lot involved in a relationship with a hospital, but specifically on the PLS, its double digits, but slightly lower than our core margin.","Stephen Rusckowski","Let me just underscore what Mark just said and remind you what we shared with you in the fall because it's important in our strategy in what we're doing every day. When we're talking about hospitals, it's about 60% of our market if we look at it and we have laid that out in three ways - one is what we could do to help them with their inpatient laboratory cost. These are cross centers that we could save the money. Number two, what Mark just went through as far as the reference testing, the advanced diagnostics to sell the hospital that they can't do themselves, they rely on laboratories like ourselves and then finally is outside of the hospital and some have outreach businesses, but they also are buying physicians and they're looking at serving geographic area and providing the laboratory services with those physicians that they now own or affiliate with.","So when we have a discussion, it just was last week with a very large integrated delivery system, their lab strategy includes all three. We talk about our relationship with hospitals, yes it's the inpatient laboratory but it's a holistic view of how we approach the marketplace in a much more progressive holistic view as they build integrated delivery system. S it's all three components when we approach the systems and it's serving us well as you see in our good start of the year.","Mark Guinan","And in fact, that PeaceHealth is a perfect example.","Stephen Rusckowski","Exactly.","Mark Guinan","So as we engage with PeaceHealth, the decision was made to sign with us on PLS deal, they are selling us their outreach and then obviously we have a reference relationship with them as well. Next question, Operator?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Donald [ph] with Seabanc [ph]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, I just have one question here. I'm really curious about this. I know it's new but this relationship with IBM. I realized it's new, but how that might play out on what you're seeing and experiencing with them around cognitive computing?","Mark Guinan","Yes, appreciate it. In our advanced diagnostics business, we have our oncology franchise and related to that, if you recall several years ago, we formed a relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering where we put together a product that's called OncoVantage. It's going to take some of their content, some of the research with 34 actionable genes. OncoVantage essentially is a product that delivers on precision. That is [indiscernible] oncology. And what we also realized with Memorial Sloan that we needed a cognitive computing partner. So we at this fall announced now teaming up the two of us with IBM and this is for IBM Health Watson. They are our cognitive computing partner. So collectively now, the threesome is going at the market and the opportunity in front of us is about 70% of oncology here is in community healthcare centers, not in large urban centers like what Memorial Sloan will be serving.","This is a big opportunity for us and we have our own dedicated sales force, it's backed up with a brand and the content from Memorial Sloan, but now when working with IBM, we believe that their sales force and their presence with integrated delivery systems and also just in general, public awareness of precision medicine in computing and healthcare is being helped by IBM. You might have seen some of the ads. They have been running and one of those specific ads that need to actually do highlight the work they're doing with us in Memorial Sloan in the field of cancer. So we think it's a step in the right direction and it's often running well.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. I didn't see that and I was just -- what would take a reasonable time frame to you at this relationship? How might it evolve? This is a year's process, I assume?","Stephen Rusckowski","We continue with all our partnerships, so this is the beginning. There's other things we could do with IBM. I'm not prepared to talk about that, but we believe all our partnerships start with something and they go from there.","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Don. Operator, last question please?","Operator","Yes. Our final question will come from Steven Valiquette with Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on these results. Thanks, good morning. Just a question around the PAMA cuts. My view is that if they are delayed beyond January of 2018, it would likely be in that positive request just because of this simple math of how it no longer potentially negatively impact the 2018 revenues. But as I'm talking with investors, I'm kind of surprised I keep getting this view by some that a PAMA cut delay could actually be a slight negative request and the thought pattern is that if the PAMA cuts themselves, we're to theoretically cause some lab provider competitors to either go out of business or want to exit the business, that would obviously help your volume gains and also help your M&A pipelines with PAMA cut delay would potentially delay these types of benefits. So I guess senses just keeps coming up in my discussions and just to have more of a full discussion around this with you guys, I mean how are you thinking about the net impact of the PAMA cut delay on your overall business for 2018?","Stephen Rusckowski","First of all, the refresh of the clinical lab fee schedule from PAMA -- I would just argue is a reality that's creating some catalyst on hospital systems; I must say all laboratories to consider their options going forward. And I would argue that as independent of whether any refresh takes place in 2018, 2019 or even 2020, it's just sitting there; that how they get paid for Medicare is being revisited and even though you've said that, its cuts is unclear on what the outcome will be until we gather all the data and we've talked about this before. Until we gather all the data, we don't have the visibility about the data, it's uncertain of what effect it would be. But we review that in general this review and the pressure that's on payment in general and we believe it's on the Medicare side with PAMA, but also on the commercial side is a good catalyst for us having these conversations with integrated delivery systems without the laboratories on the strategy going forward. So that's the first point I'd like to make.","The second is the goal is still 2018; obviously if that's postponed or delayed, and if in fact you had a negative consequence associated with how we get paid, it would be helpful in 2018. But right now we're assuming that what they tell us is what they're going to do and therefore 2018 is what we're assuming and we'll see if that does happen.","Mark Guinan","So while the other element, Steve, is that if it's delayed because they expand the definition of applicable lab, we would assume that's probably a positive for the industry and certainly for us; and I can assure you that when I laid out the view from 2020 in terms of the 3% to 5% top line growth and mid to high single digit bottom line growth, I was building in some level of COGS on the clinical lab fee schedule into our revenue growth assumptions, but that was not building in some sort of a steep change in the competitive environment where we were picking up significant volume because people couldn't survive in a world where Medicare cuts were made. So I would be cautious about assuming that we're hoping that cuts happen as large as possible, as quickly as possible; we certainly would not -- be disappointed if things get delayed.","Steven Valiquette","It's helpful. Well, just real quick housekeeping type question; you mentioned the Easter planning and how that could have helped 1Q '17 just on a year-over-year comparison. And some people have asked, could it actually be a little bit of a volume headwind in 2Q '17? I'm thinking about those year-over-year comps; is that worth flagging or am I just spending too much time thinking about how it is?","Mark Guinan","Well, it's absolutely all other things equal going to be a volume headwind in Q2, just like it helps us a little bit in Q1. But you know, there is so many factor that go in, it's just one element of growth in the second quarter. But if you're looking at -- if there is something in the second quarter that would be a headwind, yes, the fact that Easter is in the second quarter is something to factor in.","Stephen Rusckowski","Okay, we appreciate all the questions. Thanks again for joining the call. As you heard, we had a strong quarter and we're off to a solid start in 2017. We're looking forward to meeting your commitments by our two-point strategy which is to accelerate growth and to continue to drive operational excellence. We appreciate your support and you have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostic's first quarter 2017 conference call.

This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our 2017 guidance.","We finish the year on a high node. We grew revenues, operating income, margins, and operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, capping a strong year in which we achieved our commitments and created value for shareholders.","While Mark will take you through the fourth quarter, here are some key highlights for the full year 2016. Revenues were up 30 basis points on a reported basis and grew 2.6% on the equivalent basis. EPS was down 7.4% on reported basis, but grew 8% on an adjusted basis. And cash from operations increased 30% to $1.1 billion. 2016 was the third consecutive year of progress in delivering on our commitments and creating shareholder value.","Before I describe the progress we have made what I would like to do is to talk about a few dynamics impacting our industry. First, we are waiting to see what the new Congress administration decides to do with the Affordable Care Act.","As we said in the past we never realize the full benefit from ACA that we expected, so we wouldn\u2019t expect any significant near-term impact if it were to be use repealed. We hope that any potential alternative will be recognizes the value of diagnostic information services and healthcare.","Second, as you know CMS has begun to execute a process to re-flash its clinical laboratory fee schedule under PAMA. We are preparing to submit pricing data to the CMS later this quarter.","Now, having said that, we are working with our trade association to understand the impact on PAMA of our recent -- the recent pronouncements of Trump administration on regulatory review. Progress has also expressed its intent to act quickly on tax reform. We are closely monitoring developments and want to share the expected impact of potential changes.","With the majority of our taxable income earned in the United States, we could benefit from any material reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates. We would expect to use a portion of potential tax savings to invest in accelerating growth. Second, with little forward exposure in overseas cash, we are not likely to benefit significantly for changes in repatriation rules.","Now, let's review progress made we have made. As I said before we grew revenues, operating income, margins and operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, capping a strong year in which we achieved our commitments and created value for shareholders.","As we detail on our Investor Day November, we are now laser focused on our two-point strategy, to accelerate growth and continue to drive operational excellence. We grew revenue in the quarter and park by expanding relationships with possible health systems. During the quarter we enter into another professional laboratory services agreement Montefiore Health System, a premier academic health system in the University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine.","Under the agreement Quest Diagnostics will provide laboratory services for Montefiore Health System to help enhance the quality and the value of diagnostic services to patients and doctors at the systems six hospitals.","Quest is collaborating with an increasing number of hospital partners including leading academic institutions like Montefiore that are looking to focus on the core business while taking advantage of our expertise, innovation and scale to help implement their lab strategy.","We continue to expand the work we do with other leading hospital systems including RWJ Barnabas in New Jersey, HCA in Denver and many others. Our pipeline for developing new relationships is also strong.","In addition, our gene-based and esoteric testing grew mid-single digits in quarter and approximately 4% for the year. Major drivers include noninvasive prenatal testing, hepatitis C, prescription drug monitoring, and SureSwab. ","Also we strengthened our efforts to grow advanced diagnostics by adding a senior executive to our team. I'm very pleased that [indiscernible] has joined us for General Electric's Healthcare business to drive leadership in this important growth opportunity. ","We are also making great progress executing our strategy to be the provider of choice for consumers. At the end of 2016, we had already opened patient service centers in 56 Safeway supermarkets. Consumer satisfaction is high, and so is our employee satisfaction.","We are track to open a total of 200 patient service centers in Safeway stores by the end of 2017. This improves the customer experience, while also helping us better manager our real estate cost.","Also we are on track to start performing genetic testing for AncestryDNA in our Marlborough Massachusetts laboratory later this month. AncestryDNA recently reported it sold 1.4 million DNA test in the fourth quarter, and that's more than all they sold in 2015.","And then finally, our emerging data and analytics business is gaining traction. We offer data diagnostics in partnership with Inovalon. The data diagnostics customer list is growing and includes premier health plan payors such as Anthem and Harvard Pilgrim.","We're also proud that the independent panel of 50 industry analysts and influential journalists name the Data Diagnostics Service, the most innovative product of the year for healthcare.","We continue to drive operational excellence. We ended the year with $1.1 billion in run rate cost savings through Invigorate initiatives as we projected at Investor Day. We are on track to deliver $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017.","Our revenue services' partnership with Optum is off to a good start. The transition occurred in November and we expect to drive improvements in bad debt and denials in 2017 and beyond.","In terms of capital deployment, during the quarter we increased the dividend 12.5% to $1.80 a share on an annual basis and repurchased $150 million of shares. In our December Board meeting we approved $1 billion increase of our share repurchase authority, leaving us with 1.4 billion remaining for future buybacks.","We continue to expect to deliver 1% to 2% revenue growth from acquisitions and have an active M&A pipeline. Our 2017 guidance which Mark will discuss shortly reflects expectations for accelerated topline growth and is consistent with the earnings outlook we provided at our Investor Day in November.","So now Mark will provide an overview on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and provide you with our 2017 outlook. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion were up 0.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis, while equivalent revenues grew 1.9%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2% compared to the prior year. Of this growth nearly 1% was organic. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.5% versus the prior year.","Acquisitions contributed about 1% of volumes in the quarter. However, note that the impact of hurricane Matthew presented a headwind of approximately 30 basis points on organic growth in the fourth quarter.","Revenue for requisition in the fourth quarter increased 40 basis points versus the prior year. As reminder revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price changes, business mix, test mix and test per req. ","Unit price headlands were slightly less than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 70 basis points for the full year. While unit price headlands moderated in the second half of 2016, we know that price fluctuations can vary from quarter to quarter. We continue to believe that in 2017 unit price headlands will be consistent with last few years at approximately 1%.","As we highlighted throughout 2016 our PLS engagements such as RWJ Barnabas Health and HCA carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. The strength of our PLS engagements in the fourth quarter continue to impact our revenue per requisition. Other mix elements including test and payor mix contributed more than 2% to revenue per req in the quarter.","Reported operating income for the quarter was $276 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $239 million or 12.9% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis operating income was $305 million or 16.4% of revenues compared to $288 million or 15.5% of revenues last year.","The impact of our former products businesses in the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $13 million or roughly 40 basis points. Excluding this impact operating margin would've grown by 130 basis points year-over-year.","Reported earnings per share was $1.9 in the quarter compared to $1.29 a year ago due to a one-time tax benefit in 2015 associated with winding down a subsidiary. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.31, up 10% from $1.19 last year. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $18 million in the quarter, represented primarily restructuring and integration costs. The net impact of these items reduced our reported earnings per share by $0.13.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.6%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a reminder bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients have their health insurance deductible.","Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year.","Income tax expense recorded benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly a penny in Q4.","Our DSOs were approximately 47 days flat year-over-year. Cash provided by operations in 2016 was $1.1 billion versus $821 million last year, which was stronger than the guidance we provided in October due largely to better than expected earnings and improved cash collections. Capital expenditures during the year were $293 million compared to $263 million a year ago.","Now turning to guidance. We are providing the following outlook for 2017. Revenues to be between $7.64 billion and $7.72 billion, an increase of 1.7% to 2.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.65 and $4.80 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.37 and $5.52; cash provided by operations to be approximately $1.1 billion; and finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million.","I would like to provide a few items to consider as you think about our 2017 guidance. First, as a reminder, we benefited from favorable weather and an extra day due to the leap year in the first quarter of 2016. This sets up a difficult compare in the first quarter of 2017. We therefore expect our earnings growth will not be proportional, with Q1 coming in lower than the balance of the year. Given this consensus EPS estimates for the first quarter are higher than our current expectations.","Second, our revenue guidance of 2% to 3% equivalent growth includes some M&A primarily related to carryover from the CLP acquisition which closed at the end of February 2016.","Finally, our CapEx guidance includes an outlay related to the previously announced headquarters move to Secaucus.","Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks Mark. Well, to summarize, we continued our success in 2016 and ended the year on a high note. We are laser-focused on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Our 2017 guidance is both reasonable and achievable.","Now, I'd be happy to take any questions you have. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is coming from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes hi good morning.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning.","Ricky Goldwasser","I had some quick questions on the underlying assumptions for guidance. So, I think you're expecting 1% to 2% of topline growth from acquisitions. Can you give us some more detail on the price versus the volume? And whether you're assuming any buyback in guidance? I know that you have the authorization, but is it factored into the range you gave this morning?","Mark Guinan","Yes, sure Ricky, in terms of buybacks, the guidance is based on flat share count. So, there would be some buybacks necessary to prevent dilution based on our equity program for employees, but there's not any lift in EPS based on reduced share count in the guidance that I'm providing.","In terms prices, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, while we're not giving specific number saying that 2017, we would expect some continued price erosion and we expect that apples-and-apples price erosion to be similar to the last couple years which was somewhere 100 basis points or less.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And--","Stephen Rusckowski","And again when we talk price erosion that's pure price freezing all other variable's one revenue per rent basis, we haven\u2019t really provided specific guidance.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And I know you mentioned that you submitted the data to CMS this quarter on PAMA, any updates to your thoughts of how we should think of that PAMA impact and how kind of like the new cost-cutting -- or the updated cost-cutting program could help offset that?","Stephen Rusckowski","So, first of all, Ricky, we have not submitted the data yet, we're preparing to do that in the first quarter by PAMA. As you're aware we're all going to submit data in 2017 for the goal of CMS to refresh the clinical lab [ph] reschedule for 2018.","But what I said our remarks is, as trade association was spending some time to talk about where are we with PAMA, what has to with administration said. How is Congress digesting that? How that might affect CMS? So, we're not prepared to say anything about that, but we wanted to call that that out in my prepared remarks. And we're considering others might -- where we're right now with the new administration might affect this Bill.","Also as we've talked about in the past, about 12% of our revenues, we're well prepared to absorb that given our progress and you see continued progress would invigorate. We have now good line of sight to that $1.3 billion goal in 2017.","We haven\u2019t provided exact expectations beyond that. But at our Investor Day in the fall, we clearly showed that there's more opportunity beyond that $1.3 billion run rate, which gives us confidence if, in fact, there's some price reductions on the clinical IP schedule to absorb that in the new course of running our business.","Mark Guinan","So, Ricky, I'd take you back to the Investor Day, where I talked about through 2020 view that we could grow revenues 3% to 5% and grow earnings mid to high single-digits. So, that takes into account some level of anticipated potential price reductions as Steve said still to be finalize as we go throughout the year and then our invigorate program and our ability to offset certainly a portion of that and grow earnings faster than revenue.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And just one clarification on the 2017 pricing, to your point, you expect continued erosion in organic pricing, but when we think about the revenue per requisition as it flows through the P&L. Should we assume positive price increase based on mix?","Mark Guinan","So, again, I wouldn't call it price, I'd call it mix. But if you're looking for revenue per req, you've got two different drivers. So, as we mentioned we got 2% lift in Q4 from test mix and other mix elements separate from our PLS. So, there's no reason at this point to not believe that we will continue to get positive mix as we innovate, bring new test offerings that tend to have higher value. We also have shared that there has been a trend with higher density on requisitions, so we've been seeing an increasing number of tests per requisitions, while it's hard to predict there's no reason at this point to believe we shouldn\u2019t continue to get some minor lift from that as well.","But then the one headwind on mix, again as we've explained is our professional laboratory services growing at a faster rate than our overall business and because of the nature of that work, it happens to have a routine testing, fewer tests per req, and therefore, a lower revenue per req.","So, how those all come out, we're not providing a specific revenue per req number, but the trends that you've seen, we're not expecting those to change.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. Thank you for the clarification.","Mark Guinan","Thanks Ricky.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","The next question is coming from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan","Hi.","Stephen Rusckowski","Hi Jack.","Jack Meehan","Good morning guys. I wanted to just get your outlook on the pathology business for 2017 just -- and whether you thought that could be moderate a little bit?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes. Two sides of what we classify as anatomic pathology, one is on tissues, we would say that business is relatively stable for us. The second is with our path business, we've talked about in the past with the new guidance -- the new guidelines that were established number of years ago, we continue to see a decline in that business, albeit our -- the decline has slowed in 2016 and we expected that will continue in 2017. So, hopefully that's answering the question you asked.","Mark Guinan","And Jack just to add a little additional color, I'm sure you're familiar that there were some reductions in the physician fee schedule. So, in terms of our Medicare business for tissue that price headwind is built into our guidance and part of the 100 basis points or so that I mentioned. So, there were some reductions coming out of Washington.","Jack Meehan","Great. That's helpful. And then one more for you Mark, just you talked about the unit price expectations for 2017, just how do you think about the magnitude for PLS, the drag on revenue per req there, do you think that gets a little bit bigger in 2017 and how does the ancestry impact the optical numbers as well? Thank you.","Mark Guinan","Sure. So, ancestry is not a business that we're going to include in our revenue per req because it\u2019s a separate business. And we're not actually receiving requisitions; it's more of client services business. So, that's going to be separate from revenue per req we share.","And I'm not in position to provide a specific number Jack. All I can say its included in the guidance, our best guess of what PLS impact will be and quite frankly, somewhat dependent on additional PLS agreements that we might sign throughout the year.","So, it would be hard even to find -- wanted to give you that kind of color, to give you a specific number because the timing and our ability to close these deals with a certain timeframe obviously to be determined.","But, again, I want to remind people that revenue per req is not a proxy for profitability and quite frankly, PLS is good profitable business regardless of its revenue per req being lower than our core business and some of the higher revenue per req businesses such as our tissue business are not necessarily the most profitable and some of our lower revenue per req business like Wellness are quite profitable even though the revenue per req is well within our overall enterprise.","Jack Meehan","That all makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning A.J.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hello everybody. My first question I wanted to just ask about an update on the Optum relationship. I know the employee transition over to Optum from on your books was I think supposed to happen in November. Are we seeing now the cost benefit of that or is that still the common first to second quarter, and any update on the thinking about their ability to help you with your revenue cycle manage either bad debts or non-reimbursed test and the timing when you might see that side of the benefit?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah, thanks, A.J. Let me start. First of all, we did transition those employers over in November as you said. We are off to a good start. We are very pleased with how that has gone. We are actually very pleased on both sides that's Quest as well as Optum worked on the change management with their employees. The people that moved over are now employees of Optum that are very much part of the team of Quest. So we feel good about that. We are off to a good start.","Now we did this just to reminder everyone because we believe by working with Optum we are going to have a better capability of working on our bad debt, our denials, our reimbursement and we think -- we still believe there is a lot of opportunity in front of us. So Mark, would you like to respond to the specifics of what we might see that.","Mark Guinan","Sure. So, A.J. as we mentioned previously there are several elements to this, the billing savings start this year in 2017, we do not benefitted at all last year. And it -- we have tenure contract and may build over the life of the contract. Then the other element which is, you know, the gain sharing agreement around bad debt and now obviously Optum is just starting that work. So we're fully expecting significant benefit from that, but it\u2019s going to take a little time for the additional things that they heading to what we were already doing to accelerate the reduction in denials and accelerator our improvement in bad debt. So yet to come as well.","A.J. Rice","Okay. If I am just might follow-up ask you about I know you mentioned on Safeway that you have ramped that up nicely and I know you are having discussions with other people about similar arrangements, some potentially where the nurses either an urgent care or mini clinic type of environment could help you on the drawing the blood. Two aspects to the question, one is, now as you got more of the Safeway's done can you start to quantify on a regular basis what your real estate savings would be? And there any update on the discussions with the other parties about possibly collaborating with them on a similar basis?","Mark Guinan","Yeah, so in terms of quantifying the real estate savings, it's not something I'm going to do. It\u2019s another element of our Invigorate program. We don't tease out all the various pieces within Invigorate. What I did do, A.J., if you recall at the Investor Day was a frame for your total expenditures for draws and broke down what portion of that, you know, were impacting with the stately agreement which is less than 20% when you look at the real estate costs and some of the other things such as cleaning and property taxes and utilities and so and so forth. I kind of frame for, you know, kind of order of magnitude in total.","Our largest elements of draws is obviously the labor and there is labor arbitrage currently with the Safeway agreement. We're basically paying the same phlebotomist just to do those draws in a different location.","So I'm not going to providing specifics around the real estate savings over time, but it's meaningful enough that, you know, it\u2019s helping us, get greater confidence in delivering that on Invigorate savings that we talked about $1.3 billion by the end of this year and then additional room beyond the end of 2017.","Stephen Rusckowski","A.J., just to remind everyone that's this work with retailers is part of our strategy to accelerate growth. As I said in my remarks we are now laser focused on accelerating growth. And if you recall, you go back at the Investor Day we laid out our approach is to that one of which is to be the provider of choice for this industry. And we think what we're doing with Safeway is a good proof point of providing great -- a great experience for consumers in a different environment. The feedback has been very strong. ","When we talked about this at Investor Day there is a portion of requisitions or orders in this industry that go on fulfilled and we believe that having better access and very nice storefronts facilities like what we have with Safeway will benefits our business and benefit Safeway, benefits the patient by giving the testing done, they need to get done. So we see this is a growth platform for us not just a cash savings platform. ","And then finally is, as we have said at investor day, we continue to work with other potential retailers. Their health strategies, they are very focused on it. They see health as a major platform for their growth and then opportunity for them to get more traffic into their store. So more to come on that. But we are off to a good start. And again, it\u2019s a key strategy for us around the consumer, there is other parts what we are doing around the consumer, Ancestry would be another example of that. What we are doing with MyQuest, a smart app and actually this year as we exited the year without even pushing it really hard. We have over 3.5 million registered users from MyQuest, getting access to the lab results. So a lot of different initiatives underway to build on this growth theme of Quest being the super choice in our space. ","A.J. Rice","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks, A.J.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Lisa Gill of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. ","Lisa Gill","Hi. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Hi, Lisa. ","Lisa Gill","Good morning. I just had a couple of quick follow-up questions. First, Mark, as we think about the cadence of the revenue growth throughout the year, I know you talked about 1% to 2% coming from acquisitions. Can you maybe just talk about the visibility around the acquisition? Should we be thinking that that will perhaps be more towards the back half of the year?","Mark Guinan","Right. So 1% to 2%, as you recall, is a CAGR over a period of time. It is not necessarily any given year when. I talked about guidance for 2017 we don't have any unexecuted acquisitions within that guidance. The only M&A within the current guidance is the carryover from the CLP outreach purchase that we closed last February. So I think that should answer your question. So any other M&A without the CLP executed and would not more loaded towards the back half of the year because the benefit of CLP carryover ends in the first quarter and I'm not counting on any unexecuted M&A in my current guidance. ","Lisa Gill","Great. So that 1.7% to 2% growth included no incremental M&A, I just wanted to make I am 100% clear on that. ","Mark Guinan","That's correct.","Lisa Gill","Okay. And then secondly, as we talk about the consumer aspect of the business and Safeway relationship, is there a way to quantify the number of reqs or the number of patients that you are seeing, I mean, just to get an idea of the growth going from 56 to 200 stores and the potential opportunity, I know it\u2019s probably pretty small today, but is there metric around this business that you can give us as we start to think to about the growth?","Stephen Rusckowski","It\u2019s interesting idea. And we will think about how and if we do that, because it is helpful to get some idea of how much flow we are getting. So we thank you for that idea. ","Lisa Gill","Okay. ","Mark Guinan","Lisa, I just want to make sure, look here, most of the volume that's being done in the Safeway was done previously in a patient service center. So it's not all incremental. It is a lower cost and we think a more consumer friendly environment, what Jim Davidson shared at the Investor Day was that the initial and it's early, the initial view was that we were seeing new patients, we're getting some incremental growth and it's hard to be precise and -- but as I pointed even a couple of basis points of difference in an industry that's growing 2% to 3%, we get to 1% to 2% left sound a lot, but all of the small things start to add up. So we said hey, it is really early, we are definitely seeing some incremental growth whether it's sustainable or not we don't know whether it will accelerate, we don't know; whether we will see it at every single site as we move from 50 some to 200 not sure. But we will certainly try our best to give you some color and give you a sense of quantifying that value beyond, you know, just directionally if we can. ","So as Steve said, appreciate the question and we will think about and see what we can do. ","Stephen Rusckowski","As we keep on saying the initial results are encouraging. So, in due course we will share more.","Lisa Gill","Okay. Thanks. Great.","Stephen Rusckowski","Okay. ","Lisa Gill","I am looking forward to it. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Hi, Dan.","Dan Leonard","Good morning. Thank you. So my first question, Steve, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that if there was any tax benefit from change in corporate tax rate, you would invest a portion of that, can you talk about you how much you will invest of any tax benefit and what some of the key areas are you would focused on?","Stephen Rusckowski","Well, first of all, it is all if. So, we are very careful to say it could or if. And we are not going to provide specifics of what we would possibly do, because it\u2019s very hypothetical. But our two strategies that we're focused on is accelerating growth and driving operational excellence and if we get some benefit that we will consider the best way of concerning what we do with that gain. But we're not providing specific clarity beyond that. ","Dan Leonard","Okay. And just a quick follow-up, but I may have missed it. Did you provide tax guidance for 2017?","Mark Guinan","No. We did not. At this point there's no reason to believe that our effective tax rate should be significantly from 2016 or the last couple of years.","Dan Leonard","Got it. Thank you. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Isaac.","Isaac Ro","Good morning, guys. Thank you. So question on PAMA, as the data collection process goes through and we also to figure out what it mean, I imagine that there will be a lot of smaller labs that are going to struggle with the economics. And I am curious if you have seen any signs of opportunity to take some share smaller facility, you know, because they are looking partner with you guys or they are just not as competitive and can't provide good service. I am just curious if that's something is tangible right now, and if at all, is there anything baked in into your guidance this year, at least to share.","Stephen Rusckowski","So, as you know, PAMA usage lands where the goal is which is for implementation in 2018. And if I gather the data and factors and price erosion against the clinical laboratory fee schedule, you know, the smaller laboratories that hospital outreach have a higher proportion of their revenues from the clinical laboratory fee schedule that we do, so they are much more exposed.","So as we have talked about in the past we believe this is a good catalyst for Mark to continue to consolidate, and that's we still feel confident around that 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. We demonstrated in the past four years we\u2019re able to do that. We feel good about prospects or M&A funnel. And then also if you look at the competitiveness of our business going forward with this dynamic in place, I think it just speaks volumes than the opportunity we have in front of us, is a very strong player, they brings a lot of value to our industry, that's good start for years to come. ","Also as far as PAMA is concerned you probably a lot of seen Inspector General report that was published in the fall as trade association we continue to be concerned with the few facts there. First fact is that from what they have shared is small fraction of total laboratories they think will be gathered in the data collection about 5%. 5% the laboratories that are building in CMS now they represents about 69% of the total Medicare billings, but it is not -- close to 100% so this is not the intention of Congress. We're evaluating that as a trade association.","And then second is, in that data I am assuming they make some assumptions around the gathering the data in hospitals knowing what they need to do around that provider number and whether there is an applicable lab or not. So the more data we get into CMS, the more representatives it is market-based pricing and that was always the full intent of Congress. So this is what I am referring to in my commentary that we're evaluating based upon what we heard from Inspector General, what we know is happening in Washington as we speak round reviews of the new regulation and we will decide in due course of what we need to do anything going forward as far as the position as a trade association.","Isaac Ro","Thank you. And then just a follow up on the higher tax question. I just want to make sure I understand conceptually if you guys were to get a tax break that the benefit of that would be deployed to reinvestment in the business to accelerate growth, is that sort of your prepared you are trying to say?","Mark Guinan","No. Not a portion of it. What we try do, Isaac, is -- we don\u2019t want get out in front of ourselves because, although there's a lot of, you know, press about being a priority for Congress we yet to see when it is for sure and how. But there were a number of other healthcare companies recently that made some comments so we didn't want to be silent. And so in order to have people understand our thinking is as we mentioned any sort of statutory reduction since we earned basically all of our income in United States would be significant, obviously there could be other changes beyond the statutory production that could mitigate some of those savings. So we have to see that. And we just want people understand that we wouldn't necessarily crocked dollar for dollar to the bottom line that, you know, a significant reduction statutory rates when in fact give us an opportunity to look at as we balance short-term, long-term some opportunities potentially to invest.","And if and when that happens we will give you more color. But we just wanted people to understand -- get ahead of themselves and do some math that we would necessarily drop every single dollar to the bottom line.","Isaac Ro","Okay. Understandable. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Hynes","Thank you. I am going to ask one more question on tax because our analysis that we've done, it say, the statutory tax rate dropped from 35% just to 25%, that could imply a 14% increase in free cash flow. And that is such a big increase in free cash flow. So I know you don't want to give details on what the reinvestment would be, but would that actually change your strategy a little bit or I just feel like this is very significant. Would you look at the different business with that amount of more cash coming in? ","Mark Guinan","So Ann, I wouldn\u2019t say we change our strategy. As we mentioned is that as you said any sort of large statutory reduction would be significant for us. And therefore again as we balance short-term and long-term there could be a decision by us to take a portion of a portion of likely to be a small portion of the and invested in some longer term growth opportunities not a strategic shift, just really expanding some opportunities that maybe are just not making the cost right now because we have to balance short-term and long-term. So that was really all we're trying to imply not a strategic shift, but to your point if it did happen, it could be significant which is what I commented on in my prepared remarks. ","Stephen Rusckowski","We are going to take a step back and think about the use of that installed windfall for now to get the best shareholder return. As you expect we would do. ","Ann Hynes","Okay. ","Stephen Rusckowski","It\u2019s all very hypothetical, I don't want to speculate, but you can trust like we done in the past, we are going to carefully take the best use of any type of additional earnings to do the right thing to get a good return for our shareholders. ","Mark Guinan","And, Ann, just to closeout we're going to stick to our capital employment synergy. So prior to my start back in our Investor Day in 2012 you have seen we inherent to that and this would not change our very disciplined approach to deploying our capital. ","Ann Hynes","All right. Great. Can I ask about the UNH contract? I think -- and I could be wrong. I know LabCorp's in a long-term contract that ends in 2018. Do you expect -- since we're coming toward the end of that, do you expect that contract to come out to RFP? And if it does, do you expect maybe a potential opportunity, because I know that you have said in the past that you still process a lot of reqs for them out of network. So, how do you view that contract over the next couple of years?","Stephen Rusckowski","Our relationship with United Healthcare Group continues to get stronger. We are a big provider today, already laboratory services. We do have a number of areas where we actually do have carve out if you will, providing services on contract. We have not got specific on that, but we do. And our work without Optum, our revenue services, revenue cycle services this reinforces our relationship.","I was asked the question when we did this in the fall, does this help you with United and my answer is it doesn't hurt you, since it\u2019s very visible and we are clearly a strategic partner of United Healthcare Group. And then also we had mentioned that we are partnering around wellness. We are the partner for Optum as they provide wellness solutions to their client base and we're happy about that. And what I will share is that obviously we are trying to get the best possible access as possible with these many healthcare insurers in our portfolio. We are not a national provider for United today and we're hopeful as we go forward we get strong with United as they work through their contract considerations, so we are hopeful that we could be more of a provider than we are today, but we don't have any specifics share with you at this time.","Ann Hynes","Okay. Thanks.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. ","Bill Bonello","Hey, good morning, guys. Just a question. There's some large properties I think up for sale and some that maybe should be. What is your appetite these days for larger scale acquisitions, but within the lab space? If things are presented, is that something that you would consider, or are you strictly focused on some of the more regional and hospital deals?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah, first of all, what we said we will continue to do going forward is what we said in 2012. Our business is diagnostic information services. Anything we do in terms of potential acquisition into scope, so everything as pretty strategically align. And the reason why we are so committed to it, we have cleaned up our portfolio to support that. Because we think substantial opportunities in that scope of our market. So with that we said there are a number of smaller acquisitions we can do which are in that 1% to 2%, but we also said over the years is that if something were to come to us that make strategic sense that we could build value creation case for our shareholders, we wouldn\u2019t rule it out. But what I will again share is that we're not do an acquisitions that we cannot have the value creation. ","And that has been something that we have delivered against in our capital deployment strategy service well. So no matter big or small everything we do is going to create value for our shareholders. ","Bill Bonello","Okay. That makes sense. And I don't know if you are even allowed to comment on this. But is there a bigger pipeline of bigger opportunities out there than maybe there has been in the past?","Mark Guinan","Bill, what I would say is there's always a pipeline and we had -- when you say when we consider we have looked at some larger opportunities in the past that obviously we haven't shared and for various reasons and some of it being what Steve talked about, we have passed. So we're always looking at best path for shareholder value creation and it doesn\u2019t mean a large transaction could not be the best path. So we evaluate those things regularly. I wouldn't say that in today's world there is any more opportunities and sometimes you create opportunities by reaching out the people having a conversation so it's not as if we sit on the sideline to see if somebody's declaring that, you know, they are looking for some sort of transaction. So, we're very actively engaged with a number of people in the industry and geographically around the world. And we are considering capital deploying options all the time.","And what comes back to as Steve said as we have some very hard fast M&A metrics and that is our kind of litmus test for evaluation and if we found a larger transaction that make strategic sense and met those metrics and we felt good about the chemistry and integration path, you know, we certainly would seriously consider that. ","Bill Bonello","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Bill. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Brian. ","Brian Tanquilut","Good morning, guys. Hey, Steve, in the past you have talked about you gave a pricing outlook basically through 2017. And I know you are forecasting the 100 basis point decline this year. Where you sit today, take out PAMA, how are you thinking about pricing trends beyond this year?","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks for the question Brian. What I had mentioned is that, you know, through 2020 I would expect the pricing environment to continue to be similar to what has been in the last couple years, separate from PAMA and then if you also recall I did a slide kind of and if PAMA happens, you know, some of it -- especially at some of the lower end possibilities are kind of within the variability. As you look at this year we had about 50 basis points erosion in the back half, certainly higher than the first half, so if PAMA ends up contributing overall another 30, 40 basis points is almost within the variability of what we have seen, obviously if PAMA ends up being at high-end it would be a little more significant, but as you might expect we considered all of that in the guidance that we gave, this will be in the lookout that I gave and view in earnings growth relative to revenue through 2020.","Brian Tanquilut","I appreciate it. Mark, just a different question. Cash flow was pretty strong in Q4. As we think about capital deployment, you have said no incremental deals in the guide to buyback. Basically you just offset the dilution from the stock grants. So, is there anything -- number one, is there anything to call on the Q4 cash flow that drove that strategy?","And then second, capital deployment for the incremental cash that you haven't baked into the guide being deployed, is that basically your upside driver for the rest of the year? How should we be thinking about that?","Mark Guinan","I want to make sure I am clear on the question Brian, so tell me if I am answering what you are asking. Cash flow was stronger than we anticipated this year. We did actually take that as an opportunity to accelerate a couple of capital investments into this year and our free cash flow still stronger than the guidance that I had provided, so we felt we did that responsibly. And that was some strategic decisions and try to accelerate some items that we're working on in our Invigorate program and so and so forth. ","Going into this year I am guiding to flat cash flow year-over-year. Obviously as you know there's various moving pieces, one time things that could impact positively, so net-net $1.1 million of operating cash flow, $250 million to $300 million of expected capital investment and then the rest of free cash flow, you know, half of that at least is going to be committed to our shareholders through our dividend which again we increased recently on by double-digits and then supplemented by some share buybacks.","With the rest of free cash flow back to an earlier question I got it, it is dependent on executing M&A and it's not then we will buyback additional shares, so really that's to be determine.","Brian Tanquilut","Got it. That answers the question. Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Valiquette of Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. ","Steven Valiquette","Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on the results. So I think just for us, just a quick high level volume question. I guess just to the extent that some in the investment community, let's say rightly or wrongly, try to gauge lab industry volume growth by looking at things like physician office visit data, hospital volume data, it seemed like most of these data points were suggesting that lab providers could see some accelerating growth in volumes in the fourth quarter.","I just forgot where you guys stand on how much you also look at these external data points, but also your latest thoughts on how much you think investors should focus on this external data. Since you guys had decent volume growth in the quarter, don't get me wrong. But it didn't correlate to that expectation of accelerating growth and that some investors may have garnered from that external data. Thanks.","Stephen Rusckowski","So, let me start with that. We look at it all, Steven. We look at all the different matrices and leading indicators. And what we've mentioned in the past we have an internal measure we will take a look at 1,000 accounts that we know they are accounts and we do seeing how look year on year, and say what's going on with the underlying utilization of patients that those physicians are seeing. And what we have said in the past and we will continue to say because we looked at this in the fourth quarter it's been relatively stable. So -- and this is really good representation of utilization for the market we think. So it's relatively stable.","So prospectively that's what we provide in our guidance, but on top of that what you see is everything that's driving the marketplace that is more innovation coming into marketplace, more tests per encounter in the marketplace and aging populations, so that is giving us the growth that we are seeing, but also the market perspective growth that we anticipated as well. So that's what we see.","Now I will remind you that in the fourth quarter we did have a hurricane event which affected us in Q4, got up in October, October 4 lot of the industry does have an impact on the business. So Mark, any other color you would like add to volumes in Q4, but also prospectively?","Mark Guinan","So, as Steve mentioned and I said in my prepared remarks we got about a 30 basis headwind by our calculation from hurricane Matthew, we do have a significant business in Florida and although really only northern Florida was hit because of the preparations there were a lot fewer office visits and a lot fewer lab draws in the state of Florida while Matthew was going on and then certainly it hit to the Carolina as well significantly and so we have some impact there. So that certainly dampened growth would've been otherwise and without getting into too math there is a difference in the calendar and we don't always talk about this, but weekends we do less business, weekdays we do more, so any given quarter, you know, depending on how many weekends there, weekdays versus the prior year there can be some impact as well. We don't into too much detail, but you can take a look at the calendar to see how Q4 compared to 2015 and see that there were fewer weeks. ","Steven Valiquette","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is coming from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Ross. ","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. It seems like your main competitor is mimicking or getting closer in its strategy on the hospital to what you have been doing. Is that a positive relative to maybe getting more of those types of transition over the goal line just because you have two, maybe forces pushing there, or how do you think about it in general in your ability to execute against what's been sitting in the pipeline?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah, well, first of all, we have a strategy for years now focusing on what we believe supporting element of what's happening in healthcare in the U.S. that is hospitals of the big influence over laboratory strategy in general. We shared at our Investor Day it\u2019s about 50% of the marketplace. If you look at all the laboratories that are part of inpatient acute care setting and to run those we can help them with those laboratories to make more efficient. And then second is there a big part of the non-hospitals of market were about roughly a third of the market is those hospital systems competing with us. So we three or four years ago -- this is core part of our strategy, back to 2012 we said it was one of our three focus areas. And so we've been investing. It is not something you can just put up a shingle and get it to the market easy. I remind you these three areas we work with hospitals on.","One is providing the most sophisticated advanced testing sometimes called reference testing, we are the leader there. Second is we help them become more efficient with their inpatient hospital cost and the deal that we just announced today with Montefiore, is a good example, where they leverage on our efficiency and seems that money makes them more efficient, so they can focus on what they want to focus on is a system.","And then finally is outreach. And in some cases we buy outreach businesses where we have an outright purchase. What we announced last year was the relationship of Hartford Hospital in Connecticut is an example of that. The best place for us to be is requesting side of the their lab strategy where we are helping them with reference work, we are helping them with our inpatient laboratory and where they are partner for outreach. Do, it\u2019s all three. So we have been at this for a while, by being added we have invested in capabilities, repeatable methodologies, how do you price them, how do you call on the [indiscernible], what I will share is this is not typical laboratory sale it's not in a physician level, it is not at a lab director level, it\u2019s typically with the CEO and CFO delivery system. This is strategic. And so many of these conversions are at the most senior level. So I think it is a big part of -- has been a big of our strategy for a long time. We're gathering momentum. As you can see with the deals we have announced. Last year we announced Barnabas, we announced HCA, we have yet another one in the first quarter. So we have shown that we are getting momentum and we have a strong pipeline.","And as far as others participating in the marketplace I think that's reinforces, the interest in the marketplace. It is a big market, there is plenty of opportunities, there is thousands of hospitals. Do we think we are going to be the only competitor in the space? No. But I think it\u2019s just another data point that this is a good strategy that we have been working on and there is a lot more interest out there than just what we have done in few deals. So it\u2019s getting momentum in general in terms of integrated delivery systems, thinking about the lab strategy. ","So we are encouraged about the progress we have made and we are very, very optimistic about the future growth opportunities in that investment. ","Ross Muken","That's helpful. And maybe, Mark, just quickly on Q1 you obviously gave a bit of color. Could you also just remind us on SG&A cadence? I remember, while you did have a bit of a step up, obviously in volume in Q1, you also had maybe a bit more of your SG&A for the year. Just any color you could provide on how that OpEx cadence may look for how to consider what happened last year.","Mark Guinan","Sure. Ross, typically we don\u2019t give any guidance -- quarterly guidance or SG&A, but I can assure you that different from last year. You shouldn\u2019t expect a, you know, quarterly differential. Last year we were building some key capabilities, around our data diagnostics and other things, investing upfront, as necessary ahead of some revenues, but I don\u2019t anticipate anything significant similar this year.","Ross Muken","Thanks and congrats, guys.","Stephen Rusckowski","Hey, thanks. ","Mark Guinan","Thank you. ","Stephen Rusckowski","I think that was the last question and we thank all of you for joining the call. As we said at the beginning I'll close with this. We have strong quarter and a solid 2016. We're looking forward to accelerated growth and driving operational excellence this year in 2017. We thank you for all your support and you have great day.

A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics, and review progress on our five-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.","We grew revenues, margins and earnings in the third quarter. Revenues grew 1% on an equivalent basis to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew approximately 7% and operating margin expanded by 130 basis points compared to the prior year, once again reflecting improved operational efficiency. And adjusted diluted EPS increased approximately 7% to $1.28.","Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk to you about industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to PAMA. We are currently reviewing the draft and are sharing our perspective with the trade association. As you're well aware, this is an important issue for every lab because it will result in a refresh of CMS' clinical lab fee schedule, which will apply to independent physician and hospital laboratories for their fee for service Medicare payments. We have said all along that PAMA needs to be built on an accurate representative view of the market. We were disappointed that the draft provided as many limitations as it did to the definition of applicable lab.","In a recent study, the Office of Inspector General reported that the two largest independent labs represented only approximately 17% of the total Medicare spending from the clinical lab fee schedule, while hospitals and physician offices represented nearly half of the total Medicare spend.","PAMA stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. It would be a terrible irony if the data collection process demanded by PAMA had the unintended consequence of reducing access to critical laboratory services that could cause some labs to close their doors to Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, the coding containment proposals recently released by CMS jeopardized the advancement of personalized medicine. These proposals failed to take into consideration the value provided from clinically validated information that further advances more targeted and sophisticated approaches to patient care. That said, we remain optimistic that the proposed rulemaking will result in an outcome that the industry can live with even if it takes a bit more time to finalize.","Now, let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy. To remind you, it's to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information service business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Well, let's start with growth. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated equivalent basis. Let me share with you some key elements of our strategy.","First, revenues from our gene-based and esoteric testing revenues continued to grow. We also saw significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and our industry-leading wellness business. Our science and innovation team continues to work with our clinical franchises to bring new solutions to the market. In October, we announced the launch of two companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer based on the recent FDA-approved Merck therapy, called KEYTRUDA, as well as Bristol-Myers Squibb's therapy, called OPDIVO. Both diagnostic tests are from Dako, an Agilent company.","Second, over the past few years, we've outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We have shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us in running their in-patient laboratories as well as their outreach service models, and we expect to announce additional agreements by the end of the year.","Finally, over the past few quarters, we've shared additional proof points on our three information solutions that help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools.","Specifically, our Interactive Insights for physicians, our IntelliTest Analytics Solutions for hospitals and health systems and finally, our Quest analytics platform. In late September, we announced our partnership with Inovalon to deliver our data diagnostic solution. Our data diagnostic solution will provide a real-time point of service suite of analysis to physicians at the patient level.","This solution will help physicians improve care through a better understanding of the patient's medical history and review that history gives relevant quality metrics through the use of big data and real-time connectivity solutions. These solutions will help deliver valuable insights precisely when and where clinicians need them most.","We believe this value-added information will help drive the transformation from volume to value-based healthcare. The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. We continue to make progress with our focus on building e-enabling services, standardizing our processes data and systems, and improving cash collections. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017.","We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. We are proud of the professionalism and commitment of our employees, which has enabled us to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past 12 years. Quest Diagnostics was one of only eight healthcare equipment and services companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index and one of only 11 companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in the same category.","The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core business. In July, we finalized the joint venture transaction with Quintiles. The new entity, now known as Q2 Solutions, is off to a great start with strong culture built on collaborative strengths of both JV partners.","We continue to review our portfolio, look at options for non-core assets and are focused on building value for our shareholders. And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy; delivering disciplined capital deployment. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividend and share buybacks. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and announced two acquisitions. Looking forward, we continue to have a strong M&A pipeline.","Now, Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.88 billion increased by 0.9% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis; that is excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue. On a GAAP, or reported basis revenues, were lower by 1.3%.","Revenues for diagnostic information services were flat to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined by 0.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition was 0.2% better than the prior year, marking the second consecutive quarter that revenue per requisition grew compared to the prior year. While reimbursement pressure continued to be a moderate headwind, we were able to more than offset that pressure through test and business mix. This reflects our strategy to grow our esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth","Moving to our diagnostic solutions business, which now includes risk assessment, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by approximately 18% on an equivalent basis compared to the prior year. That is again excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials testing revenue. On a reported basis, diagnostic solutions revenues were lower by approximately 17% from a year ago.","Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $325 million or 17.3% of revenues compared to $304 million or 16% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 130 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program.","In the quarter, adjusted net income grew by approximately 7% compared to a year ago. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization was $1.28, 6.7% better than a year ago.","In the quarter, reported operating income benefited from the $334 million pre-tax gain on our contribution to the clinical trials testing joint venture. This benefit was partially offset by net charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs totaling $28 million. Overall, net adjustments benefited reported diluted EPS by $1.17. Last year's third quarter reported operating income was reduced by $48 million or $0.22 per diluted share principally due to restructuring and integration costs. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.9%, 20 basis points better than last quarter and 10 basis points better than a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, two days lower than the prior year and flat to last quarter.","As Steve mentioned, we continue to improve our cash collections at a time when there is a growing portion for the healthcare bill paid by patients. Reported cash provided by operations was $212 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $188 million in the quarter, excluding cash tax benefits realized during the quarter, related to the recent debt retirement. In the third quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $271 million. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago largely due to a payment against certain tax reserves in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the quarter compared to $102 million a year ago.","Before moving to guidance, let me share a few comments to help you frame our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, we delivered strong results for the quarter that are in line with our expectations for the full year. Second, through the first three quarters of this year, we have shown steady growth in operating income and will continue to see improvement in Q4. However, this improvement will be largely offset by a higher effective tax rate in Q4. As a result, we anticipate a slower earnings growth rate in the fourth quarter than we have seen throughout the first nine months of the year.","Moving to guidance, we now expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows. Revenues are now expected to be approximately $7.49 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization to be between $4.75 and $4.80, basically unchanged from previous guidance with the tightening on both ends of the range. Adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million and capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $275 million.","Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mark. While we delivered another solid quarter as many of you recall at last year's Investors Day, we shared our expectation that we would deliver revenue growth of 2% to 5% and earnings growth of 8% to 10% over the next three years. Through the first nine months of this year, we are meeting that outlook.","Revenues are up by more than 2% on an equivalent basis and earnings are up by 10% from a year ago. We're pleased with our performance and are on track to meet our expectations for the full year. I'd like to say that 45,000 dedicated employees that work at Quest remain focused on delivering a superior customer experience every day. This commitment is helping us to execute our strategy and deliver on our commitments.","Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Isaac.","Operator","Sir, please check your mute button.","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Isaac? You want to move onto the next question, Christine? And if Isaac comes back in, we'll take him.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ricky.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So just had kind of like a follow-up question on the volume and one on PAMA. So we talked a lot over kind of like the first half of the year about the easing comp into second half around the contracts, right, with your anniversary from last year. We haven't really kind of like seen a significant uptick in the third quarter; so can you just kind of like walk us through kind of like what you're seeing in evolving environment and how should we be thinking about volumes for the remaining of the year?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So thanks, Ricky. Well, first of all, let me go back and refresh ourselves on where we've come from and the progress we've made. Then, we'll talk about specifically what we're seeing in Q3 and Mark and I will tag team this.","First of all, if you recall, back in 2017, we said at our first Investor Day that this had been a company that had declining volumes and we needed to first slow down the rate of decline, flatten that out and start to show improvement and continue to show progressive improvement, and that it would take time. So if you think about the past few years, if you go back to 2013, our organic revenue declined by about 4%. If you go back to 2013, our organic revenues shrank by about 2%. As you know, what we just said is in the last four consecutive quarters, we've seen our organic revenue growing by 1%, so we are making progress.","And then if you look at it, what we're doing to grow our business and also grow our margins is to focus on the larger req portion of our business and the richer req portion of our business, which is the more sophisticated, esoteric and genetic piece of our business, which is growing faster. And what you've seen for the last two quarters is nice progress in our revenue per requisition, which is helping us both in revenue as well as profit growth for the quarter.","And then also, our growth strategy, as you know, is not just related to organic growth but also grow through acquisitions. We do plan in our strategy 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions with the exception of MemorialCare and what we just announced last night, which is a smaller acquisition in our ExamOne business. We haven't had a material acquisition as soon in the year as we expected. However, what you did hear in my commentary, we do have a strong M&A pipeline and we do expect to be seeing some of that come out in the months ahead.","So let me turn now to Mark of what we saw in the third quarter in terms of our volumes and the general environment we're seeing.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, so thanks, Steve. Ricky, as Steve mentioned, we are making progress. We certainly would have liked to have seen even stronger volume in the third quarter. We did see a couple of things, a couple of trends I'll mention. And as we've also talked about in the past, we don't have any sort of independent market data. So our sense is that the market softened a bit in the third quarter based on the utilization basis. And what I would point to is there was some softness broadly across all of our regions, which would suggest it's more market versus class performance, more pronounced in July and August and it rebounded a little bit in September. It was certainly stronger in September.","And we've also shared that we have what we call the same account analysis, which is our way of trying to assess utilization. And versus the trend we saw in the first half of the year, we definitely saw a bit of softness in that analysis. We also have been working closely with a couple of potential M&A targets. We saw softness in their volumes as well, which has also slowed down some of those deals to make sure that we understood how much of that was market and how much of that was unique to those potential targets.","So, just a couple of data points that definitely make us feel that there was some market softness in Q3. So, yes, we would have liked to have made stronger volume progress. We do think it was largely market-based; certainly expecting to be somewhat temporary. But as Steve pointed out, despite that, we still are continuing to progress and restoring our growth.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just a one follow-up on PAMA; I mean, Steve, obviously you kind of like you highlighted it in your prepared comments. When we think about kind of like the current proposed kind of like rate cuts and when you think about your mix, how should we think about the potential impact if it were to be implemented in 2017 now that you have the data points?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, first of all, the final guidelines are not out and as I said in my commentary, we're not accepting those guidance \u2013 those guidelines and we now are in the comment period. We'll actually meet with CMS in November. I want to say us; it's myself as Chairman of the trade association, American Clinical Laboratory Association with some of my colleagues. We'll meet with CMS to talk through the glaring flaws in their collection of the data.","As I said in my commentary, this is supposed to be a representative view of the marketplace to exclude a large portion of the marketplace, which based upon what we understand there are applicable law \u2013 lab definition will exclude a large piece of the physicians' offices as well as some portion of the hospital marketplace. And as I said, that's a large piece of who's providing Medicare laboratory services, so that's a big problem.","Second is, if you look to the timing, they're going to receive feedback from a number of people, not just the trade association, but independent concerned parties in the fourth quarter. They need to then finalize the guideline and then start collecting the data. Another inconsistency of what they sent out is a view that we could start providing the data in the first quarter of 2016. While we can't provide the data until we have a final rule, so that's a contradiction in what they've sent out. So we're going to talk to them about that.","So as we all know, this has been pushed out. It's already been late and, again, this is supposed to be in a place where we're going to collect all the data in 2016 and refresh the clinical lab schedule by 2017. What I'm sharing with you is, it's already late and my sense is that we're going to have more delays in 2016 with finalizing the rules and then collecting the data and understanding how that does affect the clinical lab fee schedule. As far as the potential reductions of our clinical lab fee schedule, until we collect the data and I've said this all along, we don't know what the results are going to be.","Frankly, when we looked at the data we've gathered, we shared the Avalere study from the trade association. There were notable differences when you do a fair representative review of the marketplace and so we need to gather data to see what the results are. Now in their guidance that they've sent out, they did speak to a couple of estimates of what they think the range to be. And we've shared before that it's about 12% of our revenues for Quest Diagnostics. We're not going to speculate of what any reductions there could be because we're not certain about this, but it's 12% of our revenues or whatever reduction there may be would have an effect on that 12%. So, hopefully that's clear.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Hey. Good morning.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","So I guess, a follow-up on the utilization comment, I was hoping you could just add a little color to the comment around some of the market softness that you're seeing. Was that I guess overall utilization or should we think about that being specific to any particular sub-segment, like drug testing for example?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Mark, you want to...","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, that was overall. That was not segment specific. Generally, when we're commenting it's the largest portion of our business that we're commenting on any \u2013 not any of the unique sub-segments. So actually, we saw some pockets of strength so it seems as if some hiring may have picked up in the economy so actually that business is doing better than the broader business but it's kind of the base overall routine in esoteric testing volumes compared to the trend we have seen earlier seem to slow a bit in July and August especially.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And though we did see, as we said, we did see some pick-up at the end of the quarter and we did see good growth once again in our genetic and esoteric business. We said that last quarter as well. We're encouraged by that and our results on revenue per req is reflecting that. And we think that's an important aspect of our strategy for growth and an important aspect of our strategy for growing earnings, and you're seeing it reflected in our numbers, so we feel good. Prescription drug monitoring needs to be a nice growth opportunity for us and we continue to drive our wellness business which is something that we feel strongly about going forward as a good growth driver for us.","So it's really related to the overall base of business. We do the same store analysis we talked about before. We take our existing accounts that we know they're our accounts. We do analytic on that to prepare volumes this year versus last year and there was some softness in Q3 versus what we saw in the last few quarters. So it was notable, particularly at the start of the quarter and strengthened as the quarter continued.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Very good. And then just I guess one more on PAMA. You certainly kind of outlined a number of the limitations with respect to the proposed data collection document. Any way to ballpark kind of where you \u2013 or are what the odds of that getting expanded to including more hospitals? Steve, I mean, you spoke pretty confidently about some of the problems with the document and then mentioned obviously that you're going to be sitting down with these guys, or CMS rather in November, but where do you put the odds of potentially seeing that expanded to reflect a more broader representation of the industry?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I can't place odds on what happens in Washington. I don't think anyone can. We're working on this. We want to make sure we get this right. There is a bill passed by Congress. It's called Protecting Access to Medicare Act. It was intended to refresh our clinical lab fee schedule, which hasn't been updated since the 1980s. It was very strongly felt by Congress that the right way to do it is to take a market-based approach; look at the market, understand what our people are paying on the commercial side and then reflect that in the clinical lab fee schedule.","To exclude 50% of who's providing Medicare laboratory testing is a glaring flaw in the definition of the relative market. So we're going to be all over this. We have been all over this and we'll continue to work it. And again, it has been delayed. It's hard for us to understand how they're going to be able to collect the data in the early part of 2016 to be able to adjust this fee schedule in 2017, but that remains to be their goal. And we'll see how this evolves but I'm sharing with you exactly where we stand right now. And we have a huge initiative as a trade association but also in reflecting the access comments I made.","When you look at the large part of this marketplace being provided for by small independent laboratories and you think about those rates not being included in the market, we know that, that could create an issue for many of them and therefore, Medicare beneficiaries were not going to get the lab test and that's going to be a huge issue for Congress. So we're going to work our way through this but we're going to do this in due course of the process that we have within CMS.","Operator","The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, and good morning. I just wanted to ask another question on PAMA, and certainly understand we don't have perfect data today without the survey, but just as you look at the framework that CMS used to lay out what an applicable lab is, it appears, at least based on the definition today, that Quest and lab were going to be a good portion of the survey. I think it's around 1\/3. What do you think as you look at some of your rates on the routine side of the business versus what Medicare is today? Do you think the 6.5% cut that they laid out is a reasonable assumption to use?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, I'll repeat what I said earlier. Until they gather the data, it's hard for us to speculate what the results will be. We don't have, along with they, good visibility on the rates. That's why they want to gather the data. We don't know what other analysis commercial contract rates are by code. There's an enormous amount of data here. We have over 3,000 tests. We have multiple contracts. And if you read what they propose, it has to be done by TIN number, which adds more complexity. So if you look at what we have to do, it's a lot of reporting and we're just one of hundreds of labs that are required to report. So we've got to go through the data.","As far as what was in that report or in the guidance around an estimate, we're not sure where those estimates come from other than an interesting data point with some cherry-picked results that they've seen. We'll see what the data supports and we'll make sure there is sort of a thorough process to get to our fair rates in the marketplace for the value we deliver.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Jack, as I'm sure you're aware, when we looked at the Avalere study, even without hospitals, we didn't expect significant reductions in the clinical lab fee schedule. When we shared that, hospitals were included. In fact, in many cases, Medicare was paying less. So you then have the CBO scoring which is another data point which would suggest more reductions than Avalere but certainly not anything overly draconian and then you have what's come out from CMS based on their proposal being even higher. So these estimates are all over the board. As Steve said, until we get some actual data it's kind of hard to answer that question.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, that's fair. And then just one around the commentary around the M&A pipeline; do you think that some of the discussion around PAMA has either delayed some of the transactions taking place or does that change the way you evaluate targets in the market? Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all, many hospital outreach labs that we look at and we have purchased have a larger percentage of their business with Medicare. And so we do take into consideration what the Medicare rates will be in our evaluation of the business. Second is if that in fact is true, then we believe this could be a further catalyst of more outreach businesses interested in looking at their options. And what we've said we have a nice M&A pipeline. Many of those assets that we're considering are hospital outreach assets. And we're encouraged by it and we still believe with the projections of what we have for rates that on the cost synergies when you realize by bringing their volumes into our infrastructure, we can build a nice business case related to the cost synergies associated with those acquisitions.","So it's been a deliberate part of our strategy. It's key to what we believe will happen in this marketplace that is more hospitals relying on us for their laboratory services. And the second part of our working with hospitals or hospital outreach opportunities where we help them with their impatient laboratory, we are working on a number of very large opportunities there and we hope to share some of that with you in the next few months and going into 2016. So stay posted, but we're encouraged by the progress and I think all the change that we see happening in healthcare in general is going to be a further catalyst for more interest than what we've been talking about for several years.","Operator","The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may ask your question.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Amanda, how are you?","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Mark \u2013 good. Mark, I just had a follow-up, I don't think we specifically addressed why you guys expect to be at the lower end of revenue guidance for the year. I apologize if I missed that. Are we to assume it's because of some of the volume commentary you made or is there something else there that we should be thinking about?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's a large driver certainly, Amanda, but the other one is if you recall after the first quarter when we had a little more impact from weather than we had anticipated, at that point I shared that for us to get towards the upper end of the range, we would've had to execute some meaningful M&A. So while we went into the year thinking we could do the 2% to 3% without any M&A after the first quarter headwinds we had based on weather, especially in the Northeast, and in Boston specifically record snowfalls where we have a very important share and a large portion of our business that it was going to take some M&A.","So as you've seen that we have announced two deals this year, one of them just last night, Superior, and then MemorialCare. Those are not large enough at this point and we're not done early enough to contribute significantly in 2015. So therefore, a combination of a little bit of unexpected volume softness in Q3 and then not getting a deal done in a \u2013 large enough deal in a timely fashion is really the two drivers.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And then I had a question on Q2. I know it's a bit early there but I'm curious if you can talk about how the two companies are sort of going to market? Is there any evidence yet of any competitive advantages from the combination at this point recognizing it's still pretty early there?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it is still early but we're encouraged. We closed in July. We've consolidated our business into one Q2 Solutions. We are now working through the integration that we've put in place. We still believe there's a nice business case of a creation opportunity for the joint venture now that will realize 40% of in subsequent years so we're still encouraged by that.","And then second, to your point, the days are still early but this market has consolidated and we're now in a smaller subset of companies who are now addressing the marketplace and we believe that now with Quintiles and us working together, we have a stronger presence with pharma and we're optimistic about the prospects. So as that develops and we have some opportunities to talk about as far as wins within the joint venture, we will and I'm sure Quintiles will as well but it's still early with that but we're encouraged.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. You may ask your question.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bill.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions; so for the last several quarters and especially this quarter, you're starting to show some really impressive growth from an operating income standpoint, which is something that we haven't seen for years frankly. And I'm trying to understand as you look forward, whether you think that kind of leverage either through cost savings or other factors is sustainable into 2016 and beyond? Do you think if you don't see an uptick in sort of volume or pricing that it would be, you would have to revert back to sort of lower operating income growth or is there enough on the cost saving side that you can drive growth even if the macro environment sort of doesn't improve? And then I do have a follow-up after that.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, thanks for the question, Bill. I'm sure you recall that at the Investor Day in November, I talked about and Steve talked about the fact that we thought \u2013 we foresaw 2% to 5% revenue growth through 2017; 1% to 2% of that coming from M&A, so on organic level of growth of 1% to 3%, and earnings growth, not earnings per share but earnings growth, of 8% to 10%. And that was going to be fueled by three drivers. One was going to be some of the continued synergies and leverage we would get out of the transactions we executed in 2014 carrying into 2015. The second driver was our Invigorate program which moving our goal from $700 million in run rate savings to $1.3 billion and we didn't lay out how that would drop through by year.","But given the size of that growth in savings and efficiencies, we talked about the fact that contrary to the past several years, it would be large enough to not just offset the headwinds that Invigorate had paid for in the earlier years of the annual wage inflation and some sort of price erosion but actually would contribute to the bottom line and that that would be significant. And then yes, the third lever was as we return to organic growth and there's a fairly high drop-through and that would help us to leverage our earnings growth faster than revenue as well. So those are the three levers and while we're a little bit disappointed in the softness of Q3, we have grown.","As Steve pointed out, revenue was minus 400 basis points in 2013, minus 200 basis points last year and plus 100 basis points this year. So we are growing and we are getting some leverage and we expect to continue that progress. So a long-winded answer but while we haven't given any guidance for 2016 yet, the outlook I laid out would suggest yes we are confident that we will continue to grow our earnings faster than our top line.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Bill, just to follow up with that, I said in my introductory comments we continue to believe that we can deliver on that goal we set out which is the additional savings opportunity. We exited 2014 with $700 million run rate savings. We said there's another $600 million. The goal is now $1.3 billion. We are nicely on our way. We see that reflected in the results. But I'd like to also underscore another thing that you've seen in the last couple of quarters and that is the emphasis we have on our strategy is to continue to focus our energy and our investments on a higher growth portion of our portfolio; the richer portion of our portfolio which is more of the advanced esoteric, genetic based services. We have said that that's growing nicely.","You see that's reflected in our revenue per req so that headwinds that we've seen before in last two quarters we haven't seen. So we feel good about the progress we're making on that as well to make sure we get a better yield in our portfolio than what we've seen in the past. So you put all that together coupled with the M&A to just to underscore what Mark said, we believe that that 2% to 5% growth of this business over a three-year period is solid, and we believe the 8% to 10% growth in earnings, real earnings, operating income, is achievable. So we're confident we can continue to do that as we go forward.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. And then if I can, just one slightly unrelated follow-up. But you talked about potentially we could see some exciting stuff with big deals to manage hospital, even in-house labs, et cetera. Can you talk about as you think about what you're doing on the hospital side, whether it's managing hospital lab business directly or purchasing outpatient outreach business, but particularly the former, what impact that might have in terms of sort of metrics that we're looking at? And in particular, I'm thinking about capital intensity, return on invested capital, et cetera. Is that a higher return proposition for you and how does it fit from sort of just a margin standpoint?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bill, I'll begin with this and then I'll turn it to Mark on the returns and how that affects our goals we've laid out. First of all, it's both. And it's both managing hospitals' in-patient laboratories in some form. And in some cases, it might not be entirely, but some portion of it. And then finally is helping them with their outreach business. In some cases, we would acquire their outreach business, which we have done for the last three years.","And as so much in healthcare goes, you see one strategy, you see one strategy. So we've engaged with the C-Suite around their lab strategy. When this goes well, we are their lab partner going forward. We've demonstrated this already with a number of our joint ventures we have and a number of the outreach businesses we've acquired. We're clearly their lab partner going forward and I think this is a direction that we'll see more of in the future as this healthcare system in this country continues to evolve.","Now with these potential deals around what we call laboratory professional services and also outreach, they do affect our earnings and growth rate differently. And I think you're referring \u2013 or asking the question about return on invested capital. So, Mark, give us some perspective on both sides of the growth with hospitals.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, certainly, and thanks for the question, Bill. Let's start with the professional laboratory services. What we've talked about in the past is this is really organic. There's not a significant capital outlay. There might be a little bit of capital upfront as we transition some of the volumes into our labs and out of their labs, but it's anything of significance. It is lower margin versus buying someone's outreach business where we're capturing all the margin on a go-forward basis. The way these deals work is given our economies of scale and our efficiencies, we can save them significantly enough money to get them to sign a multiyear contract with us to perform that service for them and we basically split that savings with them as part of the negotiation, but we don't have a large capital outlay.","So from a ROIC perspective, these deals, while lower margin in our current business, are very attractive on a ROIC basis. And again, as I said, it's a source of organic growth that largely was unaddressable previously. So it's getting into a market and an area, in-patient, outpatient, that is a new source of growth for us on the top line.","On the outreach, we certainly expect to continue to pursue such deals. We've talked about how the economics work very well. They're basically paid out through cost synergies. We've demonstrated the ability to do that successfully. We know how to do that and we think it's excellent for our shareholders and it is part of the 2% to 5%. So when we talk 1% to 2% of M&A, it's really those outreach businesses, small tuck-and-fold and outreach or small labs, for that matter, but a portion of that's going to be outreach. And we can fund that within our operating cash flow and still maintain our commitment to delivering majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders.","So I wouldn't anticipate any significant shift in capital intensity to drive that strategy. Certainly, the professional laboratory service business is not going to require ton of capital. And finally, on the outreach and any other M&A, we've talked about the three metrics we use. One of them is that these need to be accretive to our ROIC plan of record by year three. So we're very focused to make sure even in the acquisitions that they're growing our ROIC.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Dave. How are you?","Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I'm well. Thanks. Wondering bigger picture, do you guys have a perspective or I was wondering if we could get your perspective on just kind of what do you see overall volume-wise given your results and your perspective here? Just kind of what the puts and takes are from a broader perspective relative to kind of what's likely to kind of resolve some of the softness that you saw in the last quarter? Is there something going on with the mix of high deductible health plans, with the newly insured? Again, your bigger picture take on what's going on volume-wise?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, sure, Dave. I'll take this to start and I'm sure Mark will add to it. First of all, if you look at the market, there is a bunch of puts and takes as you describe it. First of all, we believe the Affordable Care Act and the number of uninsured decreasing will add more lives to the system. What we've said consistently when people have insurance we believe they need what we do, therefore that would be good for us. Albeit, what we have seen so far for lives in the system for the Affordable Care Act are much less than what we anticipated back three years ago, as we all know. But we've said in the past few quarters that we are starting to see some of those Medicaid lives enter the system, so that is providing some volumes. And most people would agree that there will be increasingly less uninsured in this country in the years ahead, and that's what we have modeled in our expectations going forward.","So, that's number one. Number two is, there continues to be a push for higher deductible insurance programs offered to employer-based healthcare offerings in this country. We believe it's about 40% of employer-sponsored healthcare is high deductible and that clearly has put pressure on utilization. I've said before that, those of us that are blessed with being reasonably healthy are paying for the majority of our healthcare out of our own pocket. And so people have thought twice about using the system and most people would agree over the past seven years or so that some portion of the utilization softness has been caused by this effect, and we believe actually that, that will continue. There will be more and more pressure on employers. They'll be pushing more responsibility to employees. The employees will consider when and where they use the healthcare system and that will have an effect on utilization.","Now, with all that said, we think that's actually a good thing for our business, because we offer such a strong value proposition and we believe price transparency and the visibility of the wide variation on pricing in this industry is actually a good fact for us given our value and our prices in this industry are so attractive. So, that's the second effect. The third effect is we do have an aging population, us baby boomers. We already see that in our results. We talked about infectious disease growing.","We're seeing some nice growth in hepatitis C, as an example, where all baby boomers are encouraged to get tested given the new drugs on the marketplace to cure that. The age of the baby boomer slug of our marketplace will continue to grow. The population grows. So you put all that math together and we continue to believe that in the mid-term to long-term, this industry that we're in should be growing in value 2% to 3%. We believe there will be more value per test going forward given the advancements and the introduction of new genetic-based services that we have demonstrated in our results as well.","We believe that there are some submarkets that are growing faster than that, but some of that 2% to 3% is from the dynamics of what's happening overall in healthcare, as well, based upon more people with insurance, higher deductibles for those of us to get our healthcare from our employers, the aging population, and the growth in the population. So, hopefully that provides some perspective you're looking for, for what we see in the macro market overall.","Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, no, that's helpful color and I appreciate that. A quick follow-up. On the Inovalon announcement that you guys had recently; can you talk just very briefly about what your go-to-market strategy is there? Is that a product that your sales guys are capable of selling themselves given the footprint that they have, but the difference in what they're typically selling or do you have to rely on the Inovalon guys? How are you going to go to market with that? Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, great question. First of all, we're very encouraged about the prospect, the opportunity with Inovalon. The reason why we think this is so encouraging and why Inovalon thinks it's so encouraging is our presence in healthcare. So if you think about our presence, particularly in the work floor of healthcare, we have over 200,000 placements of our quarter entry results reporting system, called Care360. We interface with all the EMRs you can think of on the planet, the large EMR companies like Epic and Cerner and McKesson and also the small homegrown activities.","We sell to 50% of physicians in this country; we sell to 50% of hospitals, so we're right in the center of the ecosystem of healthcare, so therefore we have a large presence. And the nice thing about that is, what we will do with Inovalon is attach their capability into the workflow of physicians. So, it's not something they have to disrupt their workflow to get access to. And so we're working on the actual integration of their applications into our applications, so the physician or the administrator when they're working through the workup on the patient and the completion of gathering all the information on the patient, we'll be able to access all that information.","As far as go-to-market, like so much in healthcare, it's obviously complicated. We have people that call on physicians, both primary care physicians and all specialists. That portion of our sales force will be informed and we are talking to the customers about this prospect. We also have an information sales force. These are highly specialized people that can get into more of the content associated with this. And Inovalon as well is providing some capabilities on the ground level, as well as broadly to support the sale, as well, from a real specialist perspective.","So it's a hybrid sales approach, but we are encouraged about the prospects for us and Inovalon going forward and we have launched this in the fall to get off to a good running start going into 2016.","Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please limit yourselves to one question at this time.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bob.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Hey, Steve, on that Inovalon deal, I guess my question would be, how did you arrive at a 50%\/50% revenue share for it? It seems to me with the connectivity that you have that you cited, the data you have, aren't you bringing a lot more to the table? Can you maybe flesh that out?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, well, I appreciate you saying that, Bob. We believe we bring a lot of value to the table. On the same side, they bring all the content to the table and there's a lot of content. They've built a nice capability with their quality metrics application, the collection of all claims data real-time. So there's some very sophisticated approaches to gathering the information and serving that up to physicians. So we think the 50%\/50% split fairly recognizes the value we deliver and the value they deliver, and it's a good partnership. So we think that's a fair split, but we are happy about the value I think we bring to the table because we think it's a good opportunity for us.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Bob, just real quickly. I mean the analog might be some small independent lab came up with a new esoteric test, okay, so they created the whole test. They didn't have the ability to sell it to the health plans as well as we could, and then to do the pull-through with, as Steve said, our coverage, that it's going to be ordered basically like a CPT, kind of like a test. And so I think you'd say, okay, yes, 50%\/50% is pretty fair. They did the innovation, obviously they've got the IP, et cetera, and we're really the commercial arm to help sell that and educate people on the value and the opportunity.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","And just maybe a question on the cost associated with setting this up and then the deliverable itself. It's a one page of report or a two page, and maybe just, can you give like an anecdotal example of what the report might look like? And then, just lastly, how do you get the doc to pay for it? Is the payer going to pay for it? I mean how do we get over that hurdle?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, well, first of all, the reports vary based upon what you're asking for, so some of the patient history are nice, well-presented summary of patient history. The quality metrics are somewhat of a simple, this is what you need to do to close the gaps in Care related to quality metrics to qualify for stronger HEDIS Scores and your Star Ratings, so that's another report. As far as the pay for here, in many cases it will be the risk-taking organization, the insurance company would be the person that has the motivation to do this. But in other portions of this, particularly related to the HEDIS Scores, it could be the provider organization that's clearly incentive to do a better job of closing the gaps in Care and see the value, and therefore will pay us for this.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And in terms of the investment required, Bob, it was a little more complicated than adding a couple of test codes to our compendium. That's kind of the way you should think about it. It's not a significant investment required to get this capability in our Care360. Okay.","Operator","The last question comes from Michael Cherny with Evercore. Please limit yourself to one question. You may ask your question.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. I'll make it one simple question. It's a clarification question. Just, Mark, on the reported volume for the quarter, is there any way you can break out the M&A contribution? If I'm reading correctly, I believe the only deal that should have contributed is MemorialCare; so any sense on what's organic versus what came from M&A?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's pretty much all organic, Michael. And then the quarter M&A was less than 10 basis points.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's perfect. All right.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And as we said earlier, we expected some M&A sooner. We have got a nice funnel for M&A and you'll see that in subsequent months. But the third quarter was pretty clean, but it was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Stephen H.

Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and 2013 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.","A copy of our earnings press release is available, and a text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now here is Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I want to make sure that you have seen our recent announcements, so I want to touch on those briefly.","You have all heard our news announcing our new CFO, Mark Guinan. Mark will be joining us on July 29. Bob Hagemann will remain as our CFO until Mark's arrival, and Bob has agreed to provide a smooth transition to Mark. Again, I'd like to thank Bob for his years of service to Quest Diagnostics. Given the timing of the transition, we thought it'd be best for Dan and myself to handle today's call. We look forward to introducing Mark to all of you during the third quarter.","Second, we announced this morning that we have completed the sale of ibrutinib royalty rights for $485 million in cash. We'll talk more about these later in the call.","But I'd like to take you through the top line performance, share our thoughts on reimbursement and utilization trends as well as health care reform and review progress against our 5-point strategy. And then, Dan will provide the details on our results.","Since January, we have been saying that we anticipated continued revenue softness in the first half of this year and that our efforts to restore growth would result in gradual improvement through the rest of the year.","So as expected, revenues and earnings improved from the first quarter levels but were below the prior year. We saw a continued revenue softness in the second quarter due to lower health care utilization, which impacted many health care providers, as well as reductions in our reimbursement.","There are a number of factors that impacted our year-over-year comparisons. As you'll hear later from Dan, after considering those factors, our underlying volume was down about 1.5% versus the prior year. This compares to the first quarter, which was down about 2%.","In addition, revenues per requisition decreased 3.7% in the second quarter, primarily due to the combination of Medicare cuts and commercial pricing. The impact of the acquisition of Concentra's toxicology business, coupled -- contributed approximately 50 basis points of the decrease. We continue to expect underlying revenue per requisition before acquisitions to be down about 3% for the full year.","I'd like to discuss reimbursement, utilization pressures and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which is -- which have all been in the news recently. Well, last week, CMS proposed significant changes to the physician fee schedule and a mechanism to adjust the clinical lab fee schedule in the future. Proposed reductions in Medicare reimbursement did not come as a complete surprise. We have been saying that there will be continuing pricing pressure in our industry and have been preparing for it. And this has been one of the driving forces behind our Invigorate cost-reduction initiative.","The cuts proposed by Medicare last week could impact the industry and impact us. Reimbursement from services related to physician fee schedule for Medicare patients was approximately 3% of our 2012 consolidated revenues. However, the impact will be greater on smaller independent and hospital laboratories because they have a larger portion of Medicare business. I am participating with other industry leaders to proactively work with CMS regarding these proposals.","Last fall, at Investor Day, we introduced our expectation for annual average reimbursement pressure of 1.2% over a 3-year period. We took into account the known Medicare price cuts, sequestration, forecasted commercial payer price changes and potential other government reimbursement changes. There have also been widespread signs that utilization is softer than last year. Physician office visits and hospital admissions in the first half of 2013 are below the first half of 2012. Additionally, payers have cited lower medical cost as a driver of improved performance.","Finally, turning to the Affordable Care Act. It's now seemingly likely that the expected entry of the uninsured people into the health care systems will ramp up more slowly than initially anticipated. Less than half of the states are moving forward with Medicaid expansion, which was seen as a major entry point for the uninsured.","In addition, the exchanges are taking longer to develop than originally anticipated. And then finally, the delay on the employer mandate will see slower implementations of ACA. We still believe that the Affordable Care Act will be net positive for the industry and for our company but will take longer to see the benefits initially than expected.","But the longer term outlook for this market is attractive for a number of reasons: The population is aging and growing, more people will have access to health care, advances in genomics and advanced testing will lead to opportunities for personalized medicine, data analytics will improve quality and reduce costs and this industry continues to consolidate.","We have said before that 2013 is a building year, that we are making solid progress executing our 5-point strategy and that we expect stronger performance in the second half. The improvement in the second half is expected to be driven by easier comparisons, the impact of acquisitions, the benefit of investments we have made to drive growth, the excellent progress we're making with our Invigorate cost-reduction initiatives and benefits from share repurchases. We believe that the progress we have made this year will position us for a stronger 2014 despite the slower implementation of health care reform.","Now I would like to share a mid-year update on the progress we have been making, executing our 5-point business strategy. So let's start with driving operational excellence.","The Invigorate cost-reduction initiative is on track to deliver substantial savings this year. To date, it has mitigated much of the bottom line impact of revenue softness. We are currently on track to deliver more than $250 million in realized savings in 2013 versus 2012. We have shared -- we expect twice as much in savings in the second half of the year than in the first half. In addition, we are tracking very well against our goal to deliver $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2014. We're taking advantage of our size and scale to improve quality and are committed to our challenge to increase the $600 million goal to $1 billion beyond 2014.","The progress we are making on Invigorate flagship programs gives us confidence in the savings that we have projected. Last fall, we indicated that we had a highly complex organization that was not aligned with the market and our 2 highest priorities in the market, driving operational excellence and restoring growth.","This complexity was also inefficient. We said we had too many management layers and would remove between 400 to 600 management positions, resulting in expected run rate savings of $80 million. We have essentially completed the elimination of at least 3 layers from the organization and have reduced approximately 450 management positions from the company to date, with approximately another 50 reductions to come by the end of the year. So we are on track to achieve our expected run rate savings goal.","Invigorate initiatives are enabling us to do a better job driving efficiencies in purchasing, centralizing support functions so we can provide better customer service and rationalizing excess capacity in our laboratory network. We are also standardizing the way we manage data, the way we develop and use common business processes, enable them with enterprise IT systems.","Next, we have taken actions to restore growth. The near-term focus is on bringing sales and marketing excellence to Quest Diagnostics. Second is growing our esoteric testing through our disease focus and finally, partnering with hospitals and IDMs. So let's take a look at each of these elements.","Well, the reorganization of our sales force is complete. We have a different and simpler organization headed by new leaders. We have more salespeople who are better trained, better equipped, incented and more focused on calling on customers than before. We continue to make progress with our health plan relationships, and I am pleased that we have extended our relationship with CIGNA and look forward to a continued strong partnership with an innovative partner.","We have also signed agreements with a number of payers for diagnostic services offered on the new health insurance exchanges that are an important part of health care reform. We're improving the way we introduce new esoteric Diagnostic Information Services and are developing new service offerings linked to our new disease focused clinical franchises. We have invested in building 7 clinical franchises, organized by specialty disease state, with each led by its own general manager. We believe this is more thoughtful and will bring better solutions to the market that will generate additional growth.","To give you an example, our new Women's Health clinical franchise established our new strategic relationship with Hologic, which provides us an opportunity to ignite new business opportunities with a leader in women's health. This collaboration will focus primarily on cervical cancer and breast cancer. In addition, following the landmark Supreme Court decision on BRCA1 and 2, we're working to introduce a solution for breast cancer predisposition testing later this year.","And then finally, our hospital professional services team continues to see interest building from integrated delivery networks. We have increased activity at all phases of the pipeline, from initial discussions to sharing data to due diligence and contracting. All these factors give us confidence we will see results from our efforts build throughout the remainder of the year.","Our third strategy is to simplify the organization. We have deployed our new organization, shared corporate priorities, established new behaviors and are implementing a new management process with rewards and incentives. With our new organization, we now have a new senior management team comprised of the executives from the company when I joined in addition to the 5 new members since last year.","These individuals all come from senior positions at major publicly traded companies that brings significant leadership experience. Notably, we have just announced our new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Guinan. He comes to us with strong financial operational experience and we look forward to him joining us later this month. I'm confident that this new senior management team will instill the behaviors that we're looking for throughout the company.","Our fourth strategy is to refocus on the core Diagnostic Information Service business. Last year, we sold OralDNA dental diagnostic business. During the first half, we sold HemoCue and began the process to evaluate the Celera drug assets and Celera's products business.","We are pleased to complete today the sale of ibrutinib royalty rights to Royalty Pharma for $485 million in cash. We continue to hold the royalty rights for assets licensed to Pharmacyclics and Merck. Our portfolio review is resulting in asset sales that are providing additional flexibility for our fifth strategy, which is delivering disciplined capital deployment.","Our plan is to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The sale of HemoCue provided proceeds that helped us repurchase $405 million of shares in the second quarter, bringing year-to-date share repurchases to $467 million. We plan to use of the after-tax proceeds for the sale -- from the sale of ibrutinib royalty rights to drive shareholder value, consistent with our capital deployment strategy.","In addition, we completed the acquisitions of the lab outreach business of Dignity Health and Concentra's toxicology business, consistent with our goal of contributing 1% to 2% revenue growth per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. Well, despite the difficult operating environment, this progress gives us confidence that we are making the appropriate improvements needed and that we will see the benefits build throughout the remainder of this year and thereafter.","Now let's turn it over to Dan, and he'll go through the detailed analysis of the numbers. Dan?","Dan Haemmerle","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Q2 consolidated revenues of $1.8 billion were 3.3% below the prior year but 1.6% better than Q1 2013. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 3.6% below the prior year.","Volume was essentially flat, 0.1% better than a year ago. The 3 acquisitions completed this year, UMass, Dignity Health and Concentra's toxicology business, contributed approximately 1.6% in the quarter to volumes and are all on track versus our growth plans.","The contribution from acquisitions was essentially offset by softness in our underlying volumes of approximately 1.5%. While underlying volumes were softer than a year ago, they are approximately 0.5% better than what we experienced in Q1 of this year.","As we have shared previously, we expected to see continued volume softness in the first half of the year, with improvement in the second half due to more favorable year-over-year comparisons and building momentum on our efforts to restore growth. Revenue per requisition in Q2 was down 3.7% compared to the prior year. The impact of our 2 recent acquisitions, principally Concentra's toxicology business, lowered revenue per requisition by approximately 0.5%.","Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our underlying revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by approximately 3.2%. This 3.2% reduction in underlying revenue per requisition is largely due to the Medicare fee schedule reductions, including pathology reductions that went into effect on January 1 plus the 2% Medicare sequestration reductions implemented on April 1, as well as certain commercial fee schedule changes.","Consistent with the first quarter, positive test mix is essentially being offset by business mix. We've shared previously, we continue to expect that for the full year, the underlying reimbursement decline will average about 3%, with about 1% of the year-over-year impact we saw in the first half of the year expected to anniversary later in the year. And over the next several years, we continue to plan for average annual reimbursement pressure of 1% to 2% through 2015.","Q2 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, Clinical Trials, Healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, were flat compared to the prior year. This is a sequential improvement from the first quarter performance that was down about 2% compared to the prior year.","Adjusted operating income was 16.9% of revenues, about 1.7% below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues. A significant portion of the lower revenue is being offset by continued progress with our Invigorate initiative.","Adjusted EPS of $1.06 was $0.09 below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues, partially offset with cost savings realized from Invigorate. As a result of the company's ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence and to simplify the organization, restructuring and integration costs totaling $19 million reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1% and reported EPS by $0.07. Last year, in the second quarter, it included $15 million of costs associated with restructuring, integration and CEO succession, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 0.9% and reported EPS by $0.06.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.7% or 20 basis points higher than the prior year. DSOs were 48 days, up 2 days from last quarter. The increase in DSOs can be principally related to payment delays in connection with obtaining new provider numbers associated with recent acquisitions. We expect these issues to be resolved later this year.","Cash from operations was $208 million in the quarter compared to $251 million in the prior year. Lower cash from operations is largely due to the increase in DSOs, which we expect to reverse in the second half of the year. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the quarter compared to $47 million a year ago. During the quarter, we also repurchased 7.2 million common shares at a price of $55.92 for a total of $405 million. As expected, we deployed the proceeds received from the HemoCue disposition into share repurchases in the second quarter.","Turning to guidance. We continue to expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenues to be 1% to 2% below 2012, prior guidance was to approximate the prior year level, earnings per diluted share to be between $4.35 and $4.50 compared with prior guidance of $4.35 to $4.55, cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion compared to prior guidance that it would approximate $1 billion and capital expenditures to approximate $250 million.","In considering the full year guidance in the context of the first half performance, it is important to keep in mind several factors, as we've previously indicated that comps versus the prior year will become more favorable in the second half of the year. While the number of business days, coupled with the weather effect, adversely impacted revenues in the first half of the year, those same factors are expected to contribute favorable year-over-year comparisons in the second half of the year and be essentially neutral for the full year.","Underlying revenue per requisition, which was down approximately 3.3% in the first half versus the prior year, is expected to be down about 3% for the full year, with about 1% of the impact we saw in the first half to anniversary later this year.","Our 3 acquisitions contributed approximately 1% to revenues in the first half of the year and we expect those acquisitions to contribute approximately 2% in the second half of the year. Our efforts to restore growth are gaining traction and we expect to see increasing progress as the year unfolds. We saw a 0.5% improvement in year-over-year underlying volumes from Q1 to Q2 and expect it to continue to improve in the second half. And lastly, as Steve mentioned, we expect to see approximately twice the benefit from Invigorate in the second half as we saw in the first half.","For all these reasons, we have confidence in the expected performance improvement during the remainder of the year required to achieve our full year guidance. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Dan. Well, to summarize, we see 2013 as a building year as we improve operations and begin to restore growth. We are executing well on each element in our 5-point strategy. In the second half of 2013, we'll show improvements from many reasons, which we just discussed. And we continue to have confidence in executing our 5-point strategy will drive increased value for our shareholders over the long term. Now with that, we'd like to see if you have any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] At this time, we have a question from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just a few quick ones. A few quick questions, if I could. First, on the volumes. I think, Dan, you mentioned maybe 0.5% improvement from Q1 to Q2. I just wanted to make sure we understood. Is there any calendar impact there that also might have helped that trend a little bit in terms of leap day in the first quarter or the shifting of holidays and things like that?","Dan Haemmerle","There's really not a material change in the calendar. Most of the benefit that we expect to see from the differences in how we evaluate revenue days or business days comes in the back half of the year. So no real impact in the second quarter.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then as you're thinking about the ramp on sort of the core volume, as you put it, in the second half, I mean, you describe a lot, Steve, of the things you've been doing on the sales force front. Can you help us understand the visibility on some of the specifics in terms of targeted clients or targeted market share that you expect to gain or where some of that's going to come from, or do you have that sort of visibility on the ramp that you're expecting?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Absolutely. Well, Tom, let's do this. Let's walk through -- again, we'll walk through why we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. And then what are, within that discussion, our expectations for what's described as organic improvement in the second half versus the first half. So Dan, why don't you walk through a bridge, if you will, between the first half and the second half?","Dan Haemmerle","Yes. And maybe the way to think about it is if we look at the second half performance and you look at our outlook for the remainder of the year, you're looking at a range plus or minus of about 2% revenue growth in the back half of the year. If you break down the components the way we're looking at it, we think about revenue per requisition. We said it was down about a little more than 3%, about 3.3% in the first half of the year. It will improve by about 1 point in the second half. So we expect to see revenue per requisition lower than the prior year by about 2.5%, okay? And that'll get us to our full year average of 3%, so about 2.5% down on revenue per requisition. We've done 3 different acquisitions. We've also got the benefit of the revenue days, as well as the weather impact that we expect to see turn favorable on the back half of the year due to Sandy in Q4 of last year. And if you put the acquisitions in those easier comps together, that's worth about 3.5%, maybe a little bit more than 3.5%. So that leaves about 1 point of growth from our underlying businesses. And as we look at it, we are building momentum in the underlying businesses, both our Diagnostic Information Services businesses through our restore growth initiatives, as well as our Diagnostic Solutions business, which is also building momentum and expected to both provide a positive contribution for the full year. So about 1 point will come from our underlying business and a combination of both Diagnostic Information Services and Diagnostic Solutions.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Great, Dan. So Tom, to answer your question, so given that as the opportunity that we really need to improve, we do have a great line of sight to what we need to get done in the second half. Let me give you a couple of examples. First of all, we are building our professional services business that I mentioned in my introductory comments, that is building momentum. There's a lot of interest in it and we will see some volume from that in the second half versus the first half, number one. Second is we have line of sight to a number of accounts, a number of programs we're working with payors that our sales force is driving. And we have confidence, given the traction we've seen in the second quarter, that will continue into the third quarter, into the fourth quarter. Dan also mentioned that we are going to see growth in the second half versus the first half from our Diagnostic Solutions business. So without giving you all the detail, we do have good line of sight on what we need to do to deliver our guidance for the full year and the second half on the top line. And then as far as the bottom line, we also believe that we have good line of sight given the current environment that I have indicated in my introductory comments to be able to deliver guidance for earnings for the year as well. So we're going to turn it back for any other questions.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's very helpful. Just to make sure I understand the change in the revenue guidance, is that 1% growth that you're expecting from the core sort of similar to what it was before and the reduction overall just from a macro standpoint? Or is that 1% core number sort of changed in your minds as well?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, it's slightly lower, Tom. Basically, the environment we see right now is not as strong as what we thought we were going to see this year. As we entered Q2, we are actually encouraged by April numbers. As we got further into Q2, we started to see more reports back from various sources about softening in the marketplace. We saw that in ourselves in the second quarter. And so therefore, we thought it'd be prudent going forward that we take that in consideration with our full year guidance and that's reflected in what we expect to get organically out of the business. But overall, the environment is softer than we expected entering the year and we thought it appropriate at this point of the year to adjust our guidance for the top line. However, what you'll also hear in our remarks, we are moving very, very well against our cost improvement goals. We're making excellent progress with Invigorate. And so what we have also said is we will balance that off with strong contributions through Invigorate in the second half. We've also indicated in June, we are reinforcing it today, is that we expected twice as much contribution from Invigorate in the second half than we saw on the first half.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right, right. Just last question then. On cash, it sounded like some of the cash flow issues that you saw in the quarter, you expect to sort of reverse out as you get the provider numbers nailed down. You did slightly tweak. It seems like your cash flow expectation is low for the year, down a little bit, so I just wanted to make sure we could understand that.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure, sure. Why don't you bring -- put Tom through what happened with DSOs and the overall cash expectations.","Dan Haemmerle","Yes, and 2 comments. One, Tom, just back to the last question quickly that approximately 1%, I was giving you in that walk across is kind of a mid -- gets you to the midpoint of the range, so just a point of clarification there. And then secondly is on the DSOs. DSOs were a little bit higher, they're about 2 days higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. And with many acquisitions, you have to file for a new provider number with -- for certain payors. We're filing with certain government payers right now and we have little bit of a delay in getting some of those provider numbers for those acquisitions. So as a result, we have some claims that we're confident to get reimbursed once we get those provider numbers in and we expect that to get cleaned up in the second half.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right. Now that -- so I understood that. I was just curious. So it seemed like I think your old guidance was for about $1 billion of cash flow. Now you're sort of approaching $1 billion of cash, so maybe, it's the small nuance. But if that -- if the provider number issue reverses itself out, what's the reasoning sort of for, I guess, cash flow that's a little lower for the year?","Dan Haemmerle","Yes. And so the change in the cash flow for the full year is really just reflected in bringing down the top end of our EPS range a little bit. And also as we look at cash flow and managing our balance sheet, we felt that we wanted to give clear guidance that we're going to be approaching $1 billion, the higher end of the range of approximately, probably not going to go much further north of that, but approaching $1 billion we felt more comfortable with.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just going back to the pricing decrease that we've seen. You said the underlying pricing was negative 3.2%, a lot of it due to Medicare. Just wondering if you could break out how much pressure you're seeing from the commercial payers.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure. So let's walk through exactly what's going on with pricing. Again, we've provided guidance that we would expect this year about 3%. What we saw in Q2 was in line with that expectation, and Dan will bring you through exactly how this is phasing throughout the year, which is important in it. As you know, definitely, this is a mix between our Medicare and our commercial payers. And some of this does anniversary throughout the year and that's what we reflected in our second half expectations as well. So Dan, walk him through what we come up with the numbers.","Dan Haemmerle","In terms of the pricing, Kevin, there are 3 primary drivers of the reimbursement reductions. One is the Medicare cuts that we, I think, all anticipated coming into the year that included the Middle Class Tax Relief Act, as well as the ACA changes. And then thirdly, we also included in that number an estimate for sequestration. We planned for it to take place. And if you put those components together, that's worth about 5% against our Medicare book of business, okay? Our Medicare book of business is about a little bit north of $1 billion or approximately $1 billion in total. So 5% off of that number is the first element. Second element is the Anatomic Pathology cuts, again, another set of cuts from Medicare, specifically on a handful of codes, specifically 8305, which enjoyed a 52% reduction on the technical component. And then the third component is really related to the commercial contracts with commercial payers. Some of those contracts changes took place late last year and there were some contracts that showed pricing reductions January 1 of this year, okay? So as you think about it, the majority of the Medicare cuts took place on January 1 and will carry through the entire year. One element of the Medicare cuts, the sequestration cut, went into effect April 1. And then the commercial payer cuts, we have some that have started on January 1, some that started late last year and it will anniversary later in the year and will show that point of improvement for us.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Do you expect to see -- once you annualize and anniversary the commercial pricing pressures, do you expect to see further pressure from the Managed Care payers? Or do you think we're kind of at a point where we could start to see some improvements actually?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. So Kevin, what we said back last fall in our Investor Day that we expected a 1% to 2% erosion in our price related to the pricing pressure. We also have said that we expect 3% in 2013, but we're still believing that the 1% to 2% guidance for that 3-year period is a good range. That will absorb what we knew already from the government side. Also, we have less contract negotiations in 2014 than we did in 2013, and we think that estimate is still reasonable where we sit right now.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. Okay. And then going to the proposed Medicare fee schedule and the comment that they might look at repricing the clinical lab fee schedule down the road, I'm just wondering what efforts are being made in Washington to mitigate some of these potential cuts. And let's say it were to go through, Steve, what could you do internally to offset some of these pressures?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","I'll continue to do what we're doing. First of all, we are working with our trade association, ACLA, proactively on this. We actually met this week on it and are meeting weekly to talk through this with CMS. And so all the leaders of ACLA are part of this effort. As we said, at least in the physician fee schedule, it will have an impact on the industry and us to a lesser extent because we have less Medicare business as a percentage of our total business than some of the other providers of our service in the marketplace. The second is we did anticipate, Kevin, that there will be further cuts. I said this in my introductory remarks. We actually assumed some further cuts in our -- 1% to 2%, just to be prudent. So we had planned for this and we, because of it, have been really putting the accelerator down on Invigorate. And what you should see and what we've talked about, we will see more in the second half, is continued progress on the efficiencies that we're getting throughout our organization. We'll see twice as much improvement for Invigorate in the second half than there was in the first half. We are feeling very comfortable with the goal to get to $600 million of run rate savings by 2014. And we're still pushing the organization to get to $1 billion at some point after 2014. So we believe that what we're hearing is something that we somewhat expected within reason. We don't know the details. We obviously want to make sure that we carefully walk through the best outcome with the industry leadership to get to the best place for us. But what we're doing about it is exactly what we have said before. We're executing our 5-point strategy and we're driving as much efficiency gain as soon as possible out of our business to be able to absorb that and deliver our expectations for 2014 and beyond. So we're working on the plan as we've shared before.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then 2 last quick questions here. Bad debt, we did see that 20 basis point increase on a year-over-year basis. Just wondering if there's anything unusual going on behind that. And then lastly, on the capital deployment, in the $300 million after tax that you'll get from ibrutinib, do you plan to allocate that equally between acquisitions and share repurchases or maybe see a dividend increase?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","So Dan, let's take the -- on the bad debt question.","Dan Haemmerle","Yes. On the bad debt, it's slightly higher, it's about 20 basis points higher. And with -- from one quarter to the next, 10 to 20 basis points is really in the range of normal fluctuation for our business. So we don't see it as a signal and we don't see it signaling a different trend at this point.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","And as far as the proceeds from ibrutinib, we're going to continue to do what we said, that is we're going to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders and we'll continue to act on our disciplined capital deployment strategy that we have in place. And the return that we have given to our shareholders have been in the form of dividends and share repurchases and that's what we expect to do going forward. We still have some time to complete the ASR that we put in place this spring. We'll work through that, and then we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. But we're stand behind our commitment on what we said and we're standing behind our strategy of disciplined capital deployment as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So first of all, just one clarification, does the '13 guidance include the deployment of the cash from the sale of the Royalty that you announced today?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes.","Dan Haemmerle","Yes. The cash from the proceeds, we will use it at some point. Whether or not we use it for -- we will use it in one way or another, consistent with our capital deployment strategy, but we don't see it having a meaningful impact in the back half of the year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then thank you very much for all the transparency and all the detailed comments on...","Stephen H. Rusckowski","I'm glad you find it useful.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's very useful. So just one more clarification on the pricing side. So when you think about your expectations for next year and longer term for pricing to come down by negative 1% to 2%, if we factor in the proposal in the physician fee schedule, I think that accounts for about 75 basis points based on our rough estimates. So can you just help us to better understand what are your kind of like assumptions heading into the clinical fee schedule, I think that's coming out in August, for potential rate cuts?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, understood. So let's walk through this again. Our estimate last fall was 1% to 2% over a 3-year period, more in 2013, less thereafter. We assumed in that what we knew about government reimbursement. And I mentioned in my comments is that the physician fee schedule represented about 3% of our revenue in 2012. And Dan, why don't you bring through how this is going to wash through, what our assumptions are so far?","Dan Haemmerle","Yes. So as we've looked at this, Ricky, and there's a number of moving pieces to the latest proposal that we're still working our way through and we continue to work with the trade association to better understand it. But as Steve mentioned, the physician fee schedule is about 3% of our 2012 annual revenues. That number is coming down a little bit in 2013. It's probably running closer to a 2% number as the Medicare cuts on the pathology codes were implemented January 1, so that's having a drag on that number. And we also have seen that the carryover impact to some of the pathology in-sourcing that occurred late last year into this year that it brings that number down closer to a 2% zone for the 2013 percent of revenues for the physician fee schedule. So we -- as we've said, we still are evaluating it, we're trying to understand it. We have some follow-up questions on the current proposal. And when we have some more detail on that, we will share it. And with respect to the clinical lab fee schedule question, we have contemplated government pressure in the long term, 1% to 2% guidance. In terms of splitting out our projections and our thought process beyond what we've already shared, we're not planning to do that today, not prepared to do that today.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. And the other comment I'll make is the 26% that we've seen is an average. That average that we're going through to understand what the real impact will be on us. Based upon our mix, we think it will be less than that 26%. And so what you see is that 2% of our business today, something less than what was indicated as the average. If you do the math in that, you can see what the impact will be for us in 2014. As far as the clinical schedule, yes, that is more uncertain. We're proactively working with the trade association to understand the intentions of CMS, what the timeframe is, what the logic is. The mechanism that was discussed was a mechanism around technology and with technology, it makes us more efficient. And a large portion of our value chain, yes, is running a large centralized efficient laboratories, but a large percentage of our value is the beginning of that process and the end of that process. And so we still have a lot of our cost structure that wasn't necessarily affected by some of the technology that we're referring to. So we're working through this one and has more question marks associated with it. But we believe, again, based on what we know today, based upon what we already knew going into this year with the government reimbursement changes, what we just had heard, what we see in our forecast for renegotiations with commercial players that we'll still stay within that envelope of 1% to 2% over that 3-year period that we indicated earlier. So that's where we are today.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just to help us understand it, what percent of the Managed Care commercial book is tied to this Medicare book?","Dan Haemmerle","We have hundreds of Managed Care contracts, as we've said in the past, and we have very few that are tied to or float with Medicare rates.","Operator","Our next question, from Dane Leone, Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","I guess, I'll leave it at one since the call is dragging on a bit. I think one question that really could use some vetting here is the competitive landscape. There is smaller, I guess, national lab at this point that is public that has grown rapidly, has increased its revenue base. It's centered in the Northeast, but it's expanding nationally. And it just -- when you look at the growth rates between yourself, LabCorp and the other lab, Bio-Reference, there does seem to be some underlying share shift, some share loss. And I guess the question here is, is that something you're seeing? Is there a mitigation of loss strategy that you're looking to do as the new management team here? And really, any detail about competitive offerings would be very helpful.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Appreciate that. First of all, if you recall in our Investor Day in the fall, we've shared our expectations for the market. We think this market has grown in the past and we actually believe this market will grow going forward. Even though we have some slowdown in utilization, we do believe that the Affordable Care Act will be net positive for this industry and for us. And we do believe that this market, given what I said earlier, will grow around 4%. What I also said back in the fall is we haven't grown with the market and therefore, we have lost share and that therefore, we needed to do something about it. And one of our points of our 5-point strategy is to restore growth. And so what I shared with you in my update is what we're doing to improve our performance of getting at the market and doing a better job in the competitive sense of the marketplace. And we have 3 areas of priorities for this year. First is related to our sales force. So what we have done is reorganized our sales force. We have put in place a better sales team than before. We have trained those people, have equipped those people, have aligned those people and those people are very, very engaged on calling customers everyday. So point number one is I believe that what we have in place today is better execution going at the marketplace from a sales perspective. So that's the first point. Second is we believe that some of our competitors have done a better job of introducing innovative products to the marketplace. We have changed our organization to align around the need for us to bring our innovation to the marketplace in a smarter way and more thoughtful way. And what we've done to affect that in our reorganization is we created a clinical franchise organization. We have 7 clinical franchises, each of which have a General Manager. And the example I gave you in my script is, one example of that is in Women's Health, that an effort in Women's Health lead to our relationship with Hologic and that will position us well in the whole field of Women's Health and will allow us to introduce sometime this year, a solution around BRCA1 and BRCA2. So introduction of solutions in the marketplace that are specific to patient problems, aligned around disease and specialties is the second area of investment we are making and that we believe we will see some of that benefit in the second half. And I believe some of our competitors in this marketplace, not just the large players but some of the niche players, have done a better job in the past and we learned from that. And we actually will respond to that with our clinical franchise organization in bringing more solutions to the market. Third is this market is changing. Integrated delivery networks are stronger than ever before, where there are acquisitions of physicians. We've created a brand-new organization that we call our professional services organization. They partner with integrated delivery networks to understand what we can continue to do with many of those around referenced testing, which is the base, if you will, of our relationships -- are with those organizations. Actually, in fact, if you look at the top 100 hospitals ranked by US News & World Report, we actually do business -- reference business for about 90% of those top hospitals. And so with those strong relationships, we are very engaged in discussions around what we need to do with laboratory management relationships or what we potentially do if they want to by taking on their outreach business. And the examples of Dignity Health and UMass are great examples of that. So we're building that. So those 3 initiatives this year have been our focus. Those 3 initiatives have been our investments that we have made in this year. And we feel with our focus there, that will allow us to make progress this year. We have said going into this year that this year is a building year. We believe this is an attractive market, but we need to do much better as an organization, executing in that market. And we believe we've made excellent progress in the first half and we believe we'll see some of that in the second half, gradual improvement. Now the other side of this is we've talked a lot about operational excellence and what we're getting out of that in terms of the efficiency. Let me also say that we're focused on making sure we provide a superior customer experience to our customers everyday. So along with the efficiency gains in that program, we're also very focused on the whole value chain of what we're doing in our patient services centers, what we're doing with our responsiveness and the quality of our laboratories and what we're doing to improve our building capability. So along with the efficiencies we are getting out of that program, we also expect to get improvements in our quality and our execution around superior customer experience. So we believe we've made a very good progress in the first half. That progress will allow us to achieve what we just shared with you in the second half. We'll see some of the results in the second half from all these efforts so far. So hopefully, that provides some more clarity.","Operator","Our last question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to clarify on that earlier question regarding market share, should we assume that your guidance does imply a little bit share gain at the back half of the year? And if so, can you maybe quantify that in the context of the bridge that Dan went through earlier?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, not sure you could apply that. First of all, there was a question asked whether we have good line of sight on what we need to do to deliver our guidance. We believe we do. And we believe the expectation for the second half is reasonable, given what we already know about what we'll get out of acquisitions, what we'll see with our price changes and also what's going to happen with the comparison versus the prior year. So we have good line of sight. Now what we also have, Isaac, is, with this line of sight, we're going to see some of the benefits of the investments we have made in the first half with the sales force, with new solutions in the marketplace and also with our professional services business. That will get us to our guidance. When the dust settles in 2013, we'll be able to evaluate whether in fact we stayed with the market or we actually gained some share. We don't know that yet, but we're focused on executing our plan and focused on executing. And we think the guidance we provided is reasonable based upon what we know and what we're doing.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, helpful. And then as a follow-up, on your point earlier about some of the cost savings initiatives that are going on, is it fair to say that we should see sort of a sequential improvement in EBIT margins in the back half of the year, or is there sort of a seasonality out in here you want to just keep in mind?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. So what we shared in June is we expect twice as much of the contribution from Invigorate than we saw in the first half. What we shared with you today is we said the realized improvement versus 2012 is $250 million. So you can go through the math and when you go through that, you'll be able to see what in fact we do expect in the second half. And Dan, would you like to add to that?","Dan Haemmerle","No, I think that's right. You've got $250 million realized in the -- it's more than $250 million realized in the current year and we expect to see twice as much savings in the back half of the year as the first half. So you can run through that, we're not giving specific EBIT or operating income percentage guidance or anything like that, but you should see some improvement in the back half of the year.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one last cleanup here on the ibrutinib monetization. It sounded like you guys are leaning towards using the vast majority of that for a return to shareholders. Is it possible that some reasonable percentage might be used for strategic use as well?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Again, we will return the majority of the free cash flow to our shareholders. We have a disciplined capital deployment plan and strategy. We're standing behind that. We'll approach this proceed with that in mind. We believe that one way that we can continue to return the majority of free cash flow to our shareholders, it will be from our dividend and also share repurchases. But also, to your question, we are continuing to look for acquisitions that support our goal in that regard related to getting to a 1% to 2% revenue growth from acquisitions. I'm also pleased to say that we've got there in the second half. You see that we're looking year-on-year at 2% improvement in our top line related acquisitions we've done so far. We're continuing to work on those. And so therefore, there might be some portion of our capital that's used for those in the second half as well. I can't speculate on that at this point. But we're staying the course with our 5-point strategy and deliver disciplined capital deployment in the back half as we've done so far.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter Conference Call.

Go ahead, please.","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.","Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This morning I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.","Well, we continued to make progress on our path forward, delivering a strong year and positioning ourselves very well for 2016. Before turning to the quarter, let me recap our performance for the year.","Revenues grew by 2% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues expanded by about 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by 6%.","In the fourth quarter, revenues were $1.85 billion, growing by 60 basis points on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.19, and this represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year EPS growth.","Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about our industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to the PAMA legislation, which as you know, stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. As you have heard me say before, PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the market. The current proposal limits the definition of an applicable lab to exclude a large portion of the market. We also believe that a 2017 effective date will be a significant challenge for all parties. With strong support from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and members of Congress, we remain optimistic that together industry and government can still achieve a reasonable outcome.","Second, I would like to discuss the proposed FDA guidance on regulation of laboratory developed tests. We understand the FDA's concerns, but we continue to believe what the FDA has proposed would result in labs being subject to both CLIA and FDA regulations that may be overlapping, duplicative, and sometimes contradictory in their requirements. This has the potential to raise healthcare costs for patients and potentially, hinder medical innovation.","The House Draft Legislation is a good first step in the legislative process. We share ACLA's goals of promoting and supporting diagnostic innovations that provide physicians with the insights necessary to advance patient care and save lives. We want to work with Congress to get the right balance in legislation; right for the industry, right for physicians, and right for patients who depend upon our diagnostic insights to make informed healthcare decisions every day.","Now, let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment.","So, starting with growth, just three years ago this business was shrinking by more than 4%. We slowed the organic decline to 2% in 2014 and have now grown organically on an equivalent basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. We grew 2015 full year revenues by 2% on an equivalent basis and we are well positioned for 2016.","Our gene-based and esoteric testing business grew by approximately 5% to $1.8 billion for the year. We continued to see strong growth in our infectious disease testing and prescription drug monitoring. Additionally, in late 2015 we launched two companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer. This week we announced another complementary diagnostic test for melanoma.","Quest's expertise, scale, and collaborations with the top organizations such as Dako and Bristol-Myers Squibb position us to provide companion and complementary diagnostic test services for immunotherapies on a scale other providers can't match. We are encouraged by the progress of our clinical franchise teams and expect to continue to build more momentum going forward.","Second, over the past few years, we have outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We've shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us to develop and execute their lab strategy. In November, we announced the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business. We have been working on detailed integration plans and now expect the relationship to close later in the first quarter of 2016.","In December, we announced a professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's number one health system. Under this relationship, we will manage inpatient laboratory test services for seven of their locations throughout New Jersey. We are currently working through the transition plans. We expect clinical testing volumes to be fully transitioned by mid-year 2016.","These are two strong proof points of our evolving market where hospitals are looking for high value world-class partners. We continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities we have developed.","In addition, we are building our portfolio of health information technology solutions. Our capabilities help payers, providers, and patients to improve patient care, lowering cost to manage populations.","We're rolling out our new suite of solutions called Quantum internally to our sales force this week. A good example of Quantum solution is our recent partnership with Inovalon to deliver real-time insights at the point of care, which we call Data Diagnostics.","We launched this solution in December, are seeing strong interest, and have already begun to sign business. We are very encouraged by the opportunity. You'll hear more about our Data Diagnostics and our Quantum solution later this quarter at HIMSS.","The second element in our strategy is driving operational excellence. At our Investor Day in November 2014, we outlined our goal to increase our cumulative run rate savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. To achieve that, we need to deliver an additional $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017. And we've made progress on our major objectives of our program, which include building e-enabling services, standardizing our processes, data and systems and improving cash collections.","We delivered over $200 million in realized savings in 2015. This enabled us to deliver 10% growth in pre-tax earnings for the year as we continue to move closer to our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion. Now, we're doing all this as we improve our customer experience at the same time that we lower our costs by removing waste from the system.","We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. During the year, we launched our new brand promise. We call it Action from Insight. Our brand promises more than a refreshed logo. It's really about recommitting to a superior customer experience.","We recently launched Everyday Excellence, a new initiative that focuses on our customers. We've already rolled it out to more than one-third of our workforce, but it's not just about our frontline employees. Everyday Excellence is for all of us, all of our employees, and it starts with me.","We've also invested and trained over 150 senior leaders at our Leading Quest Academy. And we've deployed our Quest management system to create a standard framework for running our business.","Our 44,000 employees are key to our success. Actually, in a recent companywide survey we experienced a record rate of engagement from our employees, and the results put us on par or above performance of high performing companies in several key areas.","There is a clear link between employee engagement and performance at the most successful companies. Our employees are providing us with valuable feedback, and we are listening. On a recent visit to our facilities in California, as with so many visits with our operations, I came away both impressed and grateful for our employees' passion and commitment to our customers.","The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business. During the year, we contributed our clinical trials testing business into the newly formed joint venture with Quintiles called Q2 Solutions. The JV's performance is on track with our expectations, and we're excited to be part of this growing business.","And then finally, we remain committed to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. In 2015, we returned over $400 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We returned 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, well in excess of our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders.","During the quarter, we increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $500 million. And then earlier today, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend; this is our fifth dividend increase since 2011.","Along with all this, we continue to invest in our business. We announced the Hartford HealthCare Outreach acquisition in the quarter and closed two acquisitions earlier in 2015. These acquisitions are aligned to our objective of growing revenues through strategically aligned M&A.","Now, Mark will provide an overview on our fourth-quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2016 outlook, which considers several of the recently announced relationships I noted earlier. Mark?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $1.85 billion increased 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis; that is, excluding the fourth-quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue. On a reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.8%.","Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew by 40 basis points versus a year ago. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew by 30 basis points versus the prior year. Volume grew on an organic basis by 20 basis points.","Revenue per requisition was 10 basis points better than the prior year. Reimbursement pressure was moderate in the quarter and for the year, which is consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Both test and business mix continue to have net positive impact, reflecting our strategy to grow our esoteric testing and drive profitable growth.","Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $288 million or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $283 million or 15% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 50 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program and business mix.","For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization was $1.19, or 80 basis points better than a year ago. Fourth quarter 2015 reported income from continuing operations includes a net benefit of $31 million or $0.21 per share related to deferred income tax benefits recognized during the quarter, partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs.","In the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations included a net benefit of $27 million or $0.18 per share from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies, offset by charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.5%, 30 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than last quarter. This is primarily due to a one-time bad debt benefit in the fourth quarter. It remains a challenging collection environment and we remain focused on improving our operational activities.","Our DSOs were 47 days, one day lower than the prior year and three days higher than last quarter.","Reported cash provided by operations was $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago largely due to an additional payroll cycle this year.","Excluding the net cash charges related to the recent debt refinancing, adjusted cash provided by operations was $899 million for the full year 2015. Capital expenditures were $94 million in the quarter compared to $89 million a year ago. Total capital expenditures in 2015 were $263 million.","Before moving to guidance, I'll share a few comments to help you think about our outlook. First, a few of you recently asked about the 8% to 10% earnings CAGR shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Reflecting on 2015, we delivered 6% adjusted earnings, excluding amortization.","Keep in mind that the compare in 2015 was negatively impacted by amortization and a discrete tax benefit in 2014. These two items reduced our reported earnings growth by about 2%, mostly because we beat our 2014 estimate by $0.05. Taking these items into consideration, we feel we are on track compared to our objectives outlined at Investor Day in 2014.","Second, because of the newly formed Q2 Solutions JV, we no longer consolidate the clinical trials revenue. Our clinical trials business reported revenues of $85 million in the first half of 2015 that you should consider as you update your model.","Finally, as you think about our revenue projections, we have been on a favorable trajectory, but one that has been building over time. We expect that we will continue to show improvement as we progress through the year. Specifically, you should consider the Barnabas Health opportunity that will phase in over the first half of the year and the recently announced Outreach acquisition which we expect to be completed late in the first quarter.","Moving to guidance, we now expect full year 2016 results before special items as follows. Revenues are expected to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% on an equivalent basis. For comparative purposes, equivalent revenues will exclude the 2015 revenues associated with our clinical trials business. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $50 million to $300 million.","Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks, Mark. Well, we believe we have the right strategy to restore growth and build value for our shareholders. We delivered another solid quarter and a good year. We're building momentum with our focus on advanced testing. Hospital partnerships are building and our expansion of our health information solutions activities is promising. We have now delivered adjusted EPS growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. We are well positioned to deliver on our commitments for 2016.","Now with that, we'd be happy to take any of your questions.","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. Our first question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","(20:50) ...regarding the underlying assumptions on guidance, obviously you have upped your buyback allocation to over $1 billion. Can you just share with us what's kind of like your assumptions for capital deployment? Are you assuming any buybacks now and if so, kind of, like the magnitude?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So Ricky, I thank you for the question; good morning. In the EPS guidance, it assumes a flat share count. So at this point, depending as we always talk about, the best value-creation opportunity between M&A and share buybacks, we may end up deploying more towards buybacks. We may end up reducing the share count. But at this point, EPS guidance assumes a flat share count.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And the topline assumes some capital deployment?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. The topline at this point is built based on some organic growth, including the Barnabas Health deal, and then the only M&A that we have explicitly in there at this point is the Hartford Outreach acquisition. But obviously, we give a range, and so within that range there's various scenarios between organic and inorganic growth.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And can I have just one follow-up? Just when you think about kind of like the early hospital partnerships that you've signed \u2013 not this year but the year before and we think about it as case studies \u2013 what type of growth are you seeing from these kind of like early partnerships that we can think about as kind of like a framework for the new deals that you've signed recently?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're building the business, Ricky, so with building any business this is part of our growth strategy, is to focus on these hospital partnerships, and we find the receptivity of hospital systems quite promising. And we've talked about in the past, we now have a number of deals that are already in our revenues in 2015. And we announced Barnabas in the fourth quarter, so that will start to show up in 2016. And again, these are growth rates of our organic revenues that Mark talked about.","And then finally, as we have a nice robust funnel, more prospects in 2016. So we believe that this business will continue to build and contribute to our growth prospects for the company going forward. So that's the way we look at it.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Ricky.","Operator","Our next question is from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jack.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Jack.","Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks. This is actually Mitchell Petersen calling in for Jack this morning. Last quarter, I know you guys talked about utilization levels and how they are little bit weaker in 3Q, but trending positively. I was wondering if you could call out the trends you've been seeing on utilization per customer throughout the quarter.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. We've talked about it in the past. We do this test where we take a look at our known accounts that are our accounts; we have about 1,000. We look at year-on-year comparison. We did that in Q3 and we said that volumes picked up at the end of the quarter. And we've done that again in Q4, and what we'll say at this time is when we look at that it's feeling like Q4 was stable with the prior year. No notable change in that and that's the best insight we have around utilization in the market that we serve.","Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then just one more quick one. So obviously, PAMA coming out and then the margin impacts from the esoteric mix shifts. Are there any other noticeable pricing trends that you're seeing in the market?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, you want to...?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No trends per se. I mean, obviously, there's mix we talk about, and that includes test mix; it also includes payer mix. So we have mentioned previously that we have seen some growth in our Medicaid volumes, probably most likely in response to the Affordable Care Act, but also a reduction in our uninsured mix as well.","So, some of that was more pronounced several quarters ago. I wouldn't say recently any other thing of note. And as I shared at the Investor Day, we expected 2016 to be more like \u2013 and then 2017 as well \u2013 to be more like 2014. You've seen the results for the past year. You can see that there was some pricing pressure. It was fairly tame, certainly compared to several years ago.","And even with PAMA, we're still confident that through 2017, there's not going to be anything noteworthy, and as we said, it should be consistent with the last couple years.","Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Lisa.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe just give us an update. You talked a little bit about the Quintiles' JV Q2. But Mark, can you tell us what you have built into the guidance for 2016 for that? And then maybe, Steve, if you can spend a minute, have you been successful in signing some new deals under the new relationship?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sure. So Lisa, to answer your question directly, I'm sure you recognize, nothing on the revenue line since we can't consolidate. On the earnings line, certainly as we discussed, we expected to deliver some significant synergies this year in 2016, and I have that built into our guidance.","We don't break that out specifically. It's not large enough or substantive enough to provide specific detail. But that is considered, and we are pleased and looking forward to having more earnings in 2016 than we did in 2015 from clinical trials, and then also having more than we think we would've had had we kept that business as standalone Quest.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. And Lisa, to your point about the business prospects, actually I was down there earlier this week with Quintiles' management team. As you know, we started this joint venture Q2 Solutions in the second half. We're very pleased with the integration that's gone on so far. We've built a nice management team. We now have a good integration plan. We feel good about the cadence.","And in parallel with the integration, we feel good about the prospects that we're seeing in our funnel and the business that we've retained. We're not going to comment specifically any new business, but we're encouraged about the beginning of the joint venture and the working relationships between both companies \u2013 and between both of us, ourselves and Quintiles \u2013 we'll give you more color as it evolves, but so far so good.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there any way to quantify any of that? The size of the funnel or \u2013 I know that you said it's bigger than what you thought previously on your own. But just as we think about that as being a future opportunity for your business, is it something that could be a key driver over time? Or you just think this is something that's a smaller, incremental driver to your business?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I just want to refresh everyone's memory. It was 2% of our overall revenues. What we shared at that point was that its operating margin was fairly representative of the overall enterprise, so nothing materially higher or lower.","So therefore, you can kind of frame about what the contribution was, and we expect significantly larger growth on that than we could have done ourselves, but still off a 2% base. So, we're pleased with it and certainly every couple pennies is nice to have, but it's not going to be a game-changer overall. But as Steve said, relative to the expectations going into the partnership, we're very pleased with the first six months and looking forward to 2016.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And since we don't consolidate revenues, we're going to see it back in our earnings growth. And a lot of that earnings growth will come from the cost synergies that's implied in \u2013 or a portion of it's implied in our guidance.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning Brian.","Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. This is Jason Plagman on for Brian. Morning. A question on the Barnabas partnership and the hospital management segment in general. How should we think about the margin profile for that segment, both over the next year or two and then how you're thinking about it longer term?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the way we look at this is we believe the market is continuing to look for partnerships. I said this in my opening comments. Hospitals are looking for partners like us to help them with their lab strategy. A piece of this is helping them run their hospital business, but also think about how we could partner with them in their more sophisticated testing \u2013 what we refer to as reference work. And so, then when we engage with clients or customers like Barnabas, we expect that we're going to start working with them and we're going to start to \u2013 continue to build their book of business with us.","As far as margins, what we'll say is this. We're driving growth in this company and we're driving better ROIC. And included in our guidance around growth and included in our guidance around earnings growth, we do expect that our build of our professional lab services business will be accretive to our plan going forward.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And I'll just add that \u2013 I have shared in the past \u2013 these professional laboratory services agreement come with a couple of different components, as Steve just laid out. Certainly the reference piece, those margins would be similar to our other reference business relationships. And then, in some of these cases there is partnership involving Outreach as well.","On the PLS piece itself, which is focused on taking some of the inpatient and outpatient in the hospital testing and partnering with them on that lab work \u2013 which previously was unaddressable revenue, so it's a new source of growth for us \u2013 those margins are lower than our overall book of business because we have to share the value creation with our partner.","Obviously, when we go in, it's a supply arrangement, and therefore we have to save enough for us each to make a return. However, as Steve also pointed out, since there's really no significant capital outlay at that point, the ROIC is very attractive. And I also want to emphasize it's somewhat previously unaddressable revenues, so a new source of growth.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Just to close on this, in 2015 we feathered in a number of PLS deals \u2013 so they're in our results \u2013 that help us with growth. But also, as you can see with our results, we expanded our margins by 110 basis points. So I feel good about our prospects of this piece of business along with other businesses growing the company and also making sure that we continue to deliver good return on invested capital.","Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for the insight.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, A.J.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. Just initially, I'm trying \u2013 this is sort of a bigger-picture question. So the revenue guidance looks for 1.5% to 2.5% growth, and I'm just trying to think through the puts and takes and how they relate to the underlying assumptions. Obviously, you've got the headwind of the half year, so the revenues that were contributed in the Quintiles JV.","Alternatively, you're anniversarying at this point some lost or exited contracts that sort of impaired growth last year, as well as you've got the St. Barnabas deal ramping up. So I'm trying to get to what do you really think the underlying trends are in terms of pricing, volume, and sort of an apples-to-apples revenue comparison? Any comments on that would be helpful.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. First off, A.J. \u2013 and thank you for the question \u2013 the 1.5% to 2.5% is on what we call an equivalent basis. So that does not include the headwinds from clinical trials. So this is excluding that. So the businesses that we continue to have or will be adding, such as the Hartford acquisition or new partnerships like Barnabas, are included in that. But that excludes the impact of the $85 million in the first half.","So as we look at it, we talked about the price; and we expect price in 2016 to have some modest headwinds. And then mix, obviously, we didn't get to that specifically, but we wouldn't expect a materially different trend than what you saw through 2015. So we continue to grow our esoteric business; so we mentioned 5% growth in Q4. We continue to focus on our most profitable business opportunities. We have cleaned up our portfolio, which certainly you're seeing some of that benefit in terms of our customers. And as we engage with new customers, we're very focused on making sure that we get the value that we deliver through our pricing.","So that's really the overall commentary. I would say the 1.5% to 2.5% is a combination of organic growth and we've had five straight quarters of revenue. We mentioned we had some volume, organic growth in this quarter, and an improving trend throughout 2016.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's great. And then, maybe just following up on Steve's comment around the LDT question and the FDA. It seems like there's two dynamics going on. The Congress is sort of working with the industry to try to come up with some parameters around what might happen there, and then you occasionally have these salvos out of the FDA suggesting that they may move ahead with guidance around it. Can you give us any flavor? I mean, is there any dialogue with the FDA? Do you get any sense of whether they're going to stand down and let Congress move forward, or are they \u2013 do you have any sense of what they're doing?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, thanks, A.J. First of all, as you know, our position as an industry is the FDA does not have statutory authority to regulate laboratories. We're in the business of medicine and applying a device (35:00) regulation to our industry doesn't make sense. And it's duplicative with what we already have with CLIA. So that remains our position.","Now with all that said, as an industry we also believe that the legislative action or process is the best solution to this and we're encouraged with what's been proposed from Congress as a good start. So we're engaging with Congress on their proposed legislation. We're doing this with other stakeholders.","And as far as the FDA involvement in this, I trust Congress and their team, and also with the work in our trade association. We have engaged with the FDA as well to see if we can come up with a reasonable solution of what they are trying to accomplish, while at the same time address the issues we're concerned about. So we are working. We think the legislative action is the best action for us, and that would be much better than the current guidance that we've seen so far from the FDA.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Jansen from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, nice job on the quarter with the organic volumes, but a couple questions. First on the SG&A trend, it did look like your SG&A dollars grew faster on maybe an equivalent basis. Maybe it's probably because last year's number wasn't restated. But just want to get a better sense of what you're viewing as core SG&A growth, and how we should be thinking about 2016 in context of the accelerating benefit from Invigorate 2.0.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, thanks, Nick. I'm sure as you can appreciate SG&A will bounce around quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of certain investments and other things that impact that overall expense. There is certainly not a trend to be read from that. You can see for the year we drove not only improvement in gross margin but leverage of our SG&A.","You would expect we need to continue that in order to drive the leverage that we're implying for our guidance in 2016, and certainly the leverage we were implying through the outlook that I provided at the Investor Day in 2014. So, some of Invigorate is on the cost of sales line; some of it is on the SG&A line and you should not expect us to deleverage our SG&A going forward.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. and then secondly, I think you mentioned a bad debt benefit in the quarter. Just wanted to know if you could potentially quantify that and think about what drove the improvement from that benefit. Thanks.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So what I would say is the bad debt continues to be fairly stable. Mix, as we mentioned, mix is going against us: as we get a larger proportion of our revenues from patients, the bad debt rate on that is significantly, on an order of magnitude, higher than it is from the payers, whether it's commercial payers or the government. So that's something we have to offset. And through some of the good Invigorate work we've been doing, we've held that at bay and held it pretty stable. So that's what I would say is, without that one-time benefit, you should have expected to see some stability in our bad debt.","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks and good morning, everybody.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey Bill. Good morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I guess going back to FDA as well as PAMA, Steve, what are you guys thinking in terms of the final documents coming out? I guess we've been hearing probably 1Q for PAMA and 2Q for FDA. I'm just curious if those are consistent with your expectations.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So first of all, let me start with PAMA. So, we've been engaged with CMS on this all last year, once we received their draft document. Two things, as I said in my introductory comments, we believe they did not get it right as far as the applicable labs; it needs to include hospitals. We've been quite clear on that and we've got a lot of support now from American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, and Congress to help us with that. So we've made that loud and clear.","And then second is the timing. We think the ability for us to get the final guidance out this year, for us to submit the data, and then also for them to go through that data to refresh the clinical lab fee schedule by 2017 is a very, very tight timetable, as you can imagine. So those are the two big issues that we've highlighted. We're hopeful that we'll see something in the first half of 2016. They never commit to what the date is, but we're hopeful that we'll see something after they've digested everything we've provided to them in the last part of last year. So that's where that stands.","As far as the FDA, as I just mentioned, we continue to work with Congress on a legislative action. We believe that's the best approach for this issue. We believe it is a good start. And again, as a trade association, we believe they do not have the statutory authority \u2013 the FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories. So, we're going to work this in due course. We're hopeful that we can come up with something with Congress, and we'll see where that leads us. But this is going to be done step-by-step and kind of make progress and see where this evolves over the next several months.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. And then if you had to handicap \u2013 I guess sticking on PAMA \u2013 if you had to handicap the option (40:54) of them expanding beyond the labs they've already spoken to, where are you thinking at this point, Steve?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, the applicable lab? You can't handicap it. All I know is the message has been loud and clear. We got the support of the American Hospital Association, which clearly gets paid the same way we get paid. If they do not include hospitals \u2013 as we all know, those commercial rates are higher than our rates \u2013 so they need to be in the base to get a market view of the codes.","Second, is the Senate has weighed in. The House has weighed in. Industry has weighed in. We clearly have done a good job of making sure \u2013 we want to make sure we get this right because it's important to all of us. Again, you go back to the definition of PAMA \u2013 it's Protect Access to Medicare Act \u2013 it's very important that Medicare beneficiaries continue to get the critical testing, and all those Medicare beneficiaries are not just in those large cities where we primarily serve. There's a lot of regional players and there's a lot of hospital outreach players in this marketplace that have to get fair rates from CMS.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. Thanks. It's actually Joel in for Isaac.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Joel.","Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You guys touched a little bit on the companion diagnostics market in the prepared remarks. Could you maybe help us think about how you intend to win share in that market? It appears that market's increasingly becoming a more commoditized end market?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, sure. It's a promising market. If you go back and look at our platforms for growth, companion diagnostics, and sometimes it's connected with precision medicine. It is an important part of our growth strategy. Several things \u2013 one is that we continue to work with the market-leading research organizations. About two years ago, we announced a relationship with Memorial Sloan-Kettering; we're actually taking their research and we are now marketing a product we call OncoVantage, with 34 actionable genes. And we're actually going to expand that panel this year as well with their help. So this is right in the middle of precision medicine, and clearly, we're providing the companion diagnostics associated with that.","Second is, we're engaging with pharma. We announced the work this past quarter that we were doing. I talked about in my introductory remarks our recent announcement around melanoma. We continue to be highly engaged with all the pharma companies that have many companion diagnostics associated with their development funnels. So we're very well positioned in that regard. We do work now closely with Quintiles of getting an even better view in the marketplace and better access point for a lot of the smaller pharma companies with the relationship that they have, since they are the world's largest CRO. So, we think we're very well positioned as an innovation player; and now we're positioned even better with our relationship with Quintiles in terms of access to the market.","Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then maybe just a high-level question on what you're seeing for M&A dynamics in the market right now. Are there pockets in the market where valuations are more attractive on a relative basis? Just trying to get a sense of whether we should expect to see more deals towards esoteric-geared independents or more traditional full-service labs?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we continue to work the market. Our strategy is to focus on Diagnostic Information Services. We're entirely focused on that. All our M&A has been associated around that. We've done some hospital outreach deals, the most notable one is Hartford's Outreach activity in the fourth quarter. We continue to have a nice funnel, and that's consistent with our strategy of 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. Through our outlook, we believe there's plenty of prospects to support that.","And in that regard, we also have been clear that we're going to only acquire when we can have a good business case to make money for our shareholders. And many of the deals we've done so far have justified themselves based upon cost synergies which, in our experience, is the best acquisitions you can do. So, we're still encouraged. We still have a strong belief that we can deliver this portion of our strategy, and we've delivered on that through the past several years.","Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Elizabeth Blake from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Elizabeth,","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. You touched on your Data Diagnostics partnership with Inovalon that you launched in the quarter. Could you provide some color around your plans for reimbursement there? I mean, have you been in discussions with health plans? I guess, how would you characterize the interest you're getting from a payer perspective?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We said in our comments that we're quite encouraged. We're offering a lot of value. Typically, the payment is through payers or the risk-taking organization, so it could be an ACO; those people that are managing the population and have the financial incentive to provide this information to the physicians that are treating and managing patients' lives.","So, in that regard, we've been off and running since the fourth quarter. Momentum is building. We've worked through the integration. The nice part about this is we're providing this capability in the normal workflow of a physician. We have tremendous, tremendous capabilities at the desktop of a physician with our order entry results reporting system which we call Care360.","And so when they're in the order entry system, if in fact they want the visibility to this information that we're getting from Inovalon, they can easily access that information. And the payment model is back to, again, typically the risk-taking entity whoever that might be, the payer or in the case of an entity that's taking risk like an ACO. So, we're working both physicians' awareness of this capability along with payer awareness of this. And we're very encouraged about the prospects.","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Donald Hooker from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, good morning. So my question will be simple because it's a follow-up on the last question. So, I'm also interested in this Data Diagnostics relationship you have with Inovalon and appreciate the color. And looking ahead, how long do you think \u2013 if you were to guess \u2013 in terms of how long do you think this relationship would take to ramp to sort of a mature level, I guess, over to a point where, I guess, theoretically it could potentially start impacting and showing up in numbers? I guess, in other words, how long are the sales cycles?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Well, first of all, we started in the fourth quarter. We announced this deal in October. We've already signed some business; I mentioned that in our remarks that we signed some business. We're starting to \u2013 we'll start to see some flow in the first quarter and it will continue to build just like building any business. So it's implied in our guidance. We do expect some growth from this business in 2016 and that business will grow into the future.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, what is your dedicated sales force to this product?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as you can imagine, you're selling to payers. So we have a hospital \u2013 excuse me \u2013 we have a health system team that calls on and manages our health insurance relationships. So, there's a portion of the sale that happens there.","Second, is we have a health systems sales organization that calls on integrated delivery systems, and as I mentioned, some of those integrated delivery systems are taking risk and have ACOs, so we call there.","Third, is we're equipping our physician sales force that goes in and talks to primary care physicians and all physicians, including our specialist physician sales forces. And so, we're training our sales force there and we have over 1,200 people in our sales organization. And this is complementary to what Inovalon already does in calling on the health insurance organizations as well.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got you, Thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Bonello from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey good morning, Bill.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. I just have a couple of questions about the guidance. So, Mark, you talked about that you felt after puts and takes and adjustments, you were pretty much in line with your long-term guidance range for what you delivered in 2015. If I look at the 2016 EPS guidance, at the middle of the range it's sort of 7%, which I think is still below your long-term EPS guidance range. So I'm just trying to reconcile why that would be and when you might expect to be in that 8% to 10% range? And then I have a follow-up.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, thanks, Bill. So, I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're going to provide guidance that we think is prudent and deliverable. We have provided a range. That range certainly includes some numbers that would put us into that 8% to 10%. I want to refresh people's memory that the 8% to 10% was a compound annual growth rate over three years, so it was not a commitment to do that every single year. And also in my prepared remarks, I reminded people that at that point we were obviously looking at a 2014 number that was a nickel lower than we actually delivered in 2014. And I certainly did not anticipate a reduction in our amortization, which was really driven by the fact that we did not have as much significant M&A activity in 2015.","So, we feel in terms of what we committed to that we're on track. We're not behind. Certainly, depending on where we end 2016 within that guidance, we'll either be a little bit slightly below the CAGR or right in the CAGR. So really, what we want to do is provide guidance that we feel is prudent and deliverable, and as we progress through the year, obviously, we'll see where we might end up within that range. But we certainly don't think the guidance implies, given the framing I shared on 2015, that we're materially off of that 8% to 10%.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, wouldn't it be logical to think that the growth comp \u2013 assuming PAMA doesn't get postponed \u2013 that the growth comp would actually be a little bit more difficult in 2017 than it is in 2016? Or are there things about either this year or next year that would offset that Medicare cut?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, so Bill, I talked about three levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue. One of them was the synergies that would be continued to be delivered to their kind of steady-state from acquisitions we had done early in 2014. So you would imagine that probably a lot of that has been delivered.","The second piece has been our Invigorate, and it being large enough to offset price and wage inflation, and deliver some margin expansion. And then the third element is the leverage we get from organic growth. And so, we committed to improving our relative performance. As Steve talked about, minus 4% in 2013, then minus 2% in 2014, and then some revenue growth the last five quarters. And certainly, since there's not as much M&A in our guidance this year as there was in the 2% we got last year, which benefited from some carryover on Solstas, we're implying continued strengthening of our organic performance.","And as you know, organic volume growth has a high drop-through, and as we get closer and closer to market rates, which we had committed we would do through the three-year timeframe, that's going to also enable us to lever our P&L. So you should expect accelerating organic growth, which will be a driver, and then continued to progress to get to the $1.3 billion of Invigorate, which will also accelerate our earnings leverage.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","That's really helpful. And then, just one last thing. Is there any way you can tell us what clinical trials contributed to operating income in Q4 of last year on an annualized basis? Just so we have an apples-to-apples comp on the operating income as well as the revenue?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We never broke it down by quarter, Bill. So the best I'm willing to do, which I've said in the past, is that it was about 2% of our revenue and its margin was comparable. So, you can kind of frame what that would've contributed in Q4.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. I just had a follow-up actually to one of the points you just made in terms of volume growth. So, what is, would you say, is the market growth at this point? I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of just base utilization. Obviously, there's been some discussion around the ACA and what impact that has had. So, just curious if you can provide more detail on utilization rates this year and then going into next year as well?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, well, I'll start and then I'm sure Mark will add something to it. First of all, we continue to build our own market model. In 2014 when we had our Investor Day, we ran our model with a number of assumptions. And we say that the independent laboratory market's going to grow about 2% to 3% in value; and 2% to 3% in value has, as you know, a lot of moving parts. We also made some assumptions about the ACA impact.","We've always assumed that as we have more insured lives in the United States that that would be net positive for this industry, net positive for us. But we all know that has been muted. There's some question about what will happen in 2016 around some of those lives. And then also, we assume in that, our advancement of technology. We're continuing to roll out new innovation to the marketplace, which helps with the growth rate assumptions and that was implied in the 2%, 3%. The aging population, for instance, Hepatitis C is a good opportunity for us, which we're taking advantage of, with the Baby Boomers who need to get tested, so all that is in the 2% to 3%.","And also what we're seeing, Amanda, is what we refer to as density. We're seeing a continued improvement in the amount of tests we're getting through requisitions. And some of this also might be enhanced with the delays that we've seen since the Great Recession over the last, let's say eight to nine years. That people eventually when they show up to the physicians have more need for more testing per that episode.","So, you put that all together and that's why we feel that 2% to 3% \u2013 and that's not in any specific year, but in the longer-term view \u2013 is a good gauge of the market. And we believe that utilization or volumes on a req basis would be slightly less than that, but on a test basis would be slightly greater than the reqs because you're getting an increase in the number of tests per requisition.","So, that's what we have right now. As I said, in 2016, we saw utilization being somewhat stable. Like you, we look at all the different indications in the marketplace to get engaged with what's happening on \u2013 going on within the marketplace. But so far, it's feeling as we come out of this year, somewhat stable expectations for utilization in 2016.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it; very helpful. And then, just one more on esoteric growth. You mentioned a few tests that you've rolled out. I'm curious if you can provide a little more detail in terms of what's driving that growth. Like for example, are you seeing increased hospital send-outs from all the consolidation a couple years ago? Just helping us understand the parts of that growth is helpful.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, what we mentioned in our prepared remarks is we have a big business. It's $1.8 billion. I referred to it in my closing remarks as being advanced diagnostics, which include gene and esoteric testing, and it grew by 5%, 5%. So we feel good about that.","And I would say it's a number of programs that we have launched in the past few years. It is taking advantage of our investment that we made in our clinical franchise organization. We have invested in a stronger team. We're launching products in a better way. And Dan, why don't you give us the top handful of opportunities that we saw in that number?","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Yes, sure. Amanda, we've seen growth in a number of different categories but certainly saw during the course of the year growth in our BRCA testing; in our non-invasive prenatal testing solution; within infectious disease with HCV and HIV. So, seeing growth in a number of different areas.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we feel good about that $1.8 billion business growing 5% and we think the prospects continue to be good going forward.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Michael Cherny from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Good morning, guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Michael.","Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","So I actually want to dig a little bit more into Amanda's question. You gave us a nice breakdown in a follow-up related to the way you look at the market here, low single digits growth in terms of the market. Obviously, it's been a while for a number of factors since you guys have been able to deliver that growth on an underlying basis.","As we think about both this year as well as the next few \u2013 and I know there are moving pieces, so this is a bit of a loaded question. But is thinking about sub-1% organic volume growth or 1%-ish, or somewhere in that range, the new normal that we should think about relative to your business? And if it is or whatever that number is, what does that mean in terms of the incremental drop-down that you would expect relative to historical levels on the volume side?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, so obviously we're not going to project our volume beyond this year, Michael. I'm sure you can appreciate that. What we did commit to was getting back to market levels of revenue growth and also then gaining share at some point. But in the three-year timeframe through 2017, we felt it was incumbent upon us to get back to market-level growth and that's what we're certainly striving to do.","I think, as everyone recognizes, we talk about utilization in a market that's really a bunch of submarkets. So one of the drivers, certainly, besides the fact that we have outstanding offerings, of the 5% growth in esoteric, is that some of those markets are growing. Certainly BRCA is a growing market; non-invasive prenatal testing is a growing market; hepatitis C is a growing market.","And then you've got things that we mentioned and it's not quite behind us, such as paps, which is a declining market. Certainly the impact of some of the safety scares on testosterone has impacted that market in terms of utilization over the last couple years. So, there's really a bunch of markets moving somewhat different directions. And depending on each lab and certainly Quest's share in those markets, it's going to impact us all differently.","So it would be really difficult, even if we were willing, to give you a volume number. That's why what we really feel better about is giving revenue numbers. And certainly, if you just look at volume, you miss some of the positive mix aspects that you've seen come through in our results over the last year-plus in terms of mix, higher mix of these esoteric offerings; higher mix of better customer pricing, being more disciplined in those ways. So that's what our focus is on as opposed to figuring out volume.","We think the demographics we've talked about are positive, certainly aging population, growing population. We certainly, despite some of the recent negative news such as 40% fewer enrollees in the exchanges; some of the slower growth that we've talked about over the last 18 months in terms of enrollment; you've seen a major payer who has talked about some of the struggles with the exchanges. And despite all that, we still think the Affordable Care Act is adding patients with insurance, and that's a good thing for us.","So, we do feel positive about volumes and trends and certainly expect to get our fair share of that. But it would be very difficult to give you some sort of a steady-state volume organic growth projection going forward.","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","And Michael, just to follow-up on that a little bit. Keep in mind, we talk about revenue a lot because what shows up as volume versus growth in our esoteric business sometimes falls into the mix category. So revenue per requisition, this year we felt some pressure but we were able to offset that for the last several quarters, more than offset that with favorable test mix that's coming through the gene-based and esoteric. So, I think Steve also mentioned that we're seeing more tests on requisitions as well, so the requisition volume counts don't necessarily get the credit, but you see the credit overall in the revenue line for some of that benefit and some of that strategy.","Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","No, I appreciate that, guys. If I could squeeze in one more quick one, any updated thoughts related to some of the technological developments, or maybe lack thereof, related to some of the point-of-care testing and particularly some of the microfluidics-linked point-of-care testing? Obviously, there's been a lot of news around a certain upstart that seems to have hit a bit of a wall. So anything related to how that market is evolving; if you see any other technologies that at some point make sense to be suppliers, particularly into the patient service centers?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so thanks, Mike, for your question. First of all, point-of-care diagnostics has been around for decades. I've been around for decades, invested in it, and know the market well. Where it has been successful is where there has been a good value proposition that has delivered something to the marketplace. So, chronic disease management, diabetes, it's done well.","If you look at critical care in hospitals, if you were to go into a critical care unit with blood gas testing, that's been an example of good point-of-care testing value proposition. And then finally, emergency medicine, if you look at cardiac enzymes and the value of having those cardiac enzymes sooner, when the patient is being transferred to the emergency room, has a good value proposition.","But in other areas where it's not quite clear, where it's not compelling, those promises have not really been delivered. With all that said, we're the world's largest diagnostic information services company. We're always looking at ways we can improve our cost structure. We buy from all the in-vitro diagnostic companies. If in fact there is a better platform to do some portion of our routine testing on a much more efficient, effective platform than the current ones that we use from all the suppliers, we're all ears.","And so, we never not look at innovation that could be helpful in us delivering on our promise of great quality at some of the best prices in the industry. And our value proposition continues to be very, very strong. So point of care is a part of that, but you need to make sure that you really understand what it's going to do and where the value proposition is strong enough to get some traction. And again, we could be a utilizer of some of that if in fact the facts are compelling.","Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thanks, guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time we have no further questions.","Stephen H.

Risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.","A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website -- on our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now here is Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, during the quarter, we increased adjusted operating income and delivered strong cash flow despite continued soft revenues, thanks in large part to our accelerated Invigorate cost-reduction initiative.","In a few minutes, Bob will review the third quarter with you. But I'd like to start by giving an update on the progress we're making to define our path forward to improve our operations, restore growth and capitalize on our market leadership position.","Our 2 highest priorities are driving operational excellence and restoring growth. I'd like to share a few words about each. Let me start with operational excellence.","Our old organization was too complex, and it failed to let us take advantage of our scale and capabilities. One of my first steps since joining a few months ago has been to lead the design of a new organizational structure that will enable Quest Diagnostics to focus even more on our customer needs, speed decision-making and accelerate cost reductions.","By eliminating complexity and empowering employees, we expect we will be able to eliminate 3 management layers or approximately 400 to 600 management positions by the end of 2013. We believe this will contribute about $65 million in savings to our previously announced cost reduction goal of $500 million annual run rate savings versus 2011 as we exit 2014.","We have continued to grow the Invigorate savings each quarter. And last quarter, I said I was closely involved with Invigorate and thought we could realize more savings faster than originally anticipated.","The acceleration in savings that we've seen throughout the year does increase my confidence in our ability to achieve this goal. And as a result, we now have increased our expectations for run rate savings as we exit this year to $150 million, and Bob will give you further comments on Invigorate in a few minutes.","We look forward to sharing some of our detailed growth plans with you next month at our Investor Day. But today, we'd like to share a couple highlights with you of what we expect to do to restore growth.","First, the new organization. In addition to allowing us to aggressively drive operational excellence, it will also allow us to focus on our customers better, which will, we believe, over time enable us to restore growth. We are consolidating several sales organizations into a single commercial group, aligned under 1 new leader.","Second, in addition to organic growth, we have shared the task for an opportunity [ph] to consider value-creating fold-in acquisitions as part of our disciplined approach to capital deployment. And I'm happy to share that yesterday, we signed an agreement to partner with UMass Memorial Labs to establish a Lab of the Future in Massachusetts. We believe this transaction could become a model for the industry and an opportunity for hospitals and integrated delivery networks to find a sustainable way to participate in diagnostic testing while focusing on their core competency, taking care of patients. We believe this transaction is a good example of the kind of opportunities we will continue to evaluate.","So we remain focused on increasing shareholder returns through a combination of improving operational performance and disciplined capital deployment. Now I'd like to turn over to Bob for a detailed analysis of the numbers. Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Q3 revenues of $1.9 billion reflect a decrease of 2.9% from the prior year. This compares to a decrease of about 0.5% in the underlying revenues in Q2.","Q3 comparables were more challenging, given there were just over 1% fewer business days in the quarter compared to last year and compared to the second quarter. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 2% below the prior year. Volume was about 1% below the prior year due principally to fewer business days.","Revenue per requisition was also about 1% below the prior year level but relatively unchanged from Q2.","Favorable test mix and an increased number of tests per requisition continued to offset reimbursement pressures, with the 1% year-over-year decrease, principally due to business and payor mix changes.","Recall that the year-over-year growth in revenue per requisition we reported in the early part of the year was principally due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera, and we anniversaried that benefit last quarter. Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 7% in the quarter, up over 1% from the growth of the last 2 quarters.","Q3 revenues in our nonclinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and health care IT, were about 10% below the prior year and contributed about 1% of the consolidated revenue decrease, with clinical trials driving the most of the decline.","As you've heard, despite reporting revenues which were below the prior year, we expanded adjusted margins in the quarter and delivered earnings comparable to the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 matched that of the prior year, and adjusted operating income at 19.1% was 80 basis points above the prior year.","Disciplined expense management and accelerated benefits from our Invigorate program were the primary drivers of our expanded margins.","Restructuring and integration costs, totaling about $45 million, reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.4% and reported EPS by $0.17.","Last year's third quarter included $27 million of restructuring and integration costs, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by about 1.4% and reported EPS by $0.10.","As we discussed the last quarter, in connection with our Invigorate initiative, we have offered a voluntary retirement program to certain qualifying employees. We estimate this program will contribute approximately $40 million in annualized savings once fully implemented, which we expect by the first quarter of next year. The program will allow us to reduce the size of our workforce, reduce our average wage bill and update the skills of the workforce.","In connection with the program, I told you last quarter that we expect to record charges estimated at about $50 million over the course of the next several quarters as employees leave the workforce. A little over $20 million was incurred in Q3 and is part of the $45 million in restructuring and integration charges I referenced earlier.","As you've heard, we have taken action to accelerate some of the savings associated with our Invigorate program. As a result, we now expected to deliver approximately $150 million in run rate savings as we exit the year, up from our earlier estimate of approximately $100 million.","This represents about 30% of our $500 million goal. In addition, as you heard last quarter, we are evaluating opportunities which could potentially increase the size of the program and plan to share any updates at our November Investor Day.","An area which continues to benefit from Invigorate is billing and collections. We have consistently produced industry-leading metrics in this area but still have room to improve. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved to 3.3% in the quarter. DSOs were 46 days, up 2 days from last quarter, with most of the increase due to the timing of cash receipts, which were affected by the month end falling on a Sunday.","Cash from operations was $395 million in the quarter compared to $338 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $45 million in the quarter compared to $39 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 832,000 common shares at an average price of $60.12 a share for a total of $50 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $150 million.","We also reduced outstanding debt by $292 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $507 million in connection with our stated objective to delever by $500 million to $700 million this year.","Turning to 2012 guidance. Based upon our performance through the first 3 quarters and our latest view of the market, we now expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenue to grow approximately 0.5%; operating income to approximate 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion; capital expenditures to approximate $180 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.45 and $4.55.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Bob. So in closing, this quarter, we increased adjusted operating income and delivered solid cash flow despite a decline in revenues. Our new organization will allow us to aggressively drive operational excellence and improve our customer focus. This will enable us to achieve our Invigorate goal and over time, restore growth.","We do remain committed to increasing shareholder returns and improving ROIC. This includes our intention to return the majority of our free cash flow to investors upon achieving our targeted leverage ratio. Yesterday, we announced a transaction that will create value for Quest Diagnostics shareholders, our partner and the people of Massachusetts. I look forward to sharing our strategy and plans with you at our November 16th Investor Day. Now we'll be happy to take any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just a couple questions on top line if I could. You lowered your revenue expectations last quarter and again this quarter. So we see some of the results, but what do you think is different versus what you expected 6 months ago as far as top line trend?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, thanks, Tom, for the question. First of all, the market continues to be what we described as soft. Even though we see a pickup in physician office visits from some of the outsourced statistics, we're not just seeing it yet in our volume. So utilization, we believe, is somewhat mixed. Second is that even though that we believe that the market is soft, the market has seen some indications that it is growing in some pockets, but we're not obviously seeing that growth. And so therefore, we actually believe our execution is not quite where we expected it to be. And specifically, we talked about narrowing the networks with payers. We still believe there's an opportunity there, but we have not seen it yet. We're still actively working inside here on getting that and also working with payers to make sure we eventually deliver it. So that's what's changed, Tom.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","On -- maybe just 2 follow-ups. On the networks, these plans that are in place, and you're just not capturing that incremental share as a result of the benefit design, or are you expecting that you're going to see changes that you haven't seen yet in benefit design?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","No, these are plans in place. We just haven't gotten what we expected out of those plans yet.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then overall market share, do you have great data on that? Can you give any good insight on what your share is doing, relatively speaking? And also, maybe specifically relative to hospitals as well, where my sense is maybe they've been taking some more in-house as they've been hiring doctors?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, first of all, we do believe that, that trend in the hospital marketplace is happening. So they are picking up a larger piece of the market. It is hard for us to give visibility on market share. And at our November 16th Investor Day, we'll give you a lot more detail on specifically what's happening in this market and what we think our performance has been in the past and what we think the opportunity is going forward. But at this point, we don't have specifics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just wondering if you could provide any more color on the UMass acquisition? Was the valuation paid in line with historical multiples? And then also, what are you seeing in the market? Are there other deals that you're excited about, similar size or any color would be helpful.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, let me ask Bob to take the question on specifics of the transaction. Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Kevin, as we indicated in the press release, we expect this to contribute about 1% to revenues next year for us. And to give you some sense as to valuation, the valuation was less than $100 million. And we would expect that, that sort of valuation is consistent with the types that we've seen for future fold-in acquisitions. This is one that we think is in that sweet spot that we've spoken about. Fold-in acquisition, we've got a good history of executing well against these, and we're very excited about the opportunity to work with UMass in the Massachusetts marketplace.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then, Bob, since I have you, with revenue per requisition being down about 1%, I don't know if you -- I missed it in your prepared remarks, what was the primary driver behind that? I know there's fewer days and whatnot. But...","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Kevin, it's down about 1% from the prior year, although it's relatively stable with the level that we had in Q2. Yes, as we've mentioned before, we continue to experience reimbursement pressure, but we're effectively offsetting that with increases or improvements in test mix and increases in the number of tests per requisition. And what you saw driving most of the year-over-year change this quarter is really the business mix. We continued to see strong growth in Drugs of Abuse Testing, which as you know, has much lower reimbursement rates than average. And unfortunately, we're continuing to see pressure on the Anatomic Pathology side, which carries higher reimbursement rates. So it's really the business mix that's driving the year-over-year change right now.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then, 1 last question for Steve. You mentioned narrower networks and then recently, we found out that Tennessee's Medicaid program selected you as the exclusive testing provider. Wondering if you're seeing anything else on the horizon with some of the other states or payers moving to low-cost provider in the market?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, first of all, Kevin, thank you for that. And we continue to work with all the payers, and we believe having access to as many payers as possible in our business is important. But as you know, we don't provide specifics on relationships with payers but we continue to be aggressively managing our approach to payers going forward. I spoke in my prepared remarks about a new organizational structure. And a key part of that structure is to pull together multiple sales forces within the company. But part of that is to make sure that we emphasize the importance of our payer relationships and health plans going forward. So it's an important of, we believe, our continuing to focus on improving how to go to market. They're an important part of our go-to-market plan, and we need to do a better job than we've done in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy of William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just had a follow-up question in terms of the hospital segment. So it seems like if you look over a long period of time, the market share of the hospital labs has remained pretty constant between the 2 dynamics of hospital buying providers and lab buying outreach programs. I'm just curious if you were to look over the long term here, especially under the reform, how do you expect those market share dynamics to change? Is the pendulum kind of shifting back to the hospitals at this point? Or is it still pretty constant between the 2 competing dynamics?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, thanks, Amanda. Well, first of all, I think there's another dynamic and that is to some extent related to reform, and that is hospital systems buying physicians. So we believe 65% of physicians today work for hospital systems. It's a larger percentage of specialists and a lower percentage of primary care, but the percentage of primary care will increase. And as they bring more physicians into their network, we believe this is affecting the dynamic of laboratory services and where that work is performed. We actually believe because of this dynamic, there's been a shift in the market into the hospital side of the equation. Our question mark as we go forward is, is it sustainable? And actually, this transaction we just announced today with UMass I think is an indication that it's not quite clear that all think it's best for hospital systems to be in the laboratory outreach business. So we're watching it carefully. The question earlier was, is there a dynamic that there's more hospitals interested in this type of transaction? There is an increase in activity of hospital CEOs debating what the best answer is for the laboratory services, and we're engaged in those conversations. So the dynamic in the industry is changing, and some of that's related to health care reform, but some of it's related to what's happening with integrated delivery networks.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then, I know this is not really related to outreach, but have you seen any effect from the TC Grandfather situation on your business at this point? And also, just not related, but there's been noise around Anatomic Pathology codes and what they might be doing with that reimbursement? Anything there that you might highlight in terms of impact?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Kathleen?","Kathleen Valentine","Yes, Amanda, it's the -- we've seen very little, if any, impact from the TC Grandfather change.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And what about potential changes to the -- some of the common AP codes?","Kathleen Valentine","No, I mean, we haven't seen anything yet. I mean, I know they're contemplating and expecting some changes on the 88305. We haven't seen what that change is yet. So we haven't seen any impact in terms of our volumes related to that.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Is there a way to quantify how much is 88305 of your volume?","Kathleen Valentine","Well, we don't provide details on specific test volumes.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then last one for Steve, just at a high level here. So obviously, you've done a great job with the Invigorate and the cost restructure side. But I wanted to dive a little deeper into the comments you made about how that could translate into increased customer focus and top line growth? I'm just curious, it's not even been there for a few months. How do you look at the top line side of the equation?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure, absolutely. Well, first of all, as you would expect, our Invigorate goal is primarily around cost, and we're encouraged by the results that we've seen so far. And therefore, we've increased our expectation for this year in that regard. But as you know, driving operational excellence is not just about cost, it's affecting the quality of the operation. And so we believe in addition to improving our cost position, we also can improve our service levels. So hand-in-hand with our improvements in costs, we expect that our service levels will improve as well. And so in parallel with all the costs initiatives, we're making sure that we don't deteriorate our service level performance metrics, how quickly we respond to phone calls, how our customer satisfaction scores are going in our patient service centers, what type of response time or turnaround time we have for specimens back to the physician. All those are quite important, and we believe we can improve quality while at the same time reducing our cost structure. And when we do that, we believe that will affect our customer focus and will affect restoring growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to follow up on a couple of questions that have already been asked. I'm just really curious, Steve, as to how you're thinking about reform, should we have Obamacare go into place around lab? And is this the idea around UMass and other deals that you really believe that over time, you're going to see the hospital and the physician bundling and others around lab costs? How should we start to think about that over the next couple of years?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, as you know, Lisa, there's a lot of uncertainty around the environment in general and specifically what's going to happen with health care going forward. As you know, we're in the middle of the election and there's a lot of questions in Washington what will happen over time. Well, first of all, there is a sense that irregardless of who gets into office, that there's some fundamentals of the Affordable Care Act that will be retained. There is a sense that there will be more lives in the system with different insurance options, and we think that's good for this industry. We know the demographics, those demographics have been with us for some time, and those won't change. And so therefore, with the aging population, we believe there will be an opportunity. And also people still believe in early detection and wellness programs, which is good for this industry. But over time, the question is what will happen with all the different payment movement types within the system and what happens to the individual states. And there's a lot of uncertainty, and last quarter, we shared that with you. So it's difficult for us to predict. We do believe overall, the Affordable Care Act is positive for this industry, but the specifics of how that will play out are still uncertain at this time.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One of the other things we've heard at a recent conference that I think you spoke at, Steve, was around formulary development around clinical laboratories. Are you starting to see that take hold? Or do you think that we're in the very early stages of that? And if we do start to move more towards formularies around clinical lab testing, is that a positive or a negative for Quest?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, first of all, it's just in its early days, and it's hard to indicate or hard to predict will it be a positive or negative at this point. So but it's starting to get some traction, but it's early.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dane Leone from Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Just 2 follow-ups on the top line, line of questioning. One, was there -- were there any acquisitions baked into the volume numbers or in volume comps that you reported? And...","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Let me give it to Bob to answer that.","Robert A. Hagemann","Essentially, Dane, what you saw is organic revenue year-over-year.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, just kind of a qualitative assessment on the growth, is there an expectation baked into the revised guidance, and kind of how we should think of revenue growth over the next couple quarters in the context of some of the management changes that were just announced being kind of mildly disruptive to the ability of the organization to grow sales and the focus on customers during this transitional period?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, get me get Bob to give you some qualitative response to the fourth quarter, what that means. And then I'll take the question on -- answer the question about organizational effect on the business going forward. Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes. There's nothing specific baked into our guidance relative to any sort of disruption as a result of the organizational change. In fact, if you look at the third quarter revenue growth and you adjust it for the change or the difference in business days, the implied revenue growth in Q4 is pretty consistent with that.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Okay. And specific to organization, we have essentially functionalized the largest part of our company, and we'll be using a term of diagnostic information services. And as we have shared, we brought in a new sales leader. The reason for that is we want to bring sales excellence to this company. Specifically, underneath the new sales leader, and his name is Everett Cunningham, he joins us from Pfizer. He's a seasoned sales executive with over 20 years of experience in a variety of roles. But we want to consolidate all our sales forces and have 1 consolidated view for Quest Diagnostics into the marketplace. Much of this change, much of this change is related to management. And we're reemphasizing to our sales reps, people who are actually calling our customers and driving volume, that their account assignments will not change and -- for the remainder of this year and for the plan going forward. This is about management reorganization and not specific to what they do on a day-to-day basis. So we're reemphasizing that with this transition. And we're meeting every other day as an operational team to make sure that anything that comes up in our organization, we're on top of. So we're on top of this closely to make sure we don't miss a beat in the fourth quarter. But I wanted to share that with you, and then when we get together in November at our Investor Day, we'll share more specifics of what we plan of doing structurally and operationally to be able to restore growth. And you'll get an opportunity to meet Everett Cunningham at that session.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Steve, in your comments, you talked about the narrow networks and that you haven't gotten, I guess, the volumes that you expected to get. Can you talk more about that? Is it simply a leakage issue? And if it is, it seems like the plans in the past have been somewhat hesitant to crack the whip with docs in order to prevent the leakage, so is there anything that's going to change to, you think, stop it?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, thanks, Gary, for the question. It is a leakage issue, and specifically the plans are aligned with us on trying to drive a narrower network. Obviously, if they're incented to do it, we would be incented to do it as well. And yes, they have been reluctant in the past, you call it cracking the whip with physicians. But let me share with you, they've already taken some actions to be able to put some of these physicians that we believe there's an opportunity on notice. And we believe they will be acting more aggressively going forward because it serves our interests well and their interests to do this. So we again are not giving up on it. We believe there's still an opportunity for us going forward, there's an opportunity with the health plans. And we still believe going forward, we'll work on this real time to make it a reality.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is there anything in the contracts, in it that you have with those more narrow networks that if you don't see the volume increases, and it's not anything that you guys did, does that impact price? Or is there really no way to adjust for that?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","No, it's just fundamentally, operationally getting to happen what we planned on happening. And we plan on some things with health plans. We've worked through those. We're reevaluating those actions because they haven't been as successful as we expect that they would be, and so we're putting together a new and improved plan, if you will, plan-by-plan to get the growth we expect.","Operator","Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I wanted to just go back to the UMass deal, and you've described in the press release that you plan to build a Lab of the future. I guess, I would want to get your vision of how different that Lab of the Future is from the current operating model, and maybe give us a little flavor for what your plans are there.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, well, thanks, Darren. This is an opportunity obviously to work with a large health system in Central Massachusetts and bring in some volume to our company. But we're also taking it as an opportunity to continue to invest in our business going forward. And we have a number of operations in the Northeast. We see this as an opportunity to basically architect and then eventually build and equip that organization with a different workflow than we currently have in some of our labs. Also invest in automation and apply the principles that we applied at some of our best labs around our network. And so we're very encouraged that we can take the best learnings that we have throughout our network of labs throughout the United States and apply it to this effort with UMass.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And is this structure a joint venture in any way? Or is it a complete 100% ownership?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, at this point, this is an outright purchase of the outreach business of UMass. And over time, we expect that there'll be a shared financial interest in the new entity. But yes, the transaction, as it stands today, is an outright acquisition of the outreach business.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then -- that's helpful. I'm sure we'll get a little bit more into this in November when we meet. My question on just the revenue side of the equation relates to some anticipated changes we're all looking at for in the short run on the Molecular Diagnostics program. And I guess, I wanted to just hear from you what your expectation is in terms of how quickly you think private payers will pivot to whatever that new pricing model is?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Bob, reactions to new pricing in our forward-looking guidance?","Robert A. Hagemann","Look, as we've seen historically, oftentimes, the commercial payers follow what the government does. And sometimes, it's faster. Sometimes, it's slower. We expect that they're all going to be very deliberate, though, with any changes that take place here so that we get this right. It's too important not to get it right. And it's still, as unfortunately with many things, early days and a little too early to tell what it could mean.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. You mentioned that your trials business experienced some pressure in the quarter. And I guess, I'd be curious to hear a little bit more about that. You have a key customer in that business. Did that change, or is it just the typical starts and stops that occur in the trials business?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, first of all, as you know, the pharma industry is slow. There's less investment going on today than there once was. And that's affecting our business. That's the best way to describe it. So there's some of your typical starts and stops, but there is an industry slowdown, if you will, with trials in general that's affecting our clinical trials business. And that had a substantial effect on our growth rate this quarter.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And my last question is just you talked about returning capital, and I'd be curious to get your thoughts on -- your view on the Celera royalty portfolio, which I think many of us in the market think has significant value to Quest. How should we be thinking about that portfolio, and how you expect to hold it or not over the long term?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Bob, do you want to handle that?","Robert A. Hagemann","Darren, look, this is one that obviously we've gotten a lot of questions on. We're continuing to evaluate all of our options with respect to these assets. And what we want to do obviously is what's in the best interest of the Quest shareholders. So more to come on that. We're still in the process of evaluating the different options that we've got.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, I wanted to maybe put your previous comments on the market environment and market share dynamic in context with Invigorate. And specifically, just wondering how you expect to sort of reclaim market share while also cutting costs. We haven't seen a lot of that as a precedent across the health care system. And maybe specifically, if you could touch on the number or percentage of mid-level management cuts that you mentioned that are actually customer-facing positions?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, sure. Well, first of all, I do believe that we can take cost out of the business, and we've indicated that before. And some of the cost we'll take out has no impact on our customer-facing activities. We shared in the past, let me give you an example, as we do believe we can do better job of procurement, buying supplies and the products that we use for operations will have no impact on customer-facing activities. We're looking at our whole administrative cost structure, clearly, we need less of administration so we can put more energy into those activities that will generate growth. So this is another example of where we can take cost out without affecting our top line. As far as the change organizationally, if you look at the organizational structure that we had, we have shared in our announcement about this that we believe we can take out 3 management layers. In the past, the structure that we had between myself and people that are selling or people that are doing blood draws or people working in our laboratories, in some cases, we had as many as 10 layers. And so, we believe that if you look at spans-and-layers and the opportunity to simplify the organization to make sure that we can be faster with decision-making and at the same time, be able to be much more aligned or around our 2 primary goals, which is driving operational excellence and restoring growth, this will help us. These cost reduction activities are all around management, all around management. So I would argue these are the people in the back, so the people that are doing the work, people that are selling, people that are doing blood draws, people that are dealing with the customers every day. And we believe that by reducing management and simplifying organizational structure, it'll impact and help us accelerate our ability to achieve our operational excellence goals and at the same time, by focusing more entirely as a company on our customer, it'll help us restore growth.","Robert A. Hagemann","And Isaac, just to build on something that Steve said before about lower costs and improve service levels going hand-in-hand. We clearly think there's an opportunity to improve service levels as we reduce costs. A great example is the fact that we touch specimens, we touch bills over and over again, a lot of manual work is done here. And as we increase electronic connectivity, which is one of the elements of the Invigorate program, we take that waste out of the system and at the same time, we improve the service levels for customers. So that's a good example of how we can improve service levels and reduce costs at the same time.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","And Isaac, let me just say 1 other comment and that is, we do believe as we go through our plan, and you'll see some of this at our Investor Day, that we will become more efficient. And we're looking at all our business, all our operations and looking at our resource allocation and where we invest to make sure we're putting an appropriate investment in terms of what we need to do to improve operational excellence. So truing up our operations, making sure we put in place best-in-class information systems and processes. We talked about the Lab of the Future at UMass. But also, we're looking at a go-to market organization to make sure we're putting the right resources in that organization. And we think actually our Invigorate program will give us some financial capacity, if you will, to make some of those investments as well. So we're looking at all that to make sure we're properly balanced to accomplish what we say we can accomplish by improving our operations and restoring growth at the same time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So one question I have -- this was touched on a couple times now, but just to follow up further on the press release from last week on the organizational structure changes. And I guess, I'm a little surprised that with the company already completing some pretty comprehensive cost-cutting programs over the past several years, I guess I'm surprised there's still 3 layers of management to still cut out of the infrastructure. So I'm just curious, this must have come up in some of the internal discussions. I'm just trying to get maybe more flavor for why these layers were not eliminated in the prior rounds of cost cutting. There must have been some risk in doing this. I'm trying to figure out why this, I guess, so obvious to do it now. So I guess that's the first question.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. Well, thank you for that. Well, I can't say much about the past. I do understand why the structure was here, and from the -- going forward, we believe it's not the right structure for us with our 2 primary goals around operational excellence and restoring growth. What we announced in the organizational change is essentially disbanding the line of business structure throughout the company for the Diagnostic Information Services business. This will allow us to simplify the organization and take out some management positions. And fundamentally, it'll allow us to take advantage of our scale and capabilities operationally. So we're going to bring together all our operational capabilities underneath 1 leader, that person is John Haydon. John will be joining us actually from Philips. I've worked with John in the past, actually brought him into Philips about 3 years ago. He has the absolute best capabilities that we could find for this job. We did an external search. We talked to a number of individuals. I personally was engaged in this and talked to over a dozen people. We brought them through the management team, and we spent time to make sure we had the best possible person we could find. So under John's leadership, we believe we can consolidate, if you will, all our operational activities; think about the full value chain, from specimen to eventual cash; the organization and by thinking about it holistically as a company, we could take the next tranche of improvement, if you will, for this company. So we think it is the right structure going forward to be able to support the goals that we have in Invigorate and over time, as we say, restore growth.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the code stocking issue just for a second. This bulletin went out from CMS on September 1 where CMS is now saying that the Medicare carriers themselves, which are owned by the commercial payers like WellPoint, Cigna, Blues Plans, et cetera, these are the guys that are going to be determining these new rates for these 100 or so molecular tests. So I guess, I'm just trying to get some color from you guys. How common is it for the commercial payers or entities owned by commercial payers to have a major say in what the rates are going to be in terms of reimbursement to the lab providers? And does this make you on the margin a little more nervous about these rates are going to be coming out, or is this maybe a little more routine than some of us may believe? Some color on that would be helpful as well.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Kathleen, you want to handle that?","Kathleen Valentine","Sure. Steve, the CMS is charged with providing the direction and the guidance on how the new codes and the reimbursement for these new codes should be done. And as you know, kind of what's proposed is sort of a gap-fill approach. There are a lot of questions that we in the industry have that we've put to CMS in terms of how that will be done and the timeframe with which to do it. I don't think it's all that common that they typically give the commercial payers, the individual payers, kind of the discretion to set reimbursement. But there are a lot of questions that the industry is asking, and centered -- starting with what the process is, to your point, in terms of who is -- the steps to take in terms of setting that reimbursement and also concerns around the timeframe with which to do it in terms of right now it's slated to go into effect in the beginning of '13. So there's a lot to be -- still be sorted out. We are working with industry through the trade association...","Stephen H. Rusckowski","And taking the leadership role.","Kathleen Valentine","Absolutely. And looking to get CMS to provide more specifics and instruction on exactly how to do that because we certainly -- we don't want it to be a disparate sort of approach. We want it to be thoughtful and want the industry's best interests protected through the process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sandy Draper from Raymond James.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, maybe just talk a little bit on the charges, obviously, it's sort of ongoing process. Do you have a target date with the -- with Invigorate can be going on for a while, in which you would expect the charges to stop and we'll get sort of a clean GAAP quarter? Or should we expect at least for most of 2013 to continue to see quarterly charges?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Sandy, as you know, the program that we've defined to date runs through the end of 2014. We've put some estimates out there as to what the charges will be over the life of that program. With the added amount of charges we expect from the management reorganization, the totals now are between $115 million to $195 million over the course of that period. And the biggest chunk of that is in employee separation costs, a large portion of which we've incurred to date. But you should expect that we'll continue to see charges over the next several quarters at a minimum, probably in some cases, stretching into 2014. As we said earlier, the voluntary severance or the voluntary retirement program is going to result in charges over the next several quarters as employees leave the workforce.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And those are all pretty much cash charges, correct?","Robert A. Hagemann","Most of the charges will be cash charges. There will be some asset write-downs and the like as we start to restructure the testing network. But the majority of the charges are going to be cash charges.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just 1 follow-up. I know a lot of people have asked about the pricing environment. As I sort of think about it and summarizing what you're saying, Bob, on the positive side, you're getting more tests per session and you continue to see the esoteric mix benefiting. On the negative side, you've got continued pressures in pathology, commercial and government payers pricing pressure there. I guess my question is, one other thing that we're hearing about is the, what I would say, commoditization of esoteric testing whereas historically, you might have a 3- to 5-year window for sort of premium pricing, that window seems to be shortening maybe down to a 1- to 2-year, I'd say. Are you guys seeing that, and how do you factor that in? And then when you think longer term, if these trends persist, are we in an environment where flat pricing is maybe a best case scenario or maybe the negative? Or do you think longer term, there are things that you can do to actually eventually get pricing to actually go back on the positive side?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, just on some of those. Yes, let's talk about first the timeframe and the migration of esoteric to routine. I'm not sure that we've necessarily witnessed a shortening of that. As you do know, though, most tests, and in fact, we hope that tests that start out as esoteric will ultimately become routine because that means the utilization ramps up and as you know, as we go through that lifecycle of a test, the revenues ramp up, the margin percent probably comes down as reimbursement comes down, costs also come down, margin dollars grow over time, so that's a good thing as we see utilization increase. And we expect that as we look ahead, the pipeline of new tests will continue to be very robust. So we're expecting that test per requisition, test mix will continue to favorably impact revenue per requisition for us. But as you know, things that do start out as esoteric over time migrate to routine, but we haven't seen necessarily an acceleration of that trend. It takes a while for physicians to change behaviors and adopt things. I mean, we have some evidence that says that it takes between 6 and 8 years for a test to be fully adopted and utilized. So I'm not sure I see anything that's necessarily going to dramatically accelerate that at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Most of my question's answered, just had 2. First, when you look at 2013 estimates, the Street is anticipating a little less than 3% revenue growth, yet your revenue growth has been decelerating this year, down almost 3% this quarter. Is it sensible that some of the initiatives you've put in place could actually get revenue to grow in 2013? Or as we anniversary this deceleration in the back half, is that less likely in that timeframe?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Bob, you want to...","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Gary. You're clearly going to hear a lot more about our plans at the Investor Day in November. And just to set expectations, though, we're not anticipating providing 2013 guidance there. We're certainly going to talk about our plans in great detail and hopefully, get you very comfortable with what we expect to accomplish with them. But we'll be giving 2013 guidance in connection with our year-end earnings call in January.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Second and last question, just going to capital deployment. Steve, I know that the previous CEO had established that the majority of free cash flow would be turned to shareholders, you've reiterated that commitment today. When we'd look at the first 9 months of the year, I think 34% of the free cash flow generation has been returned via share repurchase and the existing dividend. So assuming that the majority means some number greater than 50%, on that front, how quickly do you expect to move to a much higher payout ratio or accelerated share repurchase?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. So let me start with just reiterating what we have said, and we continue to stand by our word that it is our intention to return the majority of our free cash flow to investors and then we are going to achieve our targeted leverage ratio. That's point #1. Point #2 is we will have the Investor Day, and we'll be sharing more insight into capital deployment specifically going forward, and we look forward to having that conversation with you then. So Bob, would you like to share\u2026","Robert A. Hagemann","And Gary, just to reiterate what we said earlier, we said, return the majority of free cash flow to investors after achieving our targeted leverage ratio, which we indicated would require us to pay down between $500 million to $700 million of debt this year. We're almost there. We've paid down $500 million year-to-date, so it implies that there's not much more to go. And by the end of this year, we'll have the debt level where we're comfortable. And then, we certainly have the flexibility that we want to return the majority of free cash flow to investors beginning in 2013. But we made it very clear that, that's after we achieve targeted leverage ratios.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Have a couple of questions here. Steve, there's obviously a lot of uncertainty around consolidation of physician offices and ACOs and health care reform. But can you share with us what's been your experience with the pioneering ACOs that have been doing this for a year or 2, this could be a proxy for what we could expect in the future?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, sure. Well, thanks for the question. As you have said, Ricky, there's a lot of change going on in health care, and probably the biggest change, fundamentally, in terms of provision of health care is around hospital systems buying physician practices. And that is a big change, and I made some comments about that earlier today that it is affecting, at least in the short run, with some of the ancillary services and where that work is directed because of their ownership of those physicians. You mentioned ACOs, and as you know, ACOs are a part of the Affordable Care Act, and there are a lot of these pioneer organizations. And some portion of those organizations are around hospital systems, but some portion of those organizations are actually around physician groups. And we are deeply engaged with many of these organizations because also the health plans are quite interested in engaging as well because the model in the short run is a fee for service model. But in the future, it is anticipated that there will be more of a capitated payment reimbursement model, which will fundamentally change how health care is paid for in this country. We believe that, that obviously will take some time because it's complicated, as you know. But we're in active conversations with payers, with providers both on the physician side, as well as hospital systems. And frankly, you see one ACO, you see 1 pioneer ACO, you see 1 ACO, 1 pioneer ACO. Everyone has a different approach, everyone is thinking through this and everyone is anticipating that it's here to say, but it's not quite sure at this point to how we will eventually merge into some more standardized model of how they'll operate. So a lot of question marks, a lot of uncertainties, a lot of work in play right now, and we're right in the middle of it.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then something that is more in your control, you highlighted that the cost saving run rate is now at $150 million, I think, versus the early expectation of $100 million run rate for the year.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, that's correct.","Robert A. Hagemann","As we exit this year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","As you exit, yes. So can you updated us as to what was your run rate is off this third quarter? And then, so we can just understand also the offset as we build our model, should we assume that just ongoing expense grow with CPI, and are there any additional costs that you need to take on to accommodate the potential incremental volumes that will be associated with the Affordable Care Act assuming that we see implementation?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Ricky, this is Bob. Let me take the latter part of the question first, and that is, the cost associated with incremental volumes. Clearly, what we're doing with the Invigorate program is reducing costs across-the-board, both fixed costs and variable costs. So as we see incremental volumes come into the network as a result of health care reform and the like and our actions as well, we expect that they're going to deliver incremental profit greater than we would have otherwise had. So we're feeling very good about what that can ultimately deliver. With respect to what the run rate is at the end of any given quarter or how much of Invigorate savings is in any one given quarter, we're trying to stay away from getting into that level of detail. I think the best way for you to measure how we're proceeding and how we're progressing with the program is looking at what's happening with margins, and I think we've demonstrated that we've had some good uplift there this quarter. Obviously, we're seeing benefits from the Invigorate program. As you know, I think I've spoken about in the past, generally, we've got about $130 million of inflation that we need to give up or need to cover every year. Roughly $3 billion salaries, wages and benefits, we're seeing sort of 3% average inflation on that historically. And then, the other $3 billion in costs inflates in the range of 1% to 1.5% a year. So that's one of the first things that we need to offset with the Invigorate program before we can get some margin expansion. And obviously, we're starting to see that.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Ricky, let me just add, in my prepared remarks, what we did share is that we are seeing Invigorate savings each quarter increase. And because of this acceleration in savings, it gives us more confidence in fact, we're going to be able exceed the $100 million exit run rate this year, and we've moved the number up to $150 million. So and I shared in my remarks that I am presently engaged in this and I spent a lot of time on this in my first 5 months. I'm encouraged because as you know, with these programs, it takes some time to get traction. We're seeing that traction quarter-on-quarter sequentially. We're seeing improvement, and that is giving us confidence that we can exceed our goal for this year, and we're well on track for the goals for the program.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And based on our back of the envelope calculation, we get to around $100 million in run rate as of this quarter, so we're definitely seeing this sequential improvement that you're talking about. I was just trying to see whether we're in the ballpark.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Frelick of Canaccord.","Jeffrey Frelick - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions on the UMass Medical announcement. Not sure of your market share in the New England area, but I think you do have a solid presence. Any concerns there with FTC weighing in on the UMass Medical acquisition? And then just kind of second point to that, can you characterize their test mix, does it -- is it that obvious that you can convert a lot of your specialty in esoteric testing into this new entity?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Bob, why don't you talk about when we expect to complete this transaction?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, the transaction is obviously subject to regulatory review. We don't expect that's going to be an issue. And we're anticipating the transaction to close within the next 90 days or so. Relative to test mix and the like, yes, the outreach business that we see there is pretty consistent with the sort of test mix that we have in our operations in Massachusetts. But we do believe there's an opportunity to bring some of the testing capabilities that we have, some of the esoteric testing capabilities we have more broadly to that marketplace now.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Let me just add to that. We actually believe this will be a value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. We believe that it will be accretive to our earnings in 2014. We believe it will be accretive to our projected ROIC in 2015. And let me share with you that as an organization, we are putting in place the operating plan and the integration plan to make this a real success because we believe this can be potentially a model of future opportunities with integrated delivery networks. So we're very optimistic about the opportunity to build shareholder value, and we're going to go after it.","Operator","Our last question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just 1 quick follow-up. Now that Palmetto's Molecular Diagnostics program has been in effect since either May or June, just wondering if you've seen any impact, one way or another, on either reimbursement or claims processing time? Anything like that?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Kevin, nothing significant at this point. There are still obviously some things that we're trying to work through with them, get some clarity on a number of things and in some cases, maybe change some perspectives that they have. But this I would expect is part of the normal process of going through this significant a change.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. So really no big expectations on changes for your reimbursement with that region, J1?","Robert A. Hagemann","No, nothing material at this point.","Operator","Thank you for participating in Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter Conference Call.

Go ahead, please.","Shawn Bevec ","Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.","For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense.","As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS now excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. ","Also, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior-year comparisons to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that were effective January 1, 2018 and were adopted on a retrospective basis.","Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient possibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. ","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. ","Stephen Rusckowski ","Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I'll provide you with some perspective on PAMA, highlights on the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on fourth quarter performance.","We delivered strong revenue growth despite the negative impact of severe weather and lower Medicare reimbursement under PAMA.","Earnings growth was driven by continued strong execution as well as the benefits of tax reform.","We also completed our previously announced acquisition of MedXM, which is off to a good start.","Now, here are some highlights from the quarter. Revenues were up 3.7%. Reported EPS was up nearly 10% from 2017. Adjusted EPS grew 25%.","Before I describe the progress we've made, what I'd like to do is to provide an update on PAMA and our investments in the business using a portion of savings from tax reform. ","Turning to PAMA, this was our first quarter operating under the clinical IP schedule, which accounted for approximately 12% of our revenues last year.","Since November, we said we expected the impact of the pharma rates under PAMA would be a reduction of approximately 4% in 2018, approximately 10% in both 2019 and 2020. And our actual Medicare reimbursement in the first quarter reaffirms our projected impact for 2018.","We continue to support efforts by our trade association to implement a market-based laboratory reimbursement schedule.","On the legal front, ACLA has sued CMS and both sides have submitted their initial briefs to the court and we still believe we could have a decision from the judge by midyear.","We want to reiterate that ACLA's complaint is not challenging the new Medicare rates themselves, but rather the process CMS followed to arrive at those rates.","As the lawsuit progresses, ACLA has continued to seek a legislative fix to PAMA, coordinating closely with aligned trade associations like NILA, AdvaMedDx and other stakeholders. This issue is about ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to critical laboratory services.","While the new rates have impacted us, other laboratory providers, including many serving remote and underserved areas, may be forced to close their doors. So, that's why this is an important issue to us all.","Turning to tax reform, last quarter, we shared with you that we will realize approximately $180 million in tax savings on an adjusted basis in 2018. We are reinvesting roughly $75 million before tax into the business and our people and much of this is underway.","Turning to the first quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate our growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically accretive acquisitions, which were achieved for the fifth consecutive year in 2017.","We had a productive quarter for M&A. We completed our acquisition of MedXM, a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments related services. More on this acquisition in a few minutes.","We're integrating the acquisitions announced in the latter half of 2017 and we are pleased by the results. We guided earlier this year we expect to deliver about 250 basis points of growth from M&A in 2018, which is above the top end of our 1% to 2% objective. Our M&A pipeline remains strong and our strategy is delivering growth.","Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospital health systems. In March, we entered into a professional lab services relationship with an integrated healthcare delivery system in New England.","We acknowledged earlier that PAMA is a headwind for us. However, reimbursement cuts are bigger headwinds for hospital systems operating outreach laboratories. ","Hospital executives are starting to become more aware of the impact of PAMA and we're having more frequent conversations with them about their lab strategy and how we can help.","Many of you have asked about the possibility of expanding your access with major health plans. We continue to have productive conversations and make progress with a number of payers.","Quest offers health plans and their members' unmatched convenience, access, quality and value. And based upon our recent conversations, it's clear that many health plan leaders agree.","We're delivering on the third element of our growth strategy, which is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Key growth drivers in the quarter were prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON and non-invasive prenatal screening. ","In advanced diagnostics, we're making strong progress with our new center of excellence in precision medicine oncology in Texas. The center is helping community oncologists determine the most appropriate treatment of patients with cancer.","Since we acquired Med Fusion, we've seen an acceleration of growth of their tumor panels. 70% of patients with cancer are treated by community cancer centers and we're excited about the opportunities that Med Fusion is creating with networks of community cancer practices like The US Oncology Network and Texas Oncology, as well as Baylor Scott & White Health, the largest health system in Texas.","We continue to make strong progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice of consumers.","Our Walmart locations continue to perform well with an increase in patient traffic across the board and outstanding feedback on the customer experience.","We're expanding into different markets and we expect to open many more locations throughout this year. We're pleased with the progress and excited about the future of this important partnership with Walmart.","The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health within analytics and extended care services. The integration of MedXM is going well. Customers are excited that we can help them close their gaps in care using mobile healthcare professionals to reach patients when and where it's convenient for them.","So, let me give you one example on this capability, is closing gaps of care. Diabetic eye screening is a key part of diabetes care. MedXM's National Health Plan customers identify at-risk Medicare Advantage or managed Medicaid members. ","MedXM call centers then reach out to those patients to schedule health risk assessment to visit the patient and perform a series of tests, which include capturing a retinal image. This program helps identify people at risk of diabetes. It enables health plans to improve their quality scores.","The second element of our two point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Earlier this month, we launched the pilot program with Humana MultiPlan, Optum, UnitedHealthcare to use Blockchain technology to improve the quality of healthcare providers data and reduce administrative costs.","We look forward to continuing to use our data and expertise for this project, which we believe can lower cost and improve efficiency within the healthcare system.","We are continuing to drive efficiency and effectiveness within Quest to cover the cost of wage inflation and reimbursement pressure. So, let me give you a few updates.","Our collaboration with Optum 360 continues to perform well. As consumers there, in a pre-share share of cost of their healthcare, more of our revenues come from patients, which poses collection challenges.","And despite the pressure from increased patient responsibility, we're succeeding in keeping our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility in line with last year.","We're collaborating with payers to bring price transparency to healthcare through our real-time estimation tool. This tool enables a health plan member at a patient service center to know before a specimen is drawn if the test is covered and what out-of-pocket cost the health plan member will pay for that test.","We're continuing to enable our business to improve the customer experience. Our e-check-in process has been used in more than 27 million patient encounters. Our patients like the convenience and this information helps us place providers where they are needed most based on the patient flow.","We have 1,500 sites with e-check-in and expect to deploy in all of our patient service centers by the end of 2018.","Now, let me turn over to Mark who will take you through our financial performance. ","Mark Guinan ","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.88 billion were up 3.7% versus the prior year. ","Please note that due to a change in revenue recognition accounting, we now report uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of net revenues instead of as bad debt.","Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, improved 4.1% compared to the prior year, with approximately 340 basis points attributed to acquisitions. ","Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.2% versus the prior year driven by acquisitions, with organic growth essentially flat. Volume was negatively impacted by weather and the timing of major holidays during the quarter. ","The impact of weather presented a volume headwind of 60 basis points. The timing of the Easter and Passover holidays this year versus last year weighed on first quarter requisition volumes and created a tougher year-over-year comparison.","Revenue per requisition in the first quarter grew by 1.6% versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req.","Unit price headwinds during the quarter were approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and less than 100 basis points from all other factors. This is consistent with the outlook we provided in February and is in line with the trends we've observed for several quarters. After many changes to PAMA, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019 as we have indicated previously.","Beyond unit price, other mix elements remained strong in the quarter and more than offset reimbursement headwinds.","Reporter operating income for the quarter was $272 million or 14.5% of revenues compared to $279 million or 15.4% of revenues a year ago.","On an adjusted basis, operating income was $303 million or 16.1% of revenues compared to $297 million or 16.3% of revenues last year.","Operating income decreased by $8 million compared to the prior-year as a result of weather. The decline in operating margin was caused by a mix of PAMA, weather and acquisitions, which are in the early stages of integration and, therefore, not yet delivering full-margin contribution.","Almost, as Steve mentioned, we're using a portion of our savings from tax reform to reinvest into the business and our people. We expect these investments to help us continue to accelerate growth, which also impacted operating margin in this quarter.","Reporter EPS was $1.27 in the quarter compared to $1.16 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.52, up roughly 25% from $1.22 last year. ","Note that our adjusted EPS now excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based comp to provide greater clarity into the underlying operational performance of our business.","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 23% compared to 32% last year.","As I mentioned earlier, our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility are no longer reported in selling, general and administrative expense. That said, we intend to provide periodic updates on the progress we continue to make with our revenue cycle management partner, Optum 360.","In the first quarter, our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility are flat year-over-year. ","Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $180 million versus $196 million last year. The year-over-year difference was largely due to movements in our working capital accounts.","Capital expenditures during the quarter were $73 million compared to $42 million a year ago, which is in line with the higher CapEx spend planned for 2018.","Now, turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2018 remains unchanged and as follows. Revenues to be between $7.7 billion and $7.77 billion, an increase of 4% to 5% versus the prior year. ","Reported diluted EPS to be between $5.42 and $5.62 and adjusted EPS to be between $6.50 and $6.70.","Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures to be between $350 million and $400 million.","Recall that our guidance includes only the acquisitions that we've closed to date and that we closed several acquisitions in the back half of 2017.","We expect the earnings accretion from these deals to continue to ramp up throughout 2018 and into 2019.","I'll now turn it back to Steve.","Stephen Rusckowski ","Thanks, Mark. To summarize, we delivered a strong first quarter. We made solid progress accelerating growth and driving operational excellence.","And with that, we'd like to take your questions. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Good morning. So, just a quick clarification on the EBIT margins, it sounds like there's a number moving parts between PAMA, weather, acquisitions, and some investment in your people. Can you comment on how EBIT margins arrived in the quarter compared to your internal plan?","Mark Guinan","Yeah. Sure, Dan. I'll handle that. Certainly, PAMA was in our plan. The reinvestment to some of tax reform \u2013 again, this is self-evident, but when you reinvest tax, you're going to see a negative impact to the EBIT margins, obviously, offset by tax with the net results, though, obviously, being an increase in net income as a percent revenue.","The one thing that, obviously, we hadn't planned on was the weather. And as I mentioned, there was about $8 million impact of operating margin, which, certainly, you can see, that if that had not happened, we actually still would have grown EBIT margins despite PAMA, despite the reinvestment. Kind of worst part of the holidays. We know that the way the calendar falls has impact. We never quite know exactly how to predict, what that impact might be. So, I think as we look at all those pieces, that's probably what I would say.","And then, the last piece is acquisitions. That was certainly a part of our plan when we put together a business case and we planned those synergies. We know, as we've shared in the past, that it can take up to 12 to 18 months to get them to be kind of at their going rate of profitability. So, that was certainly in our plans as well.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Helpful color. And then, just a follow-up, you commented on tumor profiling in the prepared remarks. Can you comment on how your tumor profiling strategy might evolve, now that there is an NCD from Medicare for FDA-approved tumor profiling tests?","Stephen Rusckowski","So, Steve here. This is evolving. It has evolved and, I would say, it will continue to evolve. I think there's more and more interest by the FDA on how they will continue to think about oversight and regulatory controls around laboratory developed tests.","And this, I would describe, as one of the areas that they're looking at. So, with the new guidance that's out that did tick a forum that we're actually pleased about because we believe that we do have the process capabilities and the control capabilities to be able to support that.","And then second is, with that, it legitimizes through CMS the value that the tumor panels add to the diagnostic workup of a cancer patient. So, it just brings front and center the importance of getting a full workup when you make that expensive next choice in cancer care.","I think given my earlier comments with our acquisition of Med Fusion, about our strong work relationship with US Oncology, our working relationship with Memorial Sloan and IBM Watson, we have a strong and growing presence in the whole space.","So, we're very well positioned and actually pleased that there is some certain energy around it and some guidance about the controls in general because, I think, it's very important as we go forward that legitimate operating companies like ourselves that bring a lot of value to the marketplace have tight controls around the value of that, the verification of value of that and then the delivery of that. And we do that quite well. And so, therefore, approval for that and some kind of controls around that, we think, is a good thing.","Dan Leonard","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. And congrats on a good performance in the quarter. So, I have one question and then a quick follow-up. Just if you can give us an update on the United Lab contract and the timing for an Aetna RFP. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah, sure. So, as the industry knows, our nearest competitor's contract expires in 2018, number one. Number two is we've said that, obviously, we would like, under the right terms, to be on contract with United. We have also shared that we are in dialogue and we have nothing to share about that dialogue. And at the right time when we hopefully will have something, we'll share that. So, we're making progress there.","We also make progress with hundreds of others of health plans. Some big and some small. And we feel, as we enter 2019, we'll be in a really nice shape in terms of our portfolio relationships. And these relationships, yes, they're contractual related to being in network, but they're becoming more and more strategic.","I mentioned the work we're doing with our Extended Care Services and Population Health, the work we're doing around price transparency and our estimation tool. So, what we're doing is we definitely are showing ourselves as a laboratory. But as we said, we're in the diagnostic information services business.","And the last part of this is our consumer strategy is really resonating. That whole consumer experience, we're upgrading our patient service centers. We're e-enabling it with our e-checking capabilities. We're bringing nice information capabilities with our MyQuest application and this resonates extremely well with the health plans big and small. So, making good progress. And when we have something, we'll make sure that you all hear it quickly.","Ricky Goldwasser","Great, thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the M&A. Obviously, you're looking for 2.5% growth for 2018. So, in case I missed it, what the contribution of M&A in the quarter? And you said that new M&A is not included in guidance. So, now that PAMA is in place, I mean, have you seen any impact on valuation.","Stephen Rusckowski","I'll turn it to Mr. Mark. The question is how much M&A is in the quarter in Q1. And then, let's make more clarity around what we said around what was in the guidance for the 4% to 5% for M&A and what was excluded. So, Mark, you want to take that about Q1 and then the guidance? ","Mark Guinan","So, in the first quarter, M&A contributed 3.5% of the 3.7% total or the 4.1% of our core business. And we had included 250 basis points or 2.5% in our 4% to 5% guidance for the year. And that, obviously, will be stronger in the first half because we annualized some deals that you work through the year, but there's also potential upside without committing anything for new deals because we do not contemplate that in our guidance. ","Now, MedXM, which we had closed early in the year, was contemplated because it was completed by the time we shared our guidance in late January.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. You may go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","You bet. Thanks for hearing the question. Good morning, Steve. I guess, first off, can you talk a little bit more about the investments that you're actually making from the tax savings, what impact you expect it to have on the business? And then, just a real quick update on the retail growth strategy. How much contribution is that to your growth and how many more locations you're planning to open up this year?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah. Okay. So, first of all, on tax reform, what we shared with our fourth quarter results is we're going to take about $75 million in investment in the business and I would say the majority of this is around accelerating growth.","What we've said around up and the kind of the outlines of broad categories, and those broad categories, as you would, are some of our growth strategies. So, Quest Diagnostics, the consumer strategy, but also investing in our people. So, we also announced that we're going to provide a bonus for the vast majority of our employees that don't have equity and that will be payable in the fourth quarter.","So, all of that has started to feather into what you see starting in Q1 and will continue throughout the year. And with that, we believe this will help us accelerate growth around those five strategies.","The second part of your question is around Walmart. We're really pleased with the early returns. We started with the big states \u2013 Texas and Florida. They're going well. The customer feedback is really good. And the joint venture continues to look at prospects for other basic health services that we can provide in those stores. And so, we, as you know, formed the JV. This joint venture was about what we do around blood draws and what we do at Quest Diagnostics and our laboratory business.","But more importantly, it's all around Extended Care Services and Population Health and providing basic healthcare services to bend the cost curve. And so, we're excited about those prospects as well.","We won't give you a number today about how many stores. We're still kind of working out the details with Walmart around that, but there will be more. We have the initial stores and there will be more because the early returns and progress we're making is quite good.","Kevin Ellich","That was good. Thank you. ","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, AJ.","AJ Rice","Hey, how are you guys? Thanks. So, I'll just ask two quick parts here to questions. You referenced the discussions with hospitals in your prior remarks, Steve. I wonder \u2013 I know a lot of times \u2013 I haven't covered the hospitals for many years \u2013 that they don't always see the reimbursement changes coming. And when they come, they tend to then react to them. And I wonder where we're at in that, sort of appreciating what PAMA might mean to their lab business and where you've seen an uptick in discussions because of that? And maybe it will take till next year when there's a further step up. But I just wondered where you think hospitals are in understanding the implications of that and whether that's changing their thinking in any meaningful way about their lab business.","And then, just expand on the last question. With all the consolidation activity at CVS, Cigna, Express. Reports about Walmart as well. I wonder, has that changed either urgency of your discussions with some of your retail partners or has it opened up new people coming to you and asking about maybe potential collaboration? Just curious if it's having an impact to your discussion.","Stephen Rusckowski","Okay. So, let me take the first part, which is hospitals. I would say, this is \u2013 the pace of awareness is accelerating. What you find is that we have a number of hospital executives that are aware of PAMA. And second is they're greatly aware of all the other pressure that they have in hospitals.","So, if you talk to hospital executives today, there's a lot of pressure, and not just with PAMA. And so, many have cost improvement goals. Many are anxious to understand ways they could become more efficient. And so, our hospital strategy plays nicely into being a program that they can launch with us, to put some point through the board, if you will, particularly around in-patient laboratory cost, which is a key part of our value proposition. So, independent of us, it's accelerating.","Second is we are accelerating it as well. So, we're knocking on many hospital executives doors to make sure that they are aware, if they're not aware already, and have a conversation around this and specifically around the lab strategy.","So, we've engaged with many systems, particularly those that have large outreach businesses to talk about their lab strategy. So, it's a deliberate strategy of our accelerate strategy to make sure that they're well aware and understand what their options could be and think about the possibilities. So, we are helping with the information out there as well.","The second part of your question has to do with our retail strategy. Now, we're working on this retail strategy for years. This has happened overnight. As we said, Walmart departed that. We have Safeway who is a part of that. We do active work for CVS in the MinuteClinic. They've evolved their strategy. We have a great working relationship with Aetna. We'll see if that potential merger becomes a reality, but because of the great relationship with CVS and Aetna. We're actually hopeful that this could help accelerate some of the work we could do with them as well. Number one.","And number two is the work with Walmart, I said in my earlier comments, is going well. And speculation what they will or will not do on health is for them to communicate about. But just reemphasizes their commitment and energy around this topic.","And as far as other retailers, we're working on making sure that we have the right number and also don't leave any geography uncovered. And as you know, some of these partners we have announced so far, like Safeway and Walmart, have a center of mass that doesn't necessarily cover the whole population of the United States.","So, as we continue to work through this, we continue to understand how there might be fitting different retail partnerships that could complement what we already have. But, fortunately, we're early to the table around this. We're off and running. You see the reinforcement of this with some of the deals that are out in the marketplace. So, our strategy is the right one. And it's being supported by the marketplace and this consolidation is interesting. But, more importantly, is try to bring their resources together with the capabilities. Our capabilities of data and services are quite essential to what this is all about, which is to bend the cost curve. And that was a portion of my prepared remarks about what we're actually doing with MedXM in the middle overall.","AJ Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you,","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may go ahead.","Jack Meehan","I want to stick with consolidation. How are some of the recent acquisitions you've closed, like Shiel Medical Lab performing? In this conversation with hospitals you're having, how much of an appetite is there for PLS versus sale of lab assets?","Stephen Rusckowski","I'll start and I'll turn it to Mark for some more color. First of all, when we walk in and have a conversation with a C-suite, as a matter of fact, this week we just had a leadership group of our top 40 to 50 executives that we want to make sure are prepared to have a broad conversation about all the capabilities of Quest Diagnostics. Part of that is around what we described as our hospital strategy. And in 2016, in our investor day, we shared this with you.","And this, we have three pieces. One is we ask the question, we want to have a conversation around your lab strategy and is that important to you and you have one. ","Surprisingly to us, initially, but not anymore, many of the CEOs and the C suites have it on their list. It's one of the strategic question, what they're going to do around lab.","And related to that, there's three pieces. One is what they're doing with their hospital inpatient cost and our simple value proposition there is we have now good confidence, a track record of accounts that are all referenceable that we've actually saved them some money because it is a call center and we do that a variety of ways.","When we get into that conversation, then we have a conversation around their sophisticated testing or advanced diagnostics that they send to reference laboratories, we're a player there. We're the market leader in that regard and we believe there's more we could do in terms of consolidation and getting smarter about the diagnostics in the inpatient care setting, classing suppliers and making sure you do the right tests for the right patient at the right time. ","And the part of this is a conversation, if they're in outreach, if they partner with us with inpatient, if they partner with us around reference testing, what's their strategy around outreach. And this is where we have a conversation around what's happening with PAMA with their Medicare volumes, the pressure that's going to be on commercial rates given the reality of what's happening in this marketplace.","And so, we end with a comprehensive strategy. If you see one, you see one. But we've shared last year with PeaceHealth. That was a good example. We bought their outreach. We're helping with their inpatient laboratories and as well we're helping them with their reference testing. So, when that happens, we're their partner for laboratory services in the integrated delivery system. And that's resonating well given all the pressures they have and all the parties that they have in the current dynamic in the marketplace.","So, Mark, specific to the opportunities around consolidation, you want to share a little bit about how that's going?","Mark Guinan","Sure, Steve. When you're talking consolidation, you mean within the laboratory industry and specifically us as a consolidator. And, yes, specifically about Shiel, Shiel is early. We're pleased with the initial results. I can share a little bit. ","Commercial is fully integrated. From an operational standpoint, largely integrated, including billing, which is critically important. We haven't completely consolidated the entire infrastructure, the draw centers and things like that. That takes a little bit of time. But, certainly, after a few months, we're pleased and on plan. And then, I think, most critically, retention is good. So, if you look at the number of customers that moved over from Shiel to us, relative to expectations and the model, we're doing very well. So, that's what I can share, the point around Shiel. So, feel like it was a very nice deal. And at this point, it's on plan.","Jack Meehan","Great. Mark, I had one follow-up for you, which was on accounts receivable. I know there's some seasonality at the beginning of the year, but it took a bigger step up than we expected, not in the first quarter, maybe just comment on that and bad debt. Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Sure. So, if you look at the dollars, obviously, we're a larger business, especially with the acquisitions. If you look at the days, 47 and change, that's kind of where we typically are. Last year, we ended at a relatively AR level four a couple of different reasons. I think you may have been asking about year-end Q4 to Q1. And when you think about Q4, that is a ramp down quarter. So, October is much larger than December. And then, if you look at Q1, obviously, it's a ramp up quarter. So, March is much larger than January. So, you're always going to see a dollar dynamic where the end of Q1 in terms of receivables is much larger than Q4.","Shawn Bevec","Jack, I'll also add to that. This is Shawn. With the accounting change around bad debt, that's obviously going to impact all of the historical DSO. So, you'd have to go back and recalculate those after you make the relevant adjustment to get a comparison quarter by quarter.","Jack Meehan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick Donnelly","How are you? One of the more common topics that comes up in our conversations is just the durability of margins once the heavier impacts from PAMA are felt beyond 2018. Can you just talk through any opportunities you see given that you guys have hit your Invigorate targets? And also, how you're think about that in the context of an environment where we're seeing a bit of a tick up in wage growth.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks for the question. What was shared in 2016, and we continuously talk about it, we have our two point strategy. First is all around accelerating growth. We talked at great length of our five strategies around that where we made great progress.","The second is operational excellence. And what we shared in the end of 2017 is we achieved our goal of $1.3 billion run rate savings. But what we also shared is we have more opportunities in front of us. This is a large, highly complex business and we still have plenty of opportunities to get better.","And what we shared is \u2013 one example of that is we're kind of at the final push of harmonizing our processes and standardizing our systems. When we do that, it allows us to streamline our workflow. And then, second is it reduces our IT cost, by way of an example. This will happen in 2018. You'll see that in 2019. ","We still have some opportunities around consolidation of our laboratory network. We've shared that we're building a new facility, a new laboratory facility in New Jersey. It's a big project for us. When that is completed, it will allow us to consolidate our physical presence in what we call our east region. So, it will allow us to consolidate some of our regional laboratories into one. We're continuing to see a big opportunity around the e-enablement. When we e-enable the process, we can take cost out. In prior calls, we talked about simple things. For instance, we got a lot of calls that came in to our call centers around results. And so, now what we've done is educated our customers that you can get these results online. And so, what it has done is eliminated a lot of call volume coming into our call centers, allows us to reduce cost. Customers are happy.","So, we continuously look at opportunities. And so, we have dialed into our guidance for this year in our outlook. Those opportunities, we haven't given you a specific number. But I'll assure you that it's embedded in those numbers and that allows us to offset the wage inflation and also the reimbursement pressure that we provided you some color around.","And that will be clearly in our sights in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and beyond. There's a lot of opportunities. ","Patrick Donnelly","Very helpful. Thank you.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may go ahead.","Amanda Murphy","Hi. Good morning. Actually, just had a follow-up to AJ and Jack's questions around your hospital strategy and thank you for all the comments there. When you first outlined the kind of increased focus, you had talked about opportunities to expand relationships over time. For example, getting incremental reference work. I know it's kind of early on some of these deals, but I just was wondering if you could give some comments there in terms of how the conversations are progressing or are there any anecdotal examples of where you've been able to expand relationships over the course of the relationships that you've gotten safe now?","Stephen Rusckowski","So, the one I brought up is PeaceHealth. That's a great example. They looked at their hospital -- excuse me, yeah, looked at their hospital strategy. And that's the three aspects that I talked about, how we can help them help them with their inpatients, laboratory cost. Second is, can we help them become more efficient and effective, rather, reference testing for inpatients, ordering of diagnostics and then, finally, is they had an outreach business. And we now acquired outreach business and integrating it into our west region. A great example. ","I would share another example. If you recall back a couple years ago, we bought Hartford Hospitals' outreach business. The way we look at all this, Amanda, is these are beachheads. We start there and then we build. We build credibility. We build existing relationships. We manage the account. And in the case of Hartford, we continue to look at how we can help them, consolidate some of their purchases or reference testing. We had a dialogue around their hospital laboratories and should we help them become more efficient. So, a good example where working relationship, even though it starts in one year, it could build.","Amanda Murphy","Have you seen actual growth then in reference testing if you think back over last year, for example? Is it actually impacting organic volume growth at this point?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah. So, interesting enough, what you find is there's two pieces of this. One is, what's happening with our share of the marketplace. And then the second is what's happening in the hospital marketplace.","So, actually, what we've seen in Q1 in hospital volumes, given admissions volumes have been relatively flat best \u2013 as we talked to hospital executives and this puts a log in our fire to help them become more efficient. There is a lot of pressure on hospitals, both from a volume perspective of patient admissions and second is reimbursement changes. And so, what we see in our reference testing business, even though we might be picking up some more share, volumes are relatively stable.","And then, second is, in that portion of our business, we do see some price challenges. There's more competition. And what we have is a deliberate strategy. When we have a market like that, for the leader should get stronger and this plays into our strategy. So, many hospital systems are looking at consolidating suppliers, having a more comprehensive strategy. So, we hope over time to continue to build share, but probably more of a more challenging marketplace than two to three years ago.","Mark Guinan","And just, Amanda, to add, we don't do a POS deal without a reference deal. The only question is how much of the reference business comes. No, we certainly would not just do POS alone. In many of these cases, as we shared, we serve half the hospitals in the country. And so, I'd probably say most of these cases, if not all, we already were doing some reference work. So, there's an opportunity to expand that footprint and do more or, in some cases, all of it. So, that is part and parcel of the relationship. And as we shared, we therefore locked that up in a five to seven-year contract instead of being subject to periodic RFPs and competitive situation. So, it's a nice longer-term relationship between us and the hospital.","Amanda Murphy","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Ross.","Operator","Ross, your line is open. Please check your mute feature.","Ross Muken","Hi. Hopefully, you can hear me. So, I'm just trying to make sense of how you are able to essentially hold margins almost flat \u2013 we're down a touch \u2013 considering what we saw with PAMA. And the part that I really would like to dig into is on the OpEx line. It looks like on the restated numbers, OpEx was sort of down even a touch year-on-year or flattish, which given the acquisitions implies the core was sort of down. And, obviously, we know you're doing some investments. So, help us understand just kind of sequentially the cadence and then what is implied to the rest of the year because that seems like really good performance considering all of the sort of things you had to deal with in the quarter on the weather and PAMA side.","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah. So, we'll tag team this. Mark and I again. First of all, as I mentioned in my quote, we did execute well. And I think as we pointed out, there is a lot of moving parts. A lot of moving parts within the quarter. And so, we had to make sure that we managed all those levers.","We mentioned, in Mark's comments, we have acquisitions coming in. We have investments for tax reform. And also, there was an earlier comment about what are you doing around our Invigorate program around cost improvements.","And so, within Q1, you've got all that going on. Okay? You've that all going on. And so, what we need to \u2013 what we do as a management team is we pull together that integrated plan to continue to sell progress. We get to the outlook that we laid out in the marketplace with those moving parts, with the uncertainty sometimes of what's happening in the market. For instance, you cannot predict the severe winter that we saw, but we had to manage our way through that.","So, with that as a high level summary, Mark, do you want to give a little more color of the pieces?","Mark Guinan","Yeah, sure. As you know, Ross, price and inflation are headwinds on margin. We talk about our productivity which we've discussed with Invigorate in the past and we said we believe we've got some cost capability. We can drive about 3% a year on a cost base of over $6 billion. So, you can do the math on that.","Obviously, we have also shared that we did a substantial amount of M&A. A lot of that was skewed towards the back end. So, we expect margin expansion on that new book of business throughout the year, which will help us.","And then, finally, the important piece is organic growth. So, when we grow organically, the way we've been doing, obviously, the drop-through on the incremental revenue is higher than the fully-loaded margin. So, that's another opportunity to offset some of the headwinds in price and inflation.","So, when you add all those together, that's where we came out with reaffirming our longer-term outlook despite PAMA being more significant than any of us had anticipated. ","We still said we're going be able to do by 2020 what we said in 2016, which is topline of 3 to 5, although I did caution more likely to be in the lower end and the higher end if PAMA stays where it is and then growing our earnings. Not earnings per share, but earnings, mid-to-high single digits. But that, obviously, also directionally has correlation with the topline as well. So, probably more likely to be at the lower end than that.","So, in terms of the rest of the year, the investments that Steve referenced, the $75 million, some of those are fairly smooth over the year. Some of them are accounting, like the bonus that Steve mentioned. So, we're clearly that pretty equally. And then, some of them are going to ramp up a little bit as we move throughout the year, but we also have those other factors such as strong organic growth and expansion of our acquired revenue that's been offset, that incremental investment.","Ross Muken","Helpful color. Thank you, guys.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. You may go ahead.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Massaro","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to touch on organic volumes and revenue in the quarter. Mark, I know you indicated that organic volumes are flattish. You called out 60 basis points from weather.","Looking at last year, I think you actually grew organic volumes by 2.6%. And so, I think embedded in your guidance for 2018 is 1.5% to 2.5%. So, can you help us think of some of the key drivers that will get you to your midpoint of 2% organic revenue growth for the year?","Mark Guinan","Yes, sure. So, volume is going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. There is a number of factors. When you look at early last year, we had a couple POS deals that were fairly new. And then, those were obviously ramping up. We didn't close a significant amount of POS late in 2017. And, remember, our POS is organic. We're not buying anything. So, that is organic growth.","Certainly, as I mentioned, the timing of the holidays \u2013 and the floating holidays have significant impact on our \u2013 so, if you have \u2013 when you look at New Year's, when you look at Fourth of July and when you look at Christmas, if those fall on a weekend versus a Wednesday, there's a dramatic difference in that quarter in terms of the volume.","And so, when you look at the way this year started out, the previous year, we had New Year's on a weekend and this year we didn't. So, it's not just that day that you get a little spillover from those holiday right before or right after. Certainly, that had a little impact. So, I wouldn't make too much \u2013 read too much into the quarter to quarter slight variation. So, we'll try to share to the best of our abilities what the real drivers are and things that certainly have implications going forward.","I'd say, the first quarter, there was a fair amount of noise. And there's significant in terms of utilization or other things that you might be concerned about. And we certainly are very confident of the guidance that we put out and keeping on track with our commitments.","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah. So, just to add to that, one part of reaffirming the 4% to 5%, if you look at Q1 and we go through some of the pieces, and earlier we got a question on what's happening on the hospital side, hospital admissions are stable. But we were very pleased \u2013 we kind of look at all the different pieces of the volumes we see from our physician portion of our business, which is the vast majority of where we get our testing, we are actually, when you think through the different pieces, when you think about what Mark described and some of the headwinds, and you couple with that the offset with PAMA in terms of that price reduction in Q1 and when we look at that physician business, we actually felt okay about our performance in Q1 and we thought it was solid. And therefore, we have confidence in the 4% to 5% for this year, which includes that 250 basis points for acquisition. And as you described it, the rest from organic revenue growth.","Mark Massaro","Thank you, very helpful.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. You may go ahead.","Bryan Ross","Hi. This is Brian Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. I just had a quick one on commercial contract discussions. I know, in the past, you've highlighted the overall value prop that Quest demonstrates during payer conversations, negotiation. I guess, my question is more on how much does the value of Quest lab data play in those conversations? And do you see that becoming a bigger chip in the negotiations as we move forward?","And then, secondly, how exactly is Quest currently leveraging and monetizing that data and what further opportunities do you see there as we move forward?","Stephen Rusckowski","Brian, it's becoming increasingly more important, particularly as I mentioned in my introductory comments. If you get into Managed Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, when the payers are, obviously, are taking the risk and they're really trying to understand that 5% of the population represents 50% of the cost. So, what we described with our capabilities in Extended Care Services and specifically called out what we're doing with MedXM. The ability for us to have specific programs where we used the data we have to pinpoint and to identify the patient and then they use our call centers and then our onsite services, which could be in a convenient location like a Walmart, but also it could include one of our care professionals going into someone's home.","So, a lot of interest around, yes, we are the world's largest lab, but what we are is the world's largest diagnostic information services company, which includes using the data to identify the opportunities and then manage the care in a more active way and bend the cost curve.","Bryan Ross","Got it, thanks.","Mark Guinan","And I would also add that some of the things Steve referenced, like our real-time estimation, they see the value of that because one of the difficulties that they deal with is patients being surprised about coverage, patient being surprised about cost. And so, this is, as we shared in the past, one of the win-win-win all around. The patient is happier. We're happier. The payers are happier. So, they actually appreciate us rolling out that tool. It's not just for us. It helps them quite a bit as well. So, patients can make decisions ahead instead of finding out after around coverage and cost and so on. So, really, the value that we bring goes well beyond just the data.","The other one is our sales force. So, when you look at how they are struggling to control costs, we are part of the solution. The national labs are great value. And the fact that we can deploy our sales force to help them with physicians, we call it leakage or steerage, we are setting work to high cost providers. And with data from the payer, walk in and say, hey, doc, you've got some patients on high deductible plan. You're costing them money when you send them to this laboratory. Let me show you from their insurance company the difference between setting it up and sending it to this \u2013 who you're currently utilizing. That's powerful for the payers. They know that, actually, in that case, we are fully aligned.","And then, finally, the retail strategy. They really like that. Yes, they want to control costs, but they want their patients to get their diagnostic work done, especially if you're monitoring a condition, if they're a risk-bearing entity. They've got Managed Medicare, Medicaid. They want those patients to get these things done. And, obviously, if we're putting in more convenient sites, it's more likely the patients will get that critical testing.","Mark Guinan","A secondary value we bring to the table, I mentioned in my remarks, is around quality scores. So, if the quality scores are right, they are driving the right care process and to close those gaps in care, we help identify those patients which allows them to score better and get higher reimbursement from payers. So, it all fits together. The value is well beyond our diagnostic testing.","Bryan Ross","Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And there are no further questions.","Stephen Rusckowski","Okay. Well, we appreciate your time. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your support.

This morning I'll provide you with some perspective on PAMA, highlights on the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy, which continues to drive results. Then Mark will provide more detail and take you through updates on our 2017 guidance.","Well, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth in spite of some weather challenges. We completed two previously announced acquisitions and agreed to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory and then yesterday we announced a strategic relationship with Cleveland Clinic that includes the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab.","Here are some highlights from this quarter. Revenues were $1.93 billion up 2.4%, reported EPS of $1.15 was down 14% from 2016, adjusted EPS grew 150 basis points to a $1.39, which includes an increase of $0.02 over the prior year of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation.","Our updated guidance for our full-year 2017 primarily reflects the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, which impacted geographies where we have a large presence as well as our recently closed acquisitions.","Before I describe the progress, we have made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, I'd like to discuss PAMA. We continue to urge CMS to delay the implementation of PAMA to take the time to get it right. The preliminary rates that CMS released are not market-based rates as Congress indicated.","Unfortunately, only 1% of all laboratories submitted data and over 99% of hospitals and physician office laboratories were prohibited from reporting their rates. Also based on data submitted through CMS, Quest alone represented nearly 40% of all the market data CMS collected.","As you're aware from previous days, our estimated share of the Medicare market is less than 15%. Instead of protecting access to essential laboratory testing, this flawed approach could greatly compromise Medicare beneficiaries access to testing. A large portion of the Medicare population receives their services from small laboratories and PAMA could put them at risk.","We've been collecting facts that demonstrate the many ways that CMS has disregarded the intent of Congress and we've been finding the receptive audience among legislators and policymakers in Washington DC for our call to take more time to get the implementation right.","The clinical lab industry is a critical element in the healthcare and economic landscape of this country, creating jobs, driving economic activity and generating tax revenues for the federal and state governments. Our trade association's recent economic study found that this industry directly and indirectly employs over 600,000 people that contributes $13 billion in tax revenues. The impacts of these proposed cuts are far-reaching to this vital industry.","These rates should not be finalized as proposed and this view is shared by 22 respected medical societies and health groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and the American Hospital Association is very much back of our plan.","In October, we -- on October 6, sent a letter with these leading voices in healthcare, calling for CMS to take immediate action to address the significant deficiencies in its progress to establish new clinical laboratory payment rates. Along with our trade association, we are exploring every option to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to diagnostic information services.","In whatever form CMS might implement PAMA, Quest will be prepared and we remain confident in our ability to meet the long-term commitments outlined at our 2016 Investor Day. Mark will touch on this later.","Turning to the progress we've made in the third quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions, which we're on track to achieve for the fifth consecutive year.","We had a very productive quarter. We completed two previously announced acquisitions and agreed to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory, which we will further strengthen -- which further strengthens our position in the New York metropolitan market.","Yesterday we and also announced the acquisition of the Cleveland HeartLab from Cleveland Clinic. This lab will become our advanced diagnostic center of expertise in cardiovascular testing, an agreement build on our existing relationship with the Cleveland Clinic. Our M&A pipeline remains very strong and our strategy is delivering growth.","With the acquisitions we've completed this year and those expected to close by the end of 2017, we are well-positioned to exceed our long-term M&A objective for 2018 and of course in accretion realized from the deals in 2018 will help offset the potential impact of new Medicare rates.","Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationship with hospital systems. Our relationship with PeaceHealth is progressing well. As you recall the relationship includes the acquisition of the outreach laboratory as well as a professional laboratory service agreement to manage laboratories at 11 PeaceHealth Medical Centers in Washington State, Oregon and Alaska. This relationship is fully operational and already contributing revenues and adjusted earnings growth.","The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. In the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point in Texas forming a national precision oncology center of expertise and we are very pleased with the integration efforts to date.","In women's health we continue to be excited about the progress we've made in noninvasive prenatal screening. Our Q-Natal test is providing strong double-digit growth year-over-year. We recently complimented our women's health offering with QHerit, a screening panel that helps both women and men across multiple identify the risk of passing 22 genetic diseases to their children.","We also introduced the cholesterol test with an improved method for assessing heart disease risk in aiding treatment decisions. Unlike most lipid tests that does not require fasting and patient's life is added convenience.","We all made progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Our relationship with Safeway continues to expand as we are now operating in 128 stores and are expected to open about 30 more before the end of 2017. In addition, our collaboration with Walmart will open new locations in 2017.","In this exciting era of the empowered healthcare consumer, are MyQuest mobile application is now delivering lab results into the hands of 4.5 million users. Payers are taking notice of the progress we are making on our consumer strategy, especially with convenience, value and the number of access points we provide.","The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health and data analytics and extended care services. We're building a solid pipeline with data analytics with a number of partners interested in leveraging our data, including pharma, CRO and health plan customers.","Turning to the second part of our two-point strategy to drive operational excellence, we remain on track to deliver $1.3 billion to invigorate run rate savings as we exit 2017. As we drive operational efficiency, we continue to improve the customer experience. Over 950 of our 2,200 patient service centers are live with e-check-in, which improves the patient experience.","Our total e-check-in volume is over 12 million encounters to date. We expect to have this capability in most of our patient service centers by the end of this year.","Now let me turn it over to Mark who'll take you through our financial performance in detail. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks Steve. Starting with revenue, consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion were up 2.4% versus the prior year. We estimate the impact of the recent hurricanes reduced our revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points in the third quarter, which is slightly lower than what we had estimated in late September.","Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 2.8% compared to the prior year with approximately 140 basis point attributed to recent acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of our acquisitions increased 1.6% versus the prior year of which about 60 basis points was organic.","However, note that the impact of hurricanes presented a headwind of approximately 140 basis points to volume in the quarter. Revenue per acquisition in the third quarter grew by 1.2% compared to the prior year. As a reminder revenue per rep is not proxy for price. It includes the number of variables such as unit price variation testament and test per rep.","Here price headwinds in the third quarter remain less than 100 basis points. While price fluctuations can vary from quarter to quarter, we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain moderate through the final quarter of 2017 and consistent with the last several quarters.","Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our PLS partnerships, other mix elements including test mix contributed to the slightly more than the positive 100 to 200 basis point trend we've observed for several quarters.","Reported operating income for the quarter was $298 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $322 million or 17.1% of revenues a year ago. Keep in mind, our reported operating income in 2016 included a gain on Escrow recovery associated with an acquisition.","On an adjusted basis, operating income was $325 million or 16.8% of revenues compared to $320 million or 17% of revenues last year. We estimate the impact of hurricanes produced adjusted operating by approximately $18 million in the third quarter, which adversely impacted operating income growth by nearly six percentage points.","Excluding the impact of the hurricane, adjusted operating income would have grown more than 7% and adjusted operating margin would have expanded 50 basis points year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.15 in the quarter versus a $1.34 in the prior year period. As noted previously, our third quarter 2016 results included a gain on Escrow recovery associated with an acquisition.","Adjusted EPS was $1.39 up 2% from a $1.37 last year. We estimate the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.08 or nearly 6%. The company recorded net after-tax charges totaling $20 million in the third quarter or $0.14 per diluted share, representing system conversion, restructuring, integration and other one-time costs.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 36% versus 33% last year. Last year's rate benefitted from the previously mentioned Escrow recovery, which was nontaxable. In the quarter, we recorded approximately $7 million or $0.04 per diluted share of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation or SBC compared to $3 million or $0.02 per share benefit last year.","Year-to-date we've reported $36 million or $0.25 per share of excess tax benefits associated with SBC, which is an increase of $0.20 year-over-year. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4% flat versus last year and 20 basis points lower versus the prior quarter.","Turning to cash provided by operations, we generated $852 million in 2017 year-to-date versus $765 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $170 million compared to $165 million a year ago.","Now turning to guidance, we are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenue is now expected to be approximately $7.71 billion, an increase of about 2.6% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS to be between $4.87 and $4.92 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.62 and $5.67.","Cash provided by operations remains at approximately $1.2 million and finally capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million. Despite the impact of recent hurricanes, our full year revenue guidance is in line with our prior outlook and operating cash flow guidance remains unchanged.","Our updated EPS guidance reflects the approximate $0.08 hurricane impact noted previously, the impact from recently closed acquisitions, a $0.02 year-over-year increase of excess tax benefits associated with SBC recorded in the third quarter and a small but ongoing impact from hurricane Maria on our quarterly cooperation in the fourth quarter.","It's also important to remember that despite these headwinds just mentioned, our updated guidance is in line with or exceeding the outlook we provided to you at the beginning of 2017. While we aren\u2019t prepared to providing 2018 guidance at this time, we want to remind you that we do not expect the same levels of excess tax benefits associated with SBC in 2017 to recurrent next year.","Therefore, as you think about 2018, we would encourage you to focus on our 2017 EPS guidance, excluding the $0.20 year-over-year increase of excess tax benefits associated with SBC and assume the same $0.06 we saw in 2016 as a jump-off point for 2018.","Finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our long-term outlook, which we had reaffirmed today. Recall at 2016 Investor Day, we provided a long-term outlook from 2017 through 2020, which included a revenue CAGR of 3% to 5% with 1% to 2% growth expected from acquisitions.","It also included an adjusted earnings CAGR faster than revenue in the mid to high single-digit range. Note that this earnings outlook contemplated a starting point of $5.15 and adjusted EPS in 2016 and did not include any tax benefits associated with SBC beyond the base level of $0.06 recorded in 2016.","This outlook implies adjusted EPS in the range of $6 to $7 by 2020, excluding the impact of excess tax benefits associated with SBC. With regard to PAMA, the cost in the current proposed fee schedule are deeper than expected. If the proposed fee schedule is finalized as its currently stated, we remain confident that we can achieve our long-term outlook, while our earnings outlook is more likely to be at the lower end of the range we provided. That said, M&A activity beyond our 1% to 2% growth target represents potential update to this outlook.","Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks Mark. We've summarized a very busy and productive quarter we turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Our updated guidance for our full-year 2017 reflects the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, which impacted geographies where we have a large presence as well as the impact of recently closed acquisitions.","And then finally, we remain confident in our ability to meet the long-term commitments outlined at our 2016 Investor Day.","Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro","Good morning, guys. Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Isaac.","Isaac Ro","Hey Steve. So, both questions I had for you were longer term in nature if I may. First one had to do with market share. If we assume that you're not able to convince the regulators to push back timing of implementation, could you talk a little bit about how quickly you think the marketplace will start to react to the new pricing reality and what does that mean for your ability to start trying to take some market share in the next six to 12 months?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah thanks Isaac. Well first of all we've been in the consolidation mode as far as our strategy for the past five years, a significant part of our growth strategy is to get that 1% to 2% of growth through acquisition. What you see from us this quarter is we announced two acquisitions, puts us in that range of 1% to 2% for 2017 and while we said that puts us in a very good place for 2018.","So, our acquisition strategy continues to be part of our consolidation strategy. We continue to see interest in companies or laboratories looking at their strategic options and so we believe that's still a good part of our strategy. And then secondly, is we're confident that our guide proposition in the marketplace is really second to none.","Our value of how we deliver our services is very strong in the marketplace from a quality and our service. You couple that with what we're doing on our consumer strategy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about the convenience of what we're doing moving around our enablement of the whole process and are our better and better access for the consumer. Our value proposition of the marketplace is quite strong.","And so, I also mentioned Isaac is that payers are taking notice to that and if you look at our assets today through our health plan relationships, it's really much stronger than what we've had in the past that will continue to build and as we get that better access we health insurance companies, we will continue to grow faster than the market place, both through acquisitions and organically.","So, tracking well with our plan to accelerate growth and we believe that that is the right strategy for us going into the future. So, thanks for the question.","Isaac Ro","Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on I think Mark's comment at the end around long-term guidance and if I go back to your 2015 Analyst Day you talked about EPS growth in the mid-to-high single digits, you're staying with the current outlook maybe more towards the lower end of the range.","Could you articulate how much of that you think will come from M&A versus organically and just trying to understand the importance of M&A in achieving that new outlook, thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Sure Isaac. So, I was qualifying that we would be in the lower end if PAMA moved forward under the currently proposed fee schedule. So obviously while the things we've shared we're trying to influence that. So, at this point we're not locked into that.","What we're saying is that would be the likely outcome or the cost to be a significant or seeing in the original proposal, but we're obviously commenting on that and there is still some more work to be done to see where that settles down.","So, I wouldn't say at this point we're signaling the lower end. We're just saying there is significant impact and impairment while we certainly contemplated that with that outlook in November of 2016. That's why we gave a range. This is in the high end of what we might have expected coming our CMS. So, I would not lock into that at this point.","In terms of M&A other than the deal that we have already executed, do not have any earnings projections that are based on future M&A. Certainly in our revenue, we've talked about getting 1% to 2%, but we all know that it takes a period of time generally 12 to 18 months before you get to a run rate level of earnings contribution.","So, in that mid to high single digits, so I am not counting on significant contributions from unexecuted M&A on the bottom line only on the revenue side.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. You line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Kevin.","Kevin Ellich","I guess I want to go back to PAMA, in the press release you talked about exploring every option in terms of you guys and the lab industry exploring every option to make sure Medicare beneficiaries have access to lab services. What options do you have I guess on top of that more importantly, if PAMA is implemented as written, what impact you think that'll have on commercial rates going forward?","Steve Rusckowski","Sure. I'll take this. The first part of that question I'll give to Mark for the second part. So, we're actively working this and we've been working on it for years as we talked about. We've people engaged with the CMS on the implementation PAMA in the quarter and the principles of that we don't disagree which is market-based pricing for the refresh of the fee schedule.","But while we've been helping them was but unfortunately, we think with what we've the draft rates they got wrong. We've been helping with the implementation of gathering the data to make sure the data is correct and then working through the competition of the data to establish new rates.","So, we've hard at work with them three years, but I'll share with you since we got the draft rates we have provided them feedback on where we see -- where we have questions or where we see some issues with what we see so far with the draft rates and so they listen to that and that's the first part of how we're engaging in this.","Second is before we saw the draft rates and now since we see the draft rates for all over our congressional leaders to make sure they understand the difference of what CMS has proposed from those rates versus what the intention was with PAMA and we feel good about the receptivity of that and also, we've been engaged with the administration on that as well. So, hitting all branches of government and that we're very active.","We'll cement our formal covenants of the trade association and I'll say trade association all partners and all members of the trade association were actively engaged in that and that will go in before the deadline, which is October 23. I'll also tell you that other trade associations are deeply engaged in this.","The device trade association appalment is deeply engaged in this. The smaller laboratories are engaged, the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, I said that in my comments are deeply engaged and so we have a lot of support broadly, and then also employees are deeply engaged.","We have grassroots, mailings going into congressmen and women and centers throughout all the different states telling and urging CMS that they need to take the time to get it right. So that's happening. We'll see what CMS does with this feedback. The schedule says the world then people comments into consideration and to give us the final rates in November, we'll see.","They could decide to take the time to get it right and to like the implementation. We're not sure whether they will or will not do that. If they go forward with the rates, we'll see what that means and what the comments to take into consideration and then we would need to consider legislative action depending upon what we see there with the help of the Congress members that we have been speaking to.","And then also what we're looking at two of the trade association is what legal alternatives we might have in the event that they go forward with final rates that clearly do not represent the congressional intent of PAMA. So that's what we mean by exploring all options and as you could tell from my commentary we're all over this and I'm not along to get a lot of help from my colleagues in the trade association.","So, I feel very good about the effort we're putting into this and CMS is hearing loud and clear that we believe that long and they need to take the time to get it right. So, Mark, do you want to talk about commercial rates?","Mark Guinan","So, Kevin, so couple things. First off as we shared previously, we had very little of our commercial contracts revenue tied to floating rates. We've been cleaning that over the last couple years in anticipation for some reductions in MAA. So, it's a very small portion and we very soon not have any contracts that are in any way floating an index MAA.","In terms of predicting the future, it's always hard to predict the future, but I can assure you that in the conversations with the large payers recently, they understand the significant impact of those trends in industry and certainly to us and they actually have entity for that, so versus it being an opportunity to take advantage of that and the messaging being we want to keep this ratio to Medicare.","Of course, the conversation as you understand the intent of this is to incorporate commercial rates and Medicare rates. So that is an impossibility. So, at the end of the day, you're going to be basically in the same curve as the Medicare rates and given the significant impact and the fact that largely they agree with our premise that we are part of the solution on laboratory spending and pay significantly more to other providers of laboratory diagnostic and patient services.","And also, were a part of the solution in terms of overall healthcare spend given the amount of influence that we have our data. Many people say one to two thirds of the other spend that we're actually all of our good guys and a good partner. So, they understand that and they you look for us to be successful and so the tenor of the discussions around price, I can assure you has not gotten worse given PAMA and certainly become neutral or got better in most cases.","So, should not expect any significant commercial price erosion going forward and just to remind people, we shared before, all our labs are typically paid one and half to two times but we're paying and then hospital laboratories are often 2.5 times or more the same rate.","So, I would expect some evolution in that over time as opposed to looking for credit concessions from the independent national labs.","Kevin Ellich","Great. And then just really quickly, Steve any thoughts on the utilization environment and organic volume trends?","Steve Rusckowski","Sure. Look what we've said in the past we'll say this quarter again, we feel stable. We look at all the different indications in the marketplace and overall if you look at the amount of healthcare people are using in this country and what we see from our established accounts, we feel stable.","We feel good about our organic revenue growth in the quarter. We do look at to the effect that the larger storms over the third quarter had on us and we adjust for that. We actually feel very good about the progress we're making accelerating growth. So, we're making progress in a stable marketplace to accelerate growth.","Kevin Ellich","Great. Thanks guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Jack.","Jack Meehan","Mark, I wanted to drill little bit more into your commentary on the commercial pricing environment. Obviously, there's a negotiation of national payer contracts underway. Could you just give an update on your philosophy and those negotiations on price versus value proposition, versus network access and to your comments, you just gave as a low-cost provider, do you think you could actually push on commercial prices and offset if PAMA hold?","Steve Rusckowski","Well, yes Jack of course that's our strategy is to push to two-way negotiation. So, at this point, I am not going to speculate our -- I promise where that could end up, but yeah, that is the position that we're taking and you already have excellent rates and there are other people whose services arguably are little better in some cases are as good as we're providing given the fact that for example we provide all of our data to the payers and quite often they don't get the data from other people to provide laboratory services within their network. So that's one argument actually to get a better product.","And then some of the things that Steve walked through in terms of the consumer experience that resonates because they're understanding that the outside customer which are your members and when they compete with other health plans there is certainly some value beyond the result of laboratory tests and the services that they provide and it can positively differentiate them if they bring some partner and work with us and see some of the value that we bring and the other providers don't.","So that's part of our value proposition that we're discussing with them and I can assure you that over the last couple years we have gotten rate increases with some contracts given our value proposition explanation and that comes part and parcel with what I would call it try spirit of partnership whereas I said earlier, they see what part of the solution.","So, the more they can field work to us, the better from some of those higher cost providers who arguably don't have good value given the service they provide, the better they're going to be and the more they're going to solve their laboratory spend.","And as I said earlier appropriately drive the use of that data for other healthcare cost. So, I feel really good about the relationships that we've been building and any time of course there is everybody wants to maximize value in their side of the equation.","But I think as I said earlier, the tenure of the discussions and the lot more in the spirit of partnerships with the health plan and there are more of more seeing us as part of the solution and that's what's going to help us to defend the value of the price that we offer today and into the future.","Jack Meehan","Great. And then if PAMA holds, would you push harder on cost savings in 2018? At that point I would be curious you had any updates on regional consolidation of the footprint and then just auto adjudication rollout to payers?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah. So, we continue to drive on an invigorate despite PAMA and what we've shared and this has been our philosophy for filing out years that we need to continue to get better in what we do and better probably the both in quality and the service as well as efficiency.","And as you see in our results we continue to get more efficient and we feel about tracking to that $1.3 billion goal. And if you recall in 2016 Investor Day, we said we're not done yet. So, we got a lot more in front of us. We provided some visibility in color to that in 2016.","So, we see more beyond the $1.3 billion and so we were anticipating that there might be some more price pressure going into '18 and '19. So, what you see implied in our guidance is the continuation of invigorate test what we'll do this year and into 2018 along with just driving productivity in general.","And when you go through the math based upon what we have said, obviously we feel strong. We've had the convenience of the outlook that we provided in our Investor Day in 2016 because we've been working so hard for years. It's not a new program we're going to the continuation of the existing program and we have more efficiency to get out of this organization.","Jack Meehan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James and Associates. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Nick.","Nicholas Jansen","Hey guys. Good morning. Just two questions for me. First just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into margin trends and expectations as we think about PAMA being rolled out over the next two years. Certainly, you're showcasing very nice progress in 2017 on margins, I think up 50 basis points in the most recent quarter ex hurricane.","So just wanted to get your sense is 2017 peak margin year and how we think about if you analyze the next three years, how much does margin degrade associated with PAMA, thanks?","Mark Guinan","Yeah Nick, so thanks for the question. The outlook that we gave is a CAGR. So that will be put as a CAGR. So, it's not year-to-year, we're not until we see some variability especially depending the way some of the PAMA cuts get rolled out.","But with that said what we've committed to is growing earnings faster than revenues. So, by definition that we says that we expect to expand margins. So, then it may not be every quarter, it may not be every single year in the period year-over-year, but over the next several years we're looking for continued margin expansion because we're committed to growing our earnings faster now.","Nicholas Jansen","And just a clarification on that regarding the structure of PAMA, does that mean -- my understanding is that 2019 would be a worse year than 2018 as we think about the size of the headwind. Is that the right understanding?","Steve Rusckowski","The honest answer this point is I don't know because there are still so many things up in the air regarding how they're going to imply some of their rules and in pricing practices and without getting into too much detail because it's very complicated.","But just in summary a lot of the billings to Medicare are panels and the way Medicare pays panel is very, very complicated and the more analyzing the panels, the more it impacts the overall price and it's not the positive fashion.","So, they already have historically deviated from what people who are close to the industry might not understand which is you don't get in a way for every single analyze unless you start putting things together in a panel.","So, the question we have is how our panels get paid and how we price which is the course to market because in many cases there is not a comparable code within the commercial world with a very, very complicated issue that we're trying to sort through and that's why even if at this point we were in a position to know and really interested in sharing the estimate by year, I don't have that answer.","So still more to come. So, I would say at this point, do not assume that '19 is worse than '18 and vice versa. We will tell you as soon as we have people understanding to provide you some reliable information.","Nicholas Jansen","That's very helpful and then just one quick -- just a numbers question. I understand the tax dynamics the stock-based compensation benefit you're seeing this year. Any way you can just share what we should be plugging in for '18? Is it kind of the 35 to 37 range, just wanted to get a sense of how we should be modeling tax specifically in '18, thanks.","Mark Guinan","Yeah so, I am sure you understand that, what drives that is a couple of factors. As long as the share price is higher than it was at the time of the brand of the equity and that you're going to seek in some value.","So certainly, when you see a year like 2017 where we had significant stock appreciation that was versus previous years that was driving a lot of this benefit. The other thing is option exercises, which of course we can't predict.","So, we're investing performance shares investing that will drive some level of benefit consistently assuming that the stock price continues to appreciate to some degree, but we can't predict the timing of the option exercises, which is a huge variable.","So, what I will say is the sixth sense that we shared when we say the base level assuming that the stock is stable and continues to go up to some degree that is pretty reliable but that's kind of be there, but the large swing is beyond that will be highly dependent on appreciation of the stock movement and the amount of option exercises and that's what we can't predict.","So, I would say sixth sense and we'll continue to update if that change is kind of a base level you should consistently expect and anything beyond that is dependent on those other factors.","Nicholas Jansen","Thanks for all the detail guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","Good morning, everybody.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Bill. Good morning.","Bill Quirk","So, you addressed the commercial rate in Medicare relationship with respect to Kevin's question. I was hoping you could comment on the percent of Medicaid business that's tied into Medicare rates and how you're thinking that -- thinking about that rather over the next couple of years assuming that PAMA goes into effect?","Steve Rusckowski","So, the best of our understanding, Medicaid rates are not largely tied in terms of being an index in terms of a mechanistic fashion. Certainly, they look at Medicare rates to make sense and the states set those rates.","But it doesn\u2019t look like there is a formulaic relationship in most cases again to the best of our understanding and we've looked at this pretty deeply and will automatically trigger changes in Medicaid. So that's going to be pretty much up to the states.","And again, reminding you only about 2% or 3% of our revenues are paid by traditional Medicaid fee for service. A lot of the Medicaid are removed to management and the one thing that it won't say is that there are rules around the fact that Medicaid cannot pay more than Medicare.","So, in any case where there is a state Medicaid rate where the fee for service is close to Medicaid and there is a Medicare reduction, you will see a reduction to ensure that Medicaid is not higher than Medicare. But beyond that at this point still more to learn, but I would not expect this will trigger significant reductions in state Medicaid rate and again given the small portion of our revenue that comes from 3% Medicaid, I wouldn't expect it to be a major headwind for us.","Bill Quirk","Okay. No, I appreciate the color around that, thank you. And then just separately can you guys comment on I guess the consumer outreach programs that you have with Safeway and Walmart and help us think a little bit about the relative profitability of those as compared to say your traditional draw station and traditional diagnostics business, thanks?","Steve Rusckowski","Yeah Bill thanks. It's our consumer strategy and I outlined the five elements of our growth strategy one of which is to be most consumer oriented laboratory and there are multiple facets as far as that is concerned. One is we're putting a lot of work and e-enabling our whole consumer process and we're talking about e-check-in.","So, moving really our experience that we have our consumers to contemporary experiences that people experience in the consumer world. Making a lot of progress there. The feedback is great. It helps patients. It helps our employees and as I mentioned, our healthcare insurance partners feel great about their experience as well because they're working on that.","The second is around information. We got MyQuest, we have 4.5 million users, which is a phenomenal number given that we only brought this to the marketplace in a little over two years. So, it's just picking up the volume of users that we have and we put more and more content around that and also want people to navigate into our whole experience through MyQuest, which is a nice consumer touch if you will.","The third is around products. We see a lot more from us and we have direct to consumer testing. We mentioned we tested this in our marketplace last year. We're bringing this into Missouri and Colorado. We're actually are encouraged by some of the early returns that consumers are interested in paying out of pocket from their own ordered diagnostic test.","It could be cholesterol, it could be hemoglobin, glucose or such are transmitted, but there is a market there and so we're going at that market. And the last place we're investing in which is what you -- and that is a bit part of your questions is what we're doing around access and I'll say access because it's important that we have access for our draw stations.","And so, we're looking at how we can augment and in some place, replace our patient service centers with some of these locations at Safeway. We\u2019re making excellent progress of implementing patient service centers in those Safeway stores and also relationship with Walmart. And so, we will open some centers in Walmart in Florida and Texas this year.","And so, what they have allowed to do is by zip code is look at where we have access points and in some cases, we can consolidate what we have in those stores. And that allows us to get more efficiency in some cases around the real estate cost but also around phlebotomist productivity.","The biggest cost of drawing is not real estate it\u2019s the labor, it\u2019s a phlebotomist. So, if we can have more density of phlebotomists in better locations and convenient locations that serve the consumer better, better off we\u2019re go to be.","Remember a lot of our patient service centers even though we have unparalleled access the 2,200 patient service centers and we have over 3500 phlebotomists in physician\u2019s offices so close to 6,000 access points.","Our medical office buildings and these are not nearly as convenient locations is where you'll find a Safeway store and where if you find a Walmart with big wide-open parking lots, easy access to the store and ability to do some shopping and other activities around that experience.","So, we\u2019re quite encouraged. We think we\u2019re on the track again as we talked earlier, our value proposition to the healthcare value proposition is we want to be the most consumer-oriented laboratory. And we think our value proposition is getting stronger and stronger every day because we\u2019re focused on this. So, we're making a lot of good progress. Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Jacoby","Thanks. Good morning.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ralph.","Ralph Jacoby","Hi, just wanted to understand and clarify the jumping off point for 2017, the midpoint of guide I guess is $5.65, we\u2019ve got the $0.10 from the hurricane, so it\u2019s $5.75. We take out the $0.20 for the tax benefit we're at $5.55 and then ex panel we essentially grow that mid to high single digits, is that -- just want to make sure if that\u2019s right?","Mark Guinan","Yeah, so the jumping off point shouldn\u2019t be adjusted for the hurricane, but you may argue that the year-over-year growth compare is easier given the fact that we had hurricanes in 2017.","So, the jumping off point you're right takes the midpoint of our guidance and take out the $0.20 and that's out of the way we are thinking our starting point given that at this point we would project only $0.06 of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.","And that\u2019s how we would build our initial plan for 2018 and certainly taking into account that the hurricane impact this year, that can give us an easier compare to next year.","Ralph Jacoby","Okay. That\u2019s fair and then the -- that\u2019s in the same context as the $6 to $7 number by 2020 right. So that's off that baseline that\u2019s how we should be thinking about $6 to $7 for 2020?","Steve Rusckowski","Exactly. Not off the guidance that\u2019s includes the $0.20 excess with stock-based comp around.","Ralph Jacoby","Okay. All right that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess any help you can give on sort of based on your current mix. Can you give us the impact of the PAMA cuts for 2018, 2019 and 2020?","Steve Rusckowski","No as I said earlier \u2013 maybe wasn\u2019t as clear as I intended to be given that there are so many things that have to be sorted out. So many unanswered questions we're still trying to figure out obviously looked at it deeply and we have a huge range of potential outcomes depending on the answers to some of those questions.","So, it would not be helpful at this point to share that information as I said in a minute we expect to get more clarity in the not too distant future as soon as we're in a position to share something we\u2019ll certainly do so.","Ralph Jacoby","Okay. And then just\u2026","Mark Guinan","With that said we obviously have reconfirmed our views on outlook and the view outlook took into consideration what we saw in the draft rates. And so, our feedback to CMS is that there is a lot of areas that we think they got wrong and therefore we think the rates are too low.","So, we think as we contemplate what we just shared with you this morning we are confident we feel with those outlook despite what might happen or not happen given our dialogue with CMS.","Ralph Jacoby","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just last one, can you give us a sense of multiples you\u2019re paying for deals and maybe how you approach a purchase price just given what likely maybe a lower future earnings stream from whatever you\u2019re acquiring given PAMA? Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Sure. We've shared that we have very robust specific metrics around evaluating our deals that involves a return to invested capital metric where it would be accretive by the third year relative to our plan of record and we have a plan of record based on our performance shares.","So, every year we put forward our forecast for our return on invested capital for the base business and half of our performance shares our based on that. So, we need to do deal that are accretive to do that by the third year. And we have also have an MPV metric and obviously the MPV level that needs to be exceeded before you will consummate a deal.","So, the multiple question is a tough one because their P&L generally has no relationship to our P&L as I shared at the Investor Day. I went through actually Strawman example and in most cases, it\u2019s not all of their revenues are higher than ours.","When the business becomes part question, we get paid at the rates at which we negotiated, but the cost structure is so dramatically different than despite that revenue and synergies, we still significantly make more margin typically then the individual.","So, taking a multiple of their P&L really does not make any sense as we shared the revenue multiple look like -- they look a great deal based on when it was in their hands and the earnings multiples, or EBITDA multiples look like we way overpaid it, but it's really not meaningful.","If you look at our pro forma, you would see multiples that are the opposite, which says based on the earnings it was good and based on the revenue maybe you paid a little bit too much, but we cannot pay significantly more than our current enterprise multiple because by definition the math doesn\u2019t work and then we\u2019re not able to hit that rolling target.","So, when we actually use return on invested capital, not our cost of capital, which some other companies use to evaluate deals so in fact we have a risk premium built into our MPV and built into our return expectations that we think make sense that's good for our shareholders.","Ralph Jacoby","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Amanda.","Amanda Murphy","Hey. How are you good morning?","Steve Rusckowski","Good.","Amanda Murphy","Just a quick question on the long-term outlook and obviously there has been discussion around contract renewals repair perspective and I think you gave some perspective there just in terms of pricing over the long-term but I just wanted to clarify in terms of the long-term outlook how you're thinking about some of the major contract changes are you including any assumptions there.","And then also just thinking about capital deployment in terms of share buybacks can just help us think about how you're thinking about that over the long-term specially given PAMA? Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so let me start the contracting. We obviously want to have the best access as possible and I said in my earlier comments that we should really good about our growing access and it\u2019s helping us accelerate in growth and that continues to be our strategy going forward as you are aware one of the nationals that we don't have our preferred relationship is united what we shared in the past we know that contract expires in 2018 with our nearest competitor.","And as we said we would like to be on contract with United and our relationship continues to be strong in building so we did contemplate in our outlook is growing capability for us to have many of your insurances also on network then what we currently enjoy. And so that is contemplated in outlook and Mark second part of the question.","Mark Guinan","So, Amanda we\u2019re going to stick with our capital deployment strategy in terms of earnings growth being low to actually mid to high single-digit that is earnings that\u2019s not earnings per share so does contemplate significant buybacks two step earnings-per-share as well as earnings from cash","And so, we will continue our strategy which says in the near-term accretive opportunities that used of that cash to do M&A that will be a priority once we satisfy that majority of free cash flow back to our shareholders as we\u2019ve talked about before the dividend gets a long way towards that objective and use of supplemental share buybacks to get at least to 50%.","Our free cash flow again with the other 50% of our free cash flow will be opportunity dependent if we have M&A that will be the preference and if we don't have M&A then that is a better use of cash and we will buy back more shares.","But at this point the outlook does not include a reduction in our way so to get to higher levels of earnings. The growth rate that I share at the CAGR is real earnings.","Amanda Murphy","Got it. And then just one quick follow-up, I think Jack has done some good work in terms of looking at the regional dynamics of PAMA in the first year just given that we're going to switch from a regional to more of a national schedule.","So, I don't know if you've been able to look at that yet and if there is any mitigation there for you guys and based on your mix I know early in terms of the data but just looking for some insights into maybe what the first share might look like relative to the reported rate for you?","Steve Rusckowski","You're correct. That is a mitigation and any sort of price declines from the NOA because there are some reasons that we're already paying less than NOA. So, by definition there's less of a decrease at least in the first year depending on what the overall cuts might be over a multiyear period. ","And actually, on that note that is the issue with the panel. So, in the case of any of the panels, if you added up the individual components in there NOA, we've not been getting paid that total amount. So that would also be a mitigation assuming that they don't change into some sort of other methodology.","So that's what makes it a little bit complicated, but I did want to acknowledge that if you just look at the fee schedule and tried to say okay if the Medicare revenues are X and it looks like and this isn\u2019t the case. Every code was reduced by 10% if I can do the math.","Now it's a lot more complicated than that because in most cases, we're not getting paid NOA for the work that we do for Medicare.","Amanda Murphy","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Hynes","Good morning. So, I don't want to beat the dead horse. So, I am just going to go back to that $6 to $7 answer to 2020. So, I just want to clarify what's included and what's not. So, it includes the proposed rates for PAMA as stated in the rule and it includes only 1% to 2% M&A annually.","It includes an increase in your cost entry program, and if it does can you tell us exactly how much just for modeling purposes? It includes some share revolve but not a lot and then whether UNH contract if you're not let in it, I mean I'm assuming that if it's in you have some type of visibility and if it's not, can you let us know the downside risk, thanks?","Mark Guinan","So, let me clarify so on the efficiency program, I wouldn't model in a significant change from what we've been doing. I think Steve said that there is more to be done and then certainly we'll continue to deliver significant efficiencies, so that's part and parcel with the outlook that we gave.","Now with that said of course depending on the PAMA outcome, the timing of it and how severe it is, we're going to do what we need to do. So, we're going to get to that outlook. We have enough levers to pull that we're very comfortable and we're not reaffirming the outlook if weren\u2019t confident that we have the ability to do that despite where PAMA might come out.","And certainly, in this case, where we have the plan and it contemplates the worst-case scenario which is what they proposed. And then in terms about the share buybacks. So, there will be some share buybacks, but I think a lot of that is really just to prevent dilution given our equity program.","So, I wouldn't assume that any reduction in ways. So that is not in my outlook for this point. As I said again that growth is in earnings. And therefore, at this point given all other factors you should assume that earnings per share for both earnings and then depending on that's where to create value that could vary because we get more M&A and because we do more share buybacks.","And yes, the 1% to 2% is what we're counting on, but while we're signaling back to it's original question is we think although we've been doing consolidation, this could be a trigger for acceleration in the consolidation.","So, we are just knowing that there could be an opportunity for an acceleration and for more M&A but I'm not modeling that in the outlook at this point.","Ann Hynes","Okay. And then the UNH question, so I'm assuming if you include in the guidance you have some type of visibility, and if you don't, can you just maybe give us some visibility what the downside will be?","Steve Rusckowski","Ann, my commentary was that we're working on it, but it's the current status quo is whether it stayed that way or not. We still feel confident with our outlook.","Okay. So that's the way you should think about it is your current access is getting stronger. We are working to get it even stronger but our outlook contemplates staying where we are as well.","Ann Hynes","Okay. And then with PAMA in Washington, I appreciate all the efforts that you guys have done that you talking to Congressional people. You're commenting to CMS, but I feel like all of that was done beforehand. What do you think can change?","Do you think CMS just wanted the common period? Do they need that to make a change? So, I am just trying to figure out like what would change in two months?","Steve Rusckowski","The big change let me give you a little color around this. So, when we went off around and talked to our members of Congress and Southerners and the administration, we explained our concern but it was a concern without a lot of facts and a lot of our stakeholders said well, I understand, but let's see what the data says.","And so many of them were waiting for these draft rates. And so, the good news is the draft rates are out and the draft rates are severely flawed with the amount of data that was collected a very small percentage that is 1% with a lot of the data coming from ourselves, so the majority of the rates are based upon the large nationals and that was not the congressional intent.","So, the data being out there and is helping us now get more momentum with our stakeholders to say well okay what these guys have been talking about before we have addressed, they were right, they really got along and their message around taking time to get it right we now understand. Now the question is what do we do about that.","So strange way the draft rates have been helpful to move the dialogue along.","Mark Guinan","And one example, Ann, is the OIG in some of the reports over a month ago have said based on the definition of the applicable lab they were expecting about 5% of the labs, but close to 70% of the volume to be reflected.","As you heard us say today only 1% of the labs actually ended up submitting for various reasons. So back to Steve's point around okay, I get your concerns, but we'll see where it comes out, certainly those kind of facts are weighing in the conversations we're having right now.","Steve Rusckowski","And the vast majority of the data they're looking after these drafts from the large laboratories and we know from Medicare data that roughly 50% of what they buy is laboratory services from hospital at which laboratories as well as physician office labs. And from the two large nationals, it's only 20% of their purchases roughly.","So, the sampling is flawed and they need to take the time to get it right and the whole philosophy of PAMA is to make sure that they look at this different cost of served issue in this industry to make sure they're paying market based rates and those market base rates are not the rates of large nationals that generally have the density of large centers.","Ann Hynes","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you, Ann.","Operator","Our last question is from Lisa Gill with JPMC. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much for taking my question. I just had a question, Steve, you talked a little bit about United and potentially opening that out from the preferred relationship they have today. Would you anticipate that the same would happen with your Aetna relationship that time?","Do you think that as you think about the world if you know that may believe preferred relationships don't work quite the way that they were intended back when they were assigned in the mid-2000s? Just how do we think about that dynamic one?","And then two, if United has opened up, my assumption would be that you're probably getting some rates today that were non-network rates and so they would potentially be higher. Are you thinking that the volumes help to offset that when you're thinking about this, the equation of getting to that $6 to $7 in 2020?","Steve Rusckowski","Well first of all, in Aetna our relationship continues to be strong. Yes, we have preferred national relationship and we haven\u2019t commented where we'll continue or not, but we do have one extended contract, which we feel good about and we've secured.","And second, as far as our philosophy with all of your insurance companies, we do believe that it is good to have a smaller network and frankly given our value proposition, we actually like those contracts where we are on contract with other nationals, where we have the opportunity to compete for the business because when we do compete for the business, we do quite well.","So philosophically and strategically that's the position we've taken and as you see three out of the five nationals do have both their competitor on par and we feel good about those relationships as there is a different approach.","We feel great about that relationship and we're working with United. All of those supplies have different relationships and I'll remind you we spend a lot of time talking multinationals but a large part of our business is not with the nationals.","We have a lot of regionals. We have hundreds of contracts and those contracts continue to provide great access for us as well. So, Lisa just to clear, yes, our network rates are higher and in some cases significantly higher than the network rates, but there is also some supplies that don't have that network benefit, typically they're falling short.","So, we don't get paid quite the premium being out of network that some people might think because there's some work we receive that we do basically for free because we don't get paid for those full insurance. So, if we get any network in a plan where we're on a network, there is countervailing forces.","One is the network rate obviously typically is lower than the other network rates but then for the supplies that didn't have that benefits we actually get paid. So, there will be certainly some pricing headwind offset by what we will consider to be significant volume increase for any time we get into a network where we were previously out of network, but it's not as large a price headwind that some people might come to surface.","Lisa Gill","Okay. And then Mark, if I could just ask one question, I know everything said about the future is not about the quarter, but I just want to understand two things, one would be around the pricing environment obviously pricing coming in a little stronger.","Is that just a mix element or is there something else going on there would be first and then just second on the nonclinical down 4%, we expect it will be down around 2%. Is there anything else there that's worth calling out from a quarter perspective?","Mark Guinan","Sure. So, as I shared in the prepared remarks, pricing continues to be less and on a apples-and-apples price and then we've also shared in the past that there was any mix element that suppresses revenue correct from our PLS business.","So really when you look at the revenue per rep, it's the positive mix that we've experienced pretty consistently for several quarters, which is around the tax mix and then also then to the acquisitions where we tend to consistently have been growing our test per rep ratio.","So those are the drivers. The other mix elements have been favorable more of our advanced diagnostic testing and then more test per acquisition have all set the negative mix impact of PLS on revenue per rep.","When you look at the diagnostic services business, it's largely our risk assessment businesses. There is a couple of other things in there, but that's a big driver. That is the work we do for individuals who are looking to secure life insurance policies and in front of that is how independent on the industry itself and the number of policies that are being written and recently that's a little softer.","So, it has nothing to do with the competitive environment per se losing the competition really have to do with the market and the market has slowed in full recently.","Lisa Gill","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Okay. So, thanks again for joining us today. As we've said, we had another strong quarter in the third quarter 2017.

A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. ","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I\u2019ll provide you with highlights of the quarter. We\u2019ll share industry trends and also review progress we are making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.","Before we get into our performance, I want to highlight the joint venture we announced last month with Quintiles in clinical trials testing. Together our two companies will create the new business that will be one of the leading global providers of central laboratory services to support drug developments through clinical trials. ","The creation of a joint venture allows Quest and Quintiles to bring together the complementary capabilities in scale of our two organizations in an agile way with a laser like focus on serving customers. ","The new company will enable biopharmaceutical customers to enhance their drug development process, support precision medicine through companion diagnostics and biomarket discovery and build value by creating more efficient, effective organizations through leveraging the scale, scientific expertise and operational excellence of the parent organizations. We expect that over time that JV will have an accelerated growth rate, achieve cost synergies and to be accretive to what our clinical trials testing business would have been on a standalone basis. ","The JV structure addresses three of our five strategic points. First, it will help us accelerate growth in the near term for our clinical trials business and explore opportunities related to our longer term strategies on precision medicine, companion diagnostics and creating value from our data. ","Second, it enables us to refocus on our core Diagnostic Information Services business without distraction. And third, with minimal capital that enables us to participate in expected synergies in a way that lets us deliver disciplined capital deployment. Mark will provide some more color later on this exciting partnership. For now, both entities will continue to operator separately until the closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to be no later than the third quarter of 2015. ","Turning to our first quarter results, we continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue, EPS and operating income growth. Revenues grew 5.3%, $1.84 billion. On an organic basis consolidated revenues grew almost 1%. ","Adjusted cash EPS increased 13% to $1.05 and adjusted operating income increased 14%. Our performance reflects improved execution and a stable business environment and we are able to grow despite a harsh winter that while is somewhat less severe than a year ago was particularly difficult in the Northeast portion of the United States where we have a strong presence. ","Before I get into our strategy update I\u2019d like to talk about industry dynamics for utilization, reimbursement and regulation. Through the first quarter we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis. We are encouraged by the process of adding more insured lives to the healthcare system as a result of the Affordable Care Act. More states have been expanding their Medicaid programs, including Pennsylvania during the quarter, and we continue to see growth in our Medicaid volumes. ","Medicaid expansion will bring new people into the healthcare system with the goal of identifying issues earlier to improve outcomes and reduce overall costs. We actually saw this ourselves on a recent Quest Diagnostic Health Trend study. This peer review publication in diabetes care, found a significant double digit increase in diabetes diagnosis in states that expanded Medicaid coverage, and no increase in states that did not. ","On reimbursement we see less government pressure on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule in 2015, than we have seen in the previous two years. I\u2019ll start with the Doc-Fix. Last week the President signed historic legislation titled the Medicare Access and CHIP Re-authorization Act to primarily reform the Medicare Physician Payment Methodology. We are pleased that cuts to laboratory payments under Medicare were not included as part of the package. This legislation also encourages payments based upon quality and encourages us to make the healthcare systems smarter without dining access. ","This legislation is also directionally aligned with the HHS goals announced at January to tie traditional Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models. Both the legislation and HHS have outlined specific measurable goals and timelines for these value based reimbursement models. We believe these emerging payment models will favor providers with scale that are more effective and efficient like us. ","Next, I\u2019d like to provide a status update on the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule.","Our industry continues to work constructively with CMS on effectively implementing PAMA legislation. Just a few weeks ago I met with leaders at CMS and a delegation from our industry trade association to discuss the rule making progress that will govern any reimbursement changes. During that meeting we reviewed our view of the industry and its participants. We also discussed our shared goal of delivering an accurate, complete and efficient data collection process. ","We remain hopeful the rule making progress will be defined in 2015. It will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. As this industry continues to evolve and mature, we have the right strategy and team and are well positioned to continue to lead. ","We continue to execute the company\u2019s 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core Diagnostic Information Services business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. ","Now what I\u2019d like to do is to share a few comments on each of the elements of the strategy. Well, this was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to focus on our core growth opportunities. First, we continued to focus on sales effectiveness. Second, we are getting traction on the Professional Laboratory Services agreements we signed last year; and third, gene based esoteric testing revenues grew in the quarter at a faster rate in more than a year. ","We continue to grow BRCA revenues which clearly benefited from Angelina Jolie\u2018s ongoing public advocacy. One way we differentiate ourselves is by advocating for open access for BRCA data for patients and clinicians. ","In collaboration with our French research consortium Inserm, we led the creation of BRCA share and open data share initiative. Its goal is to accelerate research on BRCA and gene rotations, particularly a variance of uncertain significance to improve the ability to predict which individuals are at risk of developing inherited breast, ovarian and other cancers. The Inserm collaboration is an example of how we are using our unmatched data and information assets to deliver insights to our customers that demonstrate the value that Quest provides. ","Last quarter we told you about some new population health, data analytics decision support tools we are developing. We have been piloting our population health tools with several physician, ACOs and health plans to evaluate disease states for their patient populations, monitor compliance with specific testing protocols and identify gaps in care. In this pilot our customers our now engaging with patients and healthcare professionals proactively, encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring test to drive better health. ","In addition to population and health tools we are making progress to delivering on what we call interactive insights to providers and patients. Our interactive insight offer providers trendy data interactive features such as customizable reports and additional content such as videos and articles specific to conditions and disease. ","IntelliTest Analytics is a web based secure portal that provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks and physicians practices with data driven insights about test utilization patterns, so they can adhere to clinically appropriately testing norms. ","Care360 revenue cycle management helps customers manage denials of billing claims with a focus on improving patient and payer collections. In November 2012 we established a new vision that spoke to the impact we have on peoples\u2019 lives. Our vision is empowering better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision was in a central part of becoming more external and customer focused. Since then we\u2019ve made tremendous progress bringing the vision to life. Well, we are not just a lab; we are more than a lab. We are a trusted partner and we provide deep clinical insights. ","Our vision was the first step. Next we needed to turn it into a compelling customer facing brand, a simple consistent way to talk about Quest, who we are, the value we bring; in short, what is the Quest difference. ","Our new core brand idea is a powerful one. It is action from insight. Our brand strategy is based on three pillars; the idea that we inspire action from the work we do, that we have limited answers or patients and healthcare providers and that we advocate better health for patients and communities. This is a powerful idea, that notion that from data comes insight, from insight comes action, the action that transforms lives. ","Well, as you can tell I\u2019m excited about what our new corporate position, it means for Quest. It translates our vision into a concise, clear and actual brand that gives us an opportunity to reshape our place in the industry, allowing us to continue to differentiate ourselves and not compete solely on price. ","Brand is more than a logo, and we\u2019re tag lined. To bring our band to life, we have to change the way we think and talk of what we do. Additionally, we are engaging all of our 45,000 people with the direct impact on delivering this brand promise. You will start to see the new brand in action in the coming weeks and months. ","Next is our strategy for driving operational excellence. We are well underway with planning the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past we continue to update you on the progress as we go. The third element of our strategy is to simplify against and strength our organization. We\u2019ve been focusing on execution and building a performance oriented culture. We are very pleased to be included recently as one of the Fortune Magazine\u2019s Worlds Most Admired Companies. ","Over the past year we have introduced a number of new management tools as part of the Quest management system. We are rolling out a new leadership development initiative this month and as I visited more than a dozen of our major facilities in conjunction with our new brand rollout, I found employees at all levels to be highly engaged and excited about the challenges ahead. ","The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core Diagnostic Information Services business. We continue to make good progress and the joint venture with Quintiles is the most recently example of doing this. After considering a broad range of options for our clinical trials business, we found the joint venture was the best option to enable us to focus on the core while unlocking the value of this important business. We\u2019ll continue to review our portfolio and look at options for non-core assets and we always strive to build value for our shareholders. ","And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest rates for the year to come. We paid our dividend at the increased rate and as noted earlier, we think the joint venture with Quintiles will enable us to share in our future value creation without requiring significant capital outlays. ","Now Mark will provide an overview on the first quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of 2015 outlook, which is based on our strength in the operational performance and in improving business environment. Mark. ","Mark Guinan","Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.84 billion increased by 5.3% versus the prior year and grew organically by 70 basis points. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short grew by 4.9% compared to the prior year. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.6% versus the prior year, while revenue per acquisition was lower than the prior year by 0.7%. For DIS, acquisitions contributed nearly 5% to revenues. Excluding acquisitions DIS revenues volumes and revenue per acquisition were all essentially flat for the quarter. ","I would like to share some addition context on these underline volumes and revenue per acquisition metrics. First let me touch on the impact on the harsh winter. As we have shared in the past, our analysis is based on changes in volume versus trend for given geographies related to specific weather events. Additionally we provide guidance based on historical weather patterns. For the past two years we\u2019ve experienced unusually severe winters, however in 2012 we had a mild weather, which resulted in upside to our expectations. ","This year volumes were negatively impacted in the quarter by a harsh winter throughout much of the country and in particular the northeast. While the impact was not as severe as a year ago, it was worse than we anticipated. We believe the impact of weather on the quarter was approximately $0.08 of EPS. As a result, we are pleased with the quarter and we were planning on better performance.","Turning to underlying revenue per acquisition, we saw modest reimbursement pressure in the quarter that was in line with our expectations. That reimbursement pressure was offset by favorable test and business mixtures. ","Moving to our diagnostic solutions business which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. We enjoyed strong growth during the quarter from our clinical trials products and risk assessment businesses. ","Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $269 million or 14.6% of revenues compared to $236 million or 13.5% of revenues a year ago. With comparable volumes essentially flat, the improvement can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our business mix, Invigorate program and M&A related impacts including synergies. These factors enabled us to improve gross margins and further leverage SG&A. As a result, our adjusted operating income and earnings grew faster than revenues. ","For the quarter adjusted EPS excluding amortization was $1.05, 13% better than a year ago. Amortization was $0.09 in both 2014 and 2015. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $80 million in the quarter, primarily associated with the debt refinance in the first quarter. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.54. Last year\u2019s first quarter included after tax charges of $18 million, primarily associated with restructuring and integration charges which reduced reported EPS by $0.13.","Let me share a few comments on special items. As you think about special items, because of their nature they do fluctuate from period to period. This quarter we incurred a charge related to the first tranche of debt retire. A second tranche of debt was redeemed in April which will result in a similar charge in the second quarter. We expect to incur a total pre-tax charges of nearly $115 million related to our debt refinancing. ","In addition to charges our special items also include benefits. For example, we anticipate recognizing a gain related to the joint venture with Quintiles at the time of closing. This gain will occur when we contribute our clinical trials business into the joint venture which is expected to take place no later than the third quarter. This gain is expected to be in the similar magnitude to the total charges associated with the debt retirement. We will adjust this one time gain out of our earnings.","To put this in perspective, since the beginning of 2012 the benefits adjusted out of earnings have been approximately the same amount as the charges adjusted out of earnings. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.3% flat to a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with coinsurance and deductable requirements. ","Our DSOs were 45 days, three days lower than last quarter and four days lower than a year ago. This is a testament to our operational excellence, continuously demonstrated by our billing operations and patient service centers teams that continue to be effectively engaged with patients and payers to ensure that we get paid for the work we do.","Reported cash provided by operations was $52 million in the quarter; however, excluding the $78 million of cash charges associated with the retirement of debt, cash provided by operations would have been $130 million in the quarter versus $84 million a year ago. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the quarter compared to $68 million a year ago.","Moving to guidance, we expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million.","We have not included in our guidance the impact of contributing our clinical trials business to the JV with Quintiles, largely because the impact will depend on the timing of the deals closing. To help frame it, our clinical trials testing revenue was in the range of approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues in 2014.","With respect to the impact of adjusted EPS, we believe the JV will be essentially neutral in 2015. We will provide more details when the deal closes later this year. And as we noted on the investor call to announce the transaction, once it closes we will no longer report the revenues in operating income from the clinical trials business in our income statement. We will however reflect our share of the joint ventures earnings on the equity earnings line on our income statement. This is where we report our current share of earning in our other three unconsolidated diagnostic information services joint ventures, which are with leading regional integrated delivery networks.","Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks Mark. Well, to summarize we delivered solid top and bottom line growth and improved profitability in the first quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of reported organic consolidated revenue growth. We continue to make good progress executing our strategy and we\u2019re excited to share more details on the joint venture with Quintiles when we close. Thanks for your support.","Now we\u2019d be to take any of your questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mr. Mike Cherny from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Mike Cherny","Hi, can you hear me?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, good morning. Yes, we\u2019re here.","Mike Cherny","I apologize for that. So a question about volume growth. It seems to be \u2013 you talked about an improvement from a market outlook perspective. Obviously weather across the board is pretty nasty this year. If I recall correctly, I think your still rolling off the comp related, some of the lower margin business that you guys decided to walk away from last year. Is there any way you could provide us with a number of terms of what you think that took away from organic volume growth, so we can try and get to a true number, particularly one that correlates with the positive market competitor you\u2019ve had.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, well first of all your right. We are rolling off some of these businesses. In the past we haven\u2019t given you specifics on that. Marks would you like to shed some light on sequentially our continued improvement?","Mark Guinan","So Mike, thanks for the question. We have referenced at one point 150 basis points of volume differential. Obviously we don\u2019t want to get into the habit of every single quarter reconciling that, but directionally it\u2019s the order of magnitude and what you might think of in terms of the impact on our volume. ","We did also reference that we would annualize that at some point in the second quarter, but also to be clear, we took those actions in the second quarter, so you shouldn\u2019t be expecting the year-over-year comp to be fully positive until the end of that quarter. ","So it\u2019s a similar level of volume as we also said, although we continue to regularly look over our portfolio and ensure that all the volume is value creating volume. That discreet set of actions we took during the second quarter of last year was kind of a one-time event and you shouldn\u2019t expect those kind of things to happen again at any sort of regularity.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so Mike, let me just add to Mark\u2019s comments. What we\u2019re doing is continuing to focus our energy on parts of the market that aren\u2019t growing and defocusing on those parts that aren\u2019t and that\u2019s related to our earlier remarks about what we are doing with our resources and accounts. ","But the things we wanted to see grow are growing in the quarter. We did mention that we saw the highest growth rate in our gene esoteric testing business this quarter, we are happy about that. We continue to see good growth in our wellness business, our prescription drug monitoring business, Hepatitis C. All the areas that we focused on for growth are progressing nicely and as you know, I mentioned in my commentary BRCA as well. ","So the focus is good. Sequentially we are seeing improvement and the momentum continues to build, so we feel good about that.","Mike Cherny","No. Thanks guys. That\u2019s really helpful in understanding the underlying dynamics. And then just quickly on BRCA specifically, I know you called out about esoteric, which is quite strong in the quarter and BRCA is a particular driver. Is it possible at this point given that it\u2019s been a number of quarters since you first launched that test, to give a sense of the sizing of that business roughly to at least the esoteric base and over the course of this year how important you think the growth specifically there could potentially be?","Steve Rusckowski","We\u2019re not going to spell out the business. I mean obviously as you look at it, its magnitude relative to the overall size of the class. We don\u2019t get into that detail and business of that size and certainly its growing. It\u2019s one of the areas we called out previously and it continues to be a growth area along with prescription drug monitoring and certainly HCB, our special laboratory services there. So BRCA continues to provide growth that we\u2019re not going to give any granularity at this point of sharing the actual revenues.","Mike Cherny","No, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d figure I\u2019d try anyway. Thanks guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Mr. Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. ","Steve Rusckowski","Hi Isaac","Isaac Ro","Very good morning guys, thank you. First question was just on the weather commentary you had. I was wondering if you could maybe try and ballpark the volume impact. I think I missed that, and then the second question had to do a little bit with the financial.","Steve Rusckowski","That\u2019s great. Mark you want to give some more color. We gave you an EPS impact of relationship to last year.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So from a volume perspective and revenue, it\u2019s probably in the area of around 150 basis points. So last year we talked about a 2% headwind due to weather. This year as I said, not quite as severe, but a fairly large differential from kind of what we would expect to be an average weather based on looking at historical patterns. ","Isaac Ro","Sure, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then just in terms of market share I simply sort of my square out your commentary on volume and some of the benefits your seeing from your growth initiatives. How do you feel about your market share and then just last one was on tax rate, obviously a bit low this quarter. You had some one-timers, but how should we think about tax rate for the rest of the year?","Steve Rusckowski","We continue to feel good about where we are focused in the market and where we are focusing we are picking up share, we feel good about that. As we mentioned in the past, we are deciding in some portion of our portfolio to not participate and so in those areas obviously we\u2019re losing some share. But overall we\u2019re trying to manage our business and the portfolio of resources we have to get the best of earnings growth. ","What you see in the quarter and we\u2019re happy to show is that we actually reported nice operating income growth and I think it\u2019s a good indication of our business mix and our focus on those areas of growth and how it\u2019s driving some portion of our margin expansion which we called out in the script. ","So you want to mention Mark what\u2019s going on with tax?","Mark Guinan","So obviously periodically you can get some discreet items in your tax line and you can always anticipate those. So we did have a couple of small items actually, they we\u2019re that large in Q1, but the direction we gave going to the year was that our tax rate will be higher than it was in 2014 and it would be more in line with historical levels and so I think that\u2019s what your expectation should be for the balance of the year. ","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thanks so much guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks Isaac.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question is from Mr. Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser","Hi, good morning. I have two questions here. So first of all, now that you\u2019ve refinanced the debt, any thoughts about buybacks and acquisitions for the remainder of the year. I think it wasn\u2019t included in the original guidance. Do you see it at this point representing upside to numbers?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So I\u2019d say obviously there was kind of cash required Ricky. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why your tying it to what are the implications for buybacks and I think at this point the guidance we gave is consistent, which is you shouldn\u2019t assume any significant reduction in shares outstanding based on repurchases we committed to targeting to insure there is no dilution from the share account, but not any significant buyback to reduce shares. ","Now with that said, we have a strategy of deploying some of our cash every year to target 1% to 2% of growth through M&A and we\u2019ve also said that if there was not some value creative M&A that we can identify that we will do more share repurchases. ","So I don\u2019t want to completely rule out share repurchases, but at this point as part of our strategy we\u2019re continuing to look and we\u2019d like to believe that we can add some businesses, tuck in, hold in type businesses we\u2019ve done in the past and that would probably be our priority for cash in the balance of the year. But should we find that there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s executable, certainly we would use that cash for more share repurchases.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And then one follow-up question on ACH, because obviously we are seeing this kind of like more and more lines joining the exchanges, but I think we are still not quite seeing that kind of like pull through on the volume side. Could you share with us your thoughts? What do you think is kind of like causing it? Is it that this population is consuming healthcare through kind of like hospital systems router the ambulatory space? Is it that you think that they don\u2019t still know how to utilize healthcare and we\u2019re going to see the opportunity kind of like later in the year. I mean any insight would be very helpful there.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, like you and everyone else in this market was trying to digest, the resorting if you will for the system and as we mentioned in our commentary, we are seeing an increase in Medicaid volumes, so that\u2019s for sure and we see that. ","As far as the rest, it\u2019s hard to understand where people have come from, went to and how they are entering the healthcare system. So we have seen like you some of the volume reports coming out of some hospitals, not all. Its mixed views on that, so we are still trying to understand how this will all sort out with you. But again, we\u2019re starting to see the impact of more lives in the system. We\u2019re hopeful. ","From the beginning of ACA we said we believe that the Affordable Care Act should be net positive for the industry and for us. We believe more people in insurance is a good thing. The diabetes studies that we showed shows that by having people with insurance it can have a positive impact on population health and we think that\u2019s a good example of how more people in the system will serve the industry well, but also us as we go forward, so we\u2019re hopeful.","Ricky Goldwasser","So then just \u2013 last one, because you mentioned the population health. You highlighted the pilot that you\u2019re doing with some physician offices on your population health tool. Should we think about \u2013 kind of how should we think about that business model? Should we think about it as a potentially longer term revenue opportunity or is it just kind of like needed aid value to create stickiness with the physician and potentially connect also with the hospital provider space.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, we\u2019re thinking of both actually and we haven\u2019t totally sorted it out, how this might work in terms of the business model. Clearly where we could show more value with accounts, we believe that does offer value in terms of our business, but secondly as we provide more and more value to integrated delivery systems and those organizations that are managing populations, we do have valuable assets here, information assets and this application we think is actually very valuable in terms of managing that population and we\u2019re thinking our way through. May there be an opportunity for us actually to have a revenue business model for this, but we haven\u2019t concluded on that yet.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you ma\u2019am. The next question is from Ms. Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning Lisa.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much. Good morning. Can you just maybe two things around the new JV. First off, I think that Steve I heard you say that clinical trial testing was about 2% in 2014. So should we think about that as being a 50 basis point headwind for the back half of this year? It sounds like the volume actually won\u2019t go through your volume, but will come from a below the line items for the JV.","Steve Rusckowski","Right. Mark, why don\u2019t you walk through how this will get sorted out on a go forward basis?","Mark Guinan","Yes, that\u2019s correct. Depending on the timing, if you want to call it a headwind, it will be an adjustment, so obviously we won\u2019t be the controlling interest as the minority owner. We have a fair amount of involvement in the JV; we have a number of our senior leaders who are involved with clinical trials moving into that business; we\u2019ve got an executive we talked about in the past. John Heins [ph] who is actually going to be sitting on the board and involved in this JV, so while for accounting purposes we are no longer going to be recording it as a revenue and we\u2019re no longer going to be reporting the income on the operating margin line. ","It\u2019s not as if we\u2019re completely distancing ourselves from the clinical trials business. In fact through the partnership we\u2019re looking to drive even more in this relationship as we referenced in the earlier companion diagnostics and then potentially using our data for clinical trial enrollment as well. ","So yes, in terms of engineering, it will be a headwind on revenue, but from an earnings standpoint, we\u2019re really just in 2015 moving it from one line to the other and then most importantly we believe it\u2019s going to be significantly accretive to what we would have done otherwise with clinical trials in 2016 and beyond.","Lisa Gill","So Mark, the way that I\u2019m trying to think about it just from a modeling perspective and your guidance today of reiteration of your revenue expectations for 2015 and just given your comments around the weather in the first quarter, I\u2019m just trying to square that up with how to think about the next three quarters and your expectations around both volumes as well as revenue growth and did you see something that you feel confident to maintain that number, because if I remember correctly, you gave that guidance before you announced the Quintiles JV?","Mark Guinan","Right, so Lisa my apologies, let me make sure I\u2019m clear. So despite whether we still believe the 2% to 3% top line guidance is attainable; however, as I said in my prepared remarks, I will be adjusting that for the JV once I know the timing. So we will be reducing that 2% to 3% revenue growth guidance impacted by the JV, nothing related to weather.","Lisa Gill","Okay great. And then just Mark, my second follow-up question is also for you. It\u2019s just around SG&A in the quarter and where you are on the cost saving initiatives. The SG&A came in a little bit higher than we anticipated, but your gross profits are a little bit higher. I\u2019m just wondering around the timing aspect of that again. How do we think about the cost savings initiatives coming in over the next year or so?","Mark Guinan","Sure. So again, I don\u2019t look at any one specific model, so not sure why we may have been different than what you were expecting, but I can talk about SG&A. Obviously Invigorate contributes to build our cost of sales as well as SG&A. We continue to make progress on Invigorate. ","If you look quarter-to-quarter, SG&A was fairly flat in dollar terms. We do have that headwind every year at the beginning of the year from bad debt, so we did get about 30 basis points of increase from bad debt. That is typical cycle of bad debt at the beginning of the year. It tends to be higher than the end of the year, so we are very comfortable with managing of SG&A. You can see that we\u2019ve leveraged it significantly versus last year and as part of our Invigorate program we expect to continue the leverage there.","Lisa Gill","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ma\u2019am. The next question is from Mr. A.J. Rice from UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning A.J. You there?","Operator","Mr. Rice, your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","A.J. are you on mute.","Operator","It looks like we lost Mr. A.J. Rice, but next question comes from Mr. Bryan Brokmeier from Maxim Group. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Bryan Brokmeier","Hi, good morning. Did you say that the organics volume was flat and is that excluding any business that you\u2019re walking away from or is that just M&A?","Steve Rusckowski","Mark, you want to take it?","Mark Guinan","Yes, so I didn\u2019t make any adjustment before. As we talked about the business we sort of walked away from. That is an actual number, so we were just talking our results and we\u2019re adjusting for M&A to get to that figure.","Steve Rusckowski","So the walk aways we talked about in the past are not adjusted out of that. So that would be based on the earlier comments of lift if you want to look at that.","Mark Guinan","Yes, we would have shown growth and I adjusted for that.","Bryan Brokmeier","Okay, and NIPT is another large market that you\u2019re currently participating in for a partnership. Can you provide any color on when you\u2019re planning to launch your own test?","Steve Rusckowski","Well, first of all its going well. So as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re quite pleased with our growth rate in advanced and esoteric testing and our non-evasive testing is \u2013 pre natal testing is going quite well, so we\u2019re hopeful about that. We continue to work through our own test as you say. We haven\u2019t announced a specific data on that, but we\u2019re making very good progress.","Bryan Brokmeier","Okay, thank a lot.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Mr. Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Dana Nentin","Hi, good morning. Its Dana Nentin in for Darren.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Dana.","Dana Nentin ","Hey. So just going back to your DSOs being down through your four days from last year, I was wondering if you could provide any color there as it relates to the [inaudible] payment recoveries and I guess if not can you update us on the status of those non-payments?","Mark Guinan","Yes, it\u2019s not related in any way to that. Largely it points to UMass, the acquisition of that business. Last year as we were transitioning the billing system from them to us there was some complexity in that and it slowed some collections down a bit and inflated our receivables, I\u2019d say relative to what they would have been otherwise last year. So now that we\u2019ve gotten that behind us, I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably the biggest probably year-over-year. So it\u2019s really nothing at all related to molecular.","Dana Nentin ","Okay. And can you update us on the size of those non-payments?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, we\u2019re making progress. We\u2019re judiciously going after our payments for what we do. We\u2019re working with all the health plans to do that and I could share with you that if you did that we are progressing through doggedly working through test by test, payer by payer to make sure we get paid for the good work we provide, so you feel like we\u2019re making progress.","Mark Guinan","But I do want to clarify, because if we\u2019ve taken this question a number of times in the past and consistently given our response, we are not expecting any sort of significant windfall. While certainly this is a headwind and I think you\u2019ve heard from maybe other people in the laboratory area about significant reductions in payments based on some of the changes, whether its CBT 2013 or now CBT 2015 or other changes in the reimbursement requirement. ","So while there\u2019s certainly been a headwind, it\u2019s not material to our performance this year and it should not be something that you expect at some point we\u2019re going to come back and say, hey, we solved a bunch of issues and here\u2019s a big good bag.","Dana Nentin ","Okay great, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.","Robert Willoughby","Hi Steve and Mark. Your approaching a year of ownership now of solicitors. Can you speak to retention rates of the business there, what synergies have been captured, what\u2019s left on the table there?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so we\u2019re making excellent progress with the inspiration of solicitors. What we did in that geography is to really combine both of our businesses together and so we\u2019re integrating operations, we\u2019re integrating our G&A functions, some portion of the improvement you see in our SG&A. This quarter is related to that good work we\u2019re doing there. ","We also have integrated the sales force. As you know when you buy any organization, we had planned on some attrition related to clients that we know that would not move over to us and have planned that in our model and we\u2019re tracking to make sure that we did have it planned. So we feel good about the progress that we made and we feel good about what we\u2019re delivering in terms of creating value for our shareholders. ","Robert Willoughby","Okay, thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question is from Ms. Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Ma\u2019am your line is open.","Amanda Murphy","Hi, good morning guys. I guess just a couple of follow-ups on the reimbursement side. So you mentioned the growth on the esoteric front and BRCA specifically, but just curious as you think forward. Obviously there is a lot of opportunity, particularly in sequencing based diagnostics. What\u2019s your view on the reimbursement environment there specifically? I know there has been some work to establish some coding there, so curious just thinking about that this year and then longer term?","Steve Rusckowski","We deliver a lot of value. As you know the average market price has come down over the last year and a half, two years. We believe where we are right now is supporting the plan we have going forward. We feel good about that and we\u2019ll continue to as we\u2019ve done with everything in our business; continue to have the data that justifies that we\u2019re putting a lot of value here and we need to make sure we get back in our reimbursement, the value it delivers. ","So we\u2019re going to be careful before we do anything. In terms of pricing changes we believe that defending and continuing to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace is important for us. We think it\u2019s important for the industry to continue to defend and get our value back for the marketplace. There\u2019s a great value we deliver and that\u2019s position we continue to take going forward. ","So Mark, anything you\u2019d like to add?","Mark Guinan","Yes, Amanda, I\u2019m sure as you fully appreciate, especially in the gene based area, reimbursement is related also to your offering. It\u2019s not an independent decision. So look at our onc [ph] advantage product and the fact that we have a panel of actionable genes, 34 actionable genes and as we engage with the payers, I think the response is the dialog with our medical professionals and so on is you know fairly positive because of the fact that we are moving forward with the limited panel that is actually all around the action. ","So as Steve talked about earlier, data brings insights, insights to drive actions and I think the payers are much more willing to pay for things, where clearly there is a path towards actions. So again, not commenting on anybody else\u2019s offerings, it\u2019s not the same for the all of it. Certainly the choices we make around our product offerings and the size of the panels and the action ability of those panels also influences our ability to get paid. ","Amanda Murphy","And one follow-up to that, is there any way that you can give as an idea as how big that business is for you now. Obviously esoteric encompasses quite a lot, but if you think about just sequencing, I guess as a bucket how big that is and how much of your growth on esoteric is coming from that side of the world. I know you mentioned BRAC again, but...","Steve Rusckowski","Mark and Dan should talk a little bit about how we breakup things in our 10-K. ","Mark Guinan","Amanda we break out the gene based and esoteric in the 10-K we shared on the supplemental analysis on the website. So overall gene based esoteric and Anatomic Pathology is about $2.5 billion business, but in terms of specifics sub-segments and different cuts of the data at the level of granularity you are looking for, we haven\u2019t share that at this point. ","Amanda Murphy","Okay, thanks guys. ","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Nicholas Jansen from Raymond James. Sir, your line is open. ","Nicholas Jansen","Yes, Mark this one is for you on free cash flow. I think the guidance this year is $550 million, but that certainly excludes some things like the debt restructuring charges and some of the project Invigorate 2.0 charges. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of actually how much true free cash flow is available this year. I know you have a dividend payment, I know you guidance includes kind of 1% to 2% revenue growth from M&A. So maybe just walk me through the cash flow dynamics. ","Mark Guinan","The only thing that I\u2019m excluding is the debt refinancing, so I\u2019m not adjusting for any of the Invigorate expenses. So as we talked about it was $78 million in the quarter. We talked about the fact that we\u2019d have a somewhat similar charge in the second quarter. So that should guide you. I mean at the end of the day, we are expecting somewhere a little less that $100 million of expense from the refinancing. ","So the $550 million less that will be kind of I guess the free cash flow number that you are looking for that takes the new account to cash expenditures for other adjustments. And again, we have some positive guys that we adjust out, but actually they are cash positive as well. So when you net all those out, normally we don\u2019t many adjustments, but just given the size and I guess the unusual nature of the debt refinancing, I decided to adjust that just to make the year over year comparison what I thought was a little more meaningful and comparable. ","Nicholas Jansen","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then regarding the $0.08 weather headwind. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that relative to what you reported. So I guess on the previous conference call you talked about having 1Q earnings only slightly better than 2Q to 4Q. If we were added $0.08 back to the $1.05 that would be meaningfully better than slightly. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile kind of the quarter relative to your internal expectations that you gave back in January and kind of how that proceeds to the guidance that was reiterated today. ","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you for the question. Obviously when we spoke to you in January we hadn\u2019t incurred the February weather, but we had incurred some January weather. So we were trying at that point with the knowledge that we had at that point, we just wanted to make sure that people didn\u2019t get overly exuberant about the potential of the first quarter given the easy compare with the weather in 2014. ","So yes, a couple of things. One is we probably formed a little more stronger than we expected in the first quarter adjusting for the weather, so had the weather not been there, it would have been a really, really strong quarter. There is various reasons for that. However I\u2019ll go back and say the guidance that I gave today is something that we are very confident in and whatever the performance in the first quarter, you just assume that guidance is reasonable and that\u2019s where we are going to land. ","Nicholas Jansen","Thanks for the clarification. ","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open, you may proceed. ","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning. ","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning guys. Just a quick question for you on the hospital side. So I know we\u2019ve talked about in the past how the opportunity is for these hospitals to look to outsource their labs. We are hearing more and more about payer pressure on commercial pricing for the hospital based labs and also narrow network strategies specifically you know Anthem, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. So are we seeing more of that or is the pressure accelerating in the hospitals that you are starting to see more conversations with hospital CEOs. ","Steve Rusckowski","As I mentioned in the past Brian, the discussions we\u2019re having and the opportunity list that we have and that we are working is larger than we ever anticipated. Most CEOs and CFOs have lab strategies as part of their shortlist were encouraged by all that. ","The dynamic you mentioned we think is a very positive dynamic. As we\u2019ve talked about, we offer great value. We have some of the best pricing for the quality we deliver in this market place and therefore in terms of value we are in the strongest of the choices people have. ","And yes payers are now starting to look at every tightening their network further, but wide variation in prices from what we have here versus hospital outreach are notable and yes, it\u2019s from the payers, but I also mentioned two other dimensions to that. Employers are spending a lot more time on their healthcare costs and seeing wide variations, so they are starting to ask questions. And most importantly consumers with a higher co-pay in deducible have now started to ask questions. Why would their bills go up, just because physicians are now working for integrated Delivery Systems verses when those physicians used to send the work to independent laboratories like ourselves. ","So all this is coming together and in a good way. Most hospitals we talked to realize with payment models moving away from fee for service to population health and bundle payment models that no longer is an incentive to \u2013 or they are no longer incentives to drive volume and activity, but look at how they deliver the best quarter to healthcare with the lowest possible cost, that\u2019s what we saw at the University of Massachusetts. ","And then second, some do see and realize that they do have a melting ice-cream cone with some of the differential commercial rates that they enjoy today on their hospital outreach. Therefore they are taking to us and thinking about what their options should be. ","So it\u2019s coming together nicely. We actually applaud what\u2019s happening with Anthem. We think it\u2019s a positive change for the industry and a positive indication that there is a catalyst out there in the system to start to get the discussions started and move this at an accelerated pace. ","Brian Tanquilut","Got it. Thanks Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Sir your line is open. You may proceed. ","David Clair","Yes, good morning everybody. So I\u2019m just curious, given the timing of the PAMA final rule, it sounds like they are going to miss the initial June proposed rule deadline. So how would you handicap the odds of the clinical lab fee schedule reprising happening by 2017?","Steve Rusckowski","Well David, I\u2019ll leave the odds giving to Las Vegas. Hard to handicap CMS, hard to handicap anything that happens in Washington. As I mentioned, we were down there last month; we being myself and some members of our industry. We had a very good conversation. Its complex and they are working through all that complexity. With all the different entities that we have to give them their data, all the different codes they have to look through, all the different tax IDs and so they are digesting all of that. ","So with all that said, it is still their goal and that\u2019s how they say it, still their goal to have the rule making out in 2015 for collection in the \u201916 for \u201917 a refresh to the clinical lab fee schedule. So that\u2019s the gold they are still working at. ","David Clair","Okay. Thank you and then I was wondering was the debt refinance included in your original EPS guidance and if it wasn\u2019t, what\u2019s the offset to the interest savings that we are going to see in the year. ","Mark Guinan","And so, I\u2019m sure as you appreciate when put guidance together you got a number of items to consider and various ranges I know for modeling purposes, you always need a discreet entry, but we are considering ranges of potential outcomes and inputs. So certainly we had a reasonable expectation we might do the debt refinancing, we didn\u2019t know exactly the timing, we didn\u2019t know exactly what the new interest rate might be and hence the interest savings. ","So at this point since I reaffirmed guidance and EPS, assume that the interest savings is in there and I can\u2019t really call out an offset, because we still have $0.15 of range within the guidance. So its within the parameters of all the different contributors to how the EPS was driven and so I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly what the offset was, because there isn\u2019t necessarily, because we are still within a range that\u2019s quire broad. ","David Clair","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question is from Mr. Jack Meehan from Barclays. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. ","Steve Rusckowski","Hi Jack.","Jack Meehan","Hi, good morning guys. I want to sort of just ask about the new BRAC data sharing initiative you announced earlier this week and just the background, how it came together. And then timing wise, just curious why now? Obviously you\u2019ve been on the market 18 months and I think there is a lot of differing thoughts on the merits of the U.S. So just in terms of it being a metric, what are you seeing on the market? ","Steve Rusckowski","First of all we responded quickly to the opportunity to enter the BRCA market. After the Supreme Court ruling, we entered the market about four months afterwards. So we entered into the market. And as we approach all businesses Jack, we continue to look at ways that we can get better at what we do. So we\u2019ve been improving our offering in terms of our capabilities, of our sales force, capabilities of our generic counselor, capabilities of the quality of our reporting and the look and feel of our interactive insights as I talked about it in my remarks. ","But also we are looking at how do we get the actually results to be of higher quality and we only have so much data. We believe it would be the right thing to do, to take our data, combine it with other people\u2019s data. The inserm being the French Institute for Health has 16 labs that report their data gain. ","We are also happening to have LabCorp participate in this. So we are going to put in both of data that\u2019s into Inserm and we believe that this is just the beginning, there will be others to follow. ","In the outcome of this, we believe it will be an outcome of the curation and also the analytics around that data to produce better sensitivity and specificity around the testing for BRAC and we think that\u2019s a good thing for the industry and a good thing for us. So we think this is the next step of improving and delivering a great solution to the market place at a better way. ","We will continue to differentiate ourselves and everything I just described, how we sell it, how we support it, how we present it and how we explain it\u2019s in our solution to the market place which we think will allow us to continue to differentiate ourselves versus the other options that our customers have. So we think its progress in the right direction. ","Jack Meehan","Yes, got it. And then just maybe off that; is there a way to gauge a sense for just collectively the contribution in terms of volumes and just you know where you think it needs to be in order to have similar VUS rates and if that\u2019s a good metric to consider?","Mark Guinan","So we are not going to see any sort of detail on the volumes that are contributed. In the French the institute has been collecting data for 10 years. So there is a fair amount of data. Obviously you\u2019ve got us and LabCorp who have decided it\u2019s in the best interest of patients to contribute, come out to better data information. We are going to compete on other aspects of our product offering than anything around the science. ","And again back to the VUS, this is not about VUS. This is really about insuring we have the best ability to provide information to patients and therefore we won\u2019t get into sort of the medical comparisons or anything like that; that\u2019s not why we are doing this. We are not doing this for competitive reasons. We are doing this because it\u2019s in the best interest of patients. ","Jack Meehan","Got it and if I can squeeze in one more maybe just for Mark, curious if you are seeing anything on the deductable side and any changes to start the year in terms of the prevalence of high deductible health plans. ","A - Steve Rusckowski1 ","I mean it\u2019s still early for us to know whether there has been a large hit. I mean obviously we\u2019ve built into our assumptions that continued trend towards more high deductable plans for a reported based provider insurance. We did have the usual first quarter lift in bad debts like our efforts in some of it and so forth, so nothing I can share of detail at this point. ","Jack Meehan","Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","Thank you and our last question is from Mr. A.J. Rice. Sir you line is open you may proceed. ","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hi everybody, sorry about earlier. Just two quick areas of question; first on the upcoming JV with Quintiles, is it generally in the ballpark to think of the operating margins. Thank you that you gave us to revenues. The operating margins on the clinical trial business you are contributing are somewhere close to the corporate average and then as you think about the JV on an ongoing basis, will there be either cash commitments on your part going forward after the JV setup or will you be taking \u2013 have opportunities to take cash out. What are the cash flow implications of the JV? ","Mark Guinan","Right so, A.J. I won\u2019t get into the specifics, but the clinical trials businesses is not materially different from its order of magnitude; its margin is similar the overall enterprise. Obviously you get a lot more granularity on that when you start seeing the changes in our equity earnings line going forward. ","In terms of cash, there is just some initial cash from a working capital standpoint that\u2019s not significant, because we are going to continue to kind of wean down the receivables of our business and keep that as opposed to contributing that to the venture. So at the end of the day that\u2019s going to about a wash. ","We have an annual \u2013 and it\u2019s part of the contract. We have an annual ability to take out cash dividend as will Quintiles as well. So we are expecting to get cash contributions out of the JV going forward. And in terms of any sort of future cash needs, it\u2019s part of this agreement. We have the ability to both, to contribute cash if you want to do more M&A through the partnerships or there some other investment opportunity that going forward agrees make sense. There is an ability to bring cash into the entity. So we feel it\u2019s pretty flexible in terms of cash, but we certainly are expecting to get our fair share of cash out of this entity going forward as well. ","A.J. Rice","Okay and then maybe just one other follow-up. I think you had said this before, and I think it\u2019s my sense of the industry overall, but when you think about the larger contracts with payers and others, that this is a relatively benign year that doesn\u2019t have a lot of re-contracting activity, but I just wanted to put that out there and confirm that that is indeed the cash, if it\u2019s true. ","Mark Guinan","So independent of whether we had a lot of re-contracting. What we have said is that the pricing pressure, the price erosion in 2015 is to be more similar to \u201914 and in \u201914 it was less than a 100 basis points and I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics of how close is it going to be \u201914, but more like \u201914 and I also said that as part of the Investor Day that I would expect \u201916 and \u201917 to also be more like \u201914. ","A.J. Rice","Okay, all right, thanks a lot. ","Steve Rusckowski","Sure. ","Dan Haemmerle","Okay, no further questions. Thanks again for joining the call today. As you can see, we are making good progress executing our strategy. We are excited about the clinical trials opportunity. We appreciate your support and you have a great day. Thank you very much.

I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, 2011 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.","A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now here is Surya Mohapatra.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Thank you, Kathleen. We delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, revenues grew 3% to $1.9 billion, adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.23 and cash flow was strong at $338 million.","For the full year 2011, revenues grew about 2% to $7.5 billion, adjusted earnings per share grew 7% to $4.53 and the adjusted cash flow was strong at $1.1 billion.","We continued to execute our revenue growth and cost reduction plans. The fourth quarter capped a year in which we made significant progress. Despite a further decline in physician office visits, we exceeded the earnings expectations we set at the beginning of the year. We completed the acquisitions of Athena and Celera and established a solid foundation in 4 critical areas of cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders.","We began a $500 million multiyear cost-reduction program. And with key acquisitions in place, we updated our capital deployment philosophy to return a majority of our free cash flow to shareholders over the medium term. During 2011, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, and we announced a 70% increase in our dividend beginning in 2012.","As we have said before, our growth strategy is based on 3 elements: driving innovative new tests and advanced healthcare IT services, enhancing sales effectiveness and strengthening our relationship with health plans and other payers. ","Let me say a few words about each of these elements. In the quarter, esoteric and gene-based testing grew 17%, driven mainly by the contribution of neurological testing from Athena and cardiovascular testing from Berkeley HeartLab. Demand for gene-based and esoteric testing continued to grow faster than routine testing.","For the full year, gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew 11%, testing volume for SureSwab was up more than 40%, Vitamin D was up 12%, and ImmunoCAP was up 4%.","With the acquisition of Celera, along with Focus Diagnostics, we have assembled unique capabilities from discovery to laboratory developed tests to FDA-cleared IVD test kits. A good example of how we utilize these capabilities to drive personalized medicine is our STRATIFY JC virus test, which was just cleared by the FDA last week. We developed this test in collaboration with Biogen Idec. STRATIFY JCV helps physicians stratify risk for an infrequent brain infection in patients receiving Tysabri, an important multiple sclerosis therapy.","With regard to our industry-leading connectivity solutions, we continue to gain users and drive customer loyalty. Approximately 200,000 physicians and clinicians now use our Care360 connectivity platform for lab orders and results. In addition, Care360 users increased the use of e-prescribing by about 50% to an annualized rate of 32 million medications. In 2011, Care360 was named the top e-prescribing platform by Black Book Rankings. Our Care360 electronic health record is now utilized by 4,400 physicians and has enabled them to receive payments for meaningful use. Last week, we announced a plan to help physicians nationwide adopt EHRs through our Care360 EHR grant program.","Turning to sales effectiveness. As you know, our sales force expansion is complete, and we continue to enhance the support and training we provide. We have seen results when our sales force is focused on our competitive advantages, such as esoteric and gene-based testing, connectivity solution or various disease categories. Also, we continue to work with health plans and employers to move business to us from high-cost providers. ","Regarding our 3-year $500 million cost-reduction program, we are making good progress. We have begun to implement some of our plans and expect to realize meaningful benefits in 2012. You will hear more details from Bob, who is leading this initiative.  This initiative is all about building a sustainable platform for the future, one that will ensure we can continue to effectively compete in an ever-changing and increasingly challenging healthcare environment. ","To improve shareholder value, the first and most important step is improving operating performance. That's why every member of our management team is focused on driving growth and efficiency. As we said last quarter, starting in 2012, ROIC will be an important component of management's long-term incentive compensation. ","All in all, we made progress in 2011, but we have more to do. As you know, the Board of Directors is in the process of selecting my successor, and we'll keep you updated when we have more to report.","Now Bob will provide analysis of our performance and our outlook for 2012, and then we'll take your questions. Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","As noted by Surya, revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, 3% above the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share were $1.23 compared to $1.03 in the prior year, a 19% increase. The earnings improvement is principally driven by top line growth and actions we have taken to reduce our cost structure.","Adjusted EPS for the 2011 fourth quarter excludes $0.02 per share associated with restructuring and integration costs and $0.02 associated with the CEO transition. Adjusted EPS for last year's fourth quarter excludes $0.06 of charges associated with restructuring and employment litigation. These items are further detailed in Footnote 2 to the earnings release.","Fourth quarter results include a benefit of $0.08 per share in 2011 and $0.05 per share in 2010 associated with discrete tax items. Consolidated revenue growth was driven by the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, which contributed about 3% to growth in the quarter. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 2.6% above the prior year and equal to the prior year before the contributions from Athena and Celera.","Volume in the quarter grew 0.4% from the prior year and improved from the 1.2% decrease we saw in the third quarter. We estimate the impact of weather helped the fourth quarter year-over-year comparisons by about 0.4%.","The market, in terms of estimated physician office visits, may be showing signs of stabilizing. In the quarter, the data reflects a 2% improvement compared to the prior year. While our most recent improvement in volume and the data and physician office visits is encouraging, we believe it's still too early to conclude the market has completely turned the corner.","We are not expecting further declines in physician office visits in 2012, nor are we expecting much improvement from the current levels.","Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 5% in the quarter, in line with growth of the last quarter. Revenue per requisition was 2.2% above the prior year, with the improvement due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera. Base revenue per requisition has remained relatively stable throughout the year.","Revenues in our nonclinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and healthcare IT, grew about 7% in the quarter, driven by the products business acquired as part of the Celera acquisition. For the full year, these businesses grew about 10%, with about half of the growth organic.","Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues was 17.9% compared to 17.2% in the prior year. Actions taken earlier in the year to reduce our cost structure are the principal driver of the improvement. Restructuring, integration and CEO transition costs totaling $11 million reduced the reported operating income percentage by about 60 basis points in the most recent quarter.","In the last year's fourth quarter, charges associated with restructuring and litigation totaling $19 million reduced the reported operating income percentage by a full 1%. In July, we announced a multiyear initiative, the goal of which is to reduce our cost structure by $500 million by the end of 2014.","As we shared with you last quarter, the opportunities have been quantified and organized into a number of areas with dedicated teams of subject matter experts and cross-functional support. Each team has a very specific charter and financial target. Some of the areas around which teams are organized include: specimen acquisition, which includes all the costs associated with obtaining and transporting samples; client support, which includes billing and customer service; the labs themselves and all the costs associated with operating them; IT and customer connectivity costs; procurement and supply chain; and SG&A, both in the field and at corporate.","Some areas are more developed than others. However, we have made significant progress in every area and remain confident in reaching our goal. We have now established specific targets which we expect to deliver about 20% of the $500 million goal by the end of 2012, with the remainder in 2013 and 2014. The benefits we expect to realize in 2012 are the principal driver of the margin expansion we expect this year.","The areas where we are furthest along are in client support and procurement and supply chain, together which we expect to provide about 1\/3 of our savings. Here, we plan to leverage technology to eliminate manual work, further standardize systems and processes, implement more self-service options for customers and leverage Lean Six Sigma to further streamline activities. In client support and billing, we plan to reduce manual work and customer call volume by enabling customers to do more online, including supplying insurance information, making payments, checking on the status of a bill and obtaining test results.","In the area of procurement and supply chain, we will further consolidate suppliers, rationalize SKUs, standardize and optimize specs and work more closely with our suppliers in sharing information and managing costs from design to manufacture to distribution.","As one example of the opportunity here, today, across our business, we use hundreds of different gloves, specimen bags and labels and more than a dozen different urine collection cups. We plan to significantly reduce these numbers and unlock the savings associated with bulk buying and the administration associated with handling all these different choices.","Another roughly 1\/3 of the savings is expected to come from SG&A, including IT. We are flattening the organization structure and simplifying management processes, which will not only reduce costs but drive increased accountability.","In the area of IT, we will place greater emphasis on connectivity solutions which don't require computer hardware. Over time, this will dramatically reduce the cost of serving the tens of thousands of pieces of equipment we have in the field. In addition, connectivity installations will be done quicker and at lower costs.","Other areas like the labs themselves and specimen acquisition, we expect to contribute the remainder of the savings. In these areas, we are addressing capacity utilization, including our lab footprint, service parameters, organization structure and supply consumption. Common themes across most areas include standardizing systems, processes and databases; increased use of automation and technology; and centralizing and selective outsourcing. For the next few years, this will require some increased level of capital spending to standardize systems and upgrade IT infrastructure. ","We are fully committed to realizing the plan benefits from this program, which will not only make our company more efficient but also serve as a platform for accelerated growth.","Today, we continue to produce industry-leading performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.5% in the quarter and 3.7% for the full year, reflecting continued improvement from the prior year. DSOs were 45 days compared to 44 days last quarter.","Reported cash from operations was strong at $338 million. Before the effect of special items, cash from operations was about $300 million. For the full year, reported cash from operations was approximately $900 million and $1.1 billion dollars before the effect of special items.","Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter compared to $69 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 874,000 common shares at an average price of $57.21, for a total of $50 million. We completed $935 million in share repurchases for the full year.","We are firmly committed to driving increases in shareholder returns. The best way to do this is by improving operating performance, and as you've heard, we are taking actions to accelerate organic revenue growth and establish a more efficient cost structure. We also intend to use our strong cash flows to enhance shareholder value. ","As we stated last quarter, with a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities now in place, it is unlikely we will complete any large, strategic acquisitions in the near term. We will, however, continue to invest in our business in a very disciplined way to ensure we continue to differentiate Quest Diagnostics in an evolving marketplace but in a manner which should require significantly less capital than recent years. Our investments in growth are likely to focus on smaller fold-in acquisitions, like the S.E.D. acquisition completed earlier this month in New Mexico; investments in science and innovation in form of licensing, collaboration and internal development; and investments in technology, which will improve quality and efficiency in our labs and other parts of our business.","We plan to use ROIC to guide these investment decisions and are committed to improving ROIC over time. Beginning in 2012, improving ROIC is a major component of our long-term compensation program. We are committed to increasing shareholder returns and improving ROIC to a framework which encompasses improving operating performance and a capital deployment philosophy which includes dividends, share repurchases and investments in our business.","As we shared with you last quarter, this philosophy is grounded in maintaining a strong BBB credit rating, which minimizes our cost of capital and provides us appropriate access to credit in support of our business. As we have also indicated, in 2012, this will require us to use the majority of our free cash flow, about $500 million to $700 million to delever to a leverage ratio in the range of 2x to 2.25x. Upon achieving our targeted leverage ratio, we plan to commit the majority of our free cash flow be returned to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","Last quarter, we announced a significant increase, 70%, in our dividend to an annualized amount of $0.68 per share. We expect the dividend will grow over time, commensurate with earnings and cash flows. In addition, share repurchases will remain an important tool for returning cash to shareholders.","Earlier today, we announced that our board has authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1.1 billion. There is no set time frame for utilizing our current authority, and the level of share repurchases will be a function of a number of factors. While we expect share repurchases to be relatively modest in 2012 due to our commitment to delever, we expect them to be much more significant the following year.","Turning to 2012 guidance, we expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenues to grow between 2% and 2.5%, inclusive of the S.E.D. acquisition but before other potential acquisitions; operating income to approach 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion; capital expenditures to be between $225 million and $250 million, the increase from the prior year principally due to IT investments required to standardize systems and upgrade infrastructure; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.40 and $4.55.","Now I'll turn it back to Surya.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Thank you, Bob. In summary, we see signs of progress in a number of areas to drive organic growth and reduce our costs. We are focused on increasing shareholder value and improving returns on capital. With the actions we have taken over the past years, we are well positioned for the future.","We're now ready to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Feinstein.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Barclays Capital. Maybe just a quick start, I appreciate all of the background there on the outlook. But Bob, just maybe as you think about the revenue growth for 2012, I guess just what's embedded in there for volumes? And to the extent -- if you can't break it out that way, just help us think about, I guess, some of the benefits you'll get going forward relative to some of the headwinds you had this year. So I'm just trying to think about the -- because looking ahead of the quarter, the organic growth was relatively flat, but that was compared to the down 1% earlier in the year. So should we look for a continued ramp-up throughout 2012?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, and a couple things on that. First, when you look at the guidance, which is 2% to 2.5%, recognize that there is some carryover from the Athena and Celera acquisitions and some small benefit from the S.E.D. acquisition. Combined, that's worth a little over 1%. So that implies within the revenue guidance that there was about 1% organic growth there, and that compares to about flat this year from an organic perspective. So we are seeing some modest improvement there. As I said, we're not expecting the market to really pick up significantly as we look at 2012, nor are we expecting it to decline much. We're expecting it pretty much flattish for the most part and some relatively steady improvement in the revenue growth as we go through the year. As you know, we don't split out the components of revenue growth between price and volume.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just once again, the fourth quarter showed progress relative to the earlier part of the prior year. But just how do you think about the revenue per req in that with the flat growth trend for the fourth quarter? I just wanted to get your sense in terms of what's going on with pricing. Are things stable? Is that the right way to think about that?","Robert A. Hagemann","The way I think you should view pricing going forward is reimbursement itself is going to continue to be under pressure, but what will fuel increases in revenue per req over time will be test mix and the number of test order per requisition, which has really been the principal driver for the last number of years. So that's one of the factors that we think about as we're considering what the revenue growth will be and what the guidance will look like.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just my final question, and I appreciate all the details with the slides, there was just a slide in there that had the revenue by payer, just a follow-up a little bit to my last question. And if I look at the Managed Care revenue, the decline in Managed Care revenues accelerated this year relative to last year. And then relative to overall revenue growth, it was a little bit weaker. So I just wanted to see what would be driving that. Is it just a function of just Managed Care volumes being lower than overall volumes? Or excuse me, I guess this is revenue per -- well, anyway, I just wanted to get your feedback in terms of the Managed Care revenue.","Robert A. Hagemann","Nothing specific that I can point to there, Adam. As I said, reimbursement does continue to be under pressure. We're offsetting much of that with test mix, but...","Surya N. Mohapatra","The membership.","Robert A. Hagemann","And membership declines could drive the mix there a little bit as well. And we also -- one thing that we pointed out earlier is we've had some mix shift between our plans as well this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","It's Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray. Just had a quick question about the molecular diagnostic reimbursement changes that Palmetto's trying to implement at the beginning of March. Is there any update as to whether that's moving forward? And then I'm just wondering, are you guys prepared to use and move over to McKesson Z-Codes? And also, what type of impact do you think this will have on you and the industry?","Kathleen Valentine","Kevin, in terms of where the Palmetto implementation stands, I mean, according to them, all signs seem to point to they are going forward with implementing their program effective March 1. As we've said previously, we're leveraging and working all resources available to us to fight it. We're working with the trade association. There's a lot of questions about the program and the administration around it and just clarity about what they're going to require and how the process is going to work. We've expressed those concerns through the trade association, so we are going to fight it, but it does appear that they are going to proceed. So we'll continue to evaluate what it means to us in terms of implementing it from an administrative perspective. But rest assured, we're working with others in our industry to fight it and try to either delay it or get better clarity around it. Relative to the impact to us, as we've said, the molecular testing revenues could be impacted by the new AMA code that will go into effect next year. It represents less than 5% of our total company revenues. So from a financial perspective, not significant in terms of what it represents relative to total revenues. We've also indicated that from a utilization perspective, this is all intended to get more clarity around what people are paying for and what's being performed. We feel very comfortable that the testing that we perform and bill for is appropriate. So from a utilization perspective, we feel very good about that. Until CMS establishes reimbursement for these new codes, we can't determine what, if any, impact there will be from a reimbursement perspective on these new tests, but from a utilization perspective, we feel comfortable.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sure, I appreciate that color, Kathleen. And then actually, just one quick follow-up there. The AMA is also moving forward with their 101 new codes, which, like you said, haven't been assigned pricing yet from CMS. But I guess what's your view on if those AMA codes are put into the physician fee schedule versus clinical lab fee schedule? And then also, if Palmetto moves forward and then you have the AMA coming out with their codes in 2013, isn't that going to kind of create a mess in terms of reimbursement for the systems?","Kathleen Valentine","Yes. And that's one of our exact concerns, is that they will create a lot of confusion, and it will -- we and others in our industry have expressed that exact concern.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then I just wanted to switch back. Bob, you provided a lot of detail, and one thing I missed was when you said you plan to use your free cash flow to delever to 2x to 2.25x this year. How much do you plan on spending? Was it $500 million to $700 million?","Robert A. Hagemann","That's between $500 million and $700 million of debt paydown, Kevin.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just out of curiosity, just wondering what the status is on the CEO search, if you found some good external candidates or if there's any strong internals that you guys could talk about.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Kevin, this is Surya. CEO search is a top priority for our board, and the board is actively conducting the search. I don't have any information to report now, but as soon as we know something, we will let you know.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Tom, Lazard Capital Markets. Bob, I was just curious. A couple of quick questions, but one follow-up to something you had mentioned earlier, is seeing sort of a mix shift between plans and also sort of persistent reimbursement pressure. So I guess over and above the government aspect of things, can you talk about that mix shift between plans, remind us what you mean there? And maybe give us a little more on what you alluded to in terms of reimbursement pressure on the private side.","Robert A. Hagemann","Sure. Tom, as you would expect, the pricing that we have with different plans varies, and some plans are growing membership faster than others. So when I talk about the mix shift between the plans, that's really what I'm talking about there. That's impacting the overall average reimbursement from third-party health plans. And with respect to reimbursement pressure, look, it's no news. Reimbursement is going to be under pressure, will continue to be under pressure, whether be it from government payers or private payers. And as we've said before, that's one of the reasons that we've initiated the $500 million cost-reduction program.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right. So the mix shift, just sort of more of the luck of the draw, it's not a change toward high deductible plans or anything like that, that you're alluding to?","Robert A. Hagemann","No, not at this point, not that we can see or have visibility to at this moment. Although as we think about the shift to high-deductibility plans, that is a bit of a wildcard as it relates to utilization, not so much reimbursement, but utilization.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right, right. Can you remind us sort of to what extent you've got contracts or bigger contracts that we should be thinking about up for renewal over the next 18 months?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, yes, we always have a fair number of contracts set to expire in any given year, but there are no big national contracts set to expire this year. Overall, when I look at what's set to expire in 2012, it's probably a little less than we would have in an average year.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then you mentioned the doc visits. Your data showed that maybe it was up a couple percent in the quarter. Looks like organically, your volume was closer to flattish. So do you think that the lab industry volume was up more like the doc volume, or sort of how do you sort of see the correlation between doc data and what the lab industry underlying market might be doing?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, it's an interesting question, Tom, because there are lots of sources of data. There's the IMS data that showed that they were up about 2% in the quarter. There's analysis that JPMorgan puts out which shows that they were down in the quarter. So it's really hard to say. I mean, I feel as though it improved, though, because both sets of metrics indicated improvement from the third quarter. But as you know, it's really hard to get a gauge on what the market is doing, particularly in any single quarter. But we are encouraged that it looks like there's some signs that things may be starting to improve or at least stabilize.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Last one, if I could. Pathology has been a pressure point not only in volume, but I guess that impacts your sort of pricing calculation as well. Where do we sort of stand on the trends there?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, that's a business that when you look at the data that we put out there, you'll see it was down again this year. Total AP revenues were down almost 6% versus the prior year. I think the year before, they were down about 10%. So we've seen some moderation there, but that's a piece of our business that we expect will continue to be under pressure from insourcing. As you've heard us say before, we're working with legislators and other policy-setters to make them aware of the fact that insourcing drives, in some cases, unnecessary utilization. So we're hoping to get a long-term solution there. But in the short term, we're continuing to do what we can to sell our value proposition. We've added some sales people in that regard, and we think that, that is helping mitigate some of it. But as we said, we're looking for a longer-term fix there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Bob, real quick, does your guidance include share repo?","Robert A. Hagemann","It does, Ralph, but, as I said, at a much more modest level than we saw this year. When you think about how much cash we generate in a given year, we gave you guidance for cash from ops of about $1.2 billion, CapEx of $225 million to $250 million. So that gets you down to a free cash flow number of about $950 million or so. We said we're going to delever between $500 million and $700 million, so if you use the midpoint, about $600 million, which also approximates our short-term debt that we have outstanding. Then you consider the dividend that we've got, that we've committed to, which is a little over $100 million. What's available for share repurchases and acquisitions is a little over $200 million. And while we're not expecting a significant acquisition activity this year, we did do a small one already with the S.E.D. acquisition. So that does limit the amount of share repurchases we can do in 2012, but as I said, we expect the share repurchases to ramp up pretty significantly next year, after we've completed the delevering.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just along those lines, does your guidance assume the lower interest expense that's going to come with sort of the lower debt levels?","Robert A. Hagemann","Sure.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's assumed in guidance?","Robert A. Hagemann","Absolutely. I mean, we factor all that in, both the share repurchases and the debt levels. Keep in mind that the interest rate on the outstanding debt is very modest at this point. It's pretty low. We're a pretty low-interest rate environment. And the term loan that the we're paying off is a LIBOR plus, so we're looking at pretty significantly low rate there.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so help us sort of understand the margin commentary then. I mean, you ended the quarter with close to 18% operating margin. I think you had over 18% in the third quarter. Your guidance says you expect to approach 18%, yet you've got sort of 20% of your cost savings that's going to sort of start in earnest in 2012. So I guess just help me reconcile the margin run rate that we've had the sort of back half of this year relative to what seems to be your implied lower margin profile for next year or for this year, 2012.","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, I would be a little careful, Ralph, in looking at any one quarter and trying to extrapolate it. What I'd suggest you look at is the full year operating income percentage, which was 17.6% on an adjusted basis. Think about that compared to the approaching 18% that we're providing for 2012. As I said in the script, the margin expansion that we are expecting is principally from the cost-reduction effort. As we've said in the past, this is a business, with all of the fixed costs that we've got and the inflationary pressure on the elements that is salaries, wages and benefits, that you need to grow organically 2-plus percent to be able to hold margins. And as I said earlier, the organic growth that we're contemplating here is more in the 1% range. So it's the cost-reduction program that's helping improve those margins year-over-year.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Any consideration going to cash earnings?","Robert A. Hagemann","Look, yes, you can calculate it if you would like. It's readily available. We do report adjusted earnings so that people can understand what we view as the unusual items in the quarter. Otherwise, it's GAAP-adjusted for those things. Cash earnings is not something that we've historically done. It's readily available for folks to calculate, and it can certainly be calculated.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just my last one, Surya, I think you had talked about working with plans, get more business away from sort of the higher-cost and over to Quest. So I mean, can you talk about any changes to benefit design that you may be aware of and\/or what you're doing with employers that's sort of incremental to 2012 relative to where you were last year or 2 years ago?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, Ralph, as you know, it takes quite a bit of time. But I am encouraged by the traction or even the engagement that some of these health plans have. And along with them, we're talking to the employers, and the whole objective is -- and they know also, to meet their goals, they have to persuade the doctors to send the testing to our network and to avoid the high-cost providers. So that's one thing happening. The other thing which is becoming very exciting and will put us in a very advantageous position is this evolution of ACOs. And they are unique data. They are unique connectivity. They are unique analytics. So we are having a lot of discussions with them. So it may not have anything concrete in 2012, but I see that all the assets and capabilities we have accumulated over the years -- now there are 200,000 doctors that are using our Care360. We have a huge databank. So those are the things that are going to help us to work with health plans in this evolving healthcare reform. But along with that also, they are also narrowing down their network, and that's also helping when the other laboratories are removed from the network. So we'll continue working with them, and it's a part of our growth strategy.","Operator","We have a question from A.J. Rice.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Susquehanna Financial. A couple of questions, if I could ask. This is a high-level sort of question, but if you look at your anticipated revenue growth of a couple percent, on a full year basis, you're improving margin modestly. You got the share repurchase, and you're paying down $600 million in debt and getting the benefit of the interest expense savings on that. I guess when I put all those things together, I'm surprised that you'd still forecast EPS to be effectively down on an adjusted basis or flat to down. Is there something we're missing when you take those components? Because that would seem to point to at least modest growth.","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, a couple things, A.J. First, as I said earlier, we can catch you off-line, but we want to make your interest expense assumption for the debt paydown is appropriate. Again, the interest expense there is very modest. The other thing that I would tell you is when you think about the tax rate, it's not going to be the same tax rate as this year. This year, we had a number of discrete items in there which helped the tax rate. And if you want to think about the right tax rate to use, I'd suggest you look in the footnotes and you look at the rates we've used, the tax effect, some of the items in there, in Footnote 2 in the press release.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, all right. We'll do that, and we could follow up off-line. Maybe on a big picture as well question about Washington. It seems like there was a lot of focus coming up to year-end on the doc fix. We had the House proposal, the Senate proposal, and at least using those 2 as metrics, it seemed like the lab sector sort of made it through. What are you hearing in terms of this next phase of trying to get the doc fix done? Do we rest a little -- do we seem like we're in a little better spot than maybe we look like 6 months ago?","Robert A. Hagemann","A.J., I think everything's still up in the air at this point, whether it be co-pays, deductibles or reimbursement changes. Obviously, we don't think any of those are appropriate for our industry. We feel as though we've made some pretty significant contributions in terms of givebacks, and in addition, we want to make sure that whatever is done isn't counter-productive in trying to drive down the total cost of care because as we've said repeatedly in one of our arguments is that while this is a very small piece of the total spend, it has a very significant influence on treatment of physicians in the total cost of care. And you don't want to be penny-wise and pound-foolish here. So we're continuing to make our case. We think we have a good one, but I would tell you that it's still up in the air as to what the outcome is going to be with respect to the permanent doc fix.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, I appreciate that you guys don't have significant large contracts up for renewal over the next 12 months, but I had understood, at least, that maybe an opportunity for you guys was that the Horizon contract, which you're not in now, was up for grabs, and that we might even hear something by year-end. I personally haven't heard anything. Have you guys heard any update on that, any thoughts?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, you know, if I hear, I will let you know. And we are always working with our health plans and trying to meet their needs. But we haven't heard anything from them either.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One follow-up question on guidance. So just to clarify, is the additional, I think, compensation, Surya, for your retirement included in the 2012 numbers or not?","Robert A. Hagemann","No, it's not. That's being treated as a special item, just like it was in this quarter. And as we said, back at the end of Q3, we expect that to be about $14 million in total. There was roughly $6 million that went through this quarter. The remainder will go through in the first half, certainly before May next year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So just to make sure that we get all the line items right, and I know it's a follow-up on a question that was asked before, but it just seems that your guidance seems very conservative, and I want to make sure that we're not missing anything. So is really most of what's, I would say, the headwind to your guidance are below the EBIT line? Is that kind of like a correct way to look at it?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, Ricky, to try and put it in perspective for you, one, we've talked about the tax rate a little bit, so you want to make sure you're using the correct tax rate. The other topic that we've covered in a couple different forms this morning is the share repurchases. While we are going to do some share repurchases, they will be more modest than they have been this past year. And we're not expecting the weighted average shares outstanding to change much from this year because the share repurchases that we will do will pretty much offset the shares issued in connection with employee benefit plans this year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then recently, we've heard some discussion on formularies for lab testing. Can you elaborate a little bit on this? Have you seen formularies being implemented, and do you think this is going to affect where the future will be and what your role will be in setting and managing those formularies?","Robert A. Hagemann","Ricky, we have not seen that, really, anywhere at this point. Certainly, as we've talked to accountable care organizations and the like, we're trying to understand how we can work with them to not only manage their laboratory costs but more importantly, manage the total cost of care. And that really means getting the right testing to the right person at the right time and then using the data that's generated from that to make informed decisions and oftentimes, marrying that with other data. We haven't really, in those discussions, had much conversations about lab formularies. Although you may have heard it someplace, we have not.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Gavin Weiss in for Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. You discussed moderating trends in physician office visits and the various data sources that are out there. We saw an improvement in our December volumes based on our survey. I was wondering if maybe you could talk about how much you think this is a moderating trend versus are you seeing benefits from patients heading to the doctor before deductible resets in January. I know there's been a lot of anecdotal commentary on higher deductible plans in 2012. What do you think about this trend?","Robert A. Hagemann","It's really hard to gauge, quite frankly. We don't know for sure why patients either go or choose not to go to the doctor, particularly in any one month. And December is a very difficult month to predict anything off of. As you point to, there's typically this trend either in the fourth quarter or particularly in December where people are going in, trying to get their visits in prior to potentially higher co-pays, higher deductibles or more cost shifting in the next year. And there's been some speculation that that might be more pronounced this year as a result of expectations for further cost shifting in 2012. But it's really hard to gauge. I mean, it's speculation. I don't think anybody has any good data on that.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I guess you're not going to give us an update on maybe how January trends are going on then?","Robert A. Hagemann","No, we typically don't provide any information on how volumes are trending within a quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Bonello.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill Bonello with RBC. I would like to follow up on, I guess, the topic that A.J. and Ricky were sort of hitting you on, and maybe I can try asking the question in a slightly different way because frankly, I think it's the most important question as we try and assess where you're heading. And I appreciate that hopefully, you have set an EPS guidance that is meetable and maybe even beatable. But a couple of things. I guess just point-blank, would you expect operating income to grow year-over-year in 2012? Is that your expectation?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, if you have revenue growing and you have the operating income percentage growing, by definition, operating income grows.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Well, I would have thought so, too. So then my next question would be I understand what you're saying about less share repurchase, but you're saying shares essentially flat. I understand what you're saying about some people may be getting a little carried away in their interest expense projections, but I can't imagine that interest expense will be more year-over-year if you're paying down debt. So it would seem to me like the only real explanation for your expectation that EPS would be down year-over-year to flat would have to be the difference in the tax rate. I mean, is there any other item that actually puts pressure on EPS?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, I think you've identified most of them, and tax rate is an important piece of it, yes.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then this will be my last question. Can you make it a little easier for us instead of, \"Hey, go into the footnote and pick out one of the tax rates that we used to adjust our earnings,\" and just say, \"Hey, here's what we kind of think the effective tax rate will be in 2012 versus what it was in the 2011\"?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, Bill, without giving you the specific tax rate that we have in our guidance, what I would point out to you is in Footnote 2, there's a rate which we use. It's sort of an overall blended effective rate of 38.7%, which we used to tax-effect the number of items there. In that range is what you should be thinking.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And what was the effective rate this year?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, the effective rate this year is impacted by a lot of things, particularly the government settlement and the like. And overall, it was 35.7%, but you can't use that as a proxy for what it would be going forward.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No, no, I get that. But we're getting -- on the tax item, we're getting a couple hundred basis points of sort of pressure on net earnings from just how you're looking at effective taxes for comparing year-over-year growth.","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So your guidance kind of understates actually, I think, the health of the business. That's all I was trying to figure out.","Operator","We have a question from Dane Leone.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Macquarie Capital. Could you just give us an idea on the pacing of the debt paydown? Is this going to be mostly in the first quarter or second quarter?","Robert A. Hagemann","Dane, I would tell you that it will most likely be over the course of the year. It won't be first quarter, second quarter. It's really going to be a function of how cash flows are trending. While we do have some debt, a big chunk of debt that's due in May, we will likely draw on some short-term revolvers and the like to fund some of that paydown and then use cash from operations to fund the rest and then, over the course of the year, get the debt level to where we're suggesting.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","The maturity in May is somewhere around $500 million, right?","Robert A. Hagemann","Correct.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just on the gross margins, they're very strong in the fourth quarter. How should we think of just within the operating line? Do you expect that trend to persist as you continue to benefit from Celera and higher-margin Athena business maybe offset just by the sales cost on the SG&A line?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, I would, again, caution anybody to look at any one quarter and extrapolate there, particularly on a particular line. What I would tell you, though, about cost of sales in SG&A is cost of sales is a line that actually benefits from both the Celera and Athena acquisitions, whereas the SG&A line is increased as a result of them. Net-net, it's a positive to the combined SG&A and cost of sales and neutral generally in operating income after amortization.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Great. And just one follow-up on that. In terms of the contracts with the Managed Care plans and payers for Athena, basically, Athena's testing, where are you at integrating that into the overall umbrella of Quest?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, we're still in the process. We're not expecting there to be much integration with respect to Athena, quite frankly, because of the truly esoteric nature of those tests. BHL, on the other hand, is an opportunity for us to get more on contract because of how frequently that sort of testing is being ordered. And we are doing that. We're expanding contract access for BHL. We're opening up our patient service centers and our logistics, and we believe that, that's actually going to help with the turnaround of BHL. It will take some time, but those are important steps that we're taking there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions here. First, I wanted to just ask, Bob, you talked about some increased CapEx related to IT, and could you just briefly update us on what your plans are there? And are you ultimately moving to a common operating platform? How should we be thinking about your IT platforms at this point?","Robert A. Hagemann","Darren, as we talked about in the discussion of the $500 million cost-reduction program, one of the elements of that is standardizing systems processes and databases. And certainly, an element of the increasing CapEx is going towards that. Yes, I would also tell you, though, that when I look at the CapEx that we had this past year, 2011, there were some things that we put on hold in anticipation of trying -- maybe doing something differently as we went through this cost-reduction program. And as a result, some of the increase that we see next year is also just the catch-up on some deferral of a few items.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess I did have a question about the acquisition model that you, I guess, have with the S.E.D. deal. And could you just update us on how you're thinking about some of the hospital deals that you're looking at? This looks like you have a management contract in place for the hospital lab, and you're picking up the outreach business. Is that something that you think you can replicate elsewhere? And just maybe an update on how you're thinking about working with hospitals.","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, yes, I think it is something that could potentially be replicated elsewhere. I would tell you that we have hospital lab management agreements that have been put in place for -- they've been there for many years and were not put in place in connection with acquisitions. So those are opportunities that we have irrespective of whether or not there's an opportunity to acquire outreach business. But yes, we do think that those are the type of acquisitions that we'll see more of as time goes by. They're relatively small. They are fold-in type acquisitions, and we have a good history of executing against those. And I think hospitals are asking themselves whether or not lab testing is strategic. They all have different views, I guess. But hopefully, there will be more opportunities like this.","Surya N. Mohapatra","But this is a very important subject because as the hospitals buy more doctors, obviously, our hospital business benefits from the reference tests, but also, our capability in IT and our capability in managing laboratories and also our relationship with the health plans gives us an opportunity. So again, if you think about 60% of this market is in the hospital, and working with the health plans and working with the hospitals, we expect to use this as a strategy to go forward. And as Bob said, many hospital CEOs, they have different views. But a lot of people are really interested to see how they can leverage our expertise and, at the same time, get some capital by selling our outreach business.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. Last question, and just forgive the blunt nature of it, but I guess I'm surprised that we didn't see a goodwill write-down in the pathology business. It's down mid-teens over the last couple of years, and I'm sure you've tested the cash flows as you do normally at the end of the period. Can you just give us a sense for what the outlook is for that business, and are you expecting a turnaround? And is that why we didn't get a goodwill write-down?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, first, Darren, you shouldn't think about a likely goodwill write-down there yet. It's part of our clinical testing business. That's a single segment. It's fully integrated, and when we look at that business, the value of it is far in excess of the total carrying value. So you shouldn't be looking for that. Secondly, as we said, it's a business that continues to be under pressure. The whole market is under pressure, not just our AP business. And we are doing some things that we think, over time, will help that. But yes, you have to take a long-term view with respect to this business. It's a very important element of cancer diagnostics overall. Cancer diagnostics is going to be fast-growing, and atomic pathology will be a growing element of it over time as well. And we feel as though we're very well positioned there. No one has the breadth and depth that we have in that area. And while there are some challenges now and we expect that there'll be some pressure, at least for the foreseeable future, we think we're very well positioned for the long term.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Just to remind you. When we bought AmeriPath -- actually, there are 3 elements of AmeriPath. The specialty laboratories is a part of it. Esoteric lab is very well integrated and is very effective.  [indiscernible] diagnostics is doing really well, and it just -- they are now doing pathology. Both AmeriPath and Quest is under pressure, but it is the key element of cancer diagnostics, and it's going to show clearly improved results when we see the insourcing stabilizes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo. Since last quarter, you guys have announced a number of new initiatives: the cost cutting, the share repurchase, the debt paydown and the dividends. Obviously, at the same time, you've got the CEO search going on. So can you maybe talk a little bit about what kind of flexibility the new CEO is going to have to potentially change or augment some of the strategies that you laid out? Or is it going to be a prerequisite for the new CEO to sort of be on board with the strategies that have been laid out so far?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well you know, Gary, first of all, all the things that we're doing, we had it in plan to do in the beginning of the year because -- this has been a multiyear program as far as repositioning Quest Diagnostics to drive esoteric and gene-based testing and putting a $500 million cost-reduction so that we can withstand the cost pressure. And also, when we have finished or at least completed Athena and Celera, along with AmeriPath and Focus, our goal was that we'll spend couple of years in integrating, so we could return majority of the cash to the shareholders. So having said all those things, all the strategic and personal activities we're doing with the management is also in line with the board. We believe that we have a very important strategy. Going forward, the new CEO will leverage the unparalleled access and distribution we have in science and innovation and healthcare IT to drive, along with the routine testing, the esoteric and gene-based testing in cancer, infectious disease and cardiovascular disease and neurological. So from the strategy point of view, we've been building it. Now as far as -- every CEO have their own way of looking at certain things, and he or she is going to work with the board. But there's not a single thing we're doing here which is going to limit the person who is going to drive up this company after I go.","Robert A. Hagemann","And Gary, I'll just add, the entire management team and the board feel very good about the strategy that we've got, and that's what you're hearing here. It doesn't mean that somebody new might not have a different perspective, but really, what you're hearing is our confidence in what we've told you we're going to do.","Operator","We have a question from Amanda Murphy.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","William Blair. I just had a quick question on some commentary you've made previously about sort of your patient service infrastructure and the sales force and you've been working on upgrading the sales force. So curious, it doesn't sound like those 2 areas are a specific focus in terms of the cost cutting. So just looking for an update on where you stand with those 2 initiatives.","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, as I told you that our organic growth strategy, obviously, driving the faster-growing esoteric and gene-based testing but also improving sales effectiveness. And it has taken us couple of years to have the right people in the right place, and our sales force expansion is complete. And obviously, we are helping them in training and support, and I'm happy. And you can -- we're seeing early signs of traction in areas where we say we're going to get focus. So we are not reducing the number of salespeople. But as far as the patient service centers is concerned, as Bob said, that we are looking at how many patient service centers we have in ward areas, and we're trying to optimize so that in some areas, we may have too many and in some areas, we may have too few. But we are going to look at the whole patient service centers demographics as far as convenience and cost point of view.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So how do you guys think about just maintaining service levels done just in that kind of...","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, the first thing we have to do is to make sure that we don't do anything that reduce service level. And the service level is linked to its customer phasing activities, whether it's patient service center, whether it's phlebotomy, whether it is IT services. So those things are -- more or less, we are trying to optimize them, but the reduction of cost is coming from procurement, billing, G&A and all other activities which has a less impact on customer phasing services.","Robert A. Hagemann","And Amanda, if anything, the services that are valued most by our customers are areas where we could potentially invest more, whereas the services that are valued least are the ones that pose opportunities for us.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then just a question, you talked about the SureSwab growth, which was pretty meaningful. I'm just curious, obviously, the physician community likes it. Are payers talking about it? What's kind of the general buzz out there?","Surya N. Mohapatra","I haven't heard anything specific. SureSwab is a new test for gynecological infection. We had a weakness in that area, and women's health is a big focus for us. And I'm very happy that the test volume is up 40%.","Kathleen Valentine","And Amanda, payers were getting reimbursed for SureSwab, so we have no issues or concerns there.","Operator","We have a question from Robert Willoughby.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bob, can you hazard a guess on restructuring cost for 2012?","Robert A. Hagemann","I can't really at this point, Bob. We're not in a position to do that. I think a lot of that's going to be a function of the pacing of the execution of the cost-reduction program.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is the run rate for the fourth quarter a good one to carry forward? It will be something I would think on a quarterly basis, right?","Robert A. Hagemann","There may be -- I will be -- as I said, I'd be very careful taking any one quarter and extrapolating it. A lot of these charges are really driven by decisions, and some of those decisions we'll be able to make will cut across the enterprise. Some of those decisions will be impacting unit by unit. So at this point, yes, I don't have good visibility to tell you how those costs will shake out. But certainly, we'll give you as much information as we can on those costs when we do incur them. And to the degree that we have good visibility a quarter or so out, we can try and provide some information there.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I think maybe like others, I thought the guidance for '12 would have been a little bit higher. And I'm just wondering, is there any correlation between how you gave the guidance and the ongoing CEO search? I would assume a new guy would want to kind of set his own bar here, and have you given him some leeway?","Robert A. Hagemann","No, Bob. I would tell you that we've really not changed our approach to establish that.","Surya N. Mohapatra","And I won't allow him to do that either.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe a last one, I know I'm not going to get an answer on this one, but since you've announced the CEO search and you've been very adamant that the board is onboard with the strategies that you've laid out, but does a response from an inquiry from somebody from the outside come in and ask a few questions about other value-creating alternatives, or is it just radio silent out there?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, we are focused on driving [indiscernible] as far as I'm concerned. Although we are looking for a new CEO, every day, we are working as if I'll be here forever. So that's number one. Because I truly believe that we have built, really, a great company, and we have very unique capabilities. And yes, we have some headwinds, but that's not the reason why one should really abandon strategy. To me, strategy is sticking to it. The board is looking for my successor, and obviously, the person will have some flexibility. But the strategy is built in conjunction with the board, and I'm very proud of the company we built.","Robert A. Hagemann","Bob, I would add to that. I think the best opportunity for us to create value is by effectively executing against that strategy.","Operator","We have a question from Ashim Anand.","Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division","Natixis. Now obviously, Tysabri is a big drug, $1.2 billion a year, and half of it is coming from countries outside U.S., I guess as many as 65 countries. Now if the test were to go with Tysabri, how do you see this happening outside U.S.? You would be collaborating with Biogen and Elan in terms of sales, or how would this work?","Kathleen Valentine","Yes, we will collaborate with Biogen and Elan in distributing the test throughout the world. And as you know, it's an FDA-authorized test and also the test kit. So we would work with them in distributing it worldwide.","Surya N. Mohapatra","By there's a little bit more to this, as you may have pointed out. We are the only company probably in the world who has all this capability, what I call end-to-end capability. We have -- laboratories can develop tests, but they don't have the capability of creating IVD kits. We can create -- we can have by discovery -- from discovery to laboratory developed tests to IVD kits, and then we can work with IVD distributors to distribute to someone else. So I think this strategy of putting together Celera and Focus Diagnostics, along with our Nichols, is really a great opportunity for us going forward because targeted therapy is going to come. You are absolutely right. It's a $1 billion market for Biogen Idec, and I'm very pleased that we were able to collaborate with them, and there's a couple of other things going in that area.","Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division","Part of my next question, you've already answered. But maybe then it's safe to assume that these guys came to you, these pharma companies, biotech companies came to you for this specific is because you had both the product and the service component. Is that a fair thing to assume here?","Surya N. Mohapatra","We are being noticed very differently than before because we have these unique capabilities of developing tests and also making IVD kits and getting it through FDA, so the answer to your question is yes.","Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division","Now in terms of some of the revenue streams in terms of payers, physicians and others grew 13%, which was a little surprising, and hospital and reference lab, also 7%, and then to my surprise, Medicare and Medicaid, also 3%. Now excluding the benefits of Celera and Athena, if you can kind of just give a general commentary on these 3 revenue streams, what was going on and what do you see going forward?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, again, Ashim, some of this is impacted by the acquired revenues of both Celera and Athena. And it's really difficult for us to break out the impact on each of these components for you right here. We don't have that data available to us at the moment. But there's nothing in the payer mix that I would say is a significant trend other than the fact that we did see some declines in the patient volumes there. I think a lot of that was driven by the economy. And otherwise, it's been pretty consistent in terms of the way the payer mix has trended.","Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division","Okay. And finally, your EHR service that you provide to physicians, obviously, is distinguished. I was wondering if you'd like to comment on your giving 85% discount, which I thought was a little high. Maybe if you can comment on the strategy. Maybe this is a market share gain kind of strategy, or physicians are hurting obviously, maybe you want to make most of it. Just what would be the strategy behind the steep discount?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, first of all, this is a grant program, and it is only for 2 years. And this is actually to enhance the adoption of EHRs. As you know, the doctors are the last one to really adopt it. So now we have a product which has been certified for meaningful use. We have 4,400 people are using it. And the various components of that product, whether it is e-prescribing or whether it is clinical rules, all those things have been very well regarded. So our goal is to increase our installed base and have market penetration. So I think this grant program is going to help us. By the way, when it helps us, it also helps us in the diagnostics business because we see whenever anybody has our connectivity, we get more requisition from them, and it also helps the doctors to streamline their operations and get some revenues from the government.","Operator","We have a question from Gary Taylor.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Citigroup. I just had a few quick follow-ups. Bob, on that term loan, am I right that's still L-plus, about 55 basis points, so the effective rate is 1% or less?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I guess at least for my part, given that we've been normalizing the tax rate all year, I see your EPS guidance as applying somewhere between up 3% and 5% on a normalized tax basis, excluding repurchase. Does that make sense to you?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, yes, again, I'm not sure what you mean on a normalized basis. The effective rate for this year is about 3 points lower than what's embedded in the guidance. But the effective rate for this year has a lot of things that are driving it that won't continue.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. I guess my point is to me, the 2012 earnings guidance looks to be up year-over-year if you normalize the tax rate in '11 and you exclude the legal costs and some of the restructuring charges.","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, yes, I think you're right, Gary. As we've said, the operating performance is certainly expected to improve. We're looking for revenue growth, and we're looking for expansion of operating income. So the pure operating earnings, we are expecting to be up versus last year.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. In the fourth quarter, where you really beat me was on gross margin, cost of goods, and I know during the call, you've alluded to, I guess, better gross margin and some of the acquired revenue streams. Is there anything else unusual about the quarter? And I mean, it could be good or bad. I'm not saying unusual as in bad, but just that you're doing a better job on cost of goods, and that's something that carries into '12. Or should I not read too much into the increase in gross margin year-over-year outside of the acquisitions?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, again, I would caution you not to read too much into any one quarter. I think coming into the quarter, we're very conscious on managing costs. I think we've done a good job not only in terms of advancing the $500 million program but really ratcheting down on a day-to-day cost and managing those pretty effectively. I think you're seeing some of that come through. How much of that day-to-day management of cost we can continue at the same rate, there's probably some question around that. But I do feel good about the way we've managed cost overall this past year and think that it's going to certainly help us as we go into 2012. So we've got some good momentum there, and that's only going to be fueled by what we're doing with the longer-term program.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I just wanted to -- I wanted to ask a question on the acquired revenues. So to us, it looks like in '12 -- you'd mentioned this, but Athena, it looks like there's 3 months of revenue that had not yet -- will not have yet anniversary-ed in '12 and about 4.5 months for Celera. To us, that looks like about a benefit of about $76 million of revenue year-over-year, and although  you haven't disclosed it, we thought we found a $90 million revenue number for S.E.D. labs. So combined, both of those look like about a 1% benefit in terms of year-over-year revenue growth. Am I materially off on those?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, you are with S.E.D., Gary. S.E.D. is probably -- the acquired revenue is in the range of $25 million to $30 million.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. Last question, I just want to come back to kind of thinking about routine versus esoteric volumes, and I guess you had said total volumes, up 40 bps, but excluding the positive weather impact, essentially flat. We were estimating acquired volumes added maybe 1 point to 1.5 points. And so I'm just trying to think about if routine volumes are still growing high single digit or close to double digit, does that imply that routine testing volumes on an organic basis are still down 3% or 4%, 5% year-over-year?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Gary, just to clarify, when you said that you were estimating acquisitions added 1 point to volumes, the volume impact of the Celera and the Athena acquisitions is negligible, well less than 0.5%, and almost all of the benefit from the revenue growth shows up in revenue per requisition there. So back to your point, though, I would tell you that when you look at the routine volumes, they have been down year-over-year, but not to the degree that you've estimated there.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It sounds like my math, be like maybe more like down 1 or 2 based on what you said about the acquired volume.","Robert A. Hagemann","That's more in line, yes.","Operator","We have a question from Steven Valiquette.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve Valiquette of UBS. So just 2 questions for me. I guess first, is there any update on where everything stands on the potential repeal of the component of the Stark Law that allows physicians self-referral of lab testing? And then the second question is kind of along those lines, but as far as your anatomic pathology volume trends for all of 2011, any chance you can provide that growth number, or do we have to wait for the 10-K to come out to get that?","Kathleen Valentine","On the first part of your question, Steve, there is no update. We continue to work with our legislators in Washington to effect change. We do have access to certain congressmen and women to educate them on the impact that self-referral has in a physician's office not only on the cost of the test but also the utilization of testing. So that work continues, but there's nothing notable to report on that front.","Robert A. Hagemann","Kathleen, the other question was about the AP trends. Is the data out there yet and if not, when?","Kathleen Valentine","Oh, yes. Steve, the information is out on the annual revenues that we post. It's out on the IR website. If you look at supplemental analysis, it's available there, too.","Operator","Our final question comes from Bryan Brokmeier.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","This is Bryan from Maxim Group. Should your issued shares for employee benefit plans in 2012 be similar to 2011?","Robert A. Hagemann","Generally in line. I'm not expecting that it'll be dramatically different.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. So based on where your shares are currently trading and, Bob, the $200 million in cash available you mentioned for share repurchases and tuck-in acquisitions, your share count should increase in 2012, correct?","Robert A. Hagemann","We're not expecting it to increase much. But yes, we're expecting it to be pretty close to the weighted average share count that we've got now.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Bob, you mentioned on some other questions earlier on the restructuring charges, you said to the extent you have visibility one quarter in advance, you'll provide that on the restructuring charges. Do you have any visibility on the first quarter charges, any range?","Robert A. Hagemann","Not meaningful visibility at this point other than the CEO succession costs, which we've said are going to be about $8 million or so.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on that note, Surya, are you still planning to replace -- sorry, do you expect to replace Surya within the next 3 months? Because so the 6 months from when you announced the process brings us to April. So is that still the plan?","Surya N. Mohapatra","That's the plan.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so we should maybe be expecting to see a new CEO announcement anytime now? Or how long do you estimate is sufficient time for a smooth transition to the new CEO?","Surya N. Mohapatra","Well, as I said, the board is actively conducting the search. This is the top priority. And the most important thing is to find the right person who will take this company to greater heights in the next 5 to 7 years. So I don't have any information, but by April 30, we'll have a new CEO.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter Full Year Conference Call.

Go ahead, please.","Shawn Bevec","Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we\u2019ll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.","For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, references to adjusted operating income for all periods now excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates.","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, this morning, I\u2019ll discuss the first quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results.","Well we\u2019re off to a good start in 2019; for the first quarter, we grew revenues despite one less revenue day and significant reimbursement pressure. Reported EPS was $1.20, down 5% from the same period of 2019. Adjusted EPS was $1.40, down 8%. We\u2019re pleased with our revenue and adjusted EPS results given the expectations we shared with you in mid-February. Volume growth was very strong at 3.6%, so Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow share and deliver revenue growth.","Performance in the quarter reflects volume growth from expanded network access, acquisitions, improving performance in our hospital reference business, and favorable weather. We\u2019ve made progress in the quarter despite significant reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions.","As we shared before, Quest is poised for growth based on three fundamental changes in the marketplace. First, PAMA driven reimbursement pressure is a catalyst for structural change. Reimbursement experience in the first quarter is in line with the expected 10% reduction in Medicare rates and we expect a similar reduction in 2020. We also said the impact of these cuts will be more significant on smaller, independent, and hospital outreach laboratories. We believe the cuts could potentially eliminate the majority of their profit and will provide a catalyst for market consolidation.","Just in this quarter, the nation\u2019s largest nursing home lab operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The company provided clinical laboratory testing services to more than 12,000 facilities in more than 35 states. According to the press reports, PAMA was cited as a major reason for bankruptcy as the Medicare cuts wiped out the company\u2019s slim profits and caused it to cut back services.","Second, payers are more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend, which supports our plan to gain share. This is clearly evidenced by the opening of major health plan contracts at the large national laboratories, which provides the best value and quality for patients, physicians, and payers. We\u2019re very pleased to be named a UnitedHealthcare Preferred Lab Network provider effective July 1, 2019, meeting exceptional criteria for access, costs, data, quality, and service. Quest and our AmeriPath subsidiary were two of only seven labs selected to participate in the Preferred Lab Network.","Finally, nobody cares more about the variation in healthcare costs than the employers and their employees, the country\u2019s largest payers. Increasingly, patients are motivated to find high quality and service providers with low prices like Quest Diagnostics. More and more we\u2019re seeing evidence of increasing price transparency in the lab marketplace. Massachusetts has been a leader in price transparency by launching its own website to help consumers understand the wide variation in healthcare cost.","During Governor Charlie Baker\u2019s recent visit to our Marlborough lab, we pledged our continued support to Massachusetts\u2019 efforts to help consumers understand the true cost of care. We are well positioned to benefit from these trends, which will serve as a catalyst for Quest to continue to gain share.","Our strategy to accelerate growth has five elements: Grow more than 2% per year through accretive, strategic in-line acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally support population health in data analytics and extended care services.","Let me take you through several highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. Recall, we shared in our initial guidance that we carried over 1% growth into the year. The nine deals we announced and closed since the beginning of 2018 positioned as well to meet our M&A growth targets in 2019, including our recently completed acquisition of the clinical laboratory services business of Boyce and Bynum.","Our pipeline remains strong, and we\u2019re having several conversations with health systems evaluating their hospital outreach lab strategy. We delivered strong organic growth through the quarter, thanks to the best access to insured lives this company has had in over a decade. In January, we saw a rise in volume attributable to health plans, where we recently gained access and the year-over-year growth rate accelerated throughout the quarter. We\u2019re working hard to educate a whole new group of physicians on the Quest value proposition, but it does take time. As we said, gaining market share through expanded network access will be a gradual process. ","So we\u2019re pleased by the progress we\u2019re making in our access improvement as well as we\u2019re making progress in our hospital reference testing, which reflects our recent PLS relationships and reference testing wins. Trends in our reference testing business has shown improvement relative to last year. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included tuberculosis testing, Cardio IQ, drug monitoring, and hemepath blood cancer testing, all of which showed strong revenue growth for the quarter.","QuestDirect, our consumer initiating testing service is being well received by consumers who are looking to take charge of their health. Our offerings are popular across the entire demographic spectrum, with the largest percentage of consumers coming from the 25 to 34-year-olds. Earlier this month, we launched three new STD test packages allowing with consumers to get tested at their discretion.","The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Construction of our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey is well underway. The lab builds on the success of our Lab of the Future at Marlborough, Massachusetts, incorporating innovative uses of building design and automated technology to provide a broad range of advanced diagnostic and information services to more than 40 million people. We expect the lab to be operational in 2021. We also continue to drive increases in productivity. We have rebalanced resources and reduced expenses in some areas while ensuring we have the operational resources needed to deliver on the volume growth that we see.","Productivity gains have enabled us to effectively manage our headcount growth. So here are a few proof points. We\u2019re seeing improved electronic order rates as we increase volume from the expanded network access which improves our lab productivity. We continue to re-enable our enterprise workflow, which has allowed us to reduce the number of specimen pickups and the number of client calls through acquisitions to our call centers. We\u2019ve also driven increases in our supplies efficiency.","And then finally, our labor productivity gains have enabled us to reduce our labor cost per acquisition in the first quarter while providing salary increases for our front-line employees.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark, who will bring you through the financial performance. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.89 billion, up 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 0.5% compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth and favorable weather, partially offset by increasing reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 3.6% versus the prior year.","Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 2.4%. Favorable weather in the first quarter provided a tailwind of roughly 50 basis points. However, there was approximately one less revenue day in the quarter that negatively impacted volume growth by roughly 120 basis points.","Revenue per acquisition in the first quarter declined by 3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by increasing reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. Year price headwinds were consistent with our expectations at approximately 2.5%. This concludes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of slightly less than 120 basis points.","Note, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the current lab fee schedule as well as modest indirect price changes for Medicaid and then small number of floating rate contracts. Reported operating income was $248 million, a 13.2% of revenues, compared to $272 million or 14.5% of revenues last year.","On an adjusted basis, operating income was $286 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was attributable to one less revenue day in the quarter, higher reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions.","Reported EPS was $1.20 in the quarter, compared to $1.27 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.40, down approximately 8% from $1.52 last year, which is roughly in line with the expectations we shared last quarter. Cash provided by operations was $275 million in the first quarter versus $180 million last year. Capital expenditures were $47 million compared to $73 million a year ago.","Now turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our outlook for 2019 as follows. Revenues expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than $5.16 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.40. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million.","I\u2019d like to leave with a few reminders as you think about the remainder of 2019. First, we continue to expect more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year. This headwind should be relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Second, we continue to expect that volumes will gradually increase as we progress through 2019, just as we saw through the first quarter. Third, the Easter and passover holidays falling entirely in April will create a modest year-over-year headwind in the second quarter. Fourth, we have approximately one extra revenue day in the third quarter. Finally, we expect the strongest revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 because of an easier comparison.","I\u2019ll now turn it back to Steve","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we\u2019re off to a good start in 2019. While our industry faces significant reimbursement pressure. We are pleased with our results in the quarter. We\u2019re driving volume and market share based on being a network of approximately 90% of the commercial insured lives in the United States. We believe we are well positioned to meet our commitments in 2019.","With that, we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. So, for my one question\u2026","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Dan Leonard","Good morning. Steve, you made the comment that the volume growth accelerated throughout the quarter. I was hoping you could elaborate on the monthly performance, I\u2019m thinking that it will maybe help us as we think about volume growth accelerating throughout the year.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Thank you, Dan. Well, first of all, as we said going into the year, we expect that we\u2019ll have initial pickup in the first month in January given all the work we did in 2018 to get the word out about our access changes, and we did see that. And then also what we said at the beginning of this year is we do expect that it will continue to build, and it continued to build in Q1 so we saw an improvement in February and also in March. But equally, we expected it to continue to gradually build throughout the year, so as we\u2019ve said, this is a nice growth opportunity for us in 2019, but we see an opportunity in 2020 and 2021.","Dan Leonard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, Ross.","Mark Guinan","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Muken","So maybe starting on United, obviously, pretty exciting news yesterday you highlighted in terms of getting selected in their PLN. I guess one, now that this sort of is formalized, I guess, how do you think other payers will look at this given sort of the known savings someone like yourself can kind of drive for consumers, members, plans, all included, given your scale and sort of cost advantage? And then, how would you sort of characterize the conversations you\u2019re having with some of the other Managed Care peers and some of the blues who could probably easily do something similar to what United is doing today?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Thanks, Ross. Well, first of all, we\u2019re excited to be part of the Preferred Lab Network. As we mentioned in our comments, we\u2019re two out of seven. So very tight network and this will start on July 1, however, the word is out. And as you all know, the word was out when we announced that we\u2019re back in network last year. So we\u2019ve had quite a lot of interest from other national payers about what this means to some of the large regionals. And needless to say, we think it\u2019s the beginning of a trend that we would like to continue to see in other relationships that we have.","What this means will become more clear as we get into it, but what we indicated clearly there will be incentives for physicians and patients in the benefit designs to move more of the volume through the high-value lab providers like Quest Diagnostics. Second is we need to continue to perform. So, we are high-quality lab, both in service and in quality, we\u2019ll be providing statistics quarterly to demonstrate that.","And then finally, we\u2019ll continue to move with the opportunities we see in the marketplace to consolidate the marketplace and pick up share, which will include continuing to work on our hospital strategy, picking up share for some of those hospital outreach labs. So, we think this is a good first step in a trend that will continue. It\u2019s not going to be just with United but other payers will follow.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So Ross, if I could just add quickly because I think it\u2019s certainly important. In the past, there were health plans that had preferred providers in the lab space, and obviously in other areas. And a lot of that was generally around price, so who\u2019s willing to give me the lowest price and I\u2019ll call them and provide a preferred provider. In this case, contracts were negotiated separate from this decision that United just made. Obviously, everyone\u2019s prices are determined by individual negotiations. And this is really about evaluating the value that you bring.","So yes, price is an important component. But when we looked at the application and, as Steve shared, access, service and quality are the things that drive value. And as we\u2019ve been talking about for a while, we feel we are positively differentiated versus most of the market and here is an acknowledgment by a large payer, obviously, agreeing with that and then getting behind that by naming us as one of those preferred providers so that consumers of our services, both the patient and the physician, will recognize that. Because obviously, it\u2019s hard for them to know and see and compare across the various options that they have.","So we\u2019re very excited about this because this is not a price play. This is about the value you\u2019re offering on many parameters, and we are well down the road in conversations with several other nationals on similar concepts and so they recognize as well this is an opportunity to bring better value into the members.","Steve Rusckowski","And Ross, one of the things that I wanted to make clear, just based on some questions that I was receiving last night, is that we are \u2013 there\u2019s no additional contracted change or price change for us to be in the Preferred Lab Network. We have contracted rates with United and those are the rates that we\u2019ll live with them in the Preferred Lab Network. So there\u2019s no additional step down. ","Ross Muken","And maybe just quickly as a follow-up, I mean what does this do to the competitive landscape? I mean, you talked about a bankruptcy, obviously, between sort of the PAMA pressures and maybe volumes narrowing to fewer and fewer players on the lab side with yourselves and maybe your largest peer probably benefiting the most. I guess, how do you see this landscape kind of evolving competitively at least among the independents over maybe the next three or five years?","Steve Rusckowski","So Ross, it just comes backs to, we think we have a unique setup in our industry to gain share. PAMA is the big change and it changed the underlying profitability of the industry. When we were at our Investor Day, we talked about roughly half the profit coming out of the industry and whenever you take half the profit out of any industry, you\u2019re going to see consolidation and we\u2019re the market leader and we\u2019re going to consolidate. Second is you do see now with the Preferred Lab Network for United and what Mark just said about other payers following, there will be tighter purchasing with the payers.","And then finally, this is driven in part by members pushing back on the high cost of healthcare and the movement to more transparency with much more visibility and wide variation in health care cost. And Quest Diagnostics is really second to none in terms of our quality or service and at very, very competitive prices. So we believe this is a different place at a different time and we\u2019ve gotten an opportunity to pick up share.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just one on M&A. Can you give us an update on some of the recent larger acquisitions like Shiel? How that\u2019s trending against your deal model? And then just on the pipeline, can you talk about how that\u2019s trending versus maybe late last year? Are you kind of seeing that long-awaited inflection point in the consolidation pieces on the lab side?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, Mark, why don\u2019t you take the Shiel?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So Shiel \u2013 I don\u2019t know you referenced [indiscernible] since we closed Shiel more than a year ago but we don\u2019t specifically comment on individual deals. But what we have said is that we\u2019re very confident in our ability to integrate acquisitions especially around the core lab space whether its outreach or regional lab like Shiel. So we\u2019re pleased with our progress and certainly, it\u2019s contributing to some of our growth.","So this is something we\u2019ve gotten really good at over the last several years. We\u2019ve got it institutionalized in our organization. We\u2019ve got a team that spends time dedicated on these integrations. We got a playbook and we roll out every time that we do one of these deals. And largely what we\u2019re really doing is we\u2019re just moving that volume into our existing infrastructure be in our draw centers or logistics or laboratory.","So as we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s pretty much always a cost play, it\u2019s the easiest one to deliver. So we\u2019re very confident in our ability to deliver those synergies and then importantly, because of all the things we talked about around our service and our quality and the amount of attention we pay to these integrations, we have been successful in maintaining a vast majority of that volume. So we\u2019re confident in what we do going forward based on our ability that we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last couple of years.","Steve Rusckowski","And Patrick, the second part of your question has to do with our funnel and activity and just in general is more interest of particularly, I think, you\u2019re referring to hospitals \u2013 hospital outreach laboratories selling their business. If you go back a year ago, what we\u2019ve said is PAMA was announced in the first year of payment cuts and what it says in our travels is that very few hospital CEOs were aware of PAMA back a year ago.","That has changed, made more are aware of it, it\u2019s been getting much more visible. What we continue to push in terms of having to think through our \u2013 their lab strategy is continue to get traction. And so we\u2019re in active dialogues, as I said in our prepared \u2013 my prepared remarks with a number of systems around their lab strategy, which includes outreach. Now you couple PAMA with what you\u2019re hearing about the payers putting pressure on the Preferred Lab Network and as you know, the most significant price differential is typically with hospital outreach labs.","So when we have this conversation, clearly you hear about PAMA, it\u2019s certainly \u2013 potentially a 30% cut for their Medicare business, which will also see pressure on the payer side. And then thirdly is they are hearing from their physicians that their patients are pushing back on their high out-of-pocket cost. So in general, this is putting more logs on the fire of consolidation and our hospital strategies is in the works of getting more and more opportunities in front of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser","Hi. Good morning. So I have a follow-up question on the United network. Just to clarify, did you factor in any contribution from the preferred network in the second half guidance? And the second part of the question, kind of, like, when we look at all the other labs that are included, most of them seem to be focused on specialty testing. So are there also economic incentives to patients who would opt to come to Quest on their routine side? Just kind of, like, trying to understand the incentives that United is providing consumers to come to Quest over some other regional routine providers.","Mark Guinan","So Ricky, let me just address the guidance and then I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve. As you know, we have a pretty broad range of 1% to 3%. So there\u2019s a lot of different things that come to play in that. So what I would say at this point is in order to meet our guidance, certainly, somewhere in the middle, we\u2019re not counting on significant volume coming from the Preferred Lab Network. Obviously, at this point, we don\u2019t know yet know the details. United has not announced those details.","So we\u2019re awaiting that. We\u2019re optimistic and hopeful that it\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to have some significant impact. But you naturally expect that would grow and certainly probably more in 2020. We could get some benefit in 2019. But we need to wait until they announce exactly it\u2019s going to work, what those details are and so forth. So we\u2019re not counting on a kind of volume lift in the back half from the Preferred Lab Network.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. If you look at the seven, what we mentioned as two are Quest and that\u2019s Quest in general and then our AmeriPath subsidiary, which is our anatomic pathology business. If we see \u2013 you see two from Bio-Reference and so if you look at the list of seven, essentially what you find is two national laboratories broadly and Bio-Reference within reason for, let\u2019s say, the general diagnostics and then all of us for intensive purposes compete in the what we refer to as advanced diagnostics.","The specifics of incentives around that are still to be defined by United. And when we have more that we can share with you, we will. But clearly, it will drive at least incentives in place to drive volume from the general diagnostic side as well as the advanced diagnostics side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Hynes","Good morning. Good morning. So I just wanted an update on some of the operational trends from last year that were issued, maybe bad debt, drugs or abuse and vitamin C testing, it seemed to have stabilized. And also quickly, can you let me know how much of the one less day impacted organic volume growth? What it would have been without that headwind? Thanks.","Mark Guinan","Yes. As I shared in, we estimated about 120 basis points of impact from one less day and I also shared, we\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s not precise but pretty much picked that up in the third quarter. So there\u2019s the offset for the year. In terms of bad debt, I think you\u2019re referring to patient concessions. Our bad debt actually was slightly up. This year, we had one bankruptcy within our client bill business that impacted our bad debt in the quarter. Certainly not a trend, it\u2019s kind of a one-off.","But patient concessions, probably about a 50 basis point headwind. And what we\u2019re really seeing is some of the patient responsibility trends that we saw in the latter half of last year, we\u2019re now carrying it forward with the expectation that, that ratio will continue. So therefore, our expectation would be in the first half we have some headwinds around patient concessions and then assuming that things don\u2019t change dramatically within the marketplace in 2019 that in the back half maybe we get some of that back.","So that\u2019s what I would frame the \u2013 some of the trends. Around drugs of abuse, we did get some recent news that the national payer that had been denying same day of service were the presumptive and definitive testing and the reimbursement has changed and we haven\u2019t got the definitive date when that\u2019s going to be implemented. But we have got a confirmation writing for them that they\u2019re going to change that. So that was certainly good news.","And then in terms of lapping some those changes, we are beyond when they started. So from a year-over-year comparables, they\u2019re behind us. And then the big payer change last year in Q2 on vitamin D, obviously, we\u2019ve lapped that as well now that we\u2019re in the second quarter but it was a headwind in Q1 certainly for us. We\u2019ve also shared that Aetna is going to move to that similar approach for screening of vitamin D. However, with Aetna, there is a difference because we can bill the patient.","Whereas with the other payer, we just had to do the test for free, which is just something we\u2019re working on with that payer. But as per the contract, we were not able to revert to a patient bill. So while Aetna certainly were not thrilled that they\u2019re moving to a similar policy, it\u2019s not going to be as much of a headwind as it was with the other payer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Jack.","Mitch Petersen","Thank you. This is actually Mitch Petersen, on for Jack this morning. Just being curious where volumes fell relative to your expectations in the quarter in \u2013 both from a share gain perspective but also just from a utilization environment perspective? And in your view, do you think that utilization environment in the first quarter actually picked up relative to 2018?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Well, I\u2019ll start with utilization. As Mark talked about where volumes fit in with what we expected in the quarter, but utilization is stable. As we said in the past, we look at this on a different directions as you all do and from what we can tell, utilization in general is stable and that\u2019s \u2013 I would argue for our physician business and not hospital business as well as our hospital business. Mark, volumes relative to what we expected?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So as you know, we had guided to flat to down, we actually grew revenue. So volumes were slightly above our expectations. I would attribute a large part of that to weather. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we can\u2019t predict the weather. So we always kind of take an average level of weather and build that into our expectations and into our guidance, and we had 50 basis points of favorable weather this year.","So as Steve said, we\u2019re very pleased with volumes. We had expected a significant lift. If you adjust for the one fewer day, even more impressive volume growth, certainly, something we\u2019ve not seen in a long, long time at Quest, especially on the organic side. So meeting our expectations and finally, a little bit better literally because of the weather.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, Kevin. Good morning.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning, guys. So kind of just following up there. If we net-net for the weather and the one less day, it looks like underlying organic growth was about 3.1% even though reported was 2.4%. Did I do my math right there, Mark?","Mark Guinan","Close enough, Kevin, yes.","Kevin Ellich","Okay. Good. And then just wanted to see if you can help us quantify how much of the organic growth came from expanded network access to United and BlueCross BlueShield of New Jersey? And then did you see any volume loss from your Aetna business?","Mark Guinan","Sorry. any volume loss from what?","Steve Rusckowski","Aetna.","Kevin Ellich","From Aetna.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So obviously, we\u2019re not going to get into specific payers but the lift didn\u2019t all come from the new access. We certainly have seen growth in some of the other payers really across the board in the regions that are growing as one might expect because as we go in and talk about our broad access, we\u2019re winning accounts. And so those accounts obviously are bringing with them volume from the payers with whom we recently gained access but obviously we\u2019re getting some volume as well.","We did expect and we did see some losses in Aetna. It\u2019s within our expectations and our outlook, and actually it stabilized throughout the quarter. So we saw something early and then since then, actually we\u2019ve won some of that back and it\u2019s not only not that gotten any worse but actually got a little bit better. So that\u2019s about as much detail, Kevin, as I can go into in terms of the access changes.","Steve Rusckowski","Next question, operator.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi, it\u2019s Kevin Caliendo. Thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about gross margin that was a little bit lighter than we had anticipated despite a little bit better pricing. Was it mix? Was it patient concessions? It\u2019s not hugely meaningful but it just caught my eye.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So I don\u2019t know what your expectations were, Kevin. To be fair, gross margin wasn\u2019t significantly different than what we were expecting. The actual \u2013 the only area that was a little bit off our expectations was in SG&A. But there\u2019s actually a geography issue in there that I want to make sure people understand. We have some portfolio investments related to the retirement plan that we have and the accounting dictates that if there\u2019s gains or losses in that portfolio that you can either have expense or offset to expense above or below the line.","We actually had $9 million of expense above the line. There\u2019s an offset in other expense below line. So there\u2019s no impact to our net earnings and our EPS and so forth. It\u2019s a geography issue. But that didn\u2019t inflate our SG&A $9 million relative to what we would have expected based on these investments. And last year, we had about $0.5 million actually decrease. So it\u2019s a significant change year-over-year, about 50 basis points of impact. So I just wanted to make sure people understand, naturally geography, it\u2019s not any sort of a trend in our SG&A. But from a gross margin standpoint, we were pretty much where we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning, guys. Congratulations. Mark, just to follow-up on that. As I think about the ramp in earnings over the course of the year, how should we be thinking about gross margin? And then I know, last quarter, you laid out a cost-cutting initiative that I think kicks in the second quarter. So if you don\u2019t mind just walking us through the progression of that over the course of the year. Thank you.","Mark Guinan","Sure. So when you think of the determinants of gross margin, obviously, it\u2019s price, which is pretty much set for the year. As we\u2019ve said that $200 million of pricing headwinds should cycle pretty at least proportionally over the four quarters. Obviously, not every quarter is equal in terms of the volume. In terms of mix, we\u2019ve had a trend but we will see if that continues in terms of better test mix as our advanced diagnostics grows faster than our routine business. But we also have some of that offset through our PLS business as well. So mix can be a driver that goes both directions, we\u2019ll see.","And then the other one that I\u2019d point to is certainly volume within a quarter. So when we talk about one fewer day having about 60 basis points of impact in the first quarter on our margins because in a short period of time, a lot of our costs are fairly fixed. That\u2019s not all SG&A. Some of that is in cost of sales. When you think about our Patient Service Centers within a short period of time, that\u2019s a fairly fixed cost. Our logistics and even somewhat some of our laboratory expense, although obviously reagents and some labor are variable.","So other determinant certainly as we get that extra day back in the third quarter, that\u2019s going to be a tailwind to our gross margin, not just our overall margins and so we have one fewer day in the first quarter was a headwind to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright","Hi, thanks. How much of the outcome units Preferred Lab Network was previously contemplated and or any of the labs are number of labs included surprise relative to your initial expectations. And then on the PAMA side, is there any sort of update on the industry efforts around PAMA release. And I guess any sort of meaningful movement on that front? And should it be assumed that any sort of relief would occur in 2021 or how should we be thinking about timing?","Mark Guinan","Let me take the Preferred Lab Network and then Steve will address the PAMA. So as I mentioned, we didn\u2019t contemplate significant change and that obviously would be positive for 2019 in our guidance because we don\u2019t have the details yet. In terms of the number of labs that have been included, we didn\u2019t know. Obviously, we knew the bar was pretty high because we filled out the application, and we certainly have enough sense around the industry, and we knew it would be difficult for a lot of people to meet the criteria around service, access and quality","So we were, I guess pleasantly surprised but not completely surprised that it\u2019s a fairly short list because of what United\u2019s looking for in terms of the requirements. So that\u2019s kind of where we stand and once we hear from United, some of the details, we\u2019ll be able to comment more about exactly what this means and how quickly we think it will become a tailwind and to what extent. In terms of PAMA.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So we are \u2013 as far as PAMA, as we\u2019ve said, we are planning on the worse and working to get a better outcome. So what we\u2019ve planned in our guidance and what we\u2019ve planned in our outlook assumes the full impact of PAMA through 2021. Excuse me, 2020. And what\u2019s happening as we speak is actually today, they\u2019re hearing of a oral argument of our appeal. If you recall the District Court that saw on our case, decided not to rule on it because of jurisdiction issues, we appealed that and so we\u2019re having our oral argument today. That will be heard. They will digest that and make a decision. But if it\u2019s a favorable outcome in our behalf then we\u2019ll be able to court begin, the senses that we\u2019ll hear something this year and our argument and then the case will follow thereafter.","Second is we don\u2019t get a positive outcome then we could appeal in the Supreme Court will cross that bridge when we get to it. In parallel to all that, we continue to push with members of Congress that CMS got it strong. We need to take the time to get it right. We need to make sure that given all the data, because that was what was intended, that was the congressional intent and so we\u2019re working with members of Congress on the legislative fix to make sure that we take the time to get it right.","And essentially, what that would mean is push out the data collection period for some period of time to get the right amount of time for everyone\u2019s future to submit the data. And again, that\u2019d be 2019 data. So the data for first half of 2019 will be what is submitted, but we\u2019re pushing to make sure that\u2019s delayed. So that\u2019s where PAMA stands.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ivy Ma","Hey, good morning. This is Ivy Ma for Derik today. So just wanted to, Steve, if you can get an update on the QuestDirect consumer-facing program there. So any order impact this year or beyond that you can characterize there? And then can we also get an update on the extension into retail partners so far this year. Thank you.","Mark Guinan","Can you speak up with \u2013 on your question regarding QuestDirect? Sorry, we couldn\u2019t hear you.","Ivy Ma","Sorry, just wanted to get an update on that program. Just trying to see if there\u2019s any order impact that we can characterize this year or beyond?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So I would just say, we introduced our new offering for the fourth quarter last year. It\u2019s off to good start. We\u2019re seeing a nice month-to-month progression of growth. Nice adoption in the number of test categories. We did mention in the prepared remarks, our inclusion of a few bundles around sexually transmitted diseases. So we\u2019re pleased with progress so far, and we did contemplate that in our guidance for the full year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Mark Guinan","Good morning.","Bill Quirk","Couple questions. First off, Steve, you talked about pricing transparency in your prepared comments. And this is a topic that you\u2019ve touched on couple of times in the past. I guess bigger picture question here is, how should we think about this rolling out beyond Massachusetts. And then secondly, I guess following-up on Aaron\u2019s question, given that we are into the data collection period second around PAMA, how should we think about the expanded number of participating labs and what that impact might have in the 2021through 2023 period?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. First of all, transparency in general. So the number of national payers, and I would say regional payers too, have pushed on educating their membership on a wide variation of healthcare costs. And yes, it\u2019s about lab and it\u2019s about everything. So a lot of visibility around radiology, a lot of visibility about every kind of procedures. So depending upon who you might have your insurance with, you probably have seen some of us. So that drum has been beaten and that it will continue to beat.","In parallel to that is employers are hearing a lot of pushback from their employees about the cost of health care. We hear it at Quest Diagnostics, and we haven\u2019t talked about it but we actually have done a lot of work to prevent the cost of Quest Diagnostics with their \u2013 our health care costs. And in doing so, where we\u2019ve managed about 50,000 lives, we\u2019ve actually built the cost curve. And the reason for that is employees are pushing back on their employers what they\u2019re paying for out of pocket. So this is a premium cost. It\u2019s a high deductible. So it\u2019s the co-pays and full insurances.","And so they give you a lot of noise and also those patients are pushing back on their physicians and physicians or pushing back on administration. So what I\u2019ll say is this has picked up a lot of steam, and we are encouraged because when you look at the facts, you look at our medical quality, you look at the service performance and you look at our price points, we\u2019re really second to none. And that\u2019s reinforced with the Preferred Network with United Healthcare and there\u2019ll be other payers that follow.","So it will continue. We talked about Massachusetts as the state that has really put more out there, but we think more states will follow and more payers will follow and as more payers go down this path of a Preferred Lab Network, part of this will be around you can get the best quality, best service at the lowest prices from a company like Quest Diagnostics. So it\u2019s going to be one of the opportunities that we take advantage of to pick up share.","Mark Guinan","And I just want to add to that, Bill, that the data collection period is actually in the fall. It\u2019s the work that we do in the first half of 2019 but actually the submission and the collection is later in the year. And as Steve mentioned earlier, we\u2019re working to try to get that delayed because we\u2019re not clear on the changes, the impact of those changes and how much it\u2019s going to expand to the hospital and others that did not submit last time. But we do know and agree that it\u2019s going to be challenging for many of them to comply.","And therefore, that\u2019s why Steve mentioned for the trade association we\u2019re lobbying to get that delated to give them a chance to do that and make sure that it comes in because we see that as the benefit to be more representative of the overall commercial market but also that they can get it done in a quality fashion. So there\u2019s a lot of rationale for slowing this thing down. But it doesn\u2019t happen until later in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Stephen Baxter","So as part of the support act passed late last year, it looks like there\u2019s some provisions that would impact the lab industry\u2019s ability to pay incentive compensation based on sales goals. Can you help us provide some context on how that\u2019s impacting your business today? And whether any changes to your compensation structure would be required if the law remains in effect for the foreseeable future?","Mark Guinan","Yes. Thanks for the question, Stephen. We recognize what you said that it could imply potential impact to the lab industry. At this point, based on the conversations we\u2019ve had, I believe that, that was unintended. So we\u2019re in dialogue around addressing that. So we have not changed anything to our compensation program in response to that, and we\u2019re feeling comfortable. We\u2019re obviously doing the right things to ensure that, that gets amended. That was not the intent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So Steve, when you talked about utilization being normalized in the first quarter, I think many of us have seen United report and MLR below expectations. So can you just maybe define what you think normalizes on a percentage basis?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. The term I\u2019d use is stable. We keep on doing our same-store or same-account measurement when we look at 100 accounts. You know they\u2019re accounts of Quest Diagnostics, and we look at their volumes year-on-year. And we\u2019ve tracked this for years. And what we see is it\u2019s a stable environment, and this is for the nonhospital portion of our market. And equally for the hospital portion, we believe that\u2019s stable as well if you look at the volumes that we see out there in the marketplace. We believe both are stable.","Lisa Gill","Is there a number you can put around that?","Steve Rusckowski","NO, no. Because I would say that it bounces around a little bit. But in general, we\u2019re feeling that, that \u2013 it is within the range of a normal variation that we\u2019ve seen historically. So stable is a good way of characterizing what we see.","Mark Guinan","And I mean, Lisa, I guess the tightest I could quantify it is that we\u2019ve talked about a market that we think volumes are growing about 2% based on demographics and so on, which the given price headwinds pretty much take the revenue growth in the lab market to flat. And so as we look at the overall performance in the first quarter against our expectations and all the factors that play into it, including our competitiveness, there\u2019s nothing that we saw in the first quarter that suggested a significant deviation from what we were expecting in terms of if you would call utilization, the overall market consumption of laboratory services.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.","Matt Larew","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask in terms of the retail strategy, if you can update us in terms of where the footprint stands today. Any plans for additional expansion here in 2019? And then the extent to which you see this strategy actually driving incremental growth and profitability?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Several things. One is when we started with takeaway stores, we\u2019ve shared in the past that, that\u2019s going well. Good results from those stores. Second is we\u2019ve started a joint venture with Walmart. That has been progressively building and results have been very good. As you\u2019ll recall, we started with Texas and Florida, we\u2019re now beyond Texas and Florida. We\u2019re in multiple states. We\u2019re greater than 50 stores, approaching 75 to 80 stores throughout the United States. Again, what we\u2019re finding is that it benefits all stakeholders. We think it\u2019s good for Quest Diagnostics.","And we\u2019ve shared in the past that this is not about our savings in real estate. It\u2019s actually an opportunity for us to get more productive with our phlebotomists as we consolidate those in one location. Second is its better location. So it\u2019s better for employees, it\u2019s also better for our patients that we serve. So they walk again for other purposes to get your script filled, do some grocery shopping, by the way they can stop at Quest. We give them a locator. They walk in the store. They come in conveniently. Many of those people are fasting. So they would like to eat before they leave. So good patient experience.","And then finally, Walmart likes it because it\u2019s more patient volume and it\u2019s a good experience in their stores. And what we\u2019re finding in those ZIP codes where we\u2019ve done this, we do have an opportunity to pick up some share because it\u2019s \u2013 again it\u2019s a much more convenient location for us in that marketplace. So the patient has the choice they\u2019re going to be going to the convenient location. And so what we\u2019re driving to is if you look at the 2,200 Patient Service Centers that we have throughout the United States, we\u2019d like to have about 50% of those Patient Service Centers eventually in more of a retail-like setting.","So it gives you an idea of the extent of our strategy. And when I say that, we already have a retail-like strategy beyond Safeway and the Walmart locations because we\u2019ve already had some of our Patient Service Centers in more of a retail environment than a medical environment. So of \u2013 the progress so far is \u2013 continues to be a good one. We\u2019re encouraged by it and there would be progress made this year.","Mark Guinan","And so just to add to that, Matt, it\u2019s not as much a cost play around the fixed cost because the phlebotomist obviously gets paid the same regardless of where we put them and the overall rent is not that much different. But really is it\u2019s the volume leverage we get. So these are highly productive sites, especially in Walmart. And some of the reasons for that, obviously, as Steve said, it\u2019s great access and convenience but some of our key stakeholders, the payers and the physicians, like that when they hear about, hey this can bring further patient because actually you want them to get the testing done.","So as we talk about being positively differentiated from a vast majority of the market, certainly our retail locations, it\u2019s not all about cost. Some of it is really around getting more volume and being more attractive commercially. And from some of the key stakeholders, we\u2019re influencing or driving those decisions where they want to get their lab work done.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes and as you\u2019ll recall, as part of our strategy, we\u2019re using our data to support population health with extended care services. And so what you\u2019ll hear more of is basic health care services that we\u2019re also providing in those stores to manage a population. More to come on that but it\u2019s beyond draw services for Quest Diagnostics as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro","Good morning, Mark","A -Mark Guinan","Hey. Mark.","Mark Massaro","Good morning. Thanks guys for the questions. When I strip away the headwind of one less day in the quarter and the benefit from weather, I come up with organic volumes of 3.1%. That is above the long-term guide you have of 1% to 3%. So can you just help us think about the sustainability of this trend, especially given that you\u2019ve got one additional day coming in the back half, you have volumes building throughout the year?","And then second part of my question, is there any update to the work you\u2019re doing with HCA in Colorado? And what do you think they need to see the potential to expand that?","Mark Guinan","So the \u2013 to answer your question, Mark, remember the outlook \u2013 four-year outlook I provided was revenue, not volume. And while our volume, if you adjust for the weather and the days, was north of 3%, our revenue was obviously in the single-digit basis points, 10s of basis points, not as high. So I think as we\u2019ve mentioned, we expect that to continue to build. And obviously, in the four-year time frame, we\u2019re expecting to get some of these pricing headwinds significantly lowered, if not eliminated, which will help the revenue relative to the volume. So I think that \u2013 hopefully that answers your question around the outlook and our performance in the first quarter. On HCA, Steve?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. On HCA, we believe that it\u2019s going well. We believe if you ask HCA that question, they would give you the same feedback. Remember, this is in their Continental Division. So it\u2019s actually one of our Professional Lab Services engagements where we help them become more efficient with their hospital laboratories. So we now again demonstrate, now that we\u2019ve been into it for a couple of years, that we are saving them money, and they\u2019re pleased by that and the quality has not anywhere \u2013 way deteriorated. So we\u2019re hopeful, given the success there that we could take that model and try it in some other locations throughout HCA. We\u2019re actively discussing that possibility as you would expect. But no firm indication that they will expand beyond it. But it is a success story for us within very large core profit system.","Mark Guinan","And just to add quickly, I know you all can do the math. With about 40 basis points of revenue growth, if you adjust for the two factors you mentioned, that gets us north of 100 basis points. So in the year when pricing headwinds are obviously extreme, where it hits the low ends, but within that three-year CAGR of revenue growth that I provided at the Investor Day.","Operator","Our last question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Guinan","Hey, Eric.","Eric Coldwell","Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Kind of a three-parter here on Trident and the bankruptcy that you mentioned. First off, I see that they have debtor and possession financing that are still operational. But would you expect to gain volume in a situation like that when a bigger player announces a bankruptcy? Second of all, you did mention a customer bankruptcy in your prepared remarks, if I heard you correctly. I\u2019m curious was that Trident since they are a diversified holding company? And then third, how have you \u2013 just remind us how you\u2019ve generally planned or modeled for higher customer bankruptcies in 2019? Have you taken a more conservative approach this year, given what\u2019s going on with PAMA? But I\u2019m just curious if you could just remind us what you\u2019ve done there. Thanks so much.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. I\u2019ll take the beginning of that and then turn it to Mark to tell us what\u2019s in our guidance, if you will. So yes, it is Trident. What we referred to is what you can read yourself related to their lab business where they served the nursing home marketplace. We have very little exposure to the nursing home business. It\u2019s a tough market. We have a little bit of nursing home business. It\u2019s not a big market opportunity for us. So the answer to your question, it all depends whether we pick up some of the volume. If we can make money out of it and we can serve the marketplace, well we would consider it. So it all depends on where the volume is and at what price points and whether we can serve the market well to really define the presence of our laboratories and where their facilities are. Mark, you want to\u2026","Mark Guinan","Yes. So our remaining bad debt, and that will be separated from patient concessions out of bad debt and into revenue, is pretty small and you occasionally have a blip here. But we don\u2019t have any expectations that we\u2019re going to have significant headwinds on bad debt. A vast majority of that is hospital \u2013 our hospital business and then certainly, a chunk of that is actually physician client bill where in the States it\u2019s permitted. The physician is actually marking it up and billing the commercial payer, and we are charging the physician. So assuming that they continue to get paid by the commercial payers, we\u2019re certainly not at risk for any lack of payment ourselves.","So when you said are we getting more conservative, are taking any steps in anticipation of payment driving more bankruptcy, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be within our customer base, our client bill base that you\u2019re going to see that impact. So there\u2019s really not anything we should do or can do beyond. We\u2019re very diligent around monitoring collections from our client bill and that\u2019s the easiest one. It\u2019s not anywhere near as complicated as the third-party billing and involving the patients. So nothing necessary and certainly no significant headwinds expected or built into our contemplated guidance.","Operator","Yes.

I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and our new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Guinan. In addition, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jon Cohen will be joining us for Q&A.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and 2013 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations' Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com.","A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now here is Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'd like to start by taking us through the top line performance, share our thoughts on utilization and reimbursement trends as well as review progress against our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide detail on the results.","Well, first, clearly, our third quarter performance was disappointing. We recognized that we have missed expectations this year and revised our guidance more than once. We understand it is extremely important to achieve expectations, and we are focused on improving our predictability.","Our current view reflects 2 changes, the impact of a softer market than we originally expected and the fact that our strategy to reserve growth is taking longer to produce results.","Before commenting further, I'd like to welcome Mark Guinan, our new CFO. Mark brings strong financial operations experience to Quest, providing us with a fresh perspective on how we can improve our performance and predictability. Mark and I are already deeply engaged in driving shareholder value by executing our 5-point strategy.","Now let's turn to the market dynamics. All year, we have been saying that we anticipated continued revenue softness in the first half of this year, and that our efforts to restore growth would result in gradual improvement during the back half of this year. Although we have seen a gradual improvement in performance versus the prior year, our third quarter performance was less than we expected. As a result, we fell short of expectations for the period by approximately $50 million.","As we all have seen from commentary from industry stakeholders including hospitals, physicians, payers, suppliers, competitors, the healthcare industry overall is facing utilization headwinds.","At the start of this year, our expectation was that 2013 would have about the same level of utilization we saw in 2012. In the first half, we saw clear signs that health care utilization had declined versus last year and at this point it appears this trend continued. As we reported to you last week, despite seeing some hopeful signs early in the quarter, volume softened late in the quarter. Overall, despite the soft finish to the quarter, volumes remained in line with our previous run rate as organic volumes. Adjusted for our business days, they were lower by 2% versus the prior year.","As I said earlier, in addition to the continued soft market, our initiatives to restore growth that we've been planning on to contribute in the quarter are taking longer to show results. Additionally, this industry also faces considerable and ongoing pressure on reimbursement. In 2013, reimbursement challenges have become much more pronounced. This includes the reductions in Medicare payments of approximately 5%; the cuts to pathology codes on Medicare physician fee schedule; the changes to Medicare fee schedules, including requirements from molecular diagnostics; and finally, the effects of renewed commercial payer contracts.","These changes, just this year, contributed to the lowering of underlying revenue per requisition by 3.3% in the third quarter compared to 2012. We now expect underlying revenue per requisition before acquisitions to be down a similar percentage for the full year. On a full year basis, our price erosion will be greater than $200 million in 2013.","Also, we're going to see traders [ph] association has been fighting additional cuts that have been proposed or discussed. This includes a measure to extend the fixed rate reduction of the clinical lab fee schedule through 2023, as mentioned in the President's budget proposal in April. And CMS has proposed significant changes to the physician fee schedule and a mechanism to adjust to clinical lab fee schedule in the future, as was reported in July.","We are operating in a challenging environment, at the same time, we are making the changes to the way we operate. Together, these factors have affected our progress to restore growth.","Now let me give you an update on our efforts and the progress we're making executing our 5-point business strategy. First, let me start by looking at how we are refocusing on Diagnostic Information Services. We have made significant progress on our portfolio review. Since last year, we sold our OralDNA dental diagnostics business, HemoCue diagnostic products business, ibrutinib royalty rights and, most recently, Enterix, all jittering gross proceeds of approximately $800 million, providing us flexibility to drive shareholder value.","Our portfolio review is helping us deliver disciplined capital deployment. Our commitment is to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion and, in September, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase approximately $350 million of our shares and then, finally, year-to-date, we have deployed nearly $1 billion in share repurchases.","In addition, our goal is to generate about 1% to 2% revenue growth per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. So far, we have completed 4 acquisitions, including the lab outreach business of University of Massachusetts and Dignity Health as well as Concentra's toxicology business and, most recently, ConVerge. Our first 3 acquisitions are on track and contributed 2% to revenues in the third quarter. In October, we completed the acquisition of ConVerge, our second this year in the New England market.","Next, we're making progress driving operational excellence. With Invigorate, we are on track to realize more than $200 million in savings this year and remain committed to our goal of $600 million in run rate savings next year on a path to $1 billion beyond 2014. This strategy, in addition to making us more efficient, will also allow us to improve our customer experience.","Now most importantly, we are building the capabilities we need to restore growth. Our commercial reorganization is complete. As we have said, restoring growth is a gradual process and it takes time. We have made investments on our clinical franchises and the laboratory professional services business. These investments are critical to helping us restore growth.","The clinical franchises are beginning to deliver new solutions to meet customer needs and will help us grow esoteric and advanced diagnostic solutions. To give you an example, we're very excited to introduce BRCAvantage, a new choice of BRCA testing, that's intended to significantly broaden patient and provider access to testing for BRCA gene mutations associated with increased risk of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Quest BRCAvantage is based upon next gen sequencing technology, an expertise of cancer genetics and women's health matched by none and a rich service approach designed to better health care experience for the patient and the clinician.","Our laboratory professional services team continues to expand its pipeline for hospitals of integrated delivery networks that are interested in working with us to improve outcomes and reduce costs.","And then finally, we also continue to simplify the organization and build a culture so we can improve our operations and grow. We built an organizational structure to better service our customers by removing complexity, speeding decision-making and empowering employees. Along with this, we introduced new behaviors that will make us more agile, customer-focused, transparent, collaborative and performance-oriented.","This week's launch of BRCAvantage demonstrates the power of our new organization and culture. Our key ancillary clinical franchise team work collaboratively with colleagues across our enterprise as well as externally with customers, suppliers and key opinion leaders to quickly develop and introduce this important solution. We're looking forward to launching many more successful solutions in the future.","While we are in a difficult operating environment, we are taking the right actions to make our company a stronger and more effective competitor. We are making progress and recognize that there is much more to do.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark for a detailed analysis of the numbers. Mark?","Mark J. Guinan","Thanks, Steve. As you and I have discussed, I have several priorities for the finance function. These include improving our predictability and supporting the business to achieve our 5-point strategy, starting with improving operations and restoring growth. I can assure the investment community that I recognize the importance of delivering on guidance, and we will instill the discipline to improve our predictability. I don't like surprises and recognize that investors like them even less than I do.","Turning to revenues. Third quarter of consolidated revenues, $1.79 billion or 1.9% below the prior year. Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 2.4% below the prior year. Volume was better than the prior year by 2%. Our first 3 acquisitions completed this year: UMass, Dignity Health and Concentra's toxicology business contributed approximately 2% in the quarter to revenues and approximately 3% to volume, in line with expectations. Volume also benefited by approximately 1% due to favorable business days. Underlying volume, excluding business days and acquisitions, was lower by approximately 2%.","As we have shared previously, we expected this year to be a building year and we expected to build momentum and show improvement later in the year.","Revenue per acquisition in Q3 was down 4.3% compared to the prior year. The impact of our 2 second quarter acquisitions, principally Concentra's toxicology business, lowered revenue per requisition by approximately 1% in the quarter, resulting in a decrease in underlying revenue per acquisition of approximately 3.3%.","While under pressure all year from government and commercial payers, reimbursement was also impacted this quarter by increased denial rates and unfavorable test mix, both of which are related to molecular tests and coding changes made this year.","Q3 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, Clinical Trials testing, Healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, were favorable to the prior year by 4.1%. Adjusted operating income was 16.5% of revenues, about 260 basis points below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues. A significant portion of the lower revenue is being offset by continued progress with our Invigorate initiatives. However, we are operating in an environment in which we continue to make investments in advance of the revenues we expect. For example, we are investing in clinical franchises in areas like cancer and women's health to develop and launch solutions like BRCAvantage. We are also making investments in our lab professional services offering, which is an important element of our long-term strategy to restore growth.","We expected volume growth in the current year to fund some of these investments. While they have not, we have not slowed down the pace of investing. Also, keep in mind that Invigorate includes volume-based productivity improvements. While we remain confident we will deliver $250 million or more than the current year, the volume decline we've experienced has prevented us from realizing even more of the productivity savings we had expected.","Adjusted EPS of $1.02 was $0.13 below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues, partially offset with cost savings realized from Invigorate and the benefits of our share repurchase program.","As a result of the company's ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, restructuring and integration costs of $39 million reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.2% and reported EPS by $0.16.","Last year's third quarter included $44 million of cost associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.4% and reported EPS by $0.17.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.6% or 30 basis points higher than the prior year. The increase can be partially attributed to benefit plan design as patients shoulder an increasing portion of health care costs.","DSOs were 48 days, essentially unchanged from the second quarter.","Cash from operations was $186 million in the quarter compared to $395 million in the prior year. This is principally due to the following factors: adjusted operating income was lower by $54 million; higher cash in the prior year period due to a nonrecurring $72 million cash received upon termination of an interest rate swap agreement; increase in the size and the timing of tax payments of $38 million in 2013; and higher restructuring and integration payments in 2013 of $15 million.","Capital expenditures were $51 million in the quarter compared to $45 million a year ago.","During the quarter, we repurchased 7.2 million common shares. So far this year, we've repurchased almost 1 billion of our stock.","Turning to guidance. We are updating guidance based on our performance year-to-date, the current operating environment, which we do not expect to materially improve and based on updates from our business leaders. We expect full year 2013 results from continuing operations before special items to be as follows: revenues to be approximately 3.5% below 2012, prior guidance was to be about 1% to 2% below the prior year level; earnings per diluted share to be between $3.85 and $3.95 compared with prior guidance of $4.35 to $4.50; cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million compared to prior guidance that it would approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures unchanged to approximately $250 million.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, 2013 is a building year for Quest. We are focusing on implementing our 5-point strategy in the challenging environment with a particular emphasis on our strategies to restore growth. This will require us to improve our execution. Our recent BRCAvantage launch demonstrates Quest's ability to empower better health with diagnostic insights. And this illustrates a great example of our innovation will help us restore growth.","Despite the current tough environment, we believe we operate in a very attractive market, and our 5-point strategy positions Quest to deliver superior shareholder value.","Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Steve, I guess, starting off with -- one of the things that you guys called out in your press release last week was the 50 basis-point impact from increased denials on the molecular test. Will you be able to recoup the 50 basis points that was lost at some point or is that gone forever?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, good question, Kevin. Let's give you a little more clarity on what we were talking about there. It has to do with really denials for our diagnostic-related charges that are in this molecular diagnostic category. And as you know, there's been quite some discussion in the past about this code stacking and then also the new proposals. And we've commented in the past, we think, on the price side, we were okay. And then, actually, we got into the quarter and we see some issues associated with getting paid. So I'm going to turn it to Dan to give us a little more color on the specifics of what we saw and how much of that could come back to us.","Dan Haemmerle","Yes, sure thing. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. As we think about the molecular diagnostics issue and we think about pricing in general, first, let me say this. We said that reimbursement pressure would be about 3% in the year from government commercial payers, if it continues to be in that zone, so that we should be -- we're still in line with -- in terms of fee schedule erosion. We also share, when you think about revenue per requisition, that we see some favorable test mix and test per requisition, and that would be offset by some unfavorable business mix issues, okay, as our wellness and toxicology business has continued to grow. In this quarter, we saw a deterioration in the overall revenue per requisition, not necessarily fee schedule-related, but more due to test mix as well as the molecular diagnostics issues. And when we think about the molecular diagnostics issues, it has turned into -- resulted in a softer test mix benefit than originally anticipated. And as we look to those denials, some of the denials are related to some tests that we recently launched during the course of the year and have been growing, so we'll see some unfavorability there versus expectations. And then also, we do, as you know, perform reference testing for about half the hospitals around the country. We've had some clients that have started to see denials on their end a little bit later and, in an effort to maintain their profitability, have started to alter their ordering patterns, okay? And as they've altered some of those ordering patterns, we've seen changes, again, in our -- it would show up in our test mix. So denials, probably on their end, that resulted in softer test mix. So some of this -- is there an opportunity to continue to work this and get some improvement in the future? We will be working it and hope to get some improvements. But at this point, it's early to say, and we know the prudent thing to do would be to record our revenues right where they are.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Dan. But you mentioned you launched some new tests this year. I was just wondering if some of those tests have CPT codes assigned or are those tests -- I mean how big of an issue was that? And should we expect this kind of 50 basis-point headwind to continue?","Dan Haemmerle","I would expect some portion of it to continue to the end of the year.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Steve, just going back to your prepared comments, you talked about weaker utilization this year. You saw it in the first half and in the latter part of the quarter impacting your volumes. I was just wondering, what makes you think this is an industry issue? Obviously, we thought -- I'm on the same page, I think, overall utilization is a little weaker. But do you think there's any company-specific issues here? I mean could you guys be losing share to some of the smaller labs or even the hospital-based labs?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. Good question, Kevin. So we -- and, obviously, you're looking at what's happening in the marketplace and the results are starting to come in. So on the utilization front, as I said in my prepared remarks, and I've shared this with you before, we entered the year thinking that it will be about the same levels as we had last year and, in fact, it's been worse. We expected that Q3 would be similar to what we saw in the first 2 quarters. And actually, as we have seen regarding to the quarter, beginning of the quarter, we actually were encouraged. And then as we got through midpoint of the quarter, it started to slow down. And we actually have gone back and looked at kind of our underlying business. Operationally, I talked about our reorganization of our sales force, we're putting more focus on operational excellence. Yes, that's about efficiency but, as importantly, it's about enhancing our customer experience. And when we look at our underlying performance and if you look at the key measures and if you go back and look at -- we do look at this sort of top 1,000 accounts and say, \"What is happening between Q2 and Q3? Is there anything exceptional in there?\" What we see is less utilization. Also, when you go back and look at sort of where we might be picking up accounts or where we might be getting some defections related to hospital in-sourcing, it was about where we expected. So the big change, really, for the quarter is related to our belief that some of the programs we've put in place with our sales force, with our new products and with our professional services business would yield more than what we delivered, and that's the $50 million I commented to. But overall, if you look at the marketplace, and if you look at how we compete with regional labs, how we compete with some of the national -- large national labs, we look at our customer experience, we look at our product offering, we look at our access, there's no notable change in that. And actually, we are improving as our plan -- as it's improving throughout the year. So that's our take on the quarter. Obviously, we're still digging into exactly what's happening in each of the regions, what's happening by each of our payer types, what's happening by product category, and we'll have more knowledge about it as we go forward. But as we sit right now, that's our perspective on the quarter.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then one last question here, Steve. So apparently, there has been some guideline changes for women's health on the paps. Just wondering if you guys have had a chance to assess how much of an impact do you think this will have on your women's health testing business?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. The guideline changes for pap.","Jon R. Cohen","Yes. The guideline changes...","Stephen H. Rusckowski","This is Jon Cohen.","Jon R. Cohen","Sorry, it's Jon. As you know, these guideline changes do change to more than -- to less frequently than 1 year. And I think, in general, everyone is going to see some decrease in pap testing as a result of that, as physicians, particularly OBs and primary care, begin to seriously engage with the new guidelines that we're offering.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Tom Gallucci [ph], FBR.","Unknown Analyst","I guess, just on the volumes, for my first question then I'll ask a follow-up. Curious about the trend that you're saying you saw there was a little stronger in the first part of the quarter and weaker in the second part. Just trying to understand the magnitude of the dropoff that you saw or exactly what you're relaying here in terms of the trend.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. Well, we are starting to get some data back from some of the industry watchers. And it appears that things did drop off in terms of physician visits in September more than what we had seen at the beginning of the quarter, so that's tracking with what we experienced. And second is I just saw -- we just are digesting some hospital admission data and it looks like the same happened on the hospital side, too. So it was tracking, actually, in the first part of the quarter, Tom, better than what we had experienced in the first half, and then it went to a place that was lower than what we saw in the first half. So -- and on average, it's about what we saw in the first half. But we were hopeful in the early part of the quarter that things were actually improving somewhat versus what we had experienced in the past. So it's our best perspective on this, and we're trying to understand how much of this is the market, the environment, utilization, what could have been the causes for that and also what has -- Kevin asked earlier, what portion of it is us versus the competition versus what we expected versus our plans, so we're going through all that. But as we sit right now, the biggest shortfall in the quarter is related to not executing as well, is the programs that we put in place and that we had planned on in our guidance, and that's the $50 million. When we got through the quarter, you can say when the dust settles, it was a little better than the first part of the quarter, less in -- that part of the quarter overall utilization was about, for the quarter, what we have seen in the past 2 quarters. That's not it. But we actually had planned on getting more out of our restored growth initiatives. And as we said, they're still valid. We have the resources in place. It's just going to take more time for us to see the benefits of those.","Mark J. Guinan","And I just want to add -- it's Mark -- a majority of the $50 million miss came in September, so -- and I do want to make that clear. And historically, September has been a strong month for us. So we were actually, based on where we were at early in the quarter, we were expecting some momentum in September and we saw the dropoff. Now back to Steve's point, when you look at the quarter in total, the overall health of the business, frankly, utilization was pretty consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year. So while September was disappointing, when you look at it in light of the whole quarter, it seemed like it just was a continuation of the year. But earlier in the quarter, we felt like things were turning.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Is that new guidance just to clarify, is more of a run rate that you saw in September or is it really the average for the quarter?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Mark?","Mark J. Guinan","It's really looking at the quarter. We're not building off September and assuming that's indicative of what the balance of the year will be.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. My bigger picture sort of follow-up was just on use of cash. Obviously, you guys are describing a difficult environment. You bought back a lot of stock, you've done some acquisitions. In the environment that we're in, how do you sort of think about the visibility you have on acquisitions performing or on your own business performing and the stock being a good use of cash versus doing dividends or acquisitions in different lines of businesses? I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the use of cash in this difficult environment.","Mark J. Guinan","Yes. We're committed to our 5-point strategy. And as we look at the acquisitions, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, they're on track, so the 3 that we actually integrated at this point. So we continue to feel that's a good use of cash. And in terms of other use of cash, whether it's dividend or share buybacks, we've said we're going to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders and we're going to continue along that strategy.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. The first one is on the Invigorate cost savings. So I think that the implied guidance assumes about $160 million to $170 million of incremental savings in the second half of the year. And when we kind of like think about the business, the acquisitions, doing back of the envelope analysis, we get to Invigorate incremental savings of around $60 million to $65 million in the quarter. So I just wanted to confirm that. And should we -- is it reasonable to think that you're going to see another kind of like 40% of sequential uptick in the savings that you're seeing coming through in the fourth quarter?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. So let me go through what we said before and my perspective, and I'll turn it to Mark to round it off. Well, first of all, what we have shared is that we have a goal of $600 million run rate savings by the end of 2014, so we're standing behind that as I said in my prepared remarks. We actually are encouraged by the rate of change we're making with Invigorate, and we need it to offset the headwinds we have in this industry. And as we said before, we have our foot on the accelerator to get as much out of it as possible, so that continues. What we also have shared is that last year, in 2012, we were exiting about $200 million run rate and we've never provided a run rate for 2014 -- 2013, but what we have said is that we would save -- deliver savings $250 million this year. We are well on our way to save that this year, that's $250 million. We also said, as you recall, about twice as much in the back half than the front half. So if you go through the math, as you have done, Ricky, that would save -- that would be somewhere in that range that you discussed. But also it says, given the rapid pace of improvement that we're making on our cost structure, there is a ramp, and that ramp means that we'll have a ramp going into the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. So with that as just refreshing our guidance on this, I'll turn it to Mark to round it off.","Mark J. Guinan","Yes, sure. Ricky, as I mentioned again in my prepared remarks, some of the Invigorate savings is volume-dependent. And we were tracking actually ahead of our plan in the first half of the year, and we're expecting to deliver something north of the $250 million that we communicated externally. As volumes have softened, we're expecting to still meet our commitment of over $250 million, but not quite reach the levels that we had thought and had projected and built into our expectations for the full year. So therefore, the ratio of first half to second half has been impacted by 2 things: one was that the overall savings are not going to be quite as high as we'd hoped to achieve, but still exceed what we committed externally, the $250 million; the second thing is that we actually were tracking ahead in the first half, and that ratio could have held true if we had achieved our stretch targets for the year. But since we aren't, the ratio is going to be a little bit different.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that is helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, regarding the code stacking kind of like reimbursement delays, does this relate only to Medicare or are you also seeing some of that's playing over to the commercial side?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Dan, why don't you take that?","Dan Haemmerle","Yes. We have seen it with other payers in -- on the commercial side, Medicaid side. And keep in mind, as you go through this with different payers in different states, even on the Medicaid side, different payers are implementing on different timelines and they're taking different approaches to this. But we still have some payers in different states that were actually billing with the old coding system, okay? And so we expected that some of these will continue to move but, at this point, we are seeing it across multiple payers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Bonello, Craig-Hallum.","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","A question and a follow-up. I want to revisit something you kind of touched on earlier, but maybe push you a bit more on it. I guess I'm kind of flummoxed by the degree of attention that you are placing on sort of the challenging macro environment. I mean, if I look at your performance compared to the only other national lab, it's been incredibly divergent over the last 3 quarters, with you guys obviously performing significantly more poorly. And I guess, what I want to understand is how we can get comfortable that you're accurately assessing what problems really might be performance-based rather than macro-driven and what you might be doing to address those. And then I do have a follow-up.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","All right, Bill. Thanks for the question. First of all, we only have access to our data, and we see what you see in terms of our competitors and what competitor you're referring to. As you see and what we have said is that our underlying volumes, when you do all the adjustments and just look at the organic volume for Q3, it was down by about 2%, that's adjusting for days and adjusting for -- everything we adjust for with our acquisitions. And that's about at the same levels we have seen for the last 2 prior quarters. With that said, you then look at what we had expected from each of the different categories of our operation. We have different mixes of business and different areas of focus than some of our competitors. And I would say that in 2 dimensions, one from a product perspective or a service-line perspective and the second is from a geographic perspective. And so when you look through our business and you look at our pathology business, and there was earlier questions about pap smears, and there's a dynamic going on with that business, which we understand and we're trying to track. Second is, if you look at our overall business versus others in primary care versus specialty care, we're actually looking at a routine business versus our esoteric and advanced business. If we look at our payer mix, we're also quite interested, as you would expect, at what's happening with our prayer partners and how they're growing or not growing, and that could affect our performance as well. So you go through the whole calculus and all we can do is control what we do control. And so what we're focused on in our strategy to restore growth is number one, a better commercial organization or sales organization that does a better job calling on our customers to make sure that we have the best superior experience that we can for our customers that we can. This includes on how we sell to them, how do we service them and, in any length, some portion of this marketplace that is growing. And so that's why we put that in place. Second is we created an organization around clinical franchises. This clinical franchise organization is putting more emphasis of getting more solutions to the marketplace that is much more aligned with what you see from another portion of the marketplace that is growing, which is sometimes referred to as the boutique or specialized laboratories. Our BRCAvantage introduction this week is a great example of the new organization that we put in place. From the Supreme Court ruling in June to today, we sped up. Quickly, we get to this -- to the marketplace. We're quite excited about that as an introduction and we're encouraged by that. So again, we're controlling our own destiny. We're introducing more to the market at a faster pace than ever before. And then, finally, is we're building a professional services business. And I'll share with you, this is gathering traction. It's gathering traction because many hospitals and integrated delivery networks are quite interested on what their strategy is going forward and how we can help them with that. Some of that took the form of 2 acquisitions this year with hospital outreach, but you'll be hearing about more laboratory management and professional service relationships with a number of systems as we go forward because our funnel is building. So we're encouraged by that. So you look at, fundamentally, how does business go from one of our competitors to the other and vis-a-vis how we compete versus those competitors, we think we're focused on all the right things. We're focused on the things that are going to drive volumes. We also understand, and you understand, that we've had a significant reimbursement change this year. Our guidance this year is about 3% change in price. We have our fair share of the cuts in Medicare, which are outlined in my remarks, but also, we had a number of commercial contracts that anniversaried and we renegotiated those terms, and that's in the 3%. So if you look at the top line and you look at price erosion for us versus some others, we had a year where we paid out, if you will, in price concessions about $200 million, and we're offsetting that as well. So we believe that we're working on the right things. We're disappointed by Q3. We do believe it's a difficult market with a lot of headwinds. However, we need to work on the things we do control. We believe our 5-point strategy. If you look through the 5-point strategy as the right strategy, if you look at the results, 4 of those points are tracking very well. The one we're disappointed in is our strategy to restore growth. We think those initiatives that are outlined are the right initiatives. Where you look at the marketplace and look at where people are growing, what I just outlined there is what is going to make a difference for us so that we do restore growth. So that's my best summary of what we've done vis-a-vis the market and vis-a-vis the competition.","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up related to that. You've been here a couple of years now. In light of what you believe to be an extremely difficult macro environment and in light of the challenges that you still have in front of you, trying to cut costs and make some pretty significant operational changes while also trying to restore volume growth, I mean have you given any thought to -- that maybe these are things that would better be achieved as a private company? And are you exploring strategic alternatives at all? Any openness on the Board to a sale where there hasn't been in the past?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Okay, Bill. So first of all, I started here in May 2012. So time does go by fast, but not that fast, so not quite 2 years. But in relation to your question, this is a tough environment. However, we do believe we operate in a very attractive market and we do believe that our 5-point strategy positions Quest very well to deliver superior shareholder value. And with that said, we do believe we're operating in the right way. We believe we are making the proper investments. We do believe that our plan is the best value-creation plan irregardless of our ownership, so that's our focus, is our 5-point strategy in building shareholder value.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mark, just wanted to go back to one of the things that you had said, maybe just to get some clarification. You had mentioned that the Invigorate savings were, at least, in part, volume-dependent. And so some of those soft volumes had been slowing that down. Can you just talk a little bit more about what the exact relationship is there?","Mark J. Guinan","Sure. Within our cost structure, obviously, there's fixed costs and variable costs, Gary, and we're not just saving on fixed costs, we're also saving on the rate on our variable costs. So therefore, the dollar figure that we've been quoting was based on a certain level of volume revenue. And as we have less volume, obviously, the dollar, not the proportional savings, on our variable cost is going to be lower.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's -- that make sense, that's helpful. And then Steve, you had mentioned, I don't know if you'd threw or put this number out there before, sort of the $200 million in price concessions this year, can you characterize those to some extent or is there anything that you could have done differently? Maybe you did not have to have -- have had those, and sort of where are we in terms of those anniversarying so that maybe the impact isn't quite as much on a year-over-year basis?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. So let me open it up and turn it to Dan to round it off. First of all, we have said from the beginning of this year that our price erosion will be 3%. So then you go through the 3%, 3% on our business is greater than $200 million, so it's consistent. We haven't shared the exact $200 million, but it is a big number for us and that's what we planned on. As you know, we have a pretty -- we have a very good line of sight on our pricing. It's a good part about this business. Why do we have a good line of sight? We knew what was going to happen with Medicare. We actually planned in that guidance for sequestration. It wasn't certain, but we wanted to make sure we plan for the worst and hope for the better. So -- and we have shared in our remarks that Medicare was about $50 million of that $200 million, roughly. Now that excludes, and on top of, you need to include the pathology cuts, okay? And the pathology cuts were up sort of substantial, that's 52% of the technical fee and that was a considerable portion of the $200 million this year. And the remainder is related to our price concessions with the commercial payers. Some of that had started in 2012 and carried over into 2013. We had a few renegotiations this year. We actually had shared in our second quarter call that we renegotiated, and we're very happy with our renewed contract with CIGNA going forward, and that's in the 3% or the $200 million for this year. And -- but what we also said, when we were in Investor Day last November, is that we expect, over a 3-year period, that price erosion would be about 1% to 2% over that 3-year period. And what we have also shared is that there is going to be more in 2013 than there will be in 2014 and 2015 as a percentage. However, we still have headwinds associated with all the discussion we're having in Washington around further Medicare cuts as I outlined in my remarks. That's how it all fits together. You asked, \"Is there anything you would have done better?\" Well, we're going to push -- as a trade association, I would say that the effort we're mounting in Washington to offset any actions to get further cuts beyond what we baked in is happening, so we're aggressively working on that. I sit on the board of ACLA. Dave King is the Chair, I'm the Vice Chair, we're actively working on this with members of the industry to make sure our voice is heard. We think that this industry is, I repeat, substantial yet. We are an industry that represents about 70% of health care decision-making. For Medicare, we represent about 2% of costs. In a world that you're worried about better patient outcomes and getting more data, we're part of the solution to how you make that happen. And if you look at these cuts that are being proposed going forward, not just for us and for our nearest competitor, but if you look at this marketplace with a lot of small regional players, it will be substantial for those regional players since they have a higher percentage of Medicare. So we think we have a strong argument. Our voice is being heard, and we're working on that. On the commercial side, we're working actively with our commercial insurance partners. As I said when I started in this job, I'm actively engaged with many of them. That's a key part of our business. I see health care insurance as part of a -- the transformational link effort in this country. We're making progress with them on how we bring more value to their membership, how we work with them to narrow their networks, to save them money and get us more revenues, which is an opportunity that we both enjoy, so we're working that. So overall, it's about what we expected for the year. The only change is, again, related to the earlier comments about what happened with molecular diagnostics and the coding, which is on top of, if you will, the 3% price concession guidance that we've given for the year. So Dan, would you like to round up my comments?","Dan Haemmerle","Yes. I think you've touched on most of it. The only other question I think I heard in there was around contracts anniversarying. And so we do have contracts that our anniversarying in the back half of the year, both third and fourth quarter. So some of it happened in third quarter, we'll see a little more in the fourth quarter.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And maybe could you just throw -- you'd also mentioned that you thought it was going to take more time for the growth initiatives to kick in. How does that sort of fit into the comments that you made?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, it's what was the big difference between the third quarter expectations that we've set and what we delivered. And we have the 3 initiatives that we have outlined, those are our priorities for this year: more volume from a better sales organization or commercial organization; second is more coming from products and our clinical franchise organization; and then, finally, is our professional services business. We've gone through the organizational change last fall, we've staffed into place in the first quarter. We have plans and, obviously, part of those plans are making some modest investments in our sales force, our clinical franchises and building our professional services team. We have actually made those investments. We feel good about the progress. We feel good about the prospects that are building and we expected some of those to land in the third quarter. But unfortunately, it did not happen. It doesn't change our confidence, our confidence around what we're working on, our confidence about the market opportunities, our confidence about what we can get in this market as we continue to focus on the things we're focused on in our strategy. And we are making progress, but it will take longer.","Operator","Our next question is from Glen Santangelo of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just have a couple of questions. First is around the implied guidance for the fourth quarter. It looks like you're using the midpoint of your range and looking for $0.93 in the fourth quarter, which is down almost 10% from what you reported this quarter. And given the benefits you have from accruing from share repurchase, from some of the recent acquisitions and some of the Invigorate savings, what are you implying, I guess, with respect to organic trends? I mean, where are we going to see incremental deterioration in 4Q versus 3Q levels?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Mark? Thanks, Glen.","Mark J. Guinan","Yes. Glen, I'll try to answer that for you, thanks for the question. Historically, as you look at Q4, it does tend to be a softer quarter than Q3 given the seasonality. I mean, you've got the holidays. As you look at overall billing days, et cetera, there's definitely a reason to suggest a softer revenue quarter even without any trend break in terms of reqs per day and revenue per req and all that. So it's really just taking into account the days that fall within Q4. No significant change in business momentum other than a little bit more lift we're building in for some of the initiatives that Steve talked about. So we're not abandoning our belief that those investments are going to turn the tide. We just are getting a little more conservative, less aggressive in how quickly that will happen. And we're basing that on what we saw in the third quarter.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then maybe if I could just look forward to 2014. I can imagine you don't want to comment on 2014 at this point, but maybe could you at least address that Affordable Care Act? Have you done any sort of internal analysis in terms of what you think that could ultimately mean, how much you think it could help volumes? Any sort of high-level commentary you can give it at this point?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure, Glen. Well, last quarter, as you know, we talked a fair amount about Affordable Care Act. And what we shared is it's taking more time to develop than we originally had expected. We still believe that is -- that the Affordable Care Act is net positive. Net positive for this industry and net positive for us. And the simple underlying principle why that is, is because there's going to be more lives with insurance. And when more people have insurance, they're going to need what we do. Now as you know, with all the change that has happened, this has been muted. Only half of the states have expanded their Medicaid program, which was an entry point for the lives. We all know that the exchanges have been more problematic, but I will also share that we're negotiating with many of the commercial payers on their exchanges. We actually feel good about that. But as you hear and will hear from health care insurance companies, they're being cautious about their ramp into the exchange world. And also you know about all the issues associated with the government exchanges. And then third is with the employer mandate being pushed out. And again, this is another piece of where the growth would come from that is taking this out by a year or so. We had all expected, as we entered 2013, that 2014 would be a year where we'd see some of the benefits, that is, more lives into the system, and more lives in the system, we would benefit from that, and that's, clearly, been pushed out. However, we still believe that the train has left the station. We still believe that more lives will be insured with a variety of products. And we still believe that, in the end, when people have insurance and have access to the health care system, it'll be net positive for this industry and net positive for us. So Dan, anything you like to do to round that off?","Dan Haemmerle","No. I think you touched on most of it again. I think the exchange piece, as we said, we've been negotiating with a number of commercial payers. We're pleased with how those progressed so far, and we have a number of contracts that we've signed. A lot of this will depend on which -- who the big winners and losers are in exchanges in different markets and how many lives are signing up in terms of how it impacts the business. But overall, the rates we're seeing are generally in line with some of the commercial rates that we've seen in our existing contracts to this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just following up and talking about fourth quarter expectations. I appreciate that on the -- income statement-wise, it looks pretty -- or even maybe a little conservative, but your cash flow assumption, you're going to need a pretty big pickup in cash flow in the fourth quarter to hit your target for the year. And I just wondered, is there some items that are going to swing in the fourth quarter that are going to drive -- I think you need more than $400 million to hit your target. And I just -- what's the thinking there, and any impact on capital deployment decisions given a little lower cash flow expectation?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. A.J., let's turn that to Mark.","Mark J. Guinan","We haven't changed any of our capital deployment plans. And in terms of what's going to give us some uplift in Q4, it's really the -- it's -- the DSOs to a certain extent are a contributor. We had a delay in getting our Medicare provider number and -- for some of our acquisitions. And so we're highly confident that that's going to take place and we're going to get paid. But at this point, that's really been the driver and the spike in our DSOs in Q3 -- in Q2 and Q3, and we expect that to be resolved in Q4.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. On the commentary about expecting sort of pricing pressure, 1% to 2% annually for the next few years, maybe just to put it in perspective, to sort of maintain margin or even start to talk about expanding margin, what kind of -- give us a sense of what kind of volume growth you need in light of that pricing environment to sort of hold margin constant or even begin to expand at all?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","I appreciate that, A.J. Well, when you go through the facts that we had in 2013, which was a substantially larger year than what we anticipate in 2014 and 2015, so we'll have less headwinds from pricing in 2014 than we clearly saw in 2013, that's number one. Number two, is we continue to talk about the acceleration and improvements that we're making on our cost structure with Invigorate. It continues to build, it hasn't stopped. We exited 2012, that $200 million we talked about. $600 million in 2014 is the exit, and we're tracking to exiting at our rate in 2012 and we're going to be on a path to get to the 2014 number that we have committed to. So that's tracking nicely. Third is we have a little bit of headwind, as you would expect, on our wage bill. We have to be competitive with our workforce and so we have to dial that into our expectations. And we continue to build our 1% to 2% top line of opportunities with acquisitions, which is part of our disciplined capital deployment. As you see in the back half of this year, A.J., we actually are now, in the third quarter, at 2% of our top line. So we are getting to the higher end of the range. And as you know, we do these acquisitions, with a large part of those acquisitions based upon cost synergies. As we work through their integration plans -- and some of those integration plans are short, short as 6 months, and some others as large as 2 years, when it's more complicated -- it builds our profitability from those acquisitions, so we have that flowing through in 2014. So I can't give you the specific color of 2014, and we won't do it at this call, but we're still tracking of where we think our 5-point strategy will allow us to build shareholder value. And we do believe it's still compelling as we keep on working through this. As you know, it's always more difficult to get the results with the headwinds and the challenging environment that we see. And if that improves, we're not planning on the significantly sunnier day, if you will, in the short-term. But the challenging environment is making it more difficult, and that challenging environment will improve. And then with the Affordable Care Act, with more lives in the system, because we do believe there will be more lives in the system, and that this marketplace is growing, we do believe we're in an attractive marketplace and we do believe that our 5-point strategy will give us lift as we go forward in 2014 and 2015 with our earnings and also with the opportunity to build shareholder value. So we will keep you posted on when we'll provide insight into 2014, but that is as much color as we can provide at this time.","Operator","Our last question comes from Amanda Murphy, William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I have a couple of follow-up questions on the volume. Just a couple of questions on the volume side. I know we've talked a lot about it but, obviously, you've mentioned some of the underlying utilization trends. But one question I had was, you've made changes on the management side as well. I'm curious, did that have any effect on the business in terms of volume trends?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, it's a good question and, obviously, we're going through territory by territory, understanding where we see effects, can we explain it. We've taken out a sizable portion of management throughout the entire company. As I shared with you, we had to do it. One is we had a very complicated organizational structure. It was not aligned with our 2 highest priorities, which are operational excellence as well as restoring growth. We now have an organizational structure that is leaner and is much more focused on those 2 priorities. And in doing that, we've taken out 3 management layers. And actually, we did this because we spent a lot of time inside talking to ourselves, and one of our behavior changes that we are driving is to get more external. And so if you take out 3 management layers, which we have done, we're spending less time talking to ourselves and more time talking to customers. And it starts with me and my entire management team and throughout the organization. So when you refer to management, I actually think our management changes has actually improved our ability to get outside, and our management today is much more externally focused than before, number one. Number two, though, is you go through a reorganization of the sales force, and these are at the sales rep level. We had to change our sales force organization to put an organizational structure that are more aligned with the way our customers are organizing. As you know, Amanda, customers are organized around integrated delivery networks, they include hospitals, they include physicians, they include ancillary services. And so, we now have a geographic organization. We've made those changes. We did have some account assignments in the first quarter that we had to change to get a more effective organization, and we feel good about that. We did incent our sales force to make sure any changes between the accounts, between sales reps would be handled properly. We don't see a substantial defections or losses in accounts because of that. We do track our customer experience, and we think we're actually improving how we experience -- or our customers experience us. So when we go through all the data, we think we have made all the right changes. We believe that, when you get down to the granular level, they're actually moving in the right directions. But we haven't seen many things come out of some of the positive sides of these. We do expect more productivity from our sales reps, we expect our sales reps to be able to sell more, we expect them to be able to get more from our new products. And that's what we planned for in the $50 million expectation that we've set, so that's the disappointing side of Q3. This is a lot of change. We believe we are making the right changes and we are doing the right things, but it will take longer. So that's my best perspective I can give you on what we've done and how it's affected our business.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, got it. And just a broader question, obviously, the days has been, in just health care in general, has been challenged by lower utilization rates for quite a while now. So I mean, at what point do you say maybe this is a new normal and, if that's true, then I guess, that longer term, and you talk to M&A helping you supplement that growth, but how long is that runway?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, as you know, first of all, we're not planning on the environment changing abruptly or getting better quickly. You see that in our guidance for Q4, and that's what we should plan for. We believe that's being prudent. Second is, if we're seeing pressure, this whole industry is feeling pressure. If you look at the most broadly defined market, our sales and our nearest competitor represent about 20% of the market, 20% of that overall market, then has hospital outreach included in that. The reason why we're encouraged by the professional services business, many of the hospital clients we are now selling into are thinking about their lab strategy, which includes potentially selling their outreach business, the list continues to grow. They're also looking at us at helping them manage some of their inpatient laboratories or helping them with their outreach activities as well, and we are encouraged by that. And then finally, is if we look at the smaller players, the regional players in this marketplace, they have a much higher percentage of the business for Medicare, so with these cuts that we've seen this year and the potential cuts going forward, we think there is an opportunity for the strongest player, the leader, in this industry to continue to consolidate and gain share. And our plan, our 5-point strategy, addresses that. So we're moving forward on this strategy that we have to use some portion of our capital to get 1% to 2% top line for acquisitions. As I mentioned, we actually moved to the 2 side of that range in the third quarter. We are encouraged by that in the third quarter for the fourth quarter, and we continue to build our funnel. And there's a growing level of interest of parties that might consider selling. And also, we want to make sure that these are strategically aligned and accretive acquisitions as we go forward that helps build shareholder value. So that's my perspective. Mark, would you like to round that off?","Mark J. Guinan","Yes. Just one thing I'll -- I'd add. I mean, as -- I think we are seeing a rebasing, driven by a lot of changes that we're all familiar with. One could argue maybe there's overconsumption of health care and we're rebasing it. But at some point, you're rebased, and then we should be growing along demographic lines. When that point is? I'm not sure. I mean -- in addition to that, when you think about the desire to move from treatment to early detection or prevention, so it's our belief that diagnostics is a great part of that solution. So that's -- as Steve said in the end of his remarks, we believe this is a great space. Those are really the drivers. While we certainly have had a couple of tough years here, that's not looking like it's going to be over in the immediate term, we do think that, long term, this is a good space to be in and also, as Steve said, one that's likely to migrate to the highest quality, low-cost providers and we certainly expect ourselves to be there within this marketplace.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. So this is a tough environment, we all know that. But we also, to our Mark Guinan's belief, this is very attractive market. There is the routine work that we do. But most importantly, we're investing in advanced and esoteric work. And I think our example this week of our launch of BRCAvantage is a great example where we'll be entering a market that is growing. It enters in a market where clearly more information and more insight is helpful to helping health care overall. And that's one of the areas of focus for us, is to make sure we introduce more innovative solutions to the market. And as we've talked, it's not just the diagnostic, it's the information, it's the services. And that's what will fuel new growth as we go forward. And when you look at those prospects, we believe this is a very attractive market despite the difficult environment we're operating in today.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics' third quarter conference call.

I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to share that as part of the new organization structure we announced in October, I am moving into a new role in the company, supporting our new value of creation organization.","Now I'd like to introduce our new Executive Director of Investor Relations, Dan Haemmerle. Dan?","Dan Haemmerle","Thanks, Kathleen. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com.","A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now here is Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.","Well, in 2012, we generated $1.2 billion in cash, a record for the company. For the year, we expanded operating margins by 30 basis points, we reached 17.8% and this was driven by continued strong progress in our Invigorate cost-reduction initiative.","We began laying the groundwork for restoring growth. So in a few minutes, Bob will review the fourth quarter with you, but I'd like to start by giving you an update on the progress we've made to execute the 5-point business strategy we shared with you at Investor Day in November.","The first element of our strategy is to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services. We conducted a thorough business review of our assets to ensure strategic alignment and began to pursue strategic options for several of them, including HemoCue and OralDNA. Last year, we sold OralDNA and last week, we announced our plan to sell HemoCue. As a result, we reported the results for these businesses as discontinued operations.","The second strategic element is to drive operational excellence. I'd like to share that we are making excellent progress. We delivered annualized realized savings in 2012 of $160 million with a run rate exiting the year of approximately $200 million. This succeeded our goal entering the year for run rate savings of $150 million.","We are clearly on track to achieve our revised commitment to exit 2014 with run rate savings of $600 million and realized savings of $500 million.","As I've mentioned in past calls, I have been very involved in this program, which is essential to building long-term value. This program is now being managed within our newly created operations organization, but of course, I'm going to be very engaged in driving progress.","The third element is to restore growth. We now have a single unified sales team under a strong collaborative leader with new regional sales leaders in place across the organization. We'll have our first ever national sales force together in 2 weeks. This is where we'll kick off the year. We'll train our sales reps and motivate them to restore growth in 2013.","In addition, we are executing our 7 key growth initiatives with short-term focus on building sales excellence, growing esoteric testing and establishing a hospital professional services business.","Fourth, we are simplifying our organization. When we reported our third quarter results in October, we had just launched our new organizational structure and I had identified the senior management team. Since then we have been deploying the new organization deep into the business, which includes reducing the number of management layers from 10 to 7. This is on track to be concluded in the second quarter.","The fifth point of our strategy is to deliver disciplined capital deployment. In 2012, we reduced debt by $654 million. We significantly increased our dividend, repurchased 200 million of shares and announced the UMass transaction, which was completed on January 2.","Our UMass Memorial relationship and planned Lab of the Future in Marlborough, Massachusetts represent a new model for delivery Diagnostic Information Services for our nation's increasingly cost pressured health care system. We have begun integrating this business into our company and the new facility is being prepared for the buildout to start in the spring.","Our management team is actively engaged in this integration to ensure we deliver the value we envisioned. We're actually seeing a lot of interest in this acquisition by integrated delivery networks throughout the country.","We have made progress launching to our employees in November what we are calling our new quest. We have engaged our employees in the conversation about the company's new vision, empowering better health with diagnostic insights and our 5-point strategy. I'd like to share that this has generated enthusiasm and excitement inside the company. It also has confirmed our initial view that by eliminating complexity and empowering our employees, we can be more effective and create inspiring workplace.","There is a strong management commitment to driving operational excellence and restoring growth starting with me. I have been personally involved in Invigorate initiative since I arrived at Quest in May.","Another top priority for me is to ensure that we focus more intensely on our customers. I've already met a variety of customers and health plans, integrated delivery networks, and large physician practices, and I look forward to meeting many more customers during 2013 with our commercial team as we progress in restoring growth.","The revenue guidance we provided this morning is consistent with the commitment we  shared at our Investor Day in November to grow revenues in low-single digits through 2015 beginning with slower growth in the near term and accelerating through the period. We think 2013 is a building year as we improve operations and begin to restore growth.","In 2013, our focus will continue to be driving operational excellence and restoring growth. We will build on the positive momentum of our 2012 Invigorate performance in 2013. We expect results from our efforts to restore growth to gradually build throughout 2013 and anticipate continued revenue softness in the first half with improvement thereafter.","Our efforts to drive sales excellence, grow esoteric testing, and build the hospital professional services business will gain momentum throughout the year. This, coupled with more favorable year-over-year comparisons in the back half of 2013, is what we expect to lead to improvement in the second half.","We believe the Affordable Care Act will provide volume lift in 2014 as more people gain access to health insurance. The Diagnostic Information Services industry continues to deliver significant value to health care, given it represents a large portion of the information that is used every day to make health care decisions, while it only represents a small portion of the health care dollar.","In the future, with the evolving health care system that will place more emphasis on evidence-based decision-making, we believe this industry and specifically, our company, is very well positioned.","Despite this long-term view, we are clearly planning for reimbursement pressure, averaging 1% to 2% through 2015.","In the short term, we are projecting that the combination of commercial pricing pressures, coupled with Medicare cuts, including the most recent pathology service reimbursement reduction, will approximate a 3% reimbursement decline in 2013. We expect to be able to achieve double-digit earnings per share growth by the time we get to 2014 with that growth contributed by not only improvements at our operating earnings, but continued share repurchases as well.","Our management team and I are focused on driving improvements and return on invested capital. We expect that executing our strategy will result in value for our shareholders by driving return on invested capital or long term in restoring growth.","Now I'd like to turn over to Bob for a detailed analysis of the numbers. Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","Thanks, Steve. I'll start by trying to simplify some of the analysis of the results. Given the movement of HemoCue and OralDNA, the discontinued operations, explaining the performance for Q4 and full year 2012 has become more complex.","To assist in understanding the impact of that change, we have presented a series of tables and Footnote 4 to the earnings release, which reconcile the reported results for what is now continuing operations to pro forma results from continuing operations on an adjusted basis had we not treated HemoCue and OralDNA as discontinued operations. Those pro forma results are comparable with how we had been reporting through the first 3 quarters and how we presented our financial guidance provided in October. The tables presented cover Q4 and full year performance for 2012.","As the pro forma results show, we fell short of our full year revenue guidance by about 50 basis points. About half of the shortfall is due to the estimated impact of Hurricane Sandy with the other half, softer volume performance than we expected in the underlying business.","Despite the softer top line performance, the full year pro forma adjusted EPS of $4.47, which was reduced by an estimated $0.06 for Hurricane Sandy, was within our EPS guidance range. Our success in driving our Invigorate initiative was a key contributor to delivering the EPS performance.","For the balance of the discussion, I will speak to principally the adjusted results, which present HemaCue and OralDNA as discontinued operations and is consistent with how we will report going forward.  In discussing the results, I'll refer to Diagnostic Information Services or DIS, and Diagnostic Solutions or DS.","DIS is made up of the same businesses we've previously called clinical testing and was essentially unaffected by the movement of HemaCue and OralDNA into discontinued operations. What we previously called our nonclinical testing businesses will now be referred to as DS. HemaCue was previously included in nonclinical testing.","Starting with revenues. Q4 consolidated revenues of $1.8 billion reflect a decrease of 4% from the prior year with an estimated 1.2% of the decrease due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy.","Our DIS revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 4.4% below the prior year with 1.3% of the decrease due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy. Volume was 2.4% below the prior year with 1% due to the hurricane. Revenue per acquisition was 2% below the prior year level, but essentially unchanged from Q3. Favorable test mix and an increased number of tests per acquisition continued to have positive impacts, but have been more than offset by reimbursement pressures and business impairment exchanges.","Q4 revenues in our DS businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and our remaining products businesses, were comparable to the prior year. Q4 adjusted operating income at 17% was 90 basis points below the prior year with the decrease due principally to the impact of Hurricane Sandy.","Adjusted EPS of $1.01 was $0.19 below the prior year with each of the following contributing approximately 1\/3 of the decline, Sandy, underlying revenue softness and the year-over-year impact of nonrecurring tax items. Restructuring and integration costs totaling $36 million reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.1% and reported EPS by $0.14.","Last year's fourth quarter included $11 million of costs associated with CEO succession and restructuring and integration, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by about 60 basis points and reported EPS by $0.04.","The response to the softer volume we have seen in the most recent quarters, we have taken action to accelerate savings associated with our Invigorate program. We estimate that Invigorate delivered approximately $160 million in realized savings in 2012 with a run rate savings as we exited the year at about $200 million. This represents about 1\/3 of our updated goal of $600 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014. In addition, as you heard at our November Investor Day, we are evaluating additional opportunities, which can bring that amount to $1 billion over time.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved 10 basis points from the prior year to 3.4% in the quarter. DSOs were 47 days, up 1 day from last quarter.","Cash from operations was $380 million in the quarter compared to $338 million in the prior year. Cash flow in the quarter benefited by a deferral of just over $90 million of income tax payments into the first quarter of 2013. The tax deferral was offered to companies headquartered in states most affected by Hurricane Sandy. While this deferral helped cash flows in 2012, it will reduce cash flows in 2013 with the year-over-year impact being approximately $180 million. This deferral, plus the roughly $72 million of cash flow benefit we've realized from cashing out certain interest rate swaps in 2012, will adversely impact the comparison of 2013 cash flow to that of 2012 by a total of roughly $250 million.","Capital expenditures were $60 million in the quarter compared to $44 million a year ago. During the quarter, we've repurchased 869,000 common shares at an average price of $57.55 for a total of $15 million, bringing the annual total to $200 million.","We also reduced outstanding debt by $147 million in the quarter, bringing the full year total to $654 million in connection with our stated objective to delever by $500 million to $700 million.","Turning to 2013 guidance. We expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenue growth of between 0% and 1%; earnings per diluted share to be between $4.35 and $4.55; cash provided by operations to approximate $1 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $250 million with the increase from the prior year primarily associated with our Invigorate initiative.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Bob. So in closing this quarter, we had aggressively drove operational excellence and delivered strong Invigorate savings. We are actively working to regain market share and grow our business. We have taken tangible actions to increase shareholder returns and improve return on invested capital. Now I'd be happy to take any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tom Galluci, Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, first, I was just wondering within the guidance, Bob, what do you have assumed for buybacks and the incremental portion of cost savings?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Tom, we don't provide specific guidance on buybacks, but what you can assume is that we are going to meet our commitment of returning the majority of free cash flow to shareholders through, obviously, the increase in the dividend and the remainder through share repurchases. And that share repurchases this year should be higher than they were in 2012 with our delevering behind us. We feel as though we've got much more flexibility now to return cash to shareholders. The other part of the question was with respect to the Invigorate savings. While, again, we're not giving specific guidance in terms of what that will be each quarter, at the end of this past year, we had realized about 1\/3 of the $600 million in run rate savings we expect. Yes, you should expect that we're going to be in the range of about 2\/3 of that as we exit 2013.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then final one. Just on volumes, what do you peg the market growth as and obviously, it would seem that you're maybe losing a little bit of shares. So could you just give us a little bit more color on some of the headwinds that you're seeing? And you mentioned before expecting sales improvement as you go through 2013. Besides the easy comps, tell us what you're doing there and what sort of visibility you have on improving that volume and market share?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, I appreciate that. So first of all, what we shared at Investor Day is we believe retrospectively is this market has been growing around 4%. Now that is a discussion around where the volume is going and some of the volume being picked up by hospitals and their outreach activities and they're picking up volume, but also picking up value share in the marketplace. But we have been not growing at that market rate, so what we have said is we've lost share and therefore, what we're doing with restore growth is to start by improving our performance and growing the business and getting back to growing with the marketplace. With that said, what we saw on the fourth quarter is continued sluggish market conditions. We did not see an improvement in volumes and actually, independent of Sandy, it continued throughout the quarter as we saw in Q3 as well. So we don't see a big change in that so far. Prospectively, we believe this is a good market. Again, we say the market will grow at 4% going forward. We believe there will be a pickup in the market size in 2014 with the Affordable Care Act kicking in. But in the short run, given what we saw in Q3 and Q4, we are anticipating that will gradually improve going into next year, but we don't see significant changes in the market going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In the prepared remarks, you talked about guidance being back-end loaded. Can you give us some sense as to what percent of revenue in earnings will be first half versus second half?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so let me start, and I'll turn it to Bob as well. And we shared why do we believe it's going to be back-end loaded. Well, first of all, is we do have a number of programs that we have initiated in 2012 that are gaining momentum, and we believe we'll have the most material impact 2013 in the second half. For instance, we are putting an emphasis on growing our hospital professional services business. We believe there will be volumes in the second half that we won't see in the first half. In addition to that, if you look at the comparisons versus last year, the first quarter of last year was strong. It's a tough compare. A matter of fact, there's 1% fewer workdays in the first quarter versus last year. Second is if you look at second half, we're coming off the second half that was softer. So it's a combination of our organic investments materializing in 2013 and also how the year lays out in 2013. So I'll turn it to Bob.","Robert A. Hagemann","And, Ricky, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, obviously, we wanted to provide this level of understanding so that folks as they're thinking about the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, but you can get it right. As Steve said, the first quarter last year was a very strong quarter, clearly the strongest volume that we've reported. So that's going to be one of our toughest comps as we go into next year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And should we think about pricing at the same way, because I think pricing was fairly strong in the first quarter '12. So is it a fair assumption that in 1Q '13, your -- the metric that you report on pricing kind of that the price declines in 1Q '13 would be greater than what you reported in the fourth quarter?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, again, remember last year's first quarter had the benefit in it of the -- I'll call it the last quarter of both Athena and Celera in there, which drove mix. That anniversary-ed as we got into the second quarter, and we saw relative stability in the revenue correct throughout the year subsequent to that. As we think about the 3% reimbursement pressure, it will be relatively even throughout the year we're expecting.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly on the hospital front, I mean, obviously, I think hospital outsourcing trend is one of the key debates in the lab space. And looking at the metric that you provided by payer, I see that actually hospital and reference lab revenues have gone up in 2012. So can you just give us some color on what drove the year-over-year growth in revenue from that kind of like payer bucket and how do you think about that segment in '13?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","So, thanks for the question. Yes, you're right. We did see growth in our hospital reference business and we're encouraged by that. I think it speaks volumes. We shared in our Investor Day that we have bought 50% of hospital contracts with us for their reference work and given that large share, what they give to us is the more esoteric testing. We see it's a trend that will continue, but also we're going to build on those relationships in more strategic discussion about where they're heading with their laboratory activities, including their reference testing, but also how we can have more value-added services provided to them after including taking on their outreach business. So that's our strategy, but we're going to build on that trend that you picked up in the details.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich, Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Steve, your comments on the Affordable Care Act having a lift on volume in 2014, I was wondering what's your thoughts on what the impact on revenues will be with the Affordable Care Act in 2014.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, first of all, we're not going to provide guidance on 2014, but we do see -- we do believe that there will be a pickup in the market and therefore we should be seeing a piece of that market. More helpful, Kevin, given what we're doing with restoring growth, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see 2013 as a year to get a lot of things working and a lot of things in place to be able to take advantage of that change in the marketplace. So we're not going to provide guidance on 2014, but we should see a pickup in the market and we should be in a very good place at that point to take advantage of it.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I absolutely agree with you, Steve. I was just thinking that with the patient testing bucket going down with -- if you were uninsured that, that would have a negative impact on the revenue partially offset by the pickup in volume that you see. Plus, then you had the impact of the exchanges coming into play, which still kind of remains a question mark. Do you think that logic is correct?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, as you pointed out, there's so many unknowns right now, and that's part of the challenge is, there's no question, there's going to be more volume. Question is what's going to be the insurance product for those volumes and how will we engage? States are still deciding what their plans are going to be. So there's a lot of moving pieces of this as it unfolds as you know. So we believe, as we said in the past, is the Affordable Care Act will be a net positive for this industry and for us. We think we'll be in much better place to take advantage of it in 2014 than we were in 2012 with all the work we're doing. So we'll be actively engaged in the marketplace and stay close to it and take advantage of whatever way it shapes out.","Robert A. Hagemann","And, Kevin, I would just add to that while patient pay is our highest reimbursement, it also carries our highest level of bad debt and contributes about half of our bad debt overall. So as we see shifting out of that bucket, we should see some benefit on the bad debt side also.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sure, that makes sense. And then I'm not sure if you guys have provided much detail behind the UMass deal, but I was just wondering what's embedded in your guidance for any volume pickup that you'll see from that relationship.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Bob, do you want to handle it?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Kevin, as we said when we announced that deal we expect it to contribute about 1% to revenues this year in 2013 and expect it to be accretive starting in 2014.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And is that all volume, Bob? Or is there some price growth that will come in from that deal?","Robert A. Hagemann","The majority of it is volume. That's the way we should think about it.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, kind of more big picture, Steve, with the hospitals taking some share as they have made more acquisitions of physician practices, just wondering have your efforts picked up with any of the managed-care companies or with the industry to try to shift some of that volume out of the hospitals and outreach programs to lower cost settings such as yourself.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. So the answer to your question is yes, it is picking up. As we have said in the fall and it continues to be growing trend, we're having more and more conversations about what will happen in the future and how hospital systems, as they, by physicians will work with us. We talked earlier in this call about reference testing. We talked about more value-added services. Our engagement with integrated delivery networks and they're thinking through how they'll work with us going forward has increased considerably from prior year. So the trying continues.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dane Leone, Macquarie Capital.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Two quick questions for me. One, what is actual cash balance that you need to have on your balance sheet?","Robert A. Hagemann","Dane, it's probably in the range of $100 million or so. The reason that you see the cash balance as high as you do at year end, which is close to $300 million, refers to the 2 things. One, the deferral and the tax payment from Q4 to Q1. So we have cash on hand to handle that $90 million tax payment. And in addition, the cash balance that we had at year end was there to cover the payment on January 2 that we made to conclude the UMass transaction.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Right. So just as a rule of thumb in a normal environment, anything above $100 million could be considered a cash sweep back to either debt paydowns or share repurchases for the down payments?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, if you look historically at our cash balance, it's probably ranged between $100 million and $150 million or so.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And the second question for me. Is there anything besides the UMass deal that's embedded in revenue growth expectations for 2013, potentially deals not done that are considered?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","So our guidance includes UMass and also includes anything else we might have in the year. As we shared, as part of our strategy, we do believe this is an opportunity to continue to look at fold-in acquisitions. And as you would expect, as we deploy our strategy, we're looking at those, and so we have an active funnel. So the guidance includes those as well.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. So to not pin you down to be too specific about quarterly guidance, is there an expectation for organic volume trends to turn positive in 2013?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","The answer to the question is yes. If you go through the math, we do have headwinds with the 3% we have shared. That price pressure, we have to offset with our cost-improvement programs. And fortunately, we're in good shape. We exit the year at a nice momentum that will carry into 2013. With that said,  if you go through the math, we are anticipating organic improvement and some of that, our quick organic improvement, will come from all the activities you've heard about with restore, what we're doing around bringing sales excellence to the company, making sure that we continue to capitalize on esoteric testing and building out our hospital's professional services. So we are planning on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if you had any thoughts around potential copay on the Medicare side, obviously, still trying to work through the fiscal cliff. But as we think about that, is that contemplated in your reimbursement pressure of 1% to 2% through 2015?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so first of all, the work is going to happen to understand what will happen around sequestration. And also, we are planning for that at our 3% reimbursement cuts that we plan on for this year. As far as copay, clearly, this is going to be a discussion. It's hard to understand what might happen eventually. So it's not necessarily, in a detailed way, part of our guidance, but we'll be working through this and along with many others lobbying found that might fold out to the lab industry, but not quite clear yet.","Robert A. Hagemann","And Lisa, if a copay were to go into place, it would not necessarily show up as reimbursement deal. In all likelihood, if there was any negative impact from it, you'd see it in higher cost of collections. You'd also potentially see it on the bad debt side a little bit as we have to chase those copays. So we're not convinced that copays make a lot of sense. They shift cost to the patient, as well as add cost to the health care system, with now having to collect it.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","At least round that off, Lisa, because you asked about 1% to 2%. So 1% to 2% is our best estimate of what reimbursement pressure will be in 2015. Obviously, we have more of that in 2013, but the 1% to 2% assumes a mix of all reimbursement pressures, and so if there's something coming, that's in the number.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then Steve, you talked about interest by IDNs in the UMass deal. As many of these IDNs are becoming accountable care organizations, are you having discussions with them about becoming the outsource lab. I mean, they'll be accountable for those costs rather than fee for service before it made sense for them to run their own lab? Are those the type of discussions that you're having?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, it's both. First of all, this is a fee-for-service industry, and it will take time to move over to the accountable care model. As we've said in the past, and when you see one ACO, you see one ACO. The payments reform that's necessary to change how you think about cost and how we contribute to that is still evolving. So we have both discussions, one in today's world but also thinking about the future. So inform these  relationships, they're thinking about us in the short run as well as the long run, and how this might play out, so -- but in the short run, people are thinking about today in the 2013, it is a fee-for-service world.","Operator","The next question comes from A.J. Rice, UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just a couple of quick questions. First of all, your guidance range is not particularly wide range, $4.35 to $4.55 in EPS. But I wondered if I might get you to comment on the variables that you see most relevant in thinking about whether you'll end up at the high end of that guidance range or the low end of that guidance race? Any comment on that, by any chance?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Bob, do you want to...","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, A.J., it's clearly volume. Yes, that's one of the biggest drivers we feel is so [ph]. We've got very good line of sight as to the cost savings that are going to come through from the Invigorate initiative. We feel as though we've really nailed down what the reimbursement pressures are going to be this year. So clearly, the biggest variable in my mind is where volume ends up.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And when you think about the savings falling through and 2\/3 of the savings being realized by 2013, obviously, a portion of the savings is just offsetting the top line headwinds that you're referencing in the business, and then a portion over time is hopefully driving some margin improvement. Can you give us flavor for the prospects for Invigorate to drive margin improvement short and maybe long term?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, clearly, in the short-term, what it's been doing is allowing us to preserve margins given the reimbursement pressures that we see, and that's certainly going to be the case in 2013 as well. You can imply from the guidance that the operating margins aren't going to be significantly different than they were this year. And to Steve's point, in 2014, when we start to see some uplift in the volumes, we expect that we can then enjoy very nice incremental returns on those volumes, given what we'll have done to the cost structure at that point.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","And I wonder if I could just add to that. What we've said is that we have committed that we're going to have run rate savings of $600 million in 2014, realized $500 million. But what we've also said is that we have challenged organizations to give us more. And Bob, in his remarks, said that we've actually challenged the organization that eventually, like have $1 billion in our run rate. So we're doing everything we can to accelerate what we've committed to and also bring in some more. So I'll just leave that as a commentary related to the opportunity there.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, maybe a specific question on the -- you've been asked before about the Celera royalty portfolio, and any thoughts about unlocking some value there? Any update on that thought?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. I'll start it and turn it to Bob. First of all, it is not a destruction, operationally, it is a financial asset. There is some uncertainty around the value. We're thinking about it carefully, and we want to make sure we do the right thing for all shareholders at the right time at the right place to take advantage of that opportunity. So Bob, would you like to add to it?","Robert A. Hagemann","Just that we are evaluating all of the possible options that we've got for those assets. And clearly, we intend to do what's in the best long-term interest of shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First of all, just on flu. I don't think the question was asked, so just wondering, that did come a little early this year, has been significant. And I know it's hard to tease out exactly how it impacts the entirety of the testing business, but could you comment on maybe how you would weight the impact between fourth quarter and what you're seeing year-to-date in January?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Bob's just getting over the flu, as you can probably tell from his voice. So Bob, you answer the question.","Robert A. Hagemann","And I didn't generate any incremental volume [ph]. But -- no, I think flu visits to the doctor's office do not necessarily generate a lot of incremental volume for us, and where there is some, it tends to be pretty low-priced volumes. So yes, I wouldn't look for any material uptick in the numbers as a result of the flu season.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Okay. And then maybe, Steve, as part of your 5-point plan, you guys have talked about the trailing look on organic growth and the end markets you serve. And then some of the opportunities you have to regain share. But just wondering if you could give us some color as to when you think the market will sort of revisit a pace of growth that's consistent with past years, and sort of how you think that'll map against your own performance? Is that saying that you're looking at on a 12- or 18-month horizon any longer?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so what we have said is that we don't think significant -- we're not planning on significant changes in the marketplace in 2013, and that's our assumption in the guidance. The second is we do expect that there will be a pickup in 2014 with the lives entering the system with the Affordable Care Act. And so what we said earlier is we are planning on some organic improvement in 2013 to offset the price pressure. And we have a number of initiatives and programs that we started in 2012. So we do have momentum coming out of the blocks in 2013 that will pick up momentum throughout the year, and that's why we've said that we'll gradually improve throughout the year and better performance in the second half than in the first half. And then as we enter '14, we believe that we'll be in much better shape than we were in 2012 and be able to hit 2014 with a better organization, a better delivery model and a better way to capitalize all the opportunity we see in the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amanda Murphy, William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I have a follow-up question on the hospital professional services business that you're moving into or, I guess, more into. Could you just help us understand how the economics of those contracts might work?  So just thinking about pricing and margin relative to the base business.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, first of all, what we've shared is this is a professional services business with a set of capabilities that we will offer to health care systems through a whole continuum. First of all, the basics that we talked about earlier, there's a large portion of hospitals, about 50% that we currently provide reference testing to today, so we already have a relationship. And then if you go all the way to a full outsource, where we purchase then outreach activity like UMass is the end of the spectrum. So in that continuum, there are services that will look at running labs or providing consultancy services, if you will, for labs. And as we start to build the business, it's a combination of reference work, as well as total outsource. Bob, would you like to add some comments about the margins for it and pricing of it?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, just a point on that. And we mentioned this at Investor Day as well that to degree that some of that growth is coming from outsourcing us i.e.  Managing laboratories for hospitals, that does tend to be lower margin business, but given the fact that there's very little capital investment required to do that for us, tends to be high-incremental returns on invested capital. As we said, that's one of our goals is to drive returns on invested capital, because we believe it'll drive value for shareholders. And as you noticed, we've gotten away from giving guidance around operating income percentage, because, again, it's not necessarily about the percentage, it's about the top line growth and the profits that it can deliver.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So this involves then incrementally more TC-type business, TC-only. And just what are your thoughts on that general model, the TC-PC split?","Robert A. Hagemann","It certainly could involve doing more technical work, but on the AP side. So as we're talking about hospital outsourcing, it's much broader than AP.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Some pieces of the services that we'll offer some portion of their services to us in the short run as we build that client base.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just on the reimbursement side. Obviously, you talked a lot about that, and the Medicare reimbursement pressures presence are well known. I'm just curious on the commercial side. Have you seen -- I mean, is something that's changed in terms of how the commercial payors are viewing the lab business, or how we they're negotiating the contract at this point relative last year?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, well, in the 3% is Medicare. Also, we included in there the large pathology cut that we have received, and we'll be taking this year. And then third is we do have some reasonable commercial pricing changes, but I will not say in the 3% that we're planning, or do we see a substantial change in our relationships in pricing in the industry. Bob, would you like to add to that?","Robert A. Hagemann","No, there is nothing unique happening in 2012 on the commercial side that wasn't anticipated. Yes, this is fully consistent with what we had expected coming into the year. And as we've been talking through 2012 about reimbursement pressure, yes, that was clearly one of the reasons that we felt as though we had to up the ante on the Invigorate initiative, so that we can mitigate that, which was what the point is.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Just to give some color on the 3%, the Medicare piece, we do have a large pathology business. So it has more significant impact to us than maybe some of the other players in the industry. So that is in the number.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And so your point is on the commercial side, it's really just a couple of contracts there. If there's anything in there, it's from a couple of contracts versus the broader change?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, I wouldn't say that   just a couple of contracts. Again, we've spoken about the reimbursement pressure, generally. I think that exists with just about all of the payers. And I wouldn't point to any 1 or 2 contracts that are driving what we expect in 2015.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","The big hits this year are Medicare and the pathology services cut.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, we just want to get a little bit more flavor, Steve, on the 3%. And to the extent, you can just help us to think about just a little more. How does that split out between Medicare pressure and some of the commercial or managed care reimbursement pressures that you see in your book of business?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure, well, 3 pieces. First of all, Medicare, second is the pathology services piece of that and the third is commercial pricing. When we provided visibility in the past in the size of Medicare cut, roughly 5%, there's a significant cut on pathology services, and that is significant for us because of the size of our pathology practice and the rest is commercial. Bob, would you like to provide a little more color to that?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, and Darren, as you know, we've disclosed that our Medicare revenues are in the range of $1 billion or so, so the 5% cut on that is $50 million that drops right down to the bottom line. As Steve pointed out, while we haven't provided guidance or specific information relative to the CPT codes on the pathology side that are facing the biggest cuts.  It is a sizable piece of our business, and some of those codes are facing reimbursement cuts in excess of 50%. So those are big drivers that we have this year that we haven't had in the past.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And if I could just -- as it relates to the molecular diagnostics coding changes, do you have at this point any visibility in terms of what the max MACs [ph] are paying you. And are they paying you a different rate in calendar year '13 based on these molecular diagnostic codes that were set for change?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, it's still very early. We haven't yet seen the reimbursement come through on many of those codes. We're working with the Medicare into mediaries as well as in the commercial plans to try and mitigate any impact that would be there. We're helping them try and crosswalk where they can, provided additional information. And our hope is to mitigate as much as possible an impact that might be there. But again, rates are not yet published, and we've not yet seen reimbursement on those.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. And just so I'm clear about your managed care commentary that you're dialing this 3%. Is that based on your outlook for perspective contract negotiations that will be happening this year? Or are you assuming that private payers will follow Medicare to some extent on some of the Medicare reimbursement changes that you've talked about here in the past and the fee schedule?","Robert A. Hagemann","As we've said, the 3% reimbursement's a combination of multiple things. It's -- the Medicare fee cuts, the AP, CPT code fee cuts, as well as commercial. Obviously, commercial rates can be influenced by Medicare rates. We don't have contracts -- many contracts that necessarily float with Medicare, but it is a reference point in all of our discussions around pricing. But at this point, what we've baked into that 3% is -- what we fully anticipate have good visibility to at this point.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just last thing for me here. I wanted to just clarify, Bob, what you said about the cash flow guidance. I understand that the tax payment, just in terms of the year-over-year cash from operations, being lower in the outlook. Can you maybe just remind be what you said? And how much in terms of restructuring cash costs are also built into that guidance on a year-over-year business?","Robert A. Hagemann","Sure. Two things that you have to look at in comparing the year-over-year cash flow guidance. One has to do with the deferral of a tax payment this past quarter into the first quarter of 2013 that was roughly a $90 million deferral. So it has $180 million year-over-year impact. And that is, you'll recall, in the third quarter of 2012, we unwound some interest rate swaps that we had that generated about $72 million in cash flow for us that we're not expecting to have next year. So those 2 factors combined created about a $250 million impact year-over-year. In terms of restructuring costs and the like, well, we haven't provided guidance on that. The cash impact of restructuring cost is probably not going to be significantly different than it was this past year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve or Bob, have you indicated -- any idea what kind of proceeds you'd get from the 2 divestitures that you have announced in? Should we expect significantly more activity going forward? Or are we near the end of the pipeline there?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Bob, we've not given any guidance on that. I will tell you though that the OralDNA sale that did close very modest proceeds from that. And, obviously, since we are in discussions around HemoCue right now, we're not providing any estimate as to what the estimated proceeds might be there. What you also heard us say at Investor Day though is we were evaluating the entire portfolio, that includes the other products businesses, the Celera products businesses. And as we referenced earlier on this call, we are evaluating all of our options for the Celera drug assets as well.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But you wrote a fairly sizable check for HemoCue a few years back, are we getting half of that back. I mean is it a total wash? Or how do we think about that relative to what the premium paid at the time was?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Bob, as you did see, we recorded a charge in discontinued operations. So clearly, we're not expecting proceeds from those businesses, which will match what we paid up for them. But again, at this point, I don't think it would do any of us here a service by speculating what we might get at this point.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And did you mention the CapEx number's higher this year? What exactly are we spending on this year that wasn't in the numbers last year? .","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Bob, there's 2 things, principally, that are driving the increase. The first and the biggest component is the spending relative to Invigorate, which we expect to ramp up as we start to now rationalize and optimize the footprint, look more at automation opportunities, et cetera. That is ramping up this year end. And in addition, in connection with the UMass transaction, we are building out the facility that we're going to move into. And that's adding some additional expenditures. Those are the 2 principal drivers.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And would you answer the guess [ph], obviously, '14, '15, but the number should trend down from a peak level in '13 or no?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, what we said at Investor Day's for the next several years we expect that CapEx will probably be about 1% of revenues higher than it has historically run, and we expect that to be the case for the next couple of years or so.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","I just like to add, as we continue to get some refinement on our Invigorate program, we shared in the past there's a number of initiatives that were taking cost out of the operation from, but the longer-term structural improvement will require investment in the future. We haven't exactly sized that, so we want to make sure that it's clear that we will continue to invest in the business to make sure that this is a stronger business. And as we push to get more in from our Invigorate program, strive for that $1 billion goal, it will require some investments in our facilities and also our IT systems, and that's what we're trying to size. When we get visibility of it, we'll provide it to you.","Operator","The next question comes from Glen Santangelo, Credit Suisse.","Jeffrey Bailin","This is Jeff in for Glen this morning. Just one question for you on the anatomic pathology in sourcing trend. What are you guys seeing in respect to this? And do you think that the pathology cuts could actually ultimately maybe help shift some of those volumes back to independent laboratories like yourself?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. Well, first of all, it's early, so the market is digesting the cuts, clearly, as a significant cut for that service. It's on the technical side. So you put the typical side together with the professional side, it's not big as a cup, but it's a material change for that portion of the marketplace. So we're watching. We're not sure how it's going to pan out, but you can't ignore it. So we're anxious to see how it will wash through, given we are a significant player, and that there will be some change happening in the marketplace, so we're keeping our eyes on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but if we can talk just a little bit about what particular parts of your business right now you feel are stronger? What particular testing categories are stronger? If you want to talk a little bit more about your genomic esoteric goals in terms of percent of your business going forward?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure. Well, I'll start and pass it to Bob. We talked about the hospital fees having growth, so we're encouraged by that. Second is -- so we continue to focus on a more sophisticated esoteric testing. We continue to be encouraged by the growth there. Third is that we continue to see some specialized areas of that we're in. Prescription drug monitoring continue to grow nicely. And as we go forward, what you have seen from us in terms of organizational structure, we will put more emphasis on our new organization to commercialize all the science and innovation and capabilities in this company, which I believe has not been properly utilized. So you'll see more specific areas of testing and solutions around that testing, which we believe will help us restore growth. Bob, would you like to add to that?","Robert A. Hagemann","And as -- Yes, we've shared with you already too, but yes, we are organizing around certain franchises, disease states. You might think of them as your neurology infections disease, cancer and cardiovascular disease, women's health, general health. And we believe that we'll be able to drive growth in each of those. A lot of it will be in the esoteric testing side, but there's also some areas that we expect to regain some traction on women's health in area in particular that we would expect that we can see improved performance versus what we've seen over the last year or so.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Taylor, Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, just a quick house cleaning. The HemoCue business that was sold, that was never reported in any of the testing revenue disclosure in the supplemental disclosure, is that right? So when I look at some of the year-over-year changes none of that would have been impacted by the reclass of the HemoCue?","Robert A. Hagemann","That is correct, Gary. It was a product business and it was included in what we previously referred to as our nonclinical testing segment, which today is called Diagnostic Solutions or DS. So it didn't impact any of those other metrics that you saw, volumes or revenue per work [ph].","Kathleen Valentine","And just to clarify, HemoCue is not yet sold. We plan to sell it.","Robert A. Hagemann","Correct.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. 2013 operating margin, I guess, kind of our back of the envelope at the middle of your guidance is that if you deploy after dividend all your free cash flow to repurchase, then the operating margin assumption is roughly flat. And if you repurchased no shares, then operating margin will be down about 100 basis points to kind of get to your midpoint of guidance. So given that you said you'll do more share repurchase, I mean, is that -- are we essentially framing that correctly that somewhere between flat and down 100 basis points is in the range based on the amount of share repurchase?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well we certainly do anticipate doing share repurchases. And as I said earlier, I'd expect that it's going to be greater than the level that we did in 2012, given that the delevering is behind us at this point, although we haven't given specific guidance on that. But the other thing I would mention to you is while we've not provided guidance relative to the operating income percentage, given that we're expecting 3% reimbursement pressure next year, much of the Invigorate savings is going to mitigate that at this point. And you shouldn't expect there to be significant expansion in margins next year.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In '14, Stephen mentioned double-digit earnings, I guess, given that share repurchase in any given year looks like it could add 5%. You're expecting a little bit of volume growth. Is it fair to say your expectation operating margin in '14 is flat to up?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, let's not go to '14 at this point. We're  not prepared to give guidance there, other than as you've heard us say, we are optimistic that we're going to see an uptick in volumes. And certainly, we expect that any incremental volume will start to realize in '14 given what we have done for the cost structure, can be very profitable.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","And what we said is that our earnings growth will be a combination of operating improvements, as well as share repurchase.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So I did hear double-digit earnings growth '14 though earlier in the call. Correct?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","You did, in '14 effectively.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, final question, Bob, could just remind us on '13 and '14 commercial contract renewals. Any of the big guys that stand out for those 2 years?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, this year, there's only one national contract that's coming up. We've mentioned that CIGNA is the one national that's coming up. Every year, we always have regional plans that are coming up that we're dealing with, but just the one single national contract this year.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then '14?","Robert A. Hagemann","We're not going out in terms of '14 and giving a specific guidance on contracts.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter Conference Call.

Go ahead, please.","Dan Haemmerle","Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.","A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today, in the Investor Relations 'quarterly updates' section of our Web site at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the Web site.","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks, Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I will provide you with highlights of the quarter. We will share industry trends and also review progress we are making against our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.","During the third quarter we delivered against our expectations. Continued to make progress against our strategy and reported top and bottom line growth. In the quarter, revenues grew 6.5% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to $1.10 and cash from operations was strong at $271 million.","What I would like to do is start with some brief comments on industry trends. We have said, diagnostic information is a powerful lever for transforming healthcare and we are determined to be paid appropriate for the value we provide. In this respect our trade association has been getting the message out about the value of diagnostic information to healthcare. We are making progress as an industry but the reimbursement dynamics continue to evolve and there is much more to do.","To give you an example, in July, Tricare announced it had committed to restoring payment for 40 molecular codes that had previously been denied in some cases. During the third quarter, we saw progress of payment on codes that previously had been denied. This is a nice sign of progress we are making as an industry.","Also in April, Congress passed the so called Doc Fix legislation that delayed adjustments to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule until 2017. We have been working with our industry trade association to participate in a rule making process. This will define new rates based on a market weighted median of commercial rates from a broad range of labs which include both large and small independent labs as well as hospital outreach labs. We remain hopeful that this will produce a representative view of market\u2010based pricing.","Being appropriately reimbursed for the value we provide is critical to our success and we compete on a compelling value proposition, not solely on price. Also, we continue to work closely with our trade association on another important issue. And that is to oppose the FDA\u2019s proposal to regulate laboratory developed tests, referred to as LDTs. We strongly believe that unnecessary and duplicative regulation could delay patient access to life saving treatments and compromise America\u2019s leadership in diagnostic discovery.","Regarding the Affordable Care Act, while it\u2019s still early, we continued to see modest shifts from uninsured patient volumes in the third quarter to government and other payers. Regarding the market dynamics, we saw additional signs of improvement in healthcare utilization during the quarter. And then finally, we will provide you an update on our views on the market and the competitive landscape at our Investor Day in New York City on November 5th.","Now let\u2019s look at the progress we\u2019re making executing our five point strategy. Our top priority is restoring growth and we again made solid progress in the quarter. The investments we\u2019ve made and efforts to improve our sales effectiveness are yielding positive results. We saw continued improvement in sequential trends in revenues, organic volume and organic price. If we exclude business we walked away from, organic revenues would be favorable. Revenues showed strong growth in several product categories driven by our clinical franchises, which included prescription drug monitoring, health and wellness, and infectious disease.","Last quarter we told you about the partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Our plans were to provide annotated reports on solid tumor analysis based on a panel of 34 clinically actionable gene mutations. We launched those expanded OncoVantage panels during the third quarter. Solid tumor cancers account for about 90% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States every year.","Also, as promised, we began to offer our customers national access to Sequenom\u2019s non\u2010invasive prenatal test. And we continue to build our professional lab services business and finalized yet another agreement with a medium sized community hospital on the East Coast. We are making good progress advancing conversations from our pipeline into proposals and new business. These are all great examples of how we are empowering better health with diagnostic insights to make this a better world.","We are also making progress on other key areas of our strategy. We made a number of advances in our effort to improve our customer experience by driving operational excellence. We opened our lab of the future in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which will use advanced automation technology to improve the quality and efficiency of diagnostic testing for the New England market.","The Invigorate program remains on track to deliver the expected cost savings this year. As you know, the company shared an initial target of $500 million in July of 2011. Since then, we have increased that target to $600 million. Delivered the original target a year earlier, and now expect to exceed the new run rate target by delivering $700 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014. Over the past year, we have been advising you that we will update our future plans for Invigorate at Investor Day. We intend to deliver on that commitment and we will provide you with additional details on our plans to deliver total run rate savings in excess of $1 billion.","In addition, we made progress integrating recent acquisitions. We told you that Solstas and Summit were expected to be dilutive for the first half of 2014 but accretive in the back half as we work through our integration plans. We are pleased with the progress we have made realizing the expected synergies. I\u2019m happy to report that these acquisitions as well as Steward and ConVerge, were all accretive on an adjusted basis during the quarter.","The third element of our strategy is to simplify the organization to enable our top priorities of growth and operational excellence. Our simplify strategy extends well beyond our organizational redesign to also include improving our organizational capabilities, culture and processes. We continue to strengthen the management team and build a high performance culture.","And we have also continued to strengthen our board. Recently, the board elected Dr. Jeffrey Leiden as our newest Director. He currently serves as Chairman, CEO and President of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Jeff is the third new board member added this year with significant CEO experience. Coupling this with his deep management, scientific and clinical background in healthcare, this will strengthen and complement our board\u2019s capabilities.","Finally, we continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment and refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We generated $271 million in cash from operations during the quarter. We utilized that strong cash flow performance to return value to our shareholders through dividends and stock buyback program and to repay debt associated with the Solstas transaction.","As you can see, we continued to make progress executing our five point strategy. Now, Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and update you on our latest guidance details. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were 6.5% ahead of the prior year. Excluding acquisitions and the divestiture of the Enterix business last year, our underlying consolidated revenues were essentially flat to the prior year, reflecting another sequential step forward in our path to restoring growth.","Our diagnostic information services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew by 7.1% compared to the prior year. Revenue per requisition in Q3 was 60 basis points lower than the prior year. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, revenue per requisition was slightly favorable versus the prior year, and improved sequentially from the second quarter of 2014. Compared to a year ago, price pressure continued to moderate and we benefited from favorable test mix.","Volume for the quarter was 7.8% favorable to the prior year. Recent acquisitions added approximately 8% to volumes. Last quarter, I shared that we had made prudent decisions regarding pricing and in some cases decided to walk away from existing business. Excluding the impact on revenue from these decisions, our underlying volumes were favorable to the prior year by approximately 1.5% and represents another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year volume growth.","Q3 revenues in our diagnostic solutions businesses which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, were lower by about 70 basis points compared to the prior year. The divestiture of Enterix reduced revenues for our diagnostic solutions businesses by nearly 2%. Excluding this impact, our diagnostic solutions businesses grew by approximately 1% compared to the third quarter of a year ago.","Adjusted operating income at 16% of revenues was about 50 basis points below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to the increased funding of management compensation compared to a year ago and the initial lower margin profile on our recent acquisitions. Earlier this year we shared with you that we expected the Summit and Solstas acquisitions to be dilutive in the first half of the year and accretive in the back half of the year. I am happy to report that these acquisitions were accretive in the third quarter on an adjusted basis as we made nice progress on those integration plans.","In addition to delivering on our integration plans, we continued to make progress on our Invigorate program. We continue to expect to achieve approximately $200 million in realized savings during 2014 and approach approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit the year, with a longer term goal of greater than $1 billion over time. As I shared last quarter, we will provide additional details at our Investor Day in November.","Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was 7.8% better than a year ago. As a result of the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to restore growth, drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, reported operating income was reduced by $48 million, principally related to restructuring and integration costs. This reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.6% and reported EPS by $0.22. Last year\u2019s third quarter reported operating income from continuing operations included the gain on the sale of Ibrutinib royalty rights, the loss on sale of the Enterix business and restructuring and integration costs. These items resulted in a net benefit to reported operating income of $395 million or $1.64 per diluted share.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. Our DSOs were 46 days, a 1 day improvement from last quarter. Cash from operations was $271 million in the quarter compared to $186 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $102 million in the quarter compared to $51 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $25 million of our common shares at an average price of $62.03. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments for the year by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","We also made progress against our debt repayment commitment by reducing our debt by approximately $90 million in the quarter.","Turning to guidance. We now expect full year 2014 results from continuing operations, before special items, as follows. Revenues to grow approximately 3.5% compared to a year ago versus 2.5% to 3.5% previously. Adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.03 and $4.07 compared to previous guidance of $4.00 and $4.10. Cash provided by operations to approximate $900 million and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks, Mark. Mark, if I recall correctly, about a year ago you joined Quest. And actually a year ago on this call you shared several priorities. And those priorities included improving our predictability and supporting the business to achieve our five point strategy. Just as we are making progress on our five point strategy, we are also making progress on our commitment to improve our guidance and deliver on our commitments.","Well, to summarize. We delivered a second solid quarter of top line growth as we continue to build momentum. We made good progress executing our strategy and our Invigorate program remains firmly on track. As a result, we delivered 8% earnings per share growth and we are on track to meet our commitments for 2014.","And then finally, I would like to share, I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day where we will provide some longer term perspective and deeper updates on our strategic plan. Now, we would be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser. Sir, your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","First, a quick question on the volume number. Mark, you talked about 1.5% organic volume figure for the quarter which I think is the best number that you have done for a very long time. So can you just share with us, where are the volumes coming from? Are you seeing it from exchange population, Medicaid population, or are you starting to see improvement in core business utilization? And also just kind of the margins that are associated with the new business.","Mark Guinan","Thanks for the question Ricky. Couple of things. First off, organic volume was pretty flat year-over-year. What I talked about is, there were a couple of specific accounts that we had made a decision based on pricing to walk away from, earlier in the year. And what I said is, if you exclude those then that volume would have been up 1.5%. But nonetheless, I think the important message is that organic volume trends continue to improve. And when we started in the beginning of 2013, minus 200 basis points, since then we have crossed the threshold to less than 100 basis points of decline. And now essentially organic volume has been flat in the most recent quarters.","So there is an improving trend. Where is that coming from? I think it's somewhat across the board by payer type. We did say there was some reduction in the uninsured. We had continued to see some modest growth in Medicaid. However, it's really in some of the growth past our franchises that we have talked about before. So PDM continues to be an area of strength. Hepatitis C continues to be an area of strength. Obviously, we have launched our BRCA offering which is growing. So it's no single payer. I couldn\u2019t certainly attribute it specifically to anything in the Affordable Care Act. Although, certainly it seems like it\u2019s directionally positive. So that\u2019s what I would say is, it's continued growth in the areas that have been growing and just utilization picking up a little bit and then I think just our business gaining strength.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just kind of like, one follow-up there. Obviously, I think last quarter you said that the impact on volume, once you normalize from the businesses you exit was about 1%. It seems like it is 1.5% now. So is this a function of you exiting additional accounts, or is this just kind of like an impact of a full quarter of the same existing business that you have exited last quarter?","Mark Guinan","It's the same account. It's not additional accounts. So it's really just the impact in this quarter was a little larger than the impact in the previous quarter, given the timing.","Stephen Rusckowski","What you see though as you said it, is as we\u2019ve said consistently, we are going to move step-by-step improving our underlying business. And you see some underlying improvement in the third quarter versus Q2. So we feel good about that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Glen Santangelo. Sir, your line is open.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Steve, just wanted to follow up with you on some of the pricing comments that you made. It seems like the company also experienced a sequential improvement in organic pricing trends. And so I am wondering if you could just maybe give us a little bit more color and clarity around what you are seeing in terms of Medicaid pricing? Any big commercial contracts coming up or what's really driven that slightly better organic pricing number?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes, sure. Thanks, Glen. If you go back to 2012, we have been consistently talking about this. We provided guidance that over a three-year period we expected real price, and when we say real price it\u2019s really freezing other variables and just looking at unit price changes with contracts and Medicare, Medicaid reimbursement, would be reduced by 1% to 2%. It was higher in 2013. And then what we also said is, we believe it's going to be lower this year into 2015. And we actually believe we are on track to achieve that guidance we provided.","In that respect, we are seeing lower year-on-year comparisons on pricing, sequential year-on-year comparisons in price. Contractually, we have the visibility of this. We don\u2019t have any major renewals coming forward. We already shared with you the effect of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule on our price this year, which was about 1.75% this year. And then also what we see overall if you look at revenue per req, is a mix in our business. So when you go through that mix in our business which is different than what we talk about with price, this quarter and even compared to Q2 we saw a richer mix which generated revenue per req which was favorable. So, Mark, I don\u2019t know if you would like to add to any of that.","Mark Guinan","Yes. I think Steve covered it. We said in the first quarter price was down about 100 basis points and second quarter about 80 basis points, and this quarter was down about 30. I think it's a combination of the timing of contracts being more disciplined but also, quite frankly, putting more rigor into our pricing efforts across the organization on things such as client bill negotiations and things like that. So I think as an organization we have really instilled a greater discipline around price and obviously we are also benefitting from the timing of contracts that we didn\u2019t benefit from in 2013.","And then to Steve's mention of revenue per req, when you exclude the impact of acquisition mix as I said, revenue per req was actually up and so it was some slight price decline offset by some favorable tests and payer mix.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","And maybe if I could just follow up with one sort of longer-term question on pricing. Obviously, a lot of questions around 2017 and the potential changes to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And I think, Steve, you commented on some of the lobbying efforts that are going on. Could you maybe give us some of your initial reactions with maybe how you see market pricing being defined by the regulations and who is included and who is excluded in that sort of market price? And are you sort of happy with the direction that\u2019s heading as obviously it's going to have some impact on your business and I am just curious if there is any comments to kind of make, initial comments to make at this point. Thank you.","Stephen Rusckowski","Glen, I appreciate that. Well, as I said, we are working hard as a trade association. We are all working on this because it's very important. First of all, we are working with CMS on the rule making process to make sure we get it right. And as a matter of fact a couple of weeks ago we were visiting CMS and we were talking through how they will gather the data. You cannot get a full view of the market without all the competitors in the market. And as I said in my introductory comments, that includes large independent labs like ourselves, smaller independents and hospital outreach. We have been consistent on that and we are trying to work through just how we will collect the data from all those three pieces to get a real representative view on the market.","As you know, there is wide variation in pricing and actually we provided in the market from the trade association, a quick snapshot on what we believe the true market-based pricing would be by certain codes we did a sample on. And we look at that actually, the CMS prices are not widely out of line from the median that we had sought on the market in that survey. So we will continue to work through the rule making process. They will gather the data in 2016. And Glen, until you gather the data you do not know what the results are. But if we have a thorough process, a good process and we really gather the data to really get a market-based price, we believe that the outcome will be the outcome but it's not nearly as bad as what some people have intended. But we have got some work in front of us to keep on working on this to get it right in the process and gather the data correctly and correctly represent that in the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Cherny. Sir, your line is open.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group","So I want to delve a little bit more into some of the commentary you had around the business that you walked away from. As you think about, I think you did this on pretty much contract by contract basis, but what are some of the metrics specifically? I assume it's not just price or just margin. I mean how much of it is impacted by the return you got from the businesses. Maybe walk through some of the financial metrics that will cause you to say that this contract or this business is no longer for us.","Stephen Rusckowski","Let me start and then I'm going to turn it to Mark. First of all, we're trying to build value as you would expect we would. And in building value we're trying to make sure that we drive earnings per share growth which you saw this quarter. And in that regard there is lots of levers and one of which is price. And in our portfolio of our clients and our customers, and we have a wide range of customers and clients. And so what we have done in executing our plans is to take a careful look at all the business we do and to make sure we keep on getting as much value out of those accounts as possible.","So some of this I would describe it as hygiene to keep on working through our portfolio of businesses and some of the actions we have taken have helped us improve our margins and you see that reflected in this quarter's results. But, Mark, why don't you add to that, specifically what have we adjusted for to get to 1.5% growth, when we adjust for these decisions we have made.","Mark Guinan","Yes, I think even Michael was asking also about the decision criteria. So, yes, obviously the margin is a significant driver in the decision which of course is the outcome of price, with some variables depending on where the geographic location for that business is and therefore what are the other costs associated with it, such as logistics and so on and so forth. What does the book of business look like in terms of the test mix and the payer mix. So there is a number of things that go into it. Pricing is the biggest driver in that margin decision but there are some cost variables as well that we look at.","I think the importance here in why we decided to share it was we wanted to send the message that not all volume is value creating volume and we are focused on value creating volume. And there is also some competitors in the marketplace that compete on price, that is not us. And to the extent that we find ourselves in situations where the price is not rational, we are going to walk away and we are going to stick with our strategy. So that's really why we decided to share this. It's not as much about in some way modeling a organic volume and suggesting it's different than what the actual results are, but helping people understand that volume alone is not going to give you margin and growth, your bottom line and your cash flow, but it's got to be value creating volume.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group","Thanks. And then just one quick question or quick thought on some of these hospital outsource arrangements. So obviously a new opportunity for you. Can you talk about how some of those conversations evolve? You talked about the midsized hospital on the East Coast. What led them to decide to work with you and then over time what type of capacity you have to add on incremental types of these contracts?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes. It comes to us in a lot of different ways, Mike. First of all, we have a sales force that's selling to about 50% of the hospitals. So we have good presence in all the hospital systems throughout the United States with our sales force. Second is, we have very good executive access. And when we talk about this as part of our strategy, we have garnered a lot of interest from hospital executives. And quite often myself and a few of the leaders on this business are spending time discussing with hospital CEOs and typically there CFO, what their lab strategy is. And like so much in healthcare, you see one then you see one. And so we sit down and we have a conversation about our lab strategy and we talk about the whole range of possibilities of different working relationships, where we can do reference work, we could buy your outreach business, we can form a joint venture. We can run your hospital laboratory, which we call laboratory management. And we eventually end up with a place that is tailored to what they are trying to achieve in their system.","And so the contracts and engagements we have announced, all are very different, all are quite different. And I could tell you that some are small community hospitals and some discussions that we are having are large, very large integrated delivery systems that are substantially re-engineering what they are doing in healthcare. And as part of that they are thinking about where they put their resources and what's the best approach to laboratory services. And in that respect we are generally thought of as a trusted partner and we could help them with that. So that\u2019s the way we approach it.","Mark Guinan","And I just want to add, Mike, just to be clear. When you ask about capacity, certainly a lot of these deals come with reference work. So we may have been doing the reference work or we may be getting the reference work. But in many cases we are actually managing their work for us. So it's not additional strain on our lab capacity. It's actually our capabilities to help them run their lab better together with our procurement leverage, is really where the value creation comes from. So it's not bringing all their in-house testing into the walls of our laboratory. It's actually running their lab for them with their people.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group","No, that\u2019s very helpful.","Stephen Rusckowski","Just to add to that. When we have a large hospital laboratory management deal, what we arrive at is an opportunity for them to save somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% on their hospital based laboratory cost. And one potential strategy we deploy to get there is we take a portion of their menu and we actually move it to our geographic laboratory in the system. The more high volume oriented portion of their menu where we could still respond in an adequate way to meet the requirements of running their hospital. And so it's good for us because as you know most of our laboratories are really in full force starting at midnight to 8 o'clock in the morning. And so during the day we actually have a lot of capacity idle and so it's an opportunity for us to use that capacity to help with this portion of our business.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Clair. Sir, your line is open.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","I guess the first one from me, just wondering, you spoke about the FDA regulation of LDTs. So just curious, what your exposure there is and what do you think the cost would be to push these through for approval?","Stephen Rusckowski","Well, first of all as you all know, we are already regulated. So we already meet the requirements of CLIA. So we have already have oversight. And so the question that we all have as an industry is, why do we need more and some portion of this would be redundant with what we are already meeting. And so there is a concern about how these two (indiscernible) as we go forward. And frankly the proposal in the language has been silent on that topic.","Second is, in essence, what the language would say is that LDTs are devices, medical devices. And when you meet the regs of medical devices, there are substantial changes in getting regulatory approval for new products and also having a quality system that meet those regs. We haven't provided the size of that for labs like ourselves but it's not insignificant. And there's two parts again. There is one getting a new product to the marketplace and new solution to the marketplace and then second is, running your operation on a day to day basis.","Our concern, particularly when new innovation comes to the marketplace is, what it would take for us to bring new innovation. Particularly in the case where some laboratory developed tests may require a PMA for approval and that\u2019s a lengthy drawn up process. Where today we believe we can with good data, support that our LDTs we introduce to the marketplace are safe and efficacious and therefore do not require what a device manufacture would need, and that\u2019s our position on it. So we haven't sized it. We haven't provided it. But it is substantial. There is concern about the redundancy that we would have in this industry. And what we would like to do is to understand what we can do to bring these points forward as a trade association and we are doing that.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I was just hoping that we could get a quick update on some of the women's health products. So specifically, Pap volumes, BRCAvantage and IPT?","Stephen Rusckowski","Sure. Mark mentioned where we are getting some of our growth. Well, BRCA continues to grow. We are seeing nice sequential pickup in our offering in the marketplace. As you know, that\u2019s a big market and a market that\u2019s still growing and we are starting to gain some share. So we feel good about progress made there. In non-invasive prenatal testing, we talked about our introduction of Sequenom's solution in the marketplace. We are seeing nice growth in that market. And as far as Pap is concerned, we continue to see the slowdown of volumes quarter on quarter until we get to some normal steady state of volumes given the new clinical guidelines that are out there in the marketplace. So we still haven't quite bottomed out there yet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier. Sir, your line is open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group","Steve, you said that you saw a richer mix of business. Was any of that mix onetime in nature? Was it a trend of higher priced tests that you expect to continue? I assme the BRCA test is one positive factor there that should continue but are there others?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes. So if you look at some of the growth we talked about, most of the products we are introducing in our clinical franchise is our new solutions that have higher prices. And so therefore if you look at the mix going forward, you should see some effect for that on a continual basis. So that\u2019s some of it. Second is, we did say that the acquisitions that we brought into the sector are revenue per req, and if you adjust for that we actually saw the improvement year-on-year. But there is nothing here that was one big one off if you will, if that\u2019s what you are asking, that won't continue going forward. Mark, you will like to add to that?","Mark Guinan","Yes. Just to add to that. Steve talked about the fact that we had actually Tricare payments. But as we have said before, and I will confirm, it's not material. So it's good to see that. That\u2019s a positive sign. But that was not an extraordinary catch up. It's not significant in terms of our overall revenue but still nice to see. So absolutely not. This is really where the business is trending. There is nothing unusual and actually we would expect to see more growth in those higher value hence higher priced areas and favorable mix going forward. The one exception is, we've talked about our laboratory professional services does have a lower revenue per req. So obviously depending on the timing of some of those deals, that could have a mix impact that goes the other direction. But as we have also stated that despite the lower margins, those are very attractive from a return on invested capital perspective. So still very value creating.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group","Okay. And the unprofitable business that you walked away from, were these contracts that you had to terminate, were you able to renegotiate terms and similar agreements that you ended up not terminating? And are there more of these that you may walk away from in the current quarter or in the 2015?","Mark Guinan","Yes. What I would say is, as Steve mentioned, we did some hygiene work. So we looked across our portfolio and we looked at some specific books of business that we didn\u2019t think were creating acceptable value. We engaged with those parties around some pricing discussions, weren't able to come to a reasonable outcome in our onion. And that was kind of a discrete exercise which I would call a portfolio rationalization. As we go forward, we are going to have the same discipline in any new offerings, any renegotiations etc. etc. So there always could be, for the same reason, account that we walk away from because we say, hey, given your pricing position and the competitive price environment, this just doesn't make sense for us.","However, I don't want anyone to think that there is going to be regular rhythm of exiting accounts. This was really kind of a refresh of our portfolio and that\u2019s we have taken the time to talk about it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Darren Lehrich. Sir, your line is open.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","So I just wanted to come back to the margin topic. It sounds like you clearly exited some unprofitable business that accelerated in the third quarter. And then Mark you are describing a little bit of a pick up from Tricare and I think you said in your prepared remarks that the deals were accretive in the second half versus dilutive. So when we look at margins down year-over-year and sort of a stable pricing environment and some of the things you are describing. What are some of the other factors at play with margin? Is it the mix of your hospital management business? Maybe just help us think about the margin decline year-over-year despite, I guess, some of the things you have described in the exited businesses which were a drag.","Mark Guinan","So obviously, Darren, margin is our total enterprise and when you look at despite the fact that the acquisitions were accretive, they are not yet to the margins of the ongoing organic business. So from a mix perspective year-over-year since we didn\u2019t have those books of business, there is some negative mix impact. We also reference the fact that, we have talked several times about the fact that management incentive comp would be a headwind this year because last year we didn\u2019t pay out anywhere near the target and we are still accruing and hoping and expecting to pay out more to that target. So that\u2019s a headwind as well. And then we have talked about inflation. But with the $200 million we are getting from Invigorate, largely those two things, the inflation and the management comp, should be offset.","So really what you are looking at here largely is a combination of the mix impact of the new book of business we have and then bad debt was up 40 basis points year-over-year. And I would really say, those are really the contributors to that decline. So we feel good about the margin going forward, the margin profile. Certainly also as you mentioned, some of these laboratory professional services which were really just starting to ramp up, initially just like an acquisition those margins are now or they are going to be in the long run because there is things to do to get those operationally to their long term margin. So it's a lot of different pieces but we feel good about generally where our margin is heading.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just remind us, again the management incentive comp, the year-over-year impact on margin from that?","Mark Guinan","We haven't quantified it. But typically we said, hey, and previously if we get about $200 million of Invigorate savings, when you add merit inflation and I guess SWB inflation and the management comp, we had a big chunk of that was going to be taken up for both of those items. So it's not insignificant.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then my follow-up here is just, as it relates to like your pathology. You mentioned some modest success with Tricare. We have been hearing that still a lot of the State Medicaid programs are challenging in terms of getting paid for molecular pathology. So how much is still out there in terms of what was denied and can you just give us a brief update on how you are seeing the progress with some of the state programs.","Stephen Rusckowski","Dan, why don't you take that one?","Dan Haemmerle","Yes, Darren, we have said in the past the total molecular coding impact for us when you look at the umbrella of tests we're looking at, represented about 5% of consolidated revenues. That puts an umbrella over the entire amount. When you look at this and that 5% across all payers, okay, commercial payers, government payers, etc., we continue to work through this with all the payers, commercial payers as well as government. And on the Medicaid program, that's state by state and its code by code. So we are engaging in different discussions in different states and a different levels of success. We spoke to one state last year that had overturned their position and started to reimburse on a particular code late in last year. So there was a positive sign there.","Other states have been more challenged to move the bar with that. But it's something we continue to work on and we look at. The state we reference last year, we look at the Tricare scenario here that we talked about earlier today, is two good proof points and we will continue to work the issue one payer at a time.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Isaac Ro. Sir, your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Just wanted to a question about fourth quarter seasonality. You know we have seen an uptick in healthcare utilization across the board, I think in the fourth quarter for the last few years. And I'm wondering if your guidance for the rest of the year assumes that that trend will continue or perhaps increase this fourth quarter.","Stephen Rusckowski","Mark, why don't you take a [shot at] (ph) seasonality we see in Q4 typically?","Mark Guinan","Yes. Obviously, when we model any given quarter, we model the year, we take into account historical performance. So any sort of seasonality we may or may not have seen would be one of the basis for our forecast. So I don't think we are expecting any significant deviation from our quarterly pattern. So really what's driving Q4 is where we see the business trending, both in terms of some of the growth areas, some of the areas that may be a little drag like Paps. And then things like potential for laboratory professional service in fields and so on and so forth.","So we are expecting a, I think as we get into this time of year, a average weather month. So we certainly have built in, based on history, some sort of weather impact. But nothing extraordinarily good or nothing extraordinarily bad at this point.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","If I could just scratch you a little bit there. I mean what is different this year then of course the enrollment for ACA and all that is changing. Deductibles and cost burdens and so forth. So there is plenty of reason to think that people might be deferring utilization till the end of the year and all that. So I am just curious, as you think about forecasting, that was a meaningful change to your process?","Mark Guinan","That certainly, I think could be within the trends we have already seen from the third quarter, some of that. Maybe more pronounced in Q4, given, hey, I got a procedure better I do it in December than January. Is it material enough at this point? Is it materially different enough from what it has been historically? Don\u2019t know. We have not certainly built anything that\u2019s a major shift change. So, yes, I think that dynamic has always existed with people that have high deductible plans and certainly the trend has been more and more private plans as well have a high deductible feature. So we have not assumed any major impact from the Affordable Care Act that will kind of skew fourth quarter. And if it's upside, we will be pleasantly pleased as much as anybody else.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Amanda Murphy. Ma'am, your line is open.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","I just had a follow-up on the PMA discussion. So in terms of the inclusion or exclusion of hospitals, do you have a sense of how CMS is looking at some of the new bundling legislation that they have proposed for 2015 as part of [hops] (ph)? Does that meaningfully impact who from a hospital perspective may or may not be included in who is providing data for the 2017 pricing?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes. It's a good question, Amanda. Bundled payments in hospital in-patient obviously is a cost for hospitals and therefore when you think about their revenues, as a matter of fact if you look at the language that was in the bill, it says the majority of their Medicare revenues are from the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And if you are running a hospital outreach, that\u2019s the majority of your lab revenues to Medicare therefore they should be included. So the bundle side and the in-patient DRG side of hospital in-patient laboratories is part of the cost of doing business of running that hospital. And really what we are looking at is that outreach portion of that should be included because that is the market as we all know.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","And is that still roughly about a third of the hospital market. I think that\u2019s what the data suggested historically in terms of just outreach.","Stephen Rusckowski","It depends on what -- but if you look at the market, it's roughly about 40% of the total market, this hospital outreach.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Okay.","Stephen Rusckowski","The total market. And the rest is independent laboratories, big and small.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Got it. And then on the molecular, the Tricare and the low Pap pricing situation. I don\u2019t know if I am -- maybe this is a bit of wishful thinking, but have you guys got any sense of whether you might get anything from a retroactive perspective at this point?","Stephen Rusckowski","Mark, you want to take that?","Mark Guinan","Yes. I don\u2019t. I think we have been pretty consistent and we don\u2019t expect any major windfalls from retroactive reimbursement. So even on Tricare, we mentioned that we were getting paid for a portion of Tricare all along for the active military personal. Many of these were covered. It was really for the retirees of the family members. So it's not as if we are getting paid nothing. And so once in a while you may get a windfall, like in 2013 we mentioned there was one state that started reimbursing for cystic fibrosis and it went retroactively back to the beginning of the year. But still you are talking about small millions not anything in the tens of millions or anything that would be materially significant.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Willoughby. Sir, your line is open.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Steve or Mark, just two quick ones. Can you comment at all on the Solstas revenue retention rate and possibly could you size the fuel opportunity year-over-year. What kind of benefit might you see there?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes. So first of all, we are pleased with the integration of Solstas, we said that in our introductory comments. We are working nicely through our integration work which we feel good about. As we mentioned, many of these acquisitions we justify the business case based upon cost synergies. And we are integrating Solstas nicely into our operation. We feel good about that. As we make the transition, we have integrated two separate sales forces into one. We feel good that that has happened in an orderly way and in general we are tracking to what our business plan was for that business so far. And as we said, it's accretive along with other acquisitions this quarter. So we feel good about that. And also in the back half we expect that to continue. So, Mark, anything you would like to add?","Mark Guinan","No. I mean as Steve mentioned, we are tracking pretty much on our business case. And as we have shared in the past when we model these kind of acquisitions for conservatism, we do build in some level of attrition in each of these deals because despite of our best efforts to not lose any of those accounts, history has demonstrated that there are various reasons why you will get some attrition. So I would say, right now Bob, like Steve shared, we are pretty much on track to our business case.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And the fuel?","Mark Guinan","You mean fuel for growth in 2015?","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, I am sorry. Just gasoline prices being down, it's not a huge opportunity, but...","Mark Guinan","Yes. I mean certainly that\u2019s better news than we would have thought six month ago or so. So, yes, we are still in the process, Bob, and obviously I am not going to talk about any guidance or anything else for 2015. We are still in the process of putting up plans together for 2015. But certainly that\u2019s a good tailwind at least for now since we have a large fleet and certainly that should be helpful.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","We are talking pennies though not dimes, correct?","Mark Guinan","Yes. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from A.J. Rice. Sir, your line is open.","A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS Securities","First, just maybe quick, to ask you about your thoughts with respect to share repurchases. Obviously, last year was a year where you took in a lot of proceeds from asset sales and licensing agreements and this year has been one more characterized by acquisitions. Within the context of that, do you have any sort of way to articulate your view on -- update your view on share repurchase and how they fall out in the capital deployment mix?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yes. Well, look, capital deployment commitment is the same. That is to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We have been standing by that. And that will continue. You saw our purchases this quarter, Mark will give you an update on what we have done year-to-date. Also as you know, we feel like share repurchases were heavier in 2012 and 2013 and the acquisitions were heavier in '13. If you look at the two together, it's pretty consistent, pretty good weight based upon the two little heavier acquisitions where we took out the debt. But we stand behind our commitment of returning the majority of our free cash flow and we are tracking well against that and we saw a good cash flow this quarter to support that. So Mark?","Mark Guinan","A.J., for this year, I talked about the need to delever, post the Solstas acquisition. As we mentioned, we paid down $90 million in the most recent quarter. So we do have a commitment to get down closer to the 2.5 rate from a spike of up to 3. We were at it post Summit acquisition. So we have been making it a priority to pay down debt. In terms of what we are going to be doing going forward at the investor day, I am going to talk a little bit about the philosophy and some potential outcomes in terms of paying down further debt or getting to that leverage ratio. And then obviously when we give guidance for 2015, I will get specifically around what our intents would be and...","A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS Securities","Okay. And I guess at this point in the call, I'll take the bait and ask you the obligatory question about Theranos. Is there any update that you are seeing in their posture in the marketplace that you would want to share? And I know you've said from time to time you would be open to talking to them if they had any interest in talking to you about what they have and how you might work to collaborate. Any update in any of those areas?","Stephen Rusckowski","No, A.J. No new news on what they are doing in the marketplace. Essentially they are running some pilots in a couple of locations. As a laboratory, again, what they have presented in the past to the market is some disruptive approach to some routinely provided diagnostics. If in fact they have a disruptive technology, we are all for it, listening about that. And one would hope that a company that had something like that would like to talk to one of the largest providers of diagnostic informational services. But no news to share on that other than what you have probably heard and we have said so far.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Gary Taylor. Sir, your line is open.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup","Most of my questions' answered, so I'll do just one quick one here and let you go. I wanted to talk about restructuring charges for a second and $48 million this quarter over $100 million year-to-date. I guess, presumably the fourth quarter has some assumption about $20 million-$30 million perhaps of excluded charges. I just wanted to understand, what's the glide path over the next couple years as your cost saving programs mature and come to fruition? Are we still looking at hundreds of millions of dollars of one timers to get to that or is there glide path for that diminishes maybe more quickly than that?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, Gary, I appreciate the question. Really not in a position to comment on the future at this moment. At the investor day we are going to talk about the next stage for Invigorate. And as part of that, we will lay out not just the benefits but also the required investment, both capital and expense. I do want to mention that the adjustments this quarter were not all restructuring. Certainly there was a significant integration and you could imagine with an acquisition the size of Solstas, as we have mentioned it typically takes 18 months to complete that integration. And you might imagine that the first six to nine months is where you have a significant amount of those integration onetime expenses. We did just open up our lab in Marlborough, Massachusetts and with that we are moving out of some other facilities. We did have some one timers there to get into that new facility.","And then finally we did have some legal expenses, onetime legal expenses and those adjustments as well. So they are not all restructuring per say. I want to be clear. And there is not -- certainly you should not look at this quarter as kind of being a consistent representation of the kind of expenses that we will be adjusting out going forward. It really depends on all those different factors and what's going on in the business.","Stephen Rusckowski","Any other questions? Okay, if not, as I said in my introductory comments, we had our second solid quarter of top line growth and we continue to build momentum. We are doing a good job executing against our strategy and we look forward to seeing many of you on our Investor Day on November 5th in New York City. So thank you all and talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics third quarter 2014 conference call.

This morning, I\u2019ll discuss the second quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then, Mark will provide more detail on the results.","Our volume growth accelerated in the second quarter and we continued to build momentum through the first half of 2019. Our expanded network access continued to accelerate volume growth and our strategy to drive operational excellence improved efficiency. Both have helped to offset the significant reimbursement pressures we are experiencing this year.","For the second quarter, we grew revenues despite significant reimbursement pressure; reported EPS was $1.51, down about 4% from the same period of 2018; adjusted EPS was $1.73, down about 1%; volume growth remained very strong at 4.4% as the expected volume continued to accelerate in the second quarter. Year-to-date, volume growth is now at 4%.","Now, let me briefly update you on three fundamental changes in the laboratory marketplace. They are PAMA, our expanded network access, increased consumerization of health care. First, PAMA-driven reimbursement pressure remains a catalyst for structural change in the marketplace. Our Medicare rates in the first half of 2019 were down by 10% from the prior year, which is in line with our expectation. The next data reporting period remains scheduled for the first quarter of next year. However, we are encouraged by the introduction of the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act or LAB Act introduced in the House last month.","The LAB Act would be the first step towards ensuring clinical laboratory service rates under PAMA are sustainable and Medicare beneficiaries have adequate access to crucial laboratory services. By delaying the next round of PAMA data reporting by one year, the Lab Act will provide all applicable laboratories with additional time to report private payor data. A second provision in the Lab Act would require a neutral third party to produce recommendations to Congress and how to improve the PAMA data collection and rate setting process.","The second structural change affecting our industry is our expanded network access, and PAMA is becoming more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend.","We're partnering with UnitedHealthcare to reduce access cost created by other network labs, the further value to our customers and members. On July 1st, we became the UnitedHealthcare preferred lab network provider and have begun an aggressive outreach campaign to physicians and UHC members.","Beginning August 1st, providers referring members to out-of-network labs will be able to complete an online approval process. In addition, Anthem has begun to implement its own strategy that lowers laboratory rates to hospital-based providers, aligning them better with the rates currently paid to the independent laboratories. Also, we continue to have conversations with other health plans on value-based care initiatives and PLN like elements. Some of our recent contract extensions contain these features.","Finally, we continue to see increased attention on the variation in health care costs. Last month, the White House released the health care executive order designed to bring more transparency to the health care system. As consumers of health care get more information on the disparities in the cost of care, we believe this trend favors high value providers like Quest.","Now, turning to our recent progress and our strategy to accelerate growth, which has five elements: Grow more than 2% per year through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then, finally, support population health in data analytics and extended care services.","Now, let me take you through a few highlights of our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. As I said earlier, we continue to see revenue and volume growth as a result of our expanding network access. With the exception of Aetna, this growth is occurring across all of our major health plan customers. We recently signed a new professional lab services agreement with Catholic Health Services of Long Island, a large, integrated health care delivery system in New York. Under the agreement, Quest will provide laboratory and supply chain expertise as well as perform laboratory reference testing. We continue to believe hospitals will be increasingly more motivated to work with us under lab strategy as they feel the impact of PAMA and lower commercial reimbursement. And the area of advanced diagnostics, Quest is now participating as a designated laboratory in the National Cancer Institute\u2019s MATCH precision medicine trial. This is the largest of its kind.","The trial seeks to provide better outcomes for rare cancer types for which there is no standard treatment. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included tuberculosis testing, with straight to both QuantiFERON and T-SPOT, Cardio IQ, and mutual testing. Each of these categories drove strong revenue growth.","Our QuestDirect consumer testing business continues to gain popularity. Earlier this month, we launched a new consumer initiative Lyme disease tests. We also drove sequential volume growth in consumer testing in each month in the second quarter.","The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain on track to deliver 3% cost efficiencies for 2019 by continuing to drive increases in productivity. Some examples are using digital technology to enhance the customer experience, drive growth and reduce our carbon footprint. We have begun to eliminate paper documentation for Medicare beneficiaries who have financial responsibility for non-covered services. This has reduced denials and contributed to our invigorated savings.","We're also working to help patients follow through when their physician orders a lab test. We started sending reminder emails to patients whose physicians have ordered tests for them electronically. We're now sending text messages that remind them to nearly one third of our patients who scheduled appointment online, which reduces the no-show rate. Both of these initiatives are expected to help reduce the number of lab orders that go unfulfilled.","Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the financial performance. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve.","In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.95 billion, up 1.8% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew 2% compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure and patient concessions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 4.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 2.9%.","As we said before, not all volume is created equal and we regularly emphasize our strategy to be price disciplined. Recently, we had a few of our capitated contracts open for renewal. These contracts, while profitable in the past, represented large volumes at very low margins. In the competitive contract renewal process, apparently one of our competitors was willing to offer lower rates that were prospectively very unprofitable for us. Therefore, rather than accept the rate cut, we walked away from the business. Walking away had very little top and bottom line impact, but did create a 70 basis-point headwind volume to our organic volume growth and will do so throughout the balance of the year. We believe this is important for you to understand as you assess our relative volume performance. Despite that headwind, organic volume growth accelerated in the second quarter, consistent with our expectations.","Revenue per requisition declined by 2.3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher reimbursement pressure and patient concessions. Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.3% in the second quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of approximately 120 basis points. As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the clinical fee schedule as well as modest indirect price changes from Medicaid and a small number of floating rate contracts.","Reported operating income was $307 million or 15.7% of revenues compared to $305 million or 15.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $352 million or 18% of revenues compared to $362 million or 18.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily attributable to higher reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions, largely offset by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our Invigorate initiatives.","Reported EPS was a $1.51 in the quarter compared to $1.57 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.73, down approximately 1% from $1.75 last year. Cash provided by operations was $596 million year-to-date versus $503 million last year. And capital expenditures were $132 million year-to-date compared to $151 million a year ago.","Now, turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2019 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year; reported EPS is expected to be greater than $5.29 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.40; cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million.","Before closing, I would like to review a few reminders as you think about the remainder of 2019.","First, we continue to expect more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year due to PAMA, our new in-network health plan contracts in 2019, and the modest reimbursement pressure we typically experience each year from other sources. Second, we continue to expect that volumes will gradually increase as we progress through 2019, just as they have through the first half of the year. Third, we have approximately one extra revenue day in the third quarter. Finally, we expect the strongest revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2019, due to an easier comparison.","I will now turn it back to Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Mark.","To summarize, our growth accelerated in the second quarter due to our expanded network access, and we continued to build momentum through the first half of 2019. Our strong volume growth combined with our strategy to drive operational excellence enabled us to help offset the significant reimbursement pressures we're experiencing this year. We're excited to be back for being a new Preferred Lab Network status, with UnitedHealthcare, and the opportunities to extend this approach through other players in the marketplace are with us. And then, finally, we believe we're well-positioned to meet our commitments in 2019.","Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe help on how volume progressed through the quarter, if you're still seeing a build sort of month to month there, if it has stabilized? And then, I just wanted to kind of clarify what you said around sort of the capitated contract that you lost? Is that a regional or a national contract? And then, just help us on kind of the timing on when it happened? And just broader thoughts, obviously, there's a lot of discussion around the open network approach and sort of structural changes there. So, this goes sort of against that tide. So, maybe flush that out a bit for us. Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Sure, Ralph. So, because we have these artificial conventions called fiscal years, months, quarters, et cetera, there is going to be some noise. So, if you look at our volumes throughout the quarter, they didn't accelerate each month because of the calendar. However, when you look at -- there is something else to look at, which requisitions per day on an apples to apples basis, they did absolutely continue to grow throughout the quarter. And as I noted in my closing comments, that is our expectation for the balance of the year. So, throughout each month, the beginning of the year, in the first quarter, we saw accelerate volume growth; and then throughout the second quarter when you look at an apples and apples comparison, absolutely, we continue to strengthen, despite that 70 basis-point headwind. The headwind itself was actually a handful of regional capitated contracts, they were exclusively capitated. There was no fee [ph] for service element in those contracts. And as said, they were very large volumes and low margins. And they started feathering in beginning of the year, really fully hit us largely in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.","Adam Noble","Hey, guys. Great. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Kevin. I just wanted to see if you could size, in the second quarter, what the benefit to the organic volumes was from managed care access versus just general market growth? And did you expect to have further penetration of those contracts in the back half?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Let me start and then I\u2019ll pass it to Mark. First of all, we continue to talk about we\u2019re always looking at the marketplace and trying to understand what's going in the marketplace. And with all our measurements and metrics that we have, and we've talked about for many years now the same store analysis, we still believe the market is stable. We see stable volumes in our physician accounts and also our hospital business seems to be stable versus the prior year. So, Mark, can you add some color beyond that?","Mark Guinan","So, it\u2019s hard to tease out specifically. I think, to Steve\u2019s point, we don\u2019t think the market has been accelerating in terms of its growth. So, we say market access, if you're asking specifically around United versus more generally, as we shared in the prepared remarks other than Aetna, we\u2019re obviously -- we had a major competitor who entered that contract. We were the sole national. And we\u2019re growing at every single major health plan. So, in terms of market access, it\u2019s not just United. Obliviously, it just makes us more competitive; it enables us to win the office. And so, therefore, we\u2019re seeing growth across the board, not just limited to United or Horizon.","Adam Noble","Got you. If I could just sneak in one more, just any update around the M&A pipeline. Neither you or your main competitor announced any acquisitions year-to-date. Is that a more function of a elongated conversion time line or are you seeing any change to the size or nature of the pipeline?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So, you saw in our results that we inched up a little bit Q2 versus Q1 in terms of the amount of our revenue from some acquisitions. So, we're feathering in some of the acquisitions and they are delivering well. Second is, as we said before and we\u2019ll continue to say and our funnel remains strong. We have a number that support our ambition to be close to 2% this year and into future. So, we keep on working on that. And just what I said in my remarks, the pressures that we see are now becoming real and becoming more visible. And those pressures are with PAMA cuts, some of that does extend itself, particularly for hospital outreach businesses and for Medicare rates, and then the commercial changes that I talked about in my prepared remarks are clearly going to impact the hospital marketplace and the independent lab marketplace. And so because of that we continue to have a lot of conversations around integrated delivery systems, lab strategies. And you again saw that we announced this new deal with Catholic Health systems out of Long Island, which is another supporting proof point that we continue to advance our strategy in that front. And the pipeline will be there to support our strategy, as we indicated. ","Mark Guinan","As Steve highlighted and as you noted, we did the transaction in the second quarter. As Steve commented, we did get more growth from the M&A, we closed a deal, regional acquisition, Boyce and Bynum in the first quarter. So, obviously, we\u2019ve got the first full quarter of growth from that in Q2. And I would say, there is no attitudinal change in terms of people\u2019s view around potentially getting out of outreach, hospital customers. And certainly, some of the regional labs are feeling the PAMA pain. I think, the interesting dynamic that we\u2019ve seen has been actually more of the conversations with hospital systems are getting broader. So, it\u2019s not just about outreach but actually about doing a PLS deal, doing a reference deal and potentially selling the outreach, like we did with PeaceHealth last year, and that\u2019s a positive. But on the other side, those take longer. And an outreach deal can be done much more quickly. So, that dynamic has emerged a little bit over last year, so, which adds a little bit to the timeframe to get these transactions completed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open. ","Ross Muken","On the cost side, I mean, it seems like pretty strong sequential OpEx management. I know that you called out in Q1 it\u2019s a pull forward. But, give us a little color, it looks like restructuring tick up a bit, your depreciation came down, how you are tracking on your cost plan and sort of some of the realization of the main program versus some of the other timing elements that played out.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So, I\u2019ll start again and Mark will follow. We continue to execute our plan for 2019. We indicated in our first quarter that we have planned for a number of restructuring efforts to start to kick in, start to kick in, in the second quarter. That will continue in the back half of the year. So, we feel good about that. So, we think we have our handles on the levers of cost in the right way. And then, second, Ross, is we continue to drive our operational excellence program. I did say in my remark, it\u2019s 3% of our cost saves, and I'll remind everyone, that's about $200 million. And we continue to yield good results from that. We continue to see good productivity across the board. And yes, that's expense areas but also in cost of sales. And we will continue that into 2020 or 2021. So, Mark?","Mark Guinan","Yes. Ross, I thank you for reminding everyone. There were really the two drivers, if you look into Q2 versus Q1. One was the investments that we did at the beginning of our new access in terms of some marketing, adding some commercial resources, et cetera. Certainly, we haven't stepped back on the commercial resource. We have stepped back on some of the marketing campaign information. There were also some things that were expensive because we were betting on the commanding [ph] patient service centers, adding some logistics, assuming the volume would come, making sure we were in position. Now, that volume is coming, it just became kind of the classic typical cost of sale. So, it\u2019s not incremental expense. And then, the other key driver was the restructuring that we completed at the end of the first quarter, which had taken out, on a run rate basis, a substantial amount of expense. That will continue throughout the balance of the year and going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Stephen Baxter","I wanted to try to understand the sequential improvement in the decline of revenue per requisition. So, obviously, PAMA is a known quantity at this point. So, I was wondering if you could update us on some of the other moving pieces there, whether it's commercial pricing or bad debt. I guess, the other potential is, maybe this capitated contract, you just got -- had some kind of impact. Any color you can give there is very helpful.","Steve Rusckowski","Mark, why don\u2019t you take him through the math?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, typically, in terms of commercial pricing, typically those contracts run on the calendar year. There's been a couple of exceptions where we've done things in the midyear. So, there really wasn't anything in terms of commercial price changes between Q1 and Q2, nor, as you know, is there anything different than PAMA? So, this was really driven by mix. Some of it was some test mix as have some seasonality that can drive things up or down in the rev per req. But as we\u2019ve noted, that doesn't always necessarily directionally align with profitability, even though it does drive changes in rev per req. And then, of course, losing some of the capitated revenue certainly is a lift from a mixed perspective. And then, finally, PLS is a driver as well. Because as we shared in the past, those tend to be more basic requisitions, got a lot of complex testing, and, certainly as the PLS grows, business grows disproportionately; to the rest of the business it can add or put a drag on our revenue per req.","And then finally, patient concessions. When you look at the patient concession rate in the second quarter versus the first quarter, it was improved. And, a lot of that is really the result of the efforts that we've had to really improve the collectability of a lot of the tools that we put in place at our patient service centers with our real time adjudication to give people that cost upfront, the ability to collect the credit card as well as really working hard with our partner Optum to get better information on pensions, do a better job of presenting the bill and overall collecting at a higher rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. ","Ann Hynes","So, in your prepared remarks, you did talk about all the payers initiatives, what they are doing on the PLN side, you specifically mentioned them and some recent contracts include some PLN aspects. Can you just go to more detail on what you are talking about? Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, sure. Well, first of all, let\u2019s go back to the opportunity this year. The biggest opportunity is best to access -- health insurance access we have for over a decade. And the PLN is going to be nice to have and it will provide some more momentum, and we believe it\u2019s a nice lever for us. And yes, we talk a lot about the effect that will have with United. But as we talked about, we're having a number of conversations with other payers. And then, finally is some of the new contract extensions that we already have signed include some of the elements that we will talk about.","United will be releasing more and more as we go and they will provide details. As I did mention in my remarks, if you are out of network, it\u2019s going to require more authorization to allow that to happen. So, that\u2019s one point. Second is what we\u2019ve said in the past is there clearly will be a benefit design change, so less out of pocket cost for consumers. And then, third, there will be physician incentives. So, when you think about what's going to be the big element, it\u2019s all around benefit design, less out of pocket cost for consumes, physicians being managed to drive towards that preferred lab network and then finally is really making sure there is no leakage to other network. And it will be stronger than ever with United and we see a lot of momentum with other payers as well.","So, more to come on that, Ann. But, we're off and running and working this hard, and we do believe it\u2019s going to be an additional lever. We don\u2019t let it overshadow that the biggest opportunities were back in network. And what I also said in my remarks, yes we had good growth obviously from United but all our major health plans grew with the exception of that network, we actually did expect the modest decline which we saw.","Mark Guinan","So, just to add, Ann, to Steve\u2019s point that a lot of the benefits of the PLN type elements is still in front of us. So, it hasn\u2019t driven the volume growth to this point, it\u2019s an enabler to continue to drive. So, what are some of those things and it\u2019s going to be different by payer type. But these are concepts that we\u2019ve talked about and various payers have embraced some of these or are all of these to a certain extent. A lot of them are rooted in us getting additional payment or a bonus payment what have you as we\u2019ve shown the ability to scale work to better value away from higher cost providers.","So, we\u2019ve gotten that in a couple of contracts recently where we have a metric in a way of showing that as they save money, as their members save money that we get a piece of that. And so, we\u2019re aligning those incentives. Number one is around treatment of preauthorization, which is a huge driver for denial. So, and a couple of payers we\u2019ve gotten -- as our chief competitors and some others, the lab that have shown themselves to be high quality, actually differentiate themselves positively from a service perspective and other things around panels and how conduct themselves. We\u2019ve actually gotten the status where they wave the preauthorization. So, it's an advantage for us from a physician ordering perspective that payers, as we know, if you send the work to these, following labs that who are going to be okay with it. So, therefore, you don't require a preauth. So, that's another element that we've gotten in some of our contracts.","Steve mentioned some of the zero out of pocket, and some of the payers are coming up with products that they are offering, but obviously got market. We\u2019ll see the adoption rate and then some other payers have voiced an interest in going heavily in that kind of plan benefit design. So, again, it's not as if there's a one size fits all. That's why we talk about these being in elements in some of the other payers. And then, finally, there is a lot of interest in kind of sharing we\u2019ll call it the win fail game from our outreach acquisition. So, when we buy hospital outreach, obviously those commercial rates immediately go to our negotiated rates, which is a huge savings for patients, huge savings for the payer and the notion that, hey, this is good for all stakeholders, and we should share some of that value. ","So, those are a couple of details that certainly have gotten a lot of traction with the payers. And as Steve pointed out, that is in front of us. So, when I say in front of us, we've gotten those in some of the contracts but obviously, we have to perform and we have to earn those. And then, those are upside going ahead.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Good morning. I'm just wondering if you can maybe just give us an update on your consumer retail strategy. I didn't hear anything in the prepared comments this morning.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. It\u2019s one of our strategies for growth. And several parts of being what\u2019s consumer diagnostic information service provider, we have talked about in the past, just to remind everyone, we have really digitized and brought our patient experiences to today\u2019s world. And so, when you look into a Quest patient service center, it will remind everyone of the other experiences they have in their other experiences as a consumer and as a health care experience. So, a lot of progress there.","Second is we continue to make progress on the tools and the access and information. So, MyQuest app, which is our smartphone app, has continued to expand its registration, and continued to expand the capability so you can schedule appointment online, you can see wait times at patient service centers, you obviously get your results. And we now have over 7 million registered users, which is remarkable.","And there is a last piece of this, which is your specific question, is the physical presence we think is quite important. So, we have continued to manage our retail strategy and move our patients service centers to a more retail setting over time. Right now, we have roughly 200ish patient service centers between our Safeway relationship and Walmart. Walmart is about 70 of that. And we continue to evaluate the best path forward to eventually have about 50% of our 2,200 patient service centers in more retail like settings.","Now, what I\u2019ll also share is we have said that roughly 25%, let\u2019s call it, 500 of our current patient service centers are more retail like, not all with retailers, but as we evolve over time, with our current retail relationships and with possible others, that number will grow to be about half of our fleet of patient service centers. And our experience in those is quite good. We believe that the patient obviously experience better with much more consumer experience, our employees, there is -- a lot of us like it better. We can consolidate our operations at the fewer sites. And the patient have access. They walk in, they can walk around with the pager, as they can do some shopping, they can eat after they\u2019ve been fasting. So, overall, m our perspective it\u2019s quite good. And then, our relationship with retailers is good as well because they benefit from that store traffic. So, we feel positive about the response and results so far and we will continue to drive it.","Mark Guinan","The only thing I would Lisa is that there is some always some outliers. But if you look at on average, our retail draw sites continue to increase the amount of activity. We had the highest average amount of draws in our Walmart sites in June that we\u2019ve had since we started this. So, we're very happy with the amount of traffic we're getting, we\u2019re feeling really good about the presence. And of course, our volume is growing. So, there is things that are probably driving it. So, part of it is awareness. People are starting to figure out, we\u2019ve got these draw sites in Walmart and getting comfortable going there, and we\u2019d expect that to continue over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. ","Kevin Ellich","Steve, in your prepared remarks, you comment about Anthem shifting hospital base rates to independent lab rates. We saw something, I think at Lab Economics that that was shifted for pathology. Can you give little bit more color, is this for all of the tests that are being done in hospitals or just pathology? And then, are you seeing other commercial payers follow this, doing something similar, then what will that do for your hospital outreach and PLS deals? ","Steve Rusckowski","So, I would just say, as an overarching comment and it\u2019s embedded in our introductory remarks that we have PAMA, and PAMA to some extent is independent of what's happening on the commercial side. But, we now continue to see pressure from commercial payers on hospital outreach. So, yes, we mentioned Anthem but I will also share that there is pressure from other payers, typically with those that we work with, to push down the rates for all the ancillary services and obviously that includes labs, that includes radiology and includes other ancillary services that are provided by the hospital. And, Kevin, two parts to this. One is just in general to move more of the volume to most -- the highest value reach provider like ourselves in lab, but second is because we add a cost to consumers. And the consumers, given the high percentage of corresponsive health plans that have high deductibles and high out of pocket costs for these expensive hospital based services, the payers are looking at more aggressive strategies to normalize the rates more.","So, yes, we call that Anthem is proactively having a strategy but we see this in many other places with many other commercial payers that are pushing back on what they\u2019ve done in the past with ancillary services in general but specific to lab.","Mark Guinan","So, Kevin, I would encourage you to ask Anthem directly. There is a -- I don\u2019t know, they\u2019ve led a couple of places with pathology. There is a publically available document, which we\u2019re referencing. And as you might imagine, before we said anything, we checked with them to make sure they were comfortable with the statement that we are attributed to. For more detail, I would encourage you to ask Anthem about the schedule and how broadly they're doing it and so on. But, there is something they've published and put out in the public domain.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. And part B of this, Kevin, I mentioned in my remarks, the movement across the country towards more price transparency. As you know there is wide variation in our marketplace with ourselves having what we believe the best value proposition on the planet, great quality, great service at some of the lowest prices. And in that regard, actually there was a story today in the journal, which speaks to a number of the payers, providing apps and services, if you will, to provide visibility to consumers to do a better job of shopping. And they called out Anthem, as we did, but others including Humana and UnitedHealthcare that are working proactively as by way of another example, to help consumers manage their costs. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Good morning. Just given some of the recent progress in terms of the commercial contracting that you talked about, I was wondering if you could give us some line of sight into how you think commercial unit pricing is shaking out for 2020, and just how that compares to the long-term guidance that you laid out at the Investor Day later year.","Steve Rusckowski","Mark?","Mark Guinan","So, I\u2019m sure you appreciate, Jack, I'm not going to speak to 2020. We're in very good shape in terms of where we stand with the commercial payers and the need to extend contracts. So, there's no surprises that anyone should expect, we're in great shape. And around the pricing, I mean, obviously, those prices already set those contracts. Really, some of those incentive payments that I referenced, those have to be determined, as we as we perform. So those could be some upside. However, if you recall, I gave you a pretty broad range on the revenue CAGR. So, what I would tell you is that within those scenarios, between the low end and the high end, we've contemplated all the different kind of outcomes that might happen, including, obviously, how quickly we get our fair share of some of the new network access contracts, and then how quickly and to what extent we earn some of those potential incentive payments. So, I would say everything within the multiyear outlook that I provided has been reasonably contemplated. And that's why we give a broad range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Question for Mark. Hello. I just wanted to clarify your organic volume growth expectations in the second half of the year. So, you said that volume should gradually increase as you progress through the year. The comps do get tougher. So, are you expecting organic volume growth in the back half of the year to be higher than this kind of rounding to 3ish percent you've delivered in the first half of the year?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, we absolutely expect the revenue, despite any sort of comps -- I'm sorry, the volume, to increase on an organic basis. So, it may not happen every week, may not happen every day, every month. But when we look at Q3 and Q4, we expect to continue to see improvements versus the second quarter in our year-over-year organic volume.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Donald Hooker","So, I just wanted to ask maybe a question on the PLS business. I think, in the past you guys have targeted some good -- some optimistic outlook -- an optimistic outlook. So, I think you talked about 50 basis points of revenue growth and going forward or something, a revenue growth tailwind going forward from just PLS deals. Are you on track with these deals? It looks like there\u2019s been a couple. I\u2019m not sure if there have been others that you haven\u2019t announced but in terms of trying to size these deals and sort of put you on a trajectory with PLS, can you kind of reiterate that or... ","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So, as we shared with you our five strategies, one of which is the proactively conversations with integrated delivery systems on their lab strategy, and also the access to health care as well within geographies where we had issues with not having good access with some of their patients. So, this continues to be a nice growth driver for us. We announced the Catholic Health Systems deal in Long Island. We did announce some other relationships last year and they studied in and built throughout 2019. And I\u2019ll just close with say the funnel continues to build. In the past, we shared where we\u2019re going and we have conversation where the lab strategy. It starts with how we can make them more efficient and this is what we call professional lab services or PLS, and this is their in-patient hospital lab and it\u2019s a cost matter. So, we could save them anywhere from 10% to 20% of their costs. So, that\u2019s an opportunity. ","Second, as we get into that, we look at them to rationalize and to become more efficient in their sophisticated reference testing that we said out. That\u2019s another opportunity. And then, the third piece, it\u2019s very unusual not to have this conversation. We didn\u2019t have a conversation about their outreach where they are in the commercial marketplace with us and does it make a sense for us to them to continue to be in it or should we buy their business. So, those discussions continue to progress. We have a bigger funnel than ever. We\u2019ve backed out the United States. We know all the integrated delivery systems with big outreach businesses, we know those that have substantial number of beds in their cost centers and that continues to be a nice growth driver for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Steve, maybe just on the contracts you walked away from. Can you just provide some more color there? It\u2019s a bit surprising to hear competitors are once again being aggressive on price, I still hear there is a bit of a low there. Given the PAMA backdrop the industry seems to realize price discipline is best way to fan that off. So, maybe just more context on what you\u2019re seeing, what would lead these other labs to be price competitive, given this backdrop?","Mark Guinan","Great question, yes, they are competitors. So, it\u2019s not something we can speak to. Obviously, we control our own towards pricing. We\u2019ve been pretty vocal and consistent that we feel our price is already really good. There is an awful lot of competitors in this marketplace that have prices that are multiple of our price, and we are an excellent value. There was no need for Quest to offer lower price. So in terms of other people's motivation to drop price further in some instances, that\u2019s a question you will need to put to them. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. ","Steve Rusckowski","Ricky, we can't hear you.","Alexa Desai","Hi. Sorry. This is Alexa on for Ricky. Can you hear me?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes.","Alexa Desai","Okay. Thanks. Ihad a little line trouble there. I wanted to come back to your expectations for the second half of the year. You beat the quarter but maintained guidance, which sort of implies the lower second half earnings than what the Street is currently modeling. Are there any headwinds you feel the Street isn't factoring into the back half of the year? Can you just give us a sense of the puts and takes here, and what the sources of upside to the guide could be?","Steve Rusckowski","Let me just start and then Mark will give details. What we showed in the first half is we've delivered on what we set for expectations that we wanted to show the moment to build throughout the first half of 2019 that we did. So, we're pleased with the results in the first half. Second is, we\u2019re midway through the year. And we thought it was prudent at this point to maintain our outlook. I\u2019m not going to ahead of ourselves, but what Mark said earlier is and what we\u2019ve said about this year but also in general about the growth opportunities in front of us, it will continue to build throughout 2019, but this is not just a build for 2019. It will conclude the build in 2020, 2021. So, Mark little more color around the rest of the year?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, we are not in any way, influenced by the Street\u2019s feelings into the back half. What we do when we give guidance is really what we think our shareholders and stakeholders should understand from our perspective. So, when you look at the first half, we're very pleased with our results. We feel like we're on track, it's still halfway through the year. Of course, in the back half, we have things that sometimes happened that are beyond our control, like hurricanes and snow in December, and so on. So at this point, we just felt, there wasn't any need since we've given a 4 and not given any certain range. So, there's nothing negative in terms of our signaling for the back half. We are on track to do what we expected, which is to do at least $60.40 starts. We\u2019re obviously feeling good I think as many others with what we've done in the first half. But we'd rather just continue to perform, and then obviously cross our fingers around any sort of weather events and other things that might impact the back half, but certainly nothing operational that we're signaling or that anyone should be concerned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. ","Bill Quirk","So, kind of a multi-part question here, guys. First, I think the answer is no. But, is there any negative effects from Anthem? Second piece is with respect to the capitated contract loss, was that contemplated in the original guidance? And then, lastly, just any comment with respect to genomics business, given that the principal supplier into that industry had obviously cited some challenges in that space couple weeks ago? Thank you.","Mark Guinan","So, I'm sorry. I didn't catch your question Your question Bill on Anthem.","Steve Rusckowski","First part. ","Bill Quirk","Yes. The first part of the Anthem question was just, I think the impact here was predominantly for hospitals. I just want to confirm, guys, that you're not seeing any negative effects from some of the Anthem reimbursement changes that they're implementing.","Mark Guinan","No. We have a contract -- multiple contracts with Anthem. We contract with them regionally that we have a negotiated price and so on. And certainly, we are not in the ZIP code of the hospitals that they are now starting to say need to be rationalized. So, this is really a movement to get everyone -- it's not targeting anyone specifically, except for the outliers to be more in a more consistent rate. So, we feel we\u2019re already in that in that ZIP code. And certainly there's going to be no changes in the current timeframe because we have contracts with Anthem. On the capitated, we really don't give guidance on volume. So, was this a possibility that we contemplate it? Yes, certainly. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s had minimal impact to our revenue, and certainly no impact to our bottom line. So, really, it's more of a volume effect. And we try to encourage our stakeholders to not -- to pay quite as much attention to volume because of very reason. So, we thought given the magnitude of this change we\u2019re going to make sure that you understood, there was a big volume shift from us to others or to another direct headwind but really no financial or economic negativity to us, just volume.","Steve Rusckowski","The last part, Bill, I had hard time hearing that as well.","Bill Quirk","Just a comment, Steve, on your outlook for the consumer genomics business, given one of the principal suppliers a couple of weeks ago.","Steve Rusckowski","Got you. Thank you. As you know, we have relationship with the Ancestry and that\u2019s a good relationship and continues to build. No material effect on our -- at our growth plus or minus. So, I would just say in general fairly stable. Second is I did remark about our consumer testing business, which for us is a nice platform that is growing nicely and we're very pleased with the pick-up around our general diagnostic testing. And I mentioned that we just introduced a new line with these tests. But we're going to use that as well as a platform for consumer genetics in the future. So, more to come. But overall, stable environment as we see it. As you know we're not the only provider of the Ancestry at this time. And it\u2019s not a big piece of our revenue. So, stable business for us at this point and still good opportunity in front of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Could you talk a little bit about the esoteric testing business and just sort of volume and mix trends within that and sort of how that\u2019s impacting revenue per requisition, just pricing getting better, reimbursement stable in that, just any additional color would be great. ","Steve Rusckowski","First of all, the term esoteric is an industry term. We have defined our genetic and molecular as being what we call advanced diagnostics, and we don\u2019t break out specially that business and provide color. But in general, what we\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s a business and an opportunity that\u2019s been growing mid single digits, and we want to continue to accelerate it and it\u2019s active part of our strategy. And within the quarter we felt good about the progress we made in that business in a number of fronts. We had some good growth and some portions of women's health. And in addition to that we define it esoteric. Esoteric, it typically includes a toxicology presence. Prescription drug monitoring continues to be a nice, big growing business for us. We're pleased with the progress and the quarter as well. And just in general, I think, our esoteric or more sophisticated testing, we had good year-on-year compressions, better than last year in the hospital presence, that\u2019s not all esoteric but in general a lot of it is. And then, as we pull more growth in a general diagnostics business, it typically will also pull some of advanced diagnostics or esoteric business as well. So, overall, as we raise the tide, it\u2019s going to help all the boats in the harbor, including advanced or esoteric as well as general diagnostics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Matt Larew","Obviously, PAMA was an initial catalyst for hospitals and health systems thinking about the feature of their lab business. But it sounds like the preferred lab network, both specifically with United and then more broadly as payers are being more aggressive with the way you think about laboratory testing may actually be perhaps a more dramatic catalyst. I wonder if you could just discuss the conversations you're having with hospitals and health systems be it for outright M&A or PLS arrangements. And how payer behavior has started to change those conversations?","Steve Rusckowski","First of all, recall, we've been talking about three changes in the marketplace, the PAMA effect, and could argue, it really just got started within 2018. And because of some of the nuances of how payment works, it was somewhat muted related to some of the offsets to the fee reduction, which grew about 10%. So, the first year, \u201819 is the second year, is a full year, no muting any of the effects, acts and then another effect in 2020. So, that is starting to become more visible in hospital outreach businesses, and administrations of hospitals are becoming more aware of that.","And the second part of that is it will spill over and has already spilled over to Medicaid. Typically Medicaid in all states is lower than Medicare. And then, finally, as I talked earlier, a lot of the commercial payers are pushing back on, wide discrepancy of health care costs, specifically in our space, in laboratory, wide variations where hospital rates could be 2 to 10 times higher than our rates. And the last piece is the reason why they're pushing on this is because consumers are paying for more and more health care every day, employers are asking questions about it and it\u2019s getting visibility in Washington.","So, those three changes in the marketplace, they're getting a lot of visibility for -- from the administration of any and it\u2019s great delivery system. And then second is small regional operators clearly see a different environment going forward.","But sometimes we're asked question what inning we're in, okay, in anything we do. I would say, in this front, for those three structural changes, we're still in the early innings, but it\u2019s building momentum as we get into the middle of the game. So, I think we're now beyond the start, and we're starting to get a lot more visibility to it. And there's going to be a lot more change in 2020 and that can be affecting decisions of whether hospitals stay the business or whether regionals continue to operate as the operator consider their options and considering selling the business. And it is part of our strategy to be a consolidator in a smart way since we are the leader.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.","Eric Coldwell","Hey. Thanks very much. Most of my topics were covered. But on these capitated contracts, we know from past filings that they were in total representing about 11% of volume and 3% of your revenue. Were the contracts that you specifically walked away from the low end of a capitated contract because you're seeing absolutely no impact on revenue? So, I'm just trying to understand -- typically capitated contract is a quarter of your average profitability. So, were these the low end of that range or is there perhaps some slight impact from this change? Thanks very much.","Mark Guinan","So, they were definitely low margin, as I referenced. We've actually maintained some of the work at a higher rate. So, there's an offset to the lost OM, because in the particular states that this took place, they're obligated to pay us for a subset of test, even if we're not in contract, and they're obligated to pay us at a rate that\u2019s of much higher. So, therefore, you can get that detail in the prepared remarks. But that's why it is really very little, if any OM impact. That\u2019s a partial offset to the revenue, not a 100% because it\u2019s lower volume, less revenue, even though at a much higher rev per req but not enough to compensate in total. So, it\u2019s within certainly rounding overall annual revenue, it\u2019s not a huge number with that offset and on an OM basis, it\u2019s really had no impact because we continue to get paid for some of the work that we\u2019ve maintained. ","Operator","Our last question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. ","Mark Massaro","I wanted to ask about, in regards to your consumer initiatives, QuestDirect is certainly one of the initiatives. I know it seems fairly early and other lab providers are doing similar pilots. But can you just speak to any traction you are getting there? Maybe can you help us think about whether or not that has moved the needle in terms of actual orders coming from new types of individuals? And then, my second question is on the Clinical Trials Connect program. Also seems like it\u2019s early days but can you speak to any wins there that gives you confidence that this can grow in the future?","Steve Rusckowski","So, first of all, on direct-to-consumer, we\u2019ve been at this for a while. We\u2019ve actually started to test the water. We built a business with the relationship with the New York Football Giants and we call it Sports Diagnostics, and really put our toe in the water of understanding very specific segments, how we can market a product directly to consumers, how we can fulfill that order because it\u2019s a different order fulfillment change resulted. So, we had to build some capability years ago to do that.","And then, second is we actually tested the waters on our general diagnostics business is the state of Arizona several years ago. We have a joint venture partner with Banner Health. And as you recall, one of our competitors, given in that state they passed legislation where consumers no longer needed a physician order to order laboratory test. And so, we actually priced out about 100 tests and found out in fact in Arizona there was a market. And so, we took that success and we moved it to Missouri and to Colorado. And then this past fall, we actually expanded it to 48 continental states. About so, 22 of those states who no longer need a physician order, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve also done in the other 26 states, is we lit up a self help [ph] network with PWN to provide in order for consumers that they need it. So, we're deeply engaged in this. We worked out some of the things operationally from years ago with all those experiences and we're off and running. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are very pleased with the sequential improvement and sequentially actually month upon month we're seeing some nice volume growth.","And there is a segment. Now, this is all private pay. And we price it accordingly for private pay. And there is a segment where people rather cold get some of these tests done without engaging their health care insurance company. So, off and running, and we're pleased with it and show results. The second part of the question had to do with -- Mark, could you remind of the second question?","Shawn Bevec","Mark, are you still there? No. Operator, we\u2019ll end it from there.","Steve Rusckowski","We will take it from there. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your support, and have a great day.

Go ahead, please.","Shawn Bevec - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now here's Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.","Through the second quarter, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis related to our efforts to refocus the business, but grew 2.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS grew more than 69%, while adjusted EPS grew more than 7%.","Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to provide perspective on a few key aspects of the final rule implementing provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, referred to as PAMA, issued late last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred to as CMS.","First, on the issue of timing, we are pleased with CMS's decision to delay the implementation of the new payment system until January 1, 2018, a position advocated by members of Congress, hospitals and hospital \u2013 excuse me, and laboratory trade associations.","Second, CMS changed its approach to secure a better view of market pricing. By gathering the pricing data from labs in a different way, CMS will increase the number of labs that provide pricing data. And finally, we continue to evaluate the impact of this final rule, but we won't have a clear view until we see the final pricing data.","In the meantime, CMS is estimating a mid-single digit rate reduction in 2018. As you know, the clinical lab fee schedule represents approximately 12% of our revenues. As we've shared in the past, our Invigorate savings have more than compensated for price headwinds in the market. So if there is a fee reduction in 2018, we would be able to manage it.","Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which, as you recall, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So starting with growth, we delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas including prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C testing, and Cardio IQ, which provides a more complete picture of patients' cardiovascular health with basic cholesterol testing.","We also grew in the second quarter with the help from our new hospital service agreements. Our acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, referred to as CLP, and professional lab services agreements from Barnabas Health are helping us deliver the continued execution of our accelerated growth plan.","Additionally in this quarter, we announced an agreement to manage the inpatient laboratory operations for six Denver-area hospitals in HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare. We expect to see revenues from this engagement before the end of the year.","You know, hospitals continue to talk to us about how we can help them execute their lab strategy, from advanced hospital reference testing to lab management to joint ventures and outreach lab purchases. Our pipeline remains strong and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities.","In advanced testing, we strengthened our service offering, which includes gene-based and esoteric tests. During the quarter, we announced that there will be three new Quest Vantage Answer tests. These are designed to provide clinical actionable insight into an individual's risk of developing hereditary forms of cancer. These new offerings will better position us in this exciting and growing marketplace.","We piloted a program this quarter for non-invasive prenatal screening to serve women of average risk in select regions. Encouraged by the results, we're now offering the testing nationally.","We continued to drive operational excellence, the second element of our strategy. We believe quality and efficiency go hand in hand and we have strong evidence of demonstrated improvement in our customer experience as we make our business more efficient. As we deliver cost savings, we're also able to improve quality and service. This is a well-understood principle of total quality management approaches across all industries. Evidence of this can be seen in a recent independent blinded survey of more than 500 physicians. In the survey, Quest scored highest on customer experience, lab effectiveness and patient satisfaction among national, regional and hospital competitors.","Our recent agreement with Safeway will make it easier for people to get tested by locating our Patient Service Centers in high-traffic Safeway supermarkets. By expanding patient access through our relationships with retailers, we will optimize our real estate footprint and have an opportunity to reduce the number of unfulfilled test orders, which some suggest could be as high as 30%.","We're also shrinking our real estate footprint by consolidating our corporate sites. In June, we announce the relocation of our corporate headquarters and support functions from Madison and Lyndhurst, New Jersey to a single location when our current 10-year lease expires in September of 2017. By consolidating our footprint, we'll be able to get greater collaboration and performance while realizing savings in operating expenses. Our Invigorate cost savings program continues on track to realize $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017.","We continue to simplify and strengthen our organizational capabilities, the third element of our strategy.","Also this quarter, we were proud to be recognized as one of 100 companies named to Forbes 2016 America's Most Trustworthy Companies list, the only company from the diagnostic services industry to be included.","The fourth element of our strategy, to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business, was completed in May, following the completion of the sale of the Focus Diagnostic Products business. Proceeds from the sale of Focus Products were used to drive the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We launched the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, with the Focus proceeds. And since 2012, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of company stock. Additionally, in May, we issued $500 million in debt to take advantage of favorable interest rates and refinance a portion of our debt. We actually look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So mark your calendars, and we'll be providing more data about this as time goes on.","Now Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.2% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the prior year. Of the 1.9%, approximately half came from organic growth and the other half from recent acquisitions, including both CLP and MemorialCare.","Through the first half of 2016, organic volume is up nearly 2%, a solid increase compared to the slight decline reported in the first half of 2015. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter increased 0.2% versus a year ago. As a reminder, a number of different elements impact revenue per req, including unit price variation, business mix, and tests per req. Price headwinds were in line with our expectations, down slightly less than 1%. As we noted last quarter, our Professional Lab Services, or PLS engagement, such as Barnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. In Q2 2016, the year-over-year impact of growth in PLS was approximately 120 basis points on our aggregate revenue per req. In the second quarter, PLS was a larger mix of our business and as we move through the year, we expect PLS to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business.","Reported operating income for the quarter was $422 million, or 22.1% of revenues, compared to $301 million, or 15.6% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $324 million, or 17% of revenues, compared to $321 million, or 16.7% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our Invigorate initiative, slightly offset by lower margins related to recent acquisitions, our growing Professional Lab Services business and our efforts to refocus the company. The impact of our clinical trials and products businesses in the second quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating margins by approximately $15 million.","As a reminder, the clinical trials business now appears on the equity earnings line. Also, we no longer have operating earnings associated with the Focus Products business and recall that we used the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, our portfolio divestitures represented $169 million of revenues that were excluded to get to our equivalent revenues for 2015.","Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter, compared to $0.81 a year ago. The significant year-over-year increase was driven, in large part, by the gain on the sale of our Focus Diagnostics Products business in the second quarter and charges on retirement of debt in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.34, up from $1.25 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $17 million in the quarter, representing a $34 million gain on the sale of the Focus Products business, offset by approximately $17 million of primarily restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items increased our reported EPS by $0.12.","Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our clinical trials and products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate year over year improved slightly.","Our DSOs were 47 days, three days higher than last year and the prior quarter. This was driven by the timing of certain cash receipts and we expect our DSOs to come down to levels similar to the prior year by the end of Q3.","Through the first half of 2016, reported cash provided by operations was $464 million versus $337 million last year. Excluding charges associated with early debt retirement in the first half of 2016 and debt refinancing in the first half of 2015, adjusted operating cash flow was $502 million through June 30, 2016, up from $464 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the first half compared to $117 million a year ago.","Before moving to guidance, I'd like to mention a few items for you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, the year-over-year impact of the contribution of our clinical trials business to the Q2 [Q Squared] JV on reported revenues ended in the second quarter of 2016. Recall this transaction commenced at the beginning of our third quarter 2015. Second, for the Celera Products business that we wound down toward the end of last year, we recognized nearly half of the 2015 revenues and operating earnings for this business in the third quarter of 2015 as customers executed their last time buys. This will set up a difficult compare in the third quarter this year. As you think about the split for the remainder of the year, last year we had approximately $10 million on a reported basis and $12 million on adjusted basis of Celera Products operating income in Q3 and nothing in Q4.","Finally, there are two notable items on our full-year reported operating cash flow projections. The first relates to after-tax cash charges of $29 million from the retirement of debt that will impact 2016 operating cash flow. Second, we will incur a cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow despite recognizing the associated $275 million from the sale in our investing cash flow. Therefore, our adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 will exclude both items.","Having noted these items, our 2016 outlook is as follows: revenues to be between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion, flat to an increase of approximately 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis, and an increase of 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.18 and $4.33; adjusted EPS to be between $5.02 and $5.17. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $880 million on a reported basis and roughly $1 billion on an adjusted basis. Finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million.","Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we built on our good start in 2016 with another solid performance of second quarter. Revenues grew by more than 2% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS grew more than 7%. We continued to generate strong cash from operations and we've remained on track to meet our commitments for the remainder of the year. Now we'd be happy to take any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. our first question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Brian.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, Brian.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","On the hospital JVs. I know that's something that you alluded to a little bit earlier in your prepared remarks. What are you seeing in the landscape on the hospitals now, and how do you envision this joint venture with HCA in terms of the opportunity set or the receptivity of HCA and other for-profit hospitals to expand into a similar kind of strategy?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","well, a couple points, Brian. Thanks for the question. First of all, as I mentioned in my remarks, the interest of hospital CEOs, CFOs and their teams to work with us on their lab strategy is growing, evidenced with what we did with Hartford Hospital and their CLP laboratory. In fact, I was just up there last week meeting with the CEO and meeting with my team. And once we engage and we have this definite relationship, I would say the relationship continues to grow and we are their strategic partner for diagnostic information services. The same continues to grow at Barnabas. We feel good about the progress made there. Again, it continues to expand.","And then you asked a question about HCA. HCA is not a joint venture. It is a contract. It's an agreement that we're helping them run their inpatient laboratories and we're hopeful that that will go well and could potentially provide us with more opportunities going forward, but one step at a time. Our job right now is to do a good job at the Denver area in this division and we can take it from there. So this continues to be a growth prospect for us. We've been focused on it for a number of years as you know, and we're starting to see the results.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","And then, Steve, you alluded to the Safeway arrangement. So, how should we think about the rationalization of the platform or the PSCs? Is that something that is based in a way to invigorate guidance, or is that going to be an incremental opportunity to reduce cost as you shift all your PSC's into the Safeways?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, first of all, there's three aspects of the work we've done with retailers and Safeway is a good example. First of all, it's to improve the patient experience. If you've seen any of these Safeway clinics or healthcare centers, they're very nice and so it provides a really nice, fresh patient experience for our patients, so we're pleased with that. So again, goes hand in hand with our strategy around improving quality patient experience, at the same time becoming more efficient. And on the efficiency side, we are looking at where these stores are, where we have Patient Service Centers, and where possible, we'll optimize that and take some cost out.","But in some cases, we're also augmenting our unparalleled access to the marketplace with some of their locations. So it actually allows us to get greater access. And we think of this market, to the last point I made in my introductory remarks, it's quite important for us to continue to get more and more access for patients where they are. And retail has a great opportunity for us to continue to get more and more access because the data we have is about 30% of laboratory requisitions in the marketplace go unfulfilled. And so our notion is if they have more access, make it more convenient, make it easy for people to go in, get their laboratory requisition fulfilled, it's going to be better for healthcare and it's going to be better for this industry. So that's our strategy.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I just want to add in, Brian, that as Steve pointed out, this is not just a cost play and certainly we believe that it's an opportunity to grow our business faster by making our sites more accessible, making things more convenient, making it a more positive experience. But in terms of your other question around Invigorate, you can imagine that our retail strategy's going to work through over time. So at this point we've only given guidance on Invigorate through the end of 2017. Obviously at some point we'll give an update beyond then. So we've got multi-year leases in many cases for our Patient Service Centers. We are not going to dilute our volume and add a lot of incremental sites, so really this is largely going to be replacing Patient Service Centers. So it's not going to be ever 100% of our footprint for a couple reasons.","One is for that, because we want to make sure we're located where we need to be and there may not always be a retail opportunity. The second thing is we've got some Patient Service Centers where we might have four, five phlebotomists at a time. And given the limited space in a retail site, we're never going to be able to move those kind of centers fully into retail.","So we see it as a great opportunity, but it's not going to be a full replacement. And in terms of its impact on our cost savings and our Invigorate, which also is revenue enhancement, it's going to play out over the next couple years.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ricky.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I have two questions. First one just in terms of clarification around the moving parts around pricing. I think you mentioned that the hospital contracts are a price headwind of 120 basis points. So can you just kind of like walk us through what the headwinds and tailwinds are on the price metric?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, I think that's yours.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sure. So, again, I want to separate price from mix. I think it's really important. So price itself, as we mentioned, which is apples-to-apples price for the same offering on a given test was down a little less than 1% in the quarter. So everything else was mix. So what we did share is the mix impact for Professional Laboratory Services was a headwind of 120 basis points. So you could back into everything else was the positive mix that offset price and offset the mix of PLS to give us a net 20 basis point improvement in revenue per req.","Now with that said, the reason we're very careful, Ricky, about separating price from mix is that while price definitely directionally is an indication of profitability, mix is not always representative of profitability, so we caution people, and as we've said over time, don't take math, which is mix driven, as a signal for increased or decreased profitability.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just to clarify on that impact from hospital, is that something that you expect to improve over the course of the year, over the course of the contract? Or is this just going to be a matter of we have to think about it from a comp perspective?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So it's a very different business, Ricky, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, and because of the nature of that business, it happens to have fewer tests and different priced tests than our core business. And those tests are at an attractive margin, so it's not indicative that, again, just because it has lower revenue per req, that that means it's not a profitable test. And in fact, the impact should grow because our expectations are that PLS will grow faster than our core book of business, and therefore that mix impact will increase over time, not just this year, but as our strategy would be going forward, we see more and more of these opportunities.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my next question is more longer-term nature, really focusing on 2018, which is the first year of PAMA. When we think about the different moving parts and try to better understand the earnings power, obviously there's more clarity on PAMA now, but can you just kind of like help us through to think what are the other variables we need to think about? Do you have any big contract up for renewal in 2018? And also as you think about expanding Invigorate beyond 2017, how much more cost do you estimate you'll need to take out in order to offset the PAMA impact?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so first of all on PAMA, as we said in our remarks, we're pleased we have a push-out of the date. Second is we're pleased that they've expanded with the approach of more laboratories in the sample set, and we'll see when we get to 2018 if there is a price reduction and how much it is. And they estimate that as mid-single digits.","And then also what we said is if you go back and look at our history, the reason why we have Invigorate and the reason why we continue to drive quality and efficiency is to be able to absorb some of the headwinds. And obviously, true price concessions, and I treat this as true price concessions, as Mark just said, is one of the offsets. So what we said and what we believe is when we get there, we'll have to absorb this, and we will absorb this.","So with that said, we've only provided guidance and an outlook for Invigorate through 2017. What I said in my remarks is they continue to be on track for that. It's $1.3 billion, it's an additional $600 million from what we achieved a couple years ago, so we feel good about the progress made on that.","And then what we also have said is that in any business, in any industry, you need to continue to drive efficiency and quality going forward past 2017, and we're not prepared at this point to talk about that. But given what I said earlier, obviously, we're going to have to have some efficiency gains in 2018 to be able to offset any kind of price erosion and we feel confident that we'll have those given what we have in our perspective on the future.","So that's what I can share this point, but we're encouraged by what we've learned in the visibility around PAMA. We're encouraged by Invigorate and the progress we're making there. And we're not done with that. We'll continue to make progress, and we'll deal with that in due course.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Good morning, gentleman.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","I guess you talked a lot about some of the improvements across the business. Obviously quite evident first part of this year versus last year and the few prior. Now, I guess, where do you feel like the momentum has been maybe better than you would have expected? Maybe it's on some of the PLS agreements or what bps is looking like?","And then is there any part that you would point to as it's trended that maybe you feel like needs to be more of a tailwind for you than it's been? It feels like the business is sort of starting to turn a corner here. So I'm just trying to differentiate where you feel like maybe not you've declared victory, but you're sort of where you want to be versus not.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I appreciate the question. And what we've said for the last four years is that our restore growth strategy is multifaceted. This business, this industry has a number of products, a number of different programs, a number of different services. And we have to work multiple fronts.","To answer your direct question about where we are encouraged, we are encouraged about the continued prospects around advanced diagnostics; the genetic offerings that we introduced this quarter are very strong. We feel they're very competitive now with some of the incumbents in the marketplace, particularly around our BRCA offering. We expanded our panel. We have now a very nice comprehensive hereditary-based panel.","And as you know, we continue to build on our relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering in that space. And we offer some nice offerings around colorectal cancer, as well as a comprehensive hereditary cancer panel. So that is good and growing, and a lot of promise in front of it.","Second is we talked about the work around hepatitis C continues to be a great opportunity for us. Last quarter, we talked about the companion diagnostics associated with it. That is promising.","And then third is prescription drug monitoring continues to be a big opportunity for us. It's growing. We're pleased with our progress. And as you know in this country, there's a lot of renewed interest around pain meds and opiates and misuse of those and we're right in the middle of that whole debate. And we're part of the solution to that problem. And with that, we're coupling that with our Hospital Services business, which we've been working on for the past four years. You're starting to see the fruits of our efforts there. We're very pleased with our announcement of Barnabas. We're very pleased with the acquisition of our Hartford Hospital outreach relationship, which again is a purchase, but at the same time it builds a relationship with Hartford Hospital. We're very pleased with our first work with HCA. And as I said, there's many more prospects in our funnel that we continue to be happy about.","Now with that said, the last question is where you think there's more promise. I think this last piece, the strategy around hospitals, is something that I believe will continue to be a great growth driver for us. As I work the country and speak with our teams and speak with hospital CEOs and their management teams, they clearly can't do it all themselves, and they're looking for partnerships. And they realize that all we do every day is diagnostic information services. And where we have these relationships are those organizations that realize they're best served serving their population and doing best in their business by relying on us for their diagnostic information services business. So I think there's a lot more growth opportunities going forward than what we've seen so far, and I'm optimistic about that. Thank you for the question.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, that was great. And maybe just quick follow-up on the cancer genetic side. There's so much going on and we continue to hear more optimistic things in terms of the companion PD-L1. How is your thought process evolving around how you're going to play there? Obviously you have some existing relationships. And how you size that market versus maybe some of the legacy similar type drugs?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, first of all, it's evolving, it's growing, it's exciting. As you know, reimbursement's always the challenge in this space. While we have focused on those areas where there is good reimbursement, and clearly, BRCA is one of the best examples of the industry seeing benefit from it and now it's getting reimbursed for it. And as we introduced with our new product this past quarter but we now have an expanded channel in that regard for other hereditary markers in that offering.","We believe that it looks promising for us and it provides more prospects for growth and we continue to work the reimbursement side of this to demonstrate with good clinical evidence that in fact that that actually delivering value that's actionable because only when you can defend that you have good clinical value and it is actionable, then you will get paid by healthcare insurance companies. So we're continuously working that. So it's evolving but it is exciting and it's a key opportunity for growth for us going forward.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to start just on the underlying utilization trends you're seeing. I know, Mark, you mentioned about half the growth was from CLP and MemorialCare. What do you think \u2013 did Barnabas and maybe the movement of Easter add in the quarter? And then just in general what are you seeing in terms of the physician office trend?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So I have not, and I wouldn't break out a specific engagement like Barnabas and its impact, but certainly it contributed positively for us. As you look at all the moving parts, Jack, I think the organic growth is a pretty solid number, taking into account the movement of Easter and other calendar shifts and so on and so forth. So you can look at the approximately 100 basis points of organic growth and count on that as being solid and something that's a trend that we're going to build on and continue throughout the balance of the year driven by growth in our core business and also some growth in this new opportunity being our professional laboratory services, most notably Barnabas. But I'm not going to be splitting out specific relationships or engagements each quarter.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, understood. And then one more on PAMA. I'm just curious now that the final rule is out in the market and is beginning to get digested by the industry, are you seeing any different tone with either hospitals or smaller independent labs in terms of the M&A around whether it's in-sourcing versus outsourcing and just the relationships that you develop there? Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I can't say that the build, if you will, of interest around building a relationship with Quest is specifically related to what's going on with PAMA. But there might be some correlation between PAMA in that it's another contributing factor. When we have conversations with hospital systems, they talk about the changing nature of their business, they're moving away from fee for service to taking risk. When you move the risk, they need to have a low-cost provider. There's no question we're a lower cost provider than typically their hospital lab is, and they have a lot of other priorities and why would they put the next dollar of investment into laboratory when they have a good national leader nearby?","And so that's typically the conversation we have, and they realize that there's going to be price pressure on the commercial rate in every place. And, yes, their laboratory commercial rates will be under pressure, but also they understand Medicare is not going to also provide a lot of help as well. So there could be pressure there. So it's contributing but it's not necessarily, I would say, an overall driver so far. But with all that said, I think people have realized that there will be, with all this analysis for interest in it going forward, it's hard to say beyond what the estimate was of mid-single digits in 2018, how that will affect specific labs.","So that estimate is based upon the market basket that CMS says. The fees for all their expenditures from the clinical lab fee schedule, and so when you specifically apply whatever cuts there might be to a specific business, they could be considerable for small operators that are doing mostly routine testing in a small geography. And they're not billing out all the codes like we do for clinical lab fee schedule for Medicare. So it's unfolding, so more to learn, but I think we've got a lot more clarity today than we did six months ago.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood, thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on these results.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just on the PAMA related reimbursement change delay, it's obviously good news as you mentioned. But it does still seem from some calls that we're getting that maybe there's still a little bit of investor confusion as to whether or not there could be any CMS cuts to the CLFS in 2017 to essentially replace the PAMA delay. I think there was some color in the final rule that suggests this is probably even more unlikely now, but maybe it wouldn't hurt on this call just to give your latest thoughts on that just to clear the air if you are able to. Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think CMS is very focused on getting PAMA right. It is an act of Congress and therefore, any change to PAMA would require another act of Congress. So their entire focus is on this. Clearly, they've got to get it right. They've been told by Congress that they need to do it with a market based approach, and this is their entire focus. So from our view, this is what we should expect will happen in 2017, is really gathering all the data, going through all the data trying to understand it. And as you know, we still have the CPI adjustment and the productivity adjustments as well. And some of that came through in 2016 and will continue to come through as time goes on. So our view is this is going to be predominance of focus for CMS and how we get paid.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. One other quick one, just if I can sneak one in too. The earlier color on the Safeway retail deal is helpful. Just the one quick follow-up on that is, I'm curious whether that Safeway deal precludes you from entering into other similar large deals with other retailers in those six states that you've entered into so far. And could you theoretically still do a national retail deal like this with any third party if you chose to do so? Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we continue to have freedom to operate. It's a great relationship. We could build on it. But we believe there's more opportunities for us to build our patient access. We have unparalleled access, we believe. We have over 2200 Patient Service Centers, they have over 3500 people in physicians' offices, and then we have partnerships with JVs.","So \u2013 and it continues to build, and we think this retail opportunity, as I described, has really got those three prongs. One is great patient experience, second is that helps us with efficiency, and potentially, augments that unparalleled access, with nice access to where people go every day which are typically retail stores. So we're encouraged, but we have more prospects as well going forward to expand in even further because we're not limited in our ability to operate with the relationship we have with Safeway.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. As Steve said, the contract with Safeway does not preclude us from other arrangements. But as you might imagine, we're not going to put in redundant space. So if we have a Safeway location in a given neighborhood, it's unlikely, even if we have a partnership with another retailer, that we would put another PSC in the same location. So it's really all about mapping this out, the demographics where our business is, where we draw the businesses from the physician's office, et cetera.","So in the partnership in Safeway it's really important, and they're kind of, since they're on the lead here, they're going to be one of the first people to decide, in partnership with us, where we're going to put some of these locations. And so I wanted to stress that while it doesn't preclude us and we certainly are in discussion with other retailers, we highly value the Safeway agreement, and as I said, as the first mover, they're going to going to be the one we're starting with.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Line is open.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on PAMA. So I'm not sure if you have an answer to this, but I'm just curious, in terms of using the NPI from a hospital perspective, just given that you have quite a few relationships with hospitals at this point, I'm just wondering how, or if you have any view into how they're looking at that piece of it, particularly if they don't have an NPI as a hospital lab. Is that something you think that hospital labs will have incentives to get at this point? Or is yours the opposite view?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well first of all, as I said in my remarks, the movement away from using the TIN, the tax ID number, to a net provider indicator or (44:04) number, is positive. We think there'll be more labs required to contribute their data to CMS with that.","But like so many parts of healthcare, we don't fully appreciate the extent of how many more and what percentage that will be. And actually, as trade associations, as American Clinical Lab Association, we're going to sponsor a project to actually do a sampling of hospitals to see if in fact there are \u2013 what this does to the sample. Because our objective, along with Congress, along with CMS is to get this right, and we said it should be market based, and we all agree that the market includes the national labs, the regional labs and hospital outreach. And so we appreciate this new approach, but we want to make sure that this new approach does capture possible outreach. So we're going to run a study to see what it shows us and then take it from there.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the Quintiles JV, just wanted to get an update there given their relationship with IMS. I think you had talked in the past about potentially working with Quintiles more broadly than the central lab. So wondering how those conversations are going at this point.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we continue to focus on our integration of our laboratory operations, and that was the primary focus of the joint venture is to bring both of our businesses together and take out the cost, the redundant cost of both those operations. We're making very good progress on that front. We feel good about it, and as Mark said in his introductory remarks, it's showing up in our results below the operating income line. But we will build value through that relationship.","As far as other work with Quintiles, what we shared before is, yes, we will consider working with Quintiles and IMS and others around how we use our data to help with drug discovery. We have nothing really firm in place with any of them, but I'll share with you that we have multiple working relationships, and one of those relationships is with Quintiles. So we continue to look at what the data means and how we could use it and doing some tests with a variety of potential partners in this space. So we're still encouraged about the prospects, but having some type of preferred or exclusive or closer relationship is not what we have today.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So first question I guess is going back to the earlier HCA HealthONE lab management question, and that is in the event that you were able to expand this, do you have any sense, Steve, what time, I guess, the evaluation period would be? I'm just trying to get an idea here. Is this a two-year see if this works and we can expand it, or is this a longer-term sort of project?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That would be highly speculative for me to comment on that. We have to be successful at this first project, demonstrate we can save them money. I mean, in the end, this all about making their inpatient laboratory more efficient. We believe we can. When we put those points on the board, we realized that that's going to be very visible to HCA management and we'll take it from there. But beyond what I said, it would be highly speculative for me to comment on how fast it's going to move.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just be clear, the relationship itself is not a pilot. It is a firm multi-year relationship that we're committed to. What we were implying is that, as you might imagine, there's a possibility of further expansion. And whether it's within HCA or other hospital systems, seeing the momentum we're getting, hearing from some of the CEOs with whom we have relationships how successful these things are going and how valuable it is to them. So we will save them money. So it's really, in our minds, just a matter of comfort and time before we'll expand these somewhere. Whether we expand it more broadly within HCA or other places, we think the better your track record is, the better opportunity you have to get more people onboard. And it is with the Denver division of HCA, just to be clear, not with HCA itself.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I appreciate the color. Thank you. And then secondly, just I guess latest thoughts around the FDA's LDT initiative. It seems like every day that goes by without it getting to OMB or congressional notification suggests that we may see a legislative solution?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're working it. As you know, we believe as an industry that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories and LDTs. We've been working proactively on a legislative solution with a number of groups. We've made some progress on that front, but as you know, it's the summer months and not a lot will happen in the summer months in Washington. So we will see, when the fall is here, where this goes, but we think a legislative solution is the best option for us. And that's the one that we're pursuing, and we hope we can be able to get to a place that we can accept as the Trade Association and as the company going forward. But it's still there, but it's moving at a very slow pace.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Understood. Thanks for the color.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from A. J. Rice, UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. Good morning, A. J.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, thanks. Hi, everybody. How are you?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","With the pickup in the pace around deals with hospitals, whether its contract, outright purchasing of business and other structures, can you just maybe comment a little bit on how those structures have evolved and the economics of the deals that you're seeing today versus a few years ago? Are they different, about same? Are you pushing a different type of structure? Is the hospital asking for any kind of different structure? Just give us some flavor on that.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, first of all, you see one deal, you see one deal. We've said this before because healthcare is complex. Every deal has got its own nuances as you could appreciate. And you have to separate. When we buy an outreach business, that's an outright purchase of their existing commercial business. And in the case, a good example of that is what we did with Hartford Hospital and CLP, which we closed and we're in the process of integrating.","And I would characterize those deals as being similar to the other ones we've done. We take over the business. We reprice it at our rates. We build a business case around taking out cost and we think the returns for our shareholders are quite good. But what I'll also say, and I said this in my introductory remarks, when we typically do that, it typically gets us into a broader conversation about their lab strategy. And so typically they say, wow (51:18), okay, now we're tight with you. Let's talk about our advanced testing for our hospitals, or what's called reference testing, and let's talk about how you potentially could help us with our hospital inpatient laboratory and making that more efficient. So it typically becomes a beachhead opportunity for us to build a stronger relationship.","The second type of relationship, A. J., is we have an engagement, a professional services engagement like the one we have with Barnabas. And that's a services relationship. It's multi-year. We're providing service for a fee. We believe that we agree on certain conditions of delivery and payment, and we run it as that. And again, when we get in those relationships, because this is all around their inpatient laboratory, we then typically get in a conversation around their outreach business. Is that something they want to continue to stay in? Could we help them with it? And second is their advanced testing or their reference testing business. So we have that conversation, as well.","And I would say the third example is where there is a broader, deeper relationship where we think it might be prudent for us to form a joint venture in some form. And the most recent example of us doing that is with University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where we bought their outreach business but we also help them in many different ways in central Massachusetts. And so they actually have a small minority stake in that joint venture. So we're deeply embedded together in making that work in central Mass.","So all different sizes and shapes of how we work with hospital systems, which reflects the marketplace. I think part of our strategy here as well is what we're showing to the marketplace is we're a company and an organization that can manage in this very, very dynamic space. And you can work with Quest in whatever way makes sense. Obviously we want a deal that's going to work for both sides, but we are flexible and prudent in how we put together those relationships. But again, you see one deal, you see one deal. So hopefully that's helpful in providing a little bit more color...","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, that's great. Let me \u2013 just a quick follow-up on a different area. So you had the asset sale this quarter and you stepped up the share repurchase as you've done before with other asset sales. When you think about capital deployment for the second half and moving forward, should we assume the share repurchase activity sort of settles back to what we saw in the first quarter? Or any other comments on direction of cash flow in the back half of the year?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so I assume when you say cash flow, you mean cash utilization, A. J.?","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","What you should assume is we'll follow our fifth point of our five-point strategy, so once we get through the ASR, which was really triggered as you pointed out by the monetization of the Focus Products business, we'll continue to either deploy towards M&A or towards share repurchases.","Obviously between the dividend and share repurchases we've done through the first half of the year, we've met our commitment of guaranteeing a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So we've met that threshold. So the back half, depending on the timing and probability of executing any sort of deals, the cash flow will either be utilized for that, and if we don't have value-creating deals and we close in that timeframe, then we will \u2013 as opposed to sitting on the cash \u2013 we would do some additional repurchases.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Isaac.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, Steve. First question was kind of a longer-term item regarding PAMA. Just curious if the current state of PAMA legislation has had any impact on the nature of your conversations with private payers when it comes to negotiating your longer-term contracts with them.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. It's an interesting topic, but frankly they're looking at our relationship, the term of that relationship, where any discussion around pricing should be. So very little relationship, if any, between what's happening with PAMA and the refresh of the lab fee schedule in our discussions with payers.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we've gotten that question, Isaac, a number of times. I want to say again that there's very, very few contracts, if any, that are mechanically tied to Medicare rates. Yes, it's a reference point that people use in some discussions, but there's really \u2013 since there's not a mechanistic trigger, as Steve said, it's really not been a topic of conversation. They obviously want the best value. We're having discussions around the value that we bring them and the fact that we already have excellent pricing. That's more the focus of the conversation versus anything going on in the public sector reimbursement.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on 2016 guidance, specifically for cash flow. I think your guidance does call for an acceleration in CapEx in the back half of this year just based on what we know you spent in the first half. So I'm wondering what that acceleration is related to, and then to what extent some of those dollars might be one time in nature that roll off in 2017? Thank you.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so when you say acceleration, we have had a historical pattern of spending more in the back half than the first half, so this year is not atypical. We are slightly lower this year versus last year by a little over $10 million for the first six months of the year. We're guiding to a number that's similar to slightly less than we spent last year, so I think it all fits, Isaac. It really has to do with the timing of some of the work that we're doing where we consume our capital, and certainly a part of that is some equipment refresh. Some of that is tied to our Invigorate program such as the lab standardization work, and it's really driven by when we're executing some of those conversions.","So really nothing unusual or atypical, I would say, in our capital spend this year, but I think the good news is that we're expecting to spend less this year than we did last year. And as we move forward, as we've mentioned, we're looking to get some of this high level of capital for Invigorate behind us and really return to a little lower level than we have versus the last couple years as a proportion of our total operating cash flow and as a proportion of risk.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That makes sense. Thanks very much, guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from building Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bill.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Just kind of a big picture question on the commercial contracting outlook going forward. I think we're coming up on 10 years of some of these preferred national relationships for the large labs and some of the largest payers. Obviously the payer landscape's changing pretty dramatically. At least one of those contracts, I believe, terms in 2018. I'm just curious how you think that situation plays out going forward. Do you think we continue to have a situation where you have certain payers aligned with certain national providers? Or do you think we move into a more open access kind of contracting situation over the next several years?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, first of all, Bill, thanks for the question. We're not going to comment on the specific contracts with some of our largest partners. But as we said before, we have hundreds of contracts so we're potentially working, and what happens every year with some of the refreshes on those contracts. And in that regard, we have our normal cadence of how we'll work through that this year, next year and into 2018.","Generally, given our leadership position in this marketplace, we're fortunate to be included in most of the healthcare insurance contracts throughout this country. And I think we're increasingly making it obvious it's good for patients, it's good for them attracting membership that they have Quest on contract.","Now despite us maybe not having a preferred national relationship in some cases, we still continue to have strong working relationships with some of those healthcare insurance companies that we don't enjoy those relationships. And also, we continue to see other ways of working together with some of those systems. So I won't speculate on or give specifics on contract dates and timing of all that, but we're managing this in due course. And fortunately for us, we have a very strong position given our strength and position in this marketplace that collectively and collaborately we're part of the network of what's required in healthcare delivery throughout the country in a big way. And we have a good, strong seat at the table.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Do you want to elaborate at all, you said exploring alternative ways of working together, on what any of that might look like?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I mean, give an example. We have a big business measure around wellness. So our wellness business is a good business, we sell it directly to large employers but we also sell it to healthcare insurance companies. In selling it to healthcare insurance companies, they resell it. An example of that is we sell it to Aetna, we sell it to Cigna, but we also sell it to United Optum, as an example.","We also are perpetually asked for data. We test about 50% of adult Americans every year, excuse me in the course of three years. Having that data is quite important to healthcare insurance companies. So we're quite collaborative with the industry of serving up our data to help them manage some of their managed Medicaid or managed Medicare business in a collaborative way.","So, two examples. And the third example is with Inovalon, which is our data analytics product which is part of our new product introduction that we made this year around Quantum. We serve this up to all healthcare insurance companies, regardless of what we have for a laboratory contract. And so we're proactively working with all the companies that are taking risk, and so put this again in a different place with all healthcare insurance companies in a much different and broader way. So we often think about our laboratory contract, but our relationship with these systems are much broader than that.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Perfect.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.","Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please.","Shawn Bevec","Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables through our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.","For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Also, growth rate associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. As a reminder, the company now reports uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility, which we will refer to as patient concession as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within SG&A expenses.","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, we'll discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2018, and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our 2019 guidance. For the fourth quarter, revenues decreased 1.4%, reported EPS was $0.92, down about 50% from the same period of 2017, and adjusted EPS was $1.36, down 2.9%. Performance in the quarter reflects increased reimbursement headwinds as well as softer organic volume than we expected at investor day, and the change in estimate of reserves for revenue and accounts receivable, which Mark will cover later in the call.","For the full-year 2018, revenues grew 1.7%, reported EPS declined roughly 4% to $5.29. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 17%, to $6.31. In 2018, we grew revenues, adjusted earnings attached from operations despite some challenges in the marketplace. Mark will update you on the quarter, and share our perspective on 2019. Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow share, and deliver revenue growth as our in-network status now extends to approximately 90% of commercially insured lives in the United States. Volumes are off to a good start this year. Our guidance for 2019 reflects our expectation that strong volume growth will continue throughout the year. It also reflects significant reimbursement pressure partially offset by our continued execution of our Invigorate program.","As we discussed at our investor day, in November, we are poised for growth based on three fundamental changes in the marketplace. First, panel-driven reimbursement pressure is a catalyst for structural change. In 2019, we expect about a 10% reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates, and a similar reduction in 2020. The impact of these cuts will be more significant on smaller independent hospital outreach laboratories which we believe could eliminate the majority of their profit, and will provide a catalyst for market consolidation. Second, payers are more focused than ever of driving better value in their [indiscernible], which supports our plan to gain share. And finally, nobody cares more about the variation in healthcare cost than employers and their employees, the country's largest payer. Increasingly, patients are motivated to find the high-value low-price providers, like Quest.","So, we are very well-positioned to benefit from these trends. Our strategy to accelerate growth has five elements. Now, I'll share the progress we've made. First, we aim to grow more than 2% this year from M&A. In 2018, acquisitions contributed more than 3% to revenue growth. The nine deals we announced and closed, since the beginning of 2018, position us well to meet our 2019 target. Earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of a clinical laboratory services business of Boyce and Bynum, a leading provider of diagnostic and clinical laboratory services in the Midwest. The second element is to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems.","First on health plans, we're entering 2019 with the best assets this company has had in over a decade. We've added 43 million lives, which represents about a billion dollar opportunity for Quest as a result of our in-network status with UnitedHealthcare, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia. As I said earlier, we have already seen encouraging volume growth early in 2019 resulting from this expanded network access. Hospital health systems are facing unprecedented financial pressures, and are therefore motivated to discuss ways we can help them with their lab strategy. We recently signed two new professional laboratory services agreements in the Southeast region. In both relationships we will provide full lab management employing technical lab staff, providing operational lab oversight, and maintaining responsibility for the laboratory supply chain.","As we outlined at our investor day, most hospital CEOs and CFOs are still not fully aware of PAMA which impacts hospital outreach labs. We believe that this impact of PAMA becomes increasingly more visible, hospital will be more motivated to work with us on their laboratory strategy. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We made key acquisitions to expand our capability and enhance our service offerings in 2018. We saw strong double-digit growth in 2018 from a number of key test categories, including prescriptive drug monitoring, tuberculosis testing, and Cardio IQ. In 2018, we made significant progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the laboratory provider of choice for consumers.","Before arriving at a patient service center, patients can check in electronically through MyQuest and view estimated wait times before making an appointment. At the patient service center or in the physician's office, our enhanced real-time estimate let's patients know their financial responsibility before we collect their specimen. And then, once the results are available, patients can view them through MyQuest digital platform, which is now available for more than 6.5 million users, or they could review them on the Apple Health app. Next, we continue to build out our industry-leading retail strategy. At year-end, we'll be in more than 200 Safeway and Walmart locations. In 2018, we launched QuestDirect, a service which enables consumers to have a test without a doctor's script in the continental United States. And we're pleased with the volumes we've seen so far.","The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health and data analytics and extended care services. Payers understand the value of the lab data and how it can help them improve their members' health outcomes. This has strengthened our value proposition as well. We're also growing revenues from pharmaceutical customers. Quest Clinical Trials Connect, which we launched in 2018, is helping pharma and CROs recruit patients for trials faster, better, and more efficiently. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Our Invigorate cost-cutting initiatives has been successful, and we see more opportunities ahead. We are confident there's an opportunity to continue to improve and save roughly 3% on a cost structure or about $200 million per year to offset increases in our wage bill as well as reimbursement pressures.","At a recent investor day, we identified a number of areas for improvement, such as reducing denials of patient concessions, further digitizing our business, continuing to standardize and automate and optimize their lab and patient service center networks. Given the increased reimbursement pressure in 2019, we're also closely managing our cost structure. We are rebalancing our resources by reducing expenses in some areas while ensuring we have the operational resources needed to deliver on the volume increases we expect this year.","Now, let me turn over to Mark who will take you through our financial performance and our 2019 guidance in detail. Mark.","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve. In the fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $1.84 billion, down 1.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 1.5% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a change in estimated adjustment to increase reserves for net revenue on accounts receivable that we previously highlighted in November. I will share more on this in a moment.","Volume measured by the number of our acquisitions increased 3.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 1.1%. Revenue per acquisition in the fourth quarter declined by 5.5%, versus the prior year, driven primarily by the reserve adjustments and increased denials in patient concessions. For the full-year, price headwinds were consistent with our expectations of slightly less than 1.5%.","Now, I'd like to provide color on the reserve adjustment we made in the fourth quarter. You'll recall we discussed this at Investor Day. We recorded a change in estimate to increase our accounts receivable reserves by approximately $35 million. We did this based on the following: Unexpected increases in coverage denials and patient responsibility and a billing system conversion in one of our regional labs that resulted in timely filing denials and impacted our ability to precisely estimate reimbursement rates. Because these items were not typical with our historical experience we monitored them in accordance with our process increased our reserve levels. I am confident in our process and we have timed the level of precision around this complex estimation going forward.","Before moving on, I'd also like to provide an update on the headwinds to our prescription drug monitoring hep C and vitamin D test categories that we've been testing over the prior couple of quarters. In prescription drug monitoring, we saw an increase in restricted payer policies that impacted both volume and reimbursement, but we lapsed denials for two of the more significant payers in the fourth quarter. In 2019, we continue to expect PDM reimbursement challenges as payers seek more clinical evidence to support coverage.","Turning to hep C, as we noted previously, as these hepatitis C therapy reduces the need for genotype testing, while market share of this therapy continues to grow modestly, we expect to lapse the most significant headwinds by the second quarter. And finally, in vitamin D testing higher payer denials impacted both volume and revenue in 2018. One national payer implemented a more restrictive policy last March which we expect to lap in Q1, but we expect continued pressure on vitamin D testing in 2019. Moving on to the remainder of our fourth quarter results, reported operating income was $220 million or 12% of revenues compared to $269 million or 14.4% of revenues last year.","On an adjusted basis, operating income was $271 million or 14.7% of revenues compared to $317 million or 17% of revenues in the prior year. Reported EPS was $0.92 in the quarter compared to $1.82 a year ago. Note the prior-year quarter included a tax benefit recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted EPS was $1.36 down approximately 3% from $1.38 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.2 billion in 2018 versus $1.18 billion in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2018 were $383 million compared to $252 million a year ago.","Now turning to guidance, we are providing the following outlook for 2019. Revenue is expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than 516 and adjusted EPS to be greater than 640. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million.","Now, there are several considerations that I will now review for you to think about in 2019. First, as we've shared previously, we are facing more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year. This headwind is expected to be relatively and evenly spread throughout the year. Second, based on the factors I discussed earlier, the fourth quarter of 2018 should create an easy compare in the fourth quarter of 2019. Third, our revenue guidance includes more than 1% revenue growth from M&A that has already been announced and executed. Fourth, as Steve mentioned, our volumes are off to a good start this year, and we expect them to continue to build throughout the year.","Finally, we are incurring incremental costs in the first quarter to support the volume growth from our expanded network access. We're also tightly managing our cost structure, and have undertaken a restructuring in the first quarter of 2019, and will begin to yield savings starting in the second quarter. As you think about the first quarter, we have approximately one less revenue day. And to remind you, denials in patient concession increased throughout 2018, and we are assuming these headwinds carry into 2019. Taking these into consideration with some of the items I just highlighted, we expect revenue to be flat to down in the first quarter, while adjusted EPS is expected to be similar to the adjusted EPS we reported in the fourth quarter.","I will now turn it back to Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow revenue and earnings. Our in-network status now extends to approximately 90% of the commercially insured lives in the United States, and volumes are off to a good start. Our guidance for 2019 reflects reimbursement pressures offset by strong volume increases, and continued execution of our Invigorate program.","Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Muken","So, as we look at sort of the fourth quarter and kind of what's implied in the first part of '19 and then over the balance of the year, I guess as you think about sort of the state of the lab market in general and some of the reimbursement headwinds you're dealing with, and then the flexibility of your cost structure, I guess in terms of your thesis for the business, obviously there's a lot of things that occurred toward the end of the year that were challenging for you guys, but yet there's a lot positive happening on the volume side. I guess how do you sort of put it all together for us so we can be confident that clearly the challenges we saw in the back part of this year you've sort of dealt with and now are reflected accurately so that we sort of found a rebasing side?","And then what could you point us to kind of over the balance of this year that we should be looking for to kind of judge that the jump off into, hopefully, '20 and beyond, I guess, is going to be better? Because obviously you had a tough fourth quarter, the Q1 is supposed to be a bit weaker, and Mark you walked through that. And then we're sort of recovering. So I'm just trying to get a sense for confidence in some of the moving parts and your sort of evolved thesis here.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, let me start, and then I'll turn it to Mark. And thanks for asking the question. So start, we'd go back to what we shared with you in investor day. We still believe as the market leader we have a tremendous opportunity to gain share. And I think we just announced the kickoff of our journey to pick up share, and it starts in 2019. We also couple 2019 with the most significant reimbursement that this industry has ever seen, so in reimbursement costs, and so it's muting some of the share gains that we're going to pick up this year. But what we told you at investor day, there's two parts of our market share gains, is one is we do believe we can accelerate M&A, and we're actually targeting for 2% growth through M&A. What we said in our guidance, we only will put in our guidance what we have seen so far closed, so it's roughly 1% in the guidance for 2019.","Second is, we will see organic growth, and we have to pick up the volumes to be able to offset that reimbursement pressure. But when you go through the math, we believe there's an opportunity for us to pick up share in '19, and that will continue in 2020. The second part of this is what's going on in the industry, and I'll come back to those three points again. One is, PAMA is hurting all of us, but it's going to hurt the non market leading laboratories much more significantly. We believe this will be a catalyst for further consolidation. Second is, with our better than ever access changes payers are working proactively with us in how they do a better job of managing our category of spend.","And then finally, as consumers are pushing back on their physicians, pushing back on their employers and asking questions about the best value in the marketplace, and we are the best value in the marketplace; the best quality, the best service at the lowest price. So, Ross, we have really kicked off '19 with the beginning of a journey here to pick up share. And we believe with confidence that we can deliver that outlook that we outlined at investor day.","Mark, would you like to add to that?","Mark Guinan","Yes, sure, Steve. Ross, as I mentioned, and we've talked about several times, including the investor day, this year saw more dramatic changes throughout the year than certainly any one I've experienced since I've been at Quest. Denials were a big part of that. I'll start with the vitamin D change back in the second quarter, we saw more and more state Medicaid programs making decisions on cystic fibrosis, we've talked about prescription for monitoring and payers both tightening policies around same day of service for presumptive and definitive testing, which we think is clinically appropriate but they've put in policies to deny payment for one of those tests. We've seen them squeezing panels saying that they're going to pay for fewer and fewer analytes [ph], and again we don't think that's necessarily clinically appropriate but that is the way many of them are paying now.","And even in the area allergy, there was an NCCI edit that was put in last year that resulted in significant denials in our allergy space. So, it was a tough year from a denials perspective. We have built all that into our 2019 guidance. And so when I talked about carrying the fourth quarter business into Q1, we fully accounted for all that in our thinking in the guidance we're providing. The other area of surprise was patient concessions. And we, based on what we knew going into the year, we're expecting a similar level of patient concessions. I'm sure you've seen and we referenced the Keiser Report that came out about the middle of the year that informed us and others that actually the average deductable went up significantly, so there was more being borne by patients.","Obviously that meant more of our revenue was coming from patients, and we were just starting to see that in our collections because there's obviously a delay in the adjudication process to the payers, and then we -- as we send the bills out to the patients so we start to get an experience of the collection rate that may or may not match our historical rate, and was actually finding that it was being negatively impacted. The other thing I mentioned was we did have some issues with one of our lab conversions. We have done a number of these that we've shared. We're getting close to the endpoint in the standardization process. This particular lab was not a legacy Quest system, it was a system we had acquired a couple of years ago as part of an acquisition. We therefore did not do as well with this conversion as we did historically, and therefore we struggled, as I mentioned, with some filing deadlines and other things.","The other issue is this is in a geography where historically there's higher rate of payment concessions versus other geographies. So, as we got delays in our ability to send out bills and as we looked more and more to patients and less directly to the payers, that definitely created a headwind. The good news on that one is we fully expect that to be behind us. And so that's more of a temporal issue versus the denials, which as I said. And the overall level of patient responsibility will carry into 2019, and is fully baked within our guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks, guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick Donnelly","Good morning. Steve, maybe just on the United trends, I know you gave some color. You guys are expecting a first tranche to move pretty quickly. Can you just talk through how it's come in relative to expectations? And then any way you can frame the expectations for the year would certainly be appreciated in terms of what's\u2026","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, sure. So, what I said in my prepared remarks, it's off to a good start. And we expected that it would be off to a good start, so it's on our expectation that we expected to be able to pick up some of the volume early in the year. But what we also said is that it will continue to build throughout '19, and also this provides us a growth opportunity beyond '19, into '20, into '21, okay. So, when I talk about a billion dollars worth of opportunity, we'll see a portion of that in '19, and that's contemplated in our guidance. But there is a large portion of that billion dollars beyond '19. So it's tracking well. We're happy with the early volumes we see. And it will continue to build throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Ralph Giacobbe","Just lab equipment size, an incremental $30 million headwind from Medicaid related to PAMA. Are you seeing similar -- I think you said over $200 million of reimbursement headwind, seemed a little bit worse than what you previously estimated, so wanted to understand that. And then if you could, real quick, you talked about incremental cost in the -- I think you said in the first quarter, hoping you can just size that, and whether that does go away for the rest of the year.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, Mark?","Mark Guinan","Sure. Ralph, the $200 million is actually consistent with what I shared at investor day. The amount of PAMA headwinds outside the clinical lab fee schedule, where we're directly reimbursed from Medicare on fee for service, is not large. There's some Medicaid programs that have reduced their rates, they may have justified it or cited PAMA changes. It's hard to know whether these Medicaid rates are directly tied to PAMA. You can look across all the states, there seems to be potentially some direct relationship. Not all of them have changed the rates. So yes, there's a little bit of headwind in Medicaid as there typically is, that's not unusual, certainly not to the magnitude of the amount that you asked us about.","And then, we're not going to size the investment specifically, but what we wanted people to understand is when you look at the rhythm of the quarters coming to the year, on the cost side, not only do we not benefit from the restructuring of our cost base that we announced at the end of this quarter until Q2, but we also are actually spending more in Q1 as we're making people aware of our new access in all of the geographies where we need to inform patients and providers. We're adding [indiscernible] by adding patient service centers, extra couriers, doing all the things to ensure that as this volume comes the customer and stakeholder experience is outstanding. And obviously, we'll continue to monitor that as we see the volume, and either add more or less, but initially when you add that a little bit ahead of the volume it's cost versus cost of sales.","So, that's really what we wanted to make sure people understood. And then the other significant item in terms of the quarterly cycling, as I mentioned, is one fewer revenue day that it is significant. We pick it up in Q3, but losing a day billing Q1 versus last year is going to be a significant impact in the year-over-year comparison.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Morning, Bill.","Bill Quirk","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, a couple of questions here, so first off, on vitamin D, real quick, just want to confirm that this is lower volumes versus, say, pressure on reimbursement levels. Also on the Medicaid denials, was hoping you could expand on that a little bit because it's pretty much universally covered, at least based on our due diligence. And then lastly, just big picture question for Steve, based on your conversations, how much volumes from the hospitals do you think could be play for M&A over the three-year PAMA period -- initial PAMA period? Thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Got you. Mark, why don't you take the first two?","Mark Guinan","Yes, so the Medicaid denials, and I'm not sure what you're referencing, Bill, but a combination of managed Medicaid where they put in more restrictive requirements, including preauthorization that often can result in denials. Also, some of it arguably clinically appropriate where they put in new intelligence to ensure that we only have this once in a lifetime. They may have had this done by a different lab. Historically we obviously weren't aware of it. We get an order, we think it's legitimate, we do the work, we provide it to the payer and they deny it based on it -- once in a lifetime policy. So those things are absolutely tightening in the cystic fibrosis. And we have had a couple of states, I don't have it at my fingertips, we'll circle back and do that actually, the state programs with traditional Medicaid that have stopped reimbursing cystic fibrosis as well. And vitamin D, as I mentioned, it was a combination. So certainly, we still continue to get and got orders with screening codes. Quite often vitamin D is ordered as a part of a bunch of other common laboratory testing. So we don't choose to not perform that test. Even if a diagnostic code initially is not one that suggest to get reimburse, so and absolutely the headwind to our revenue, revenue for rack. And has resulted in significant denials with the change in this national payer, but also as physicians have gotten educate them with the appropriate use and certainly, we're driving that. The industry is driving that, you have seen a fall-off because some of the vitamin D that was being ordered was prescreening and clinically that has been determined not to be appropriate. But there still is a number of vitamin D tests are coming to in the screen codes that really are not screening. The doctors just are not coding them appropriately, and unfortunately, those are resulting in denials and headwinds for us.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So Bill, on your question about the opportunities around hospitals, let me start by reminding you and everyone that, what we said in the Investor Day is in 2018, we have a strong year for M&A. It's about 300 basis points roughly. And if you recall, you go back to one of those Investor Day slides up for use and charts we use, if you look at the distribution of the M&A, we've done past few years, it's really been a balance of acquiring hospital outreach, acquiring some outreach deals. Excuse me, some laboratory regional deals and they are finally buying some capabilities and services and advanced diagnostics. And if you look at the hospital deals, it's been, a good part, but not a majority of what we have acquired. And then, second is we still pick up let's say one regional app for year. And that, in fact, we just said in our prepared remarks that we closed on voice and vitamin Missouri.","So it's a good example of doing that once again. And what we also indicated is prospectively, we do believe it's obviously for all three categories, is that M&A should be north of 2% going forward. And we also said we've only contemplated in our guidance, something around 1%, which are those deals for 2019. So some portion of that is the acceleration in the discussions we're having with hospitals around their lab strategy. And we have those discussions Bill, we also have discussions around professional laboratory services and that's an organic growth opportunity. And we announced again in our prepared remarks that we picked up two engagements in the back half '18 that we feel good about and we have more engagements in the pipeline as well. So you need to think about our hospital strategy really from a contributor to M&A because of that 2% but also equally the opportunity organically to pick up organic revenue growth through these professional laboratory services engagements that we continue to announce.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Steve Rusckowski","Good Morning, Lisa.","Lisa Gill","Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Mark. I just really wanted to just make sure that I understand how we're thinking about the cadence of earnings this year. If I look at 2018, it looks like roughly 52% of earnings came in the front half, 48% in the second half. It sounds like it's going to be vastly different in 2019, am I thinking about that correctly that we're going to see a lot more of the earnings come in the third and fourth quarter just based on all your commentary whether we think about the incremental day in the third quarter, we think about anniversary in hep C, as well as vitamin D as well as some other things, so that would just be the first part of my question. And then secondly, also, along those lines, Steve you made this comment around the volume to build throughout the year as it pertains to the managed care contracts, can you maybe just give us some color, is that you are educating the physicians that are being in networks, is it what are some of the things that will have to happen throughout 2019 to give us comfort that you will see that volume?","Steve Rusckowski","Okay, Mark. It's for you.","Mark Guinan","So I'll start with the quarterly cadence Lisa. Yes, you're correct. So as we look at 2019, as I mentioned Q4, should be in we expected an easy compare to 2018 given the significant change enhancements that I referenced also and Steve will comment more color when we submitted, but we expect volumes to build. So while we certainly moved a bunch of offices and got incremental access volumes you know at the beginning of the year, we are continuing to compete that we expect to build more and more over time. And we also have referenced and are anticipating and hopeful that United will announce this preferred lab network. And we're hoping to be included that and we're expecting to be we're all waiting that announcement. We think that will benefit us as well, certainly with United patients. And yes, we have probably not gotten as much into the calendar impact on quarterly cycling in the past, but it is so significant, we're going to provide more transparency, so losing a day in the first quarter, getting a day in the third quarter, certainly well, change the year-over-year impact that is not insignificant. And then finally as you mentioned some of the timing of what we incurred some of the headwinds last year and when we left those and that will not happen in Q1. So therefore, we have some a topic compared to year-over-year in Q1 combined with the cost items that I mentioned earlier, so for all those reasons that compares much tougher in Q1.","Last thing I would add is patient concessions. As we mentioned the beginning of the year, we did not anticipate a significant shift to patients away from the payers directly on where revenue would come from. Now that we saw what happened last year, we are building in a higher rate of patient concessions from day one. Obviously, over time as we look at our collections, we will adjust that, but that's certainly going to be a headwind in the first quarter as well. All of those things are built into the guidance that we provided for the year.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so just to fill out the question around volume growth throughout the year and the first tranche of the first quarter, so what we shared in 2018 is when we announced that we're going to be back in network with United and Horizon and with anthem in Georgia. We started to communicate that to our customers. And so, what we will see in the first quarter is the first tranche, if you will, of those really good customers's request that they wanted us to get back into network and we're ready to flip those accounts as quickly as possible. So you'll see that and second part of this is, why it's going to continue to build, it's not everyone is flipping on day one. I mean, they provide us an opportunity for the rest of '19 and then into '20 and '21 and some of this is that some of the market is still hearing firsthand from us that we're back in network. So the answer to your question what do we need to do is we continue to work on communication. We do this with our sales force, it takes multiple calls to the customer and to be able to flip those accounts typically, sometimes we need to work out some of the IT integration issues to make sure we can get those orders and as a result of those some customers that might be relatively new and that just takes some time.","So if you take the state of New Jersey we are essentially we're back in network with the Blue Cross Blue Shield system in New Jersey and with United. We picked up a lot of access, so we've got a number of accounts that were detailing to pick up the gun and a chair for those taking more time than maybe where we only had -- did have 10% of the volume of those loyal customers in that first tranche. So that's what we're going to need to do and we'll do in backup and that will continue in 2020 and 2021 where we still see more opportunities to pick up shares.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Jack Meehan","Thanks. Hi, Steve. Hi, Mark.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Jack.","Mark Guinan","Hi, Jack.","Jack Meehan","I had a couple of just hoping for some details on both the rev per rack and volumes in the quarter. So on rev per rack down 5.5% by my math, the accounts receivable change was about two points. So if you could reach us on the remaining, what some of the factors are? That will be helpful. And on the volume side, how much did M&A contribute and the moving pieces between weather in calendar would be helpful?","Steve Rusckowski","And you're asking weather in calendar in Q4 Jack, or just?","Jack Meehan","Yes, all related to the fourth quarter.","Steve Rusckowski","Okay. So the other drivers of revenue per rack include things like mix, so for instance, our PLS business which, as we explained in the past had higher as lower revenue per rack at a higher growth rate than our overall core business. So that created some headwinds on a rev per rack. And then, what I referenced in terms of the fact that the business experienced an increasing level of denials throughout the year and also patient concessions relative to the prior year. So those things all maybe the tough compared year-over-year Q4 2017 versus Q4 2018, so it wasn't just the change in estimates but it is actually a recognition that that business have revenue per req as we are exiting the year.","So those are some of the contributors. We certainly had a little bit of weather impact, it wasn't significant but it was a headwind in that as well. In terms of days, that was a small impact, small negative impact as well. And the other thing was that we had some price changes in the back half of the year that will annualize in 2019 before the end of the year. So you combine all those things and those certainly were the drivers in the year-over-year decrease in rev req.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question.","Kevin Caliendo","Good morning, guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Caliendo","Thanks for the call. So I just wanted to go over the United the preferred network. You made the comment that you hoped to be included. And I would assume that you're planning on being included given that you're now part of your now in network but if you can clarify that that comment a little bit that would be helpful but also I just want to understand what you think is going to actually happen within the United Network come July 1, like what actually changes within the United behavior within their member behavior. You can sort of quantify that? That would be really helpful.","Steve Rusckowski","Sure, sure, first of all, one would think when we announced in May that we're back in the United and we're the Nation's largest commercial laboratory that if in fact United were to go forward with a preferred migratory network that we would be included.","Now it's up to them to announce that. But we're clearly hopeful and planning on being one of the shortlist of laboratories that are included and in that, what we share with that in the past is that all payers and particularly United I think in my mind is taking the lead on this, is realizing that they could do more to do a better job in laboratory spending and by doing, by having a preferred laboratory network, they're going to tighten up the network and they will work with us on things that we can do to make sure that we drive market share gains. And that would include things like working with your customers that are so customers on benefit designs, it could include working with us on our hospital strategy where it could be in the best interest of all parties to think about a different network strategy within the geography. It also could include things that we're proactively going after certain geographies where we know there's an opportunity for us to gain share. So can announce it before it's announced but we're hopefully, we'll be included as you would expect, we should be given we're the largest national and given that we just announced that network and there'll be a lot of strategies within this to help us with our market deep plans that we've outlined through the course of the last six to nine months. So Mark, you would like to add to that?","Mark Guinan","I think that covers and obviously we're respectful of United's desire and right to announce, we've applied for that lab network, there is a certain set of criteria as we looked at it, we're very confident. But ultimately we need to wait for United and then in terms of what the particular aspects are I think Steve has captured it well, largely it's leverage preferred, you preferred for a reason obviously it's better value but it's also quality metrics and other things that United is looking for their members and therefore United, the patients and everybody is in the ecosystem who is in that preferred lab network will all benefit if there's more work sent to those better value providers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Mark Guinan","Good morning, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser","Good morning. So two questions, let me start with the payer one, so when you listed the factors that had a negative impact on price in 2018, you talked about payer denial that started in March when national pay is going to lab into first quarter. So what gives you confidence that other national payers are not going to follow the lead of the specific one, you have had conversations with payers and have you factored in that risk in your guidance range?","Mark Guinan","Ricky, thanks for the question. Actually a majority of the payers are already there and in the managed Medicare space they've been following MLCP for a while and that's really where this emanated from, Cigna adopted it in 2018, the labs remaining significant payer who have to do early on, we obviously have a very close relationship with Aetna, we expect Aetna to move in that direction and certainly that is built within our assumption, we don't know exact timing, we don't know for sure but certainly in our assumptions and our guidance we are expecting Aetna to go there as well and therefore all the national payers to be there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Mark Guinan","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Hynes","Good morning. So where you get your free cash flow guidance, it looks pretty strong despite the reimbursement headwinds, can you let us know what is embedded of that free cash flow guidance, is it how much share repurchase on this embedded, how much is slated to M&A and then secondly and typically you provided guidance range and you just doing minimum this time, is it a reason for that and maybe what are the biggest swing factors that could get you higher than that minimum range? Thank you.","Mark Guinan","Sure, Ann. So the guidance on operating cash flow of $1.3 billion is obviously commensurate with our pacing around earnings, it is not a significant change in working capital assumes within those number, there is other puts and calls around some tax items and so on and so forth that impact our operating cash flow, that we take into account. But largely the change year-over-year is based on our net earnings. In terms of cash deployment, I talked about the 350 to 400 for internal capital which obviously we view somewhere between 900 and 950 of free cash flow, our dividend now gets us to long way towards our majority commitment to our shareholders but certainly we need to do some share repurchases to get ourselves to that at least 50% commitment and that is built in our expectations to basically this point preventing dilution given our equity program.","We're now anticipating in that guidance that I provided a pick up from any reduction in ways down. So with the remaining free cash flow is going to be situationally dependent. So as Steve talked and I mentioned we have an main strategy we're expected to deploy chunk of that cash we're coming into the year with some good carryover based on deals that we've already executed but we just announced the closing of item beyond that we believe there's opportunity deploy more M&A but we're going to use the same financial discipline we always have and if we have a deal that with our money will create more value for shareholders we're going move forward on that deal and in a given point in time we don't have any excusable deal that meets our expectations then we will buy back shares as we have historically. So this point I don't have a specific plan or the balance of the year beyond our majority commitment and others and that's beyond the cash but we are deploying for the -- acquisition.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut","Hi, good morning guys. Steve, just a question for you as we talk about the payer consolidating market share to the top layers on your competitors call they talk about Blue Cross of Florida is a payer that they're having conversations with so. Is that something that we should start thinking about and if you just could give that goes in detail on that contract in terms of exploration and the set up that you have with them right now. Thanks?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So, Brian, honestly we down pass some record due to specific comment on the specific payer. But what we have said is that were very nice shape. With 19 with our relationships, what we what we will say is that you know going into 19 we should have most of the nationals are in good shape, obviously they are with United where they would got out and the others will it will be a nice shape as well and then also these big states matter of fact, we talked about in their Investor Day, we pick up new strong bigger states United States. If you look at California with New York, Florida and Texas, about 110 million lives are shared very strong and our relationship with the other payer most states are quite strong. So we feel good about that and we're in nice shape in those states. And that is true to go back to your specific question about Florida. We feel good about our cousins in Florida, we have a strong working relationship with Florida Blue Cross Blue Shield and we feel we're in a nice position to deliver on good income share that we talked over all about doing at Quest Diagnostics in the state of Florida because of that relationship, and our great access that we have in Florida.","Mark Guinan","If I could just jump in real quick, I didn't hear the second part of Ann's question, my apologies, we jumped to Brian, so Ann and others, the reason we've chosen [indiscernible] this year is given some of the uncertainty this year, obviously, to make the call on how quickly we grow the volume, we move access, it's not a negative uncertainty, it's just more variability than we've experienced historically in terms of how the volume might come, where it will come from, et cetera. And so the guidance we're providing with the floor obviously is towards the lower end of our revenue guidance and to the extent that we hit the upper end of our revenue guidance, or even potentially surprise ourselves and beat that. Those would be the upside.","So I think we've got our costs down pretty good. Really, the question is around the overall volume growth, the pace at which it comes and the source of which lies because obviously there's variability in the pricing and margin depending on which payer they come through. So that would be the opportunity to do better and hopefully that answers your question on why we chose to [indiscernible].","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my call.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, good morning.","Derik de Bruin","I certainly have seen my out-of-pocket diagnostics costs creep higher now that I'm getting some work done on a regular basis, but I may not have noticed this if I was doing a one-off or annual visit. I guess, how do you drive consumers that shop around for their diagnostic vendor when they're at the hospital and if you're told to go to a hospital lab to get a sample, at what point can you intervene or can they intervene to ask Quest to run the tests since basically, it's like how do you give that consumer the choice to send it to the lower cross provider if the hospitals aren't telling you to go there?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, that's a good question. So we've been on raising awareness for consumers around the wide variation, and medical costs broadly, and related to that is a multi-pronged approach. First of all, in some states, we actually provided this at Investor Day. The states are actually providing visibility of a wide variation for consumers. So the state of Massachusetts, they're actually providing on their Web site and if you go on that Web site you'll see the wide variation of what the average commercial rates for Quest Diagnostics are versus hospital outreach laboratories. And the hope is in that state since consumers are picking up a fair share of the costs in health care that consumers will start to become aware of this and bring that information to their physician.","And the second part of this is physicians are the advocate, typically, for the patient, even though they have this relationship with the hospital systems and in some cases they sold their practice, but still they realize that this is coming out of their patients' pocket, they realized it could be a wide variation which for a number of a patients it's a considerable sum of money. And for those of us that are reasonably healthy might be once a year, but for many it's not once a year. So it's a considerable portion of our out-of-pocket cost.","So we're making sure that the physicians are aware of this as well and then also you know that when you look at what we're doing with the payers the payers increasingly make it visible. And so the payers all reach out to their membership and have campaigns with simple messages like why pay more, and related to that it's not just the lab, you know -- I know many of you realized there's other ancillary services that you have the same issue. So for instance, radiology is getting a lot of visibility. So the help we're getting here as well is this topic in general is getting -- visibility from payers but equally from physicians and then with consumers asking questions. And then once they realize they can ask a question they demand that they [indiscernible] we are in network and therefore it's unacceptable that you tell them they can only go to the hospital lab. And they simply point to -- it's going to cost you extra money if they don't go to Quest, so Doc, why does this make sense? So that's what we're doing about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. You may ask your question.","Matt Larew","Hi, good morning.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Matt Larew","I wanted to ask about your referral partners. You mentioned, Steve, that volumes had traded nicely through first quarter. I just wanted to get a sense for what of that you attributed to potential share gains versus increasing health care utilization at the end market level, thanks?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. First of all, yes, we're here and we're only -- I guess, February 14th, happy Valentine's Day, but what we see in the first five or six weeks of the year as we said we're off to a good start. We haven't been asked about it, but I'll share, you know, we think utilization volumes are stable. We're not seeing big pickups or drops in our good customers. So therefore, we think utilization environment out there is relatively stable. So therefore, the volume is coming from share gains. And that's what we expected. So, good start. We're picking up share, and that's going to build throughout the year.","Shawn Bevec","Operator?","Operator","You're showing no questions in queue.","Shawn Bevec","Okay.

During this call, we may make forward\u2010looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected.

A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on our website.","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning what I would like to do is walk you through the industry dynamics, talk about the impact harsh winter on the quarter and review progress against our five-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and walk you through the guidance. ","So let's start with the industry dynamics and the legislative dynamics in particular. As you know our industry has been facing unprecedented reimbursement challenges from the government from a long history of reimbursement cuts. The new provisions of what's called the Doc Fix Legislation that related to the clinical fee schedule remove a dark cloud that was hanging over our industry. This legislation gives us an outcome that is much preferable to earlier government proposals. What is does is it delays adjustments to the clinical out fees schedule until 2017. It provides for a rule making process to define new rates, based upon a market weighted medium of commercial rates for abroad or in laboratories and importantly it restricts the authority of CMS to make discretionary cuts.","I look forward at working on this with our trade association, particularly in my new role as Chairman. Now there's been questions about the pricing mechanisms in the legislation, and let me provide some clarity to that. ","First, this needs to be top defined through the role making process, but it's designed to be representative of the entire commercial laboratory market. The legislation includes hospitals, out reach laboratories and independent laboratories. The laboratory industry agrees that everyone benefits from including a broad spectrum of providers in the network. ","Now beyond the recent legislation we continue to believe the affordable care act will be net positive for the industry. In the near term we expected it to be neutral to slightly positive for Quest in 2014. The enrolment process was in line with our expectations, that is bumpy roll-out followed by a late surge near the deadline, and we believe that going into the second half will see some impact, but again neutral to slightly positive. ","As we all know this was an unusually harsh winter in many parts of the country. And this had a significant impact on many businesses. During the quarter we estimate that the harsh winter reduced our revenues by 2% and EPS by $0.11. At this winter and more like last year revenues would have been essentially flat to the prior year and EPS would have been favourable to 2013. ","We saw signs of continued stabilization in the underlying trends. Sequential year-over-year trends improved for revenue, volume and revenue per acquisition. ","As we said in January, we want to deliver guidance that is both realistic and achievable. While the slow start to this year clearly is a challenge. We are confident that progress we have made on growth initiatives, particularly as a result of acquisition activities will enable us to meet our commitments. ","Given this environment and actions we are taking, we now expect to show revenue growth beginning in the second quarter. In a few minutes Mark will share color on our 2014 guidance. We have been dealing with dynamic market forces and we are in the process of updating our longer term view. We do expect to share this with you later in the year at our Investor Day Presentation. But in the meantime we continue to be bullish on the longer term growth drivers of this industry.","First, the market will benefit from continued population growth and favourable demographics as baby boomers move into Medicare and live longer. Also advanced esoteric testing will grow as precision medicine drives demand for advanced diagnostic insights. And despite the slow uptake for the affordable care act, more ensured buyers will gradually begin to enter the market each year.","And then finally, medical guideline changes do influence physician behaviour and we expect to see increases in some tests such as hepatitis C, non-invasive prenatal testing, lymph syndrome and lipid testing. Over the long term we see significant opportunity in being a high quality, low cost provider of diagnostic information services which are essential to healthcare delivery.","We remain committed to executing our five-point strategy and what I'd like to do now is to give you an update on progress.","Our top priority for 2014 is to restore growth. We are making solid progress on our growth priorities. On the business development front, we've completed seven acquisitions at the beginning of 2013, including three this year. Prior to our January call we announced the agreement to acquire Solstas. I'm happy to say the integration is now well under way. I've been impressed with the professionalism in the quality of the Solstas team that I had met. Solstas will help us improve top-line performance and strengthen our presence in important region of the country.","We also recently completed the acquisition of Summit Health a few days ago. Summit solidifies our leadership decision in the fast growing wellness business. In this business we partner with employers in health plans to provide an overall health assessment, including biometric screening as well as a comprehensive laboratory analysis.","Summit is complimentary to Quest owned wellness offering whose customers tend to be large employers. Both businesses have been growing organically in the double digits. Summit offers wellness services largely through third parties, including through large health plans and employers. And both Summit and our wellness business also works closely to help retailers and urgent care centres meet their necessity explored new business models.","Our specimen collection is largely based on vein puncture and Summit relies largely on fair sticks. This positions us well in the major Wellness segments including screening, immunization, coaching and disease management. ","At Investor Day on 11\/20\/12, we indicated that we are targeting 1% to 2% of revenue growth through strategically aligned acquisitions. As we have shared Solstas Lab about 5% to revenues on a annualized basis. In addition other acquisitions including Summit and Stewart, we add an additional 1% to 2% to revenues growth in 2014.","Beyond the quarter growth we have been highlighting the opportunity to target with hospital systems in integrated delivery networks. Our investor day on 11\/20\/12 we spoke about the challenges that integrated delivery networks would begin to have as a result of intensified reimbursement pressure and following utilization. ","There are many ways that Quest Diagnostics can help from performing reference testing to various forms of laboratory management partnerships, all the way to including purchasing of hospitals outreach business, such as our recent agreement with Stewart Health System. ","What we're seeing over the past year is increased interest from the C-suite of integrated delivery networks, interested in learning more about our broad experience across the spectrum of service offerings.","During our last call we announced that we have reached agreement with three humidity based hospitals, and we indicated that we would have more to share. I am pleased that during the quarter a lab professional services team reached agreement with a significant regional integrated delivery network. This is a multi-million dollar opportunity evolving several sights. We have taken out hundreds of this client's former employees to operate this lab network and we begin to generate revenues earlier this month. ","These are all exciting opportunities for us. This last win is further evidence that hospital leaders are open to new ideas to help them manage the emerging challenges of reimbursement pressure and lower utilization. We have the experience and expertise to help tailor solutions for the needs to hospitals of all shapes and sizes.","Finally, we are seeing results from our focus on specific disease stay-in conditions. We talked about the strong growth in our Wellness business, combining with Summit Health, will strengthen this business. We have also seen solid growth in our toxicology and prescription drug monitoring offerings, as well as improvements in Hepatitis C, BRC Advantage, and non-invasive prenatal testing.","In Oncology, women's health, we have launched a test to assess the risk of lymph syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with the higher incidence of colon, rectal, and other cancers. While we are making progress, we need to keep our focus on this top priority of restoring growth. We also continue to make progress driving operational excellence. ","Our Invigorate cost reduction in this is expected to approach $700 million in run-rate savings by the end of this year compared to 2011. And we also are committed to our longer term goal of $1 billion in savings beyond 2014. ","As we have said the operational excellence program which we call Drive, is improving our quality and efficiency, it will enable us to improve our overall customer experience. You know driving operational excellence is really all about creating a superior customer experience in towards that end we recently launched what we call Our My Quest, which is by Care360 patient portal that allow patients to take ownership of their own results and manage their conditions more effectively.","A new federal rule that took effect earlier this month, gives patients in all 50 States the right to view their tests directly without first being authorized by a physician. We also made great progress on our simplifying the organizations strategy last year. So in 2014, our intention has been shifted towards building a high performance culture, focusing on our behaviours and delivering results. ","We also made some important organizational changes. First, I'm pleased that Lidia Fonseca, an industry veteran has joined Quest as our new Chief Information Officer. I worked with Lidia years ago at Philips in Marlborough. Lidia is now fully engaged in this part of our plant to strengthen our IT capabilities, which includes improving the customer experience and driving efficiencies that will help us reach our $1 billion goal.","Also as previously announced John Hayden, formally our Senior Vice President of Operations has moved into a key role to oversee our equity joint ventures. He has succeeded in the operation role by Jim Davis, who has deep operational experience and had led our Employer Insurance and Products businesses.","Finally we continue to review our portfolio for opportunities to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services and enable us to continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We remain committed to our plan to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. ","The harsh winter made a particularly tough quarter. But we are seeing signs of continued stabilization in the business and closed this quarter strong in March. We are making progress and recognize that there is much more to be done. ","Now I would like to turn it over to Mark for a detailed analysis of numbers, Mark.","Mark Guinan","","Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.75 billion were 2.3% below the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues which account for over 90% of total revenues were 2.1% below the prior year. Volume was 0.07% favourable to the prior year. Recent acquisitions added approximately 3.5% to volumes. The seasonably harsh winter depressed volumes by approximately 2% compared to the prior year. ","You've heard us talk about the impact of weather on our business in the past. Given the severity of this past winter let me take a minute to give you some color on how we calculate the impact of weather on our business. Our analysis is based on specific declines in volume versus trend for a specific geographies related to various specific weather events.","Adjusting for acquisitions in weather, we are estimating our organic volumes decline less than 1% compared to Q1, 2013. This year-over-year comparison is essentially in line with our exit run rate from Q4, 2013, and is an improvement in the comparison from the earlier periods of 2013.","Revenue per acquisition in Q1 was down 2.8% compared to the prior year. The recent acquisitions and price erosion each accounted for about 100 basis points of the change. While changes in business mix accounted for the remainder. However we except this metric to improve as we move through the year, as certain items will anniversary, including sequestration and certain commercial rates that were renegotiated during 2013, consistent with what we shared with you in the fall of 2012. We continue to plan our average reimbursement pressure of 1% to 2% through 2015.","Q1 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical cross testing, healthcare IT, and our remaining products businesses were down 4.3% compared to the prior year, with approximately half of that impact related to the devastator of Inter X last year. ","Adjusted operating income at 13.5% of revenues was about 1.7% below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to lower margins associated with reimbursement pressure and limited flexibility in our ability to remove costs in response to short term weather events. Despite these challenges we continued to make progress on our Invigorate Program, which helped offset wage bill inflation and lower margins on our more recent acquisitions. ","As we indicated on our last call, we expect to achieve approximately $200 million in real life savings during 2014, and approach approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014, with a longer term gaol of $1 billion over time. ","Adjusted EPS of $0.84 was $0.05 below the prior year, with an $0.11 headwind resulting from the impact of the unfavourable weather in the quarter. Special items totalling $28 million principally restructuring in integration costs, reduced reported operating income as the percentage of revenues by 1.6%, and reported EPS by $0.13.","Last year's first quarter included $45 million of costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.5%, and reported EPS by $0.17. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 4.3%.","Two issues to keep in mind on our bad debt, first as you think about the year, our bad debt expense is typically the highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with the un-met deductible amounts. Second, from a benefit design perspective, as we shared in our last call, we expected that employers would shift more costs to individuals and we see a continued increase in the prevalence of high deductible plans. Despite this trend we believe we are managing the change in operating environment and continue to see improvement in our collection rates across our various pair categories, as a result of our efforts to drive operational excellence.","DSOs were 49 days, a two day increase from last quarter, principally as a result of the Solstas transaction. That is our results include all of the Solstas accounts receivable balance, but only revenues since the early March close date. ","Cash from operations was $84 million in the quarter, compared to $47 million in the prior year. Cash flow for Q1 is seasonally the weakest of the year and as we explained last year our Q1, 2013, cash flow was reduced to a tax payment that has previously been deferred.","Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter compared to $49 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $32 million of our common shares at an average price of $52.80. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","We also acquired Solstas and recently went to the Capital markets and ran a very successful $600 million bond offering last month at attractive rates, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating and also remain committed to paying down the majority of the debt associated with the Solstas transaction over the next 18 months.","Turning to guidance, our guidance remains unchanged to what we shared last month. We expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows; revenues to increase 2% to 4% compared to a year ago. Earnings per diluted share to be approximately between $3.95 and $4.15. Cash provided by operations to approximately $900 million and capital expenditures to approximately $300 million.","While the first quarter was negatively impacted by the weather, we continue to believe that guidance is realistic and achievable, and will benefit from our recently completed acquisitions and our efforts to restore growth.","Finally I'd like to remind you of some data points to help put our guidance into perspective. Regarding reimbursement keep in mind some items were anniversary this year, including sequestration and certain commercial contracts. On acquisitions, you should dial 6% to 7% revenue growth into your models for the remainder of the year, 5% from Solstas and an additional 1% to 2% from other acquisitions in the year. And we expect acquisitions to benefit EPS gradually through the year as integration plans unfold, both Solstas and Summit will be dilutive to second quarter earnings but accretive for the full year.","As a result of these items, we now expect second quarter EPS to approximate the prior year level and to show growth in adjusted EPS in the back half of the year. ","Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen Rusckowski"," ","Thanks Mark, and to summarize the harsh winter hurt us in the quarter, but we are seeing positive signs in underlying trends. Fortunately Congress lifted a cloud from our industry with a recent legislation that effects the clinical out fee schedule, and our top priority for 2014 is restoring growth. ","We are pleased with progress we are making on our growth priorities and particularly the recent acquisitions. As we said in January, we believe our 2014 guidance is both realistic and achievable. Now we would be happy to take your questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","","Thanks and good morning. I just want to follow-up on the pricing question. Mark, if I heard you correctly, I think you sort of talked about the revenue pre-requisition being down 2.8%. You kind of laid out the different components being acquisition, price erosion, and business mix. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on the price erosion and business mix, you know components of that erosion because I think if I heard you correctly your assuming that pricing will be down 1% to 2% this year and next year. So given that you\u2019re down almost 3% in 1Q, should we assume that you\u2019re going to start an anniversary in some of these acquisitions and ultimately in some of these contract renewals and so we should see pricing start to improve sequentially throughout the year. Is that the right way to think about it?","Mark Guinan","Yeah I appreciate the question Glen. So first off the 1% to 2% guidance is really a three year from 2013 to 2015. So what we're, what I was trying to emphasise is that we're not deviating from what we had communicated. You know starting with our investor day in 2012 and I think pretty consistently, each time we have a chance to address it. So the, when you look at the 2.8% that I referenced, the revenue per rack, this quarter about 100 basis points was true price, and that's what we are referring to when we talk about the 1% to 2 percentage. True price independent from business mix and business mix obviously comes in two forms. One is, should we do acquisitions, for instance we've talked about the toxicology acquisition, we did mid last year. That can have a different structure and had lower revenue per rack, obviously also lower cost per rack as well, and therefore it has a negative mix impact on us. ","The other one is the mix within our core organic business as we go forward and things can shift you know quarter-to-quarter depending on tax mix and so on and so forth. So the trend throughout the year, what I'm really talking about is the comparisons year-over-year will improve. Not necessarily you know forecasting and improvement in overall rent per rack, although we have talked about the fact that we have seen a positive trend in a number of tests per acquisition and that's certainly something that we would expect to continue.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Okay, I appreciate that. Steve maybe if you can just follow-up on the molecular diagnostics piece of the business. You know your primary competitor obviously has called out you know some big challenges getting paid in that area in 2013. Maybe we start and see a little bit of reprieve on that in 2014. Could you maybe comment in terms of what your collection experiences have been related to the molecular diagnostics and ultimately do you think this could be an opportunity as some of the payers start to maybe ease up a little bit on some of the restrictions here and can just be a tailwinds. For U.S. we think about the balance in 2014 relative to 2013.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Yeah. Thanks. Glad it. Let me just underscore something that Mark just went through. We feel that we have good visibility on pricing and there has been a lot of interest at pricing in the past and as we said our guidance for the next three years is 1% to 2%. We shared at 2013 it was going be about 3%, we ended at about 3% and we actually showed in the first quarter that were making movement down. We actually believe that we\u2019re executing well against our pricing discipline approach in the market place and the 1% real price effect in the first quarter, I think, underscores that strategy. So, Dan answered your on molecular diagnostics. Actually, we continue to work with payers and what I\u2019d share is even though we had been in constructive dialogue, I would not say that it\u2019s material change than what we\u2019re getting paid for by payers. So, this is a continued process we continue to work at. We\u2019re hopeful we\u2019re having a good dialogue and good discussion, but I can\u2019t say in the first quarter there was material change of what we were paid for versus prior quarters.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","","Okay, thanks for the comments.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Thanks brother.","Operator","Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","","Ah yeah, good morning.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Just a couple of questions here. Obviously, we\u2019re hearing a lot of commentary around hep C. I just want to get your perspective. Are you seeing any upside to your hep c testing business as a result of sociability [ph] you expected to be a meaningful contributor for the remainder of the year?","Mark Guinan","Yes. Thanks for the question, Ricky. We did actually mention in Steve\u2019s prepared remarks at just one of the areas that we had seen growth in. So, yes absolutely we\u2019d seen growth and we expected to contribute to our overall business success for after remainder of the year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And can you quantify for us?","Mark Guinan","","Yes.","Stephen Rusckowski","Now I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s tough to quantify. I think as you\u2019re commenting has a lot of visibility right now with the new drug therapies in the market place and now there is effective treatment for hepatitis C. There is lot more visibility to it and so therefore we should see some tailwinds in the testing we performed, but we can\u2019t quantify for you at this time.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then on your ACA comments, obviously, it\u2019s early on and we get most of the uptick in lives towards the - actually we\u2019re getting in first quarter. But any early insights on ACA-related volumes? How are patients on exchanges utilizing that services versus kind of like your non-NCA population?","Stephen Rusckowski","Well. The best way that will I answer at this point were so digestive what we\u2019ll see. We are at commences that for this year on the neutral-to-slightly positive for us in our numbers. We [indiscernible] of this industry or trying to understand the true impact of the exchange. We still believe there was increase at Medicaid volumes and we\u2019re also trying to digest it and have it on the employer\u2019s side. The [indiscernible] breaking is as you know we do have a larger percentage of our business with highly top [ph] peoples. We are relieving a fair percentage of the new lives. We will have higher deductibles and as interest they are aiming for our business both in [indiscernible] but actually these people will have to pay our pocket. It\u2019s exactly [ph] what it does to pressure our bad debts. So, we\u2019re digesting it all. We don\u2019t have better fill for it yet, but again we believe it will be neutral to slightly positive in 2014. Mark, will you care to join?","","Mark Guinan","","Yeah. There is someone come out at us. One of the very positive aspects amongst many of the Affordable Care Act is that there is a number of diagnostic and preventative treatments that are not actually subject to many patients responsibility. It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s broadly understood. So, until that\u2019s broadly understood certainly the passion would be so much needed to taking advantage of past not having to work after deductible and these higher deductible plans. So, I think it\u2019s very early. I think it\u2019s the answer. And we\u2019ll be interested, we\u2019ll be monitoring it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be asking us about regularly but it\u2019s just too early to make a call at this point.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Let me just assemble [ph] on last comment on you for Affordable Care Act again. We believe Affordable Care Act continues to be net positive. This is free and net positive for us. We have said in the past, we\u2019ll continue to say that more people are determined to continue with what we do and that\u2019s the trust.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","","And that\u2019s \u2013 those are included in your 1% to 2% assumptions for pricing trends going forward? Yeah.","Stephen Rusckowski","","We have to do this.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning.","Stephen Rusckowski","Good morning.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc","So obviously, a few weeks ago everyone knows the push-outs you mentioned of the clinical lab fee schedule reimbursement changes. In terms of your negotiations there I guess you obviously think that the clinical lab has been a bit of the crosshair as seen with us for a while now. This is clearly a sign of positive for you guys. What you think was a key tipping point in convincing CMS to delay some of these costs particularly? And also what you did mention much also was the downside limits on those cuts of 15% released [rail guards] up to 17%.","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah, Michael. I have described it this way is if we did a good job actually as an industry as you know active with the Miracle Clinical Episode Association so are number of people in this industry. We expect a fair amount of time walking the halls of Congress getting Congress involved and what this industry has paid in the past and what is at risk if it in fact we didn\u2019t have any what we\u2019ll describe as guard rails on the process going forward. Fortunately, we got them to listen. We were fortunately there also thinking about how they would do this year\u2019s doc fix. We took advantage of that opportunity, and fortunately with the build-up was passed it allowed us some time now to get it to a good dialogue about the rule-making process and also that will allow us to have a comprehensive market view by code that will eventually set the prices that will take effect in 2017. So, we\u2019re encouraged by that. We have worked on furloughs [ph] to make sure the rules are done correctly and eventually when we do the market analysis and again when I set up my remarks it\u2019s a full market view including all segments of the market place and we feel good about that. We think it serves all segments well to be participants in that survey, and when we go through the data in 2015 and 2016 we\u2019ll eventually have new prices in 2017. We did have caps at the per code level. You know they are at 10%, but until you get the market data you\u2019re not sure really what the effect would be per code, but that\u2019s 2017. So, we feel good about the process, we feel good that we\u2019ve some time to digest it and create some stability with us but this is unknown in the market price and as I said from my earlier remarks it actually lifts the cloud that was over this industry that worked in the past. So, we feel good about what\u2019s happened.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc","","Great. Thanks. And just quickly relative to maintaining the 1% to 2% compounded reimbursement cuts to 2015. Are there any other really unknown there are swing factors one way or the other that could impact on \u201915 and the year currently debating to you positive or negative?","Stephen Rusckowski","","Yeah. Mark would you like to add that one?","Mark Guinan","Yeah. I think the add to that is no. I don\u2019t think there is any other wildcards, at this point certainly not in the radar. So, I think as you mentioned in the past we\u2019ve got a good handle on the cycle of commercial renegotiations. I think we got a pretty track good of be able to kind of guard rail those as Steve mentioned and we called the 3% going into 2013 that includes negotiation but had yet to be completed. At that point, we at that pretty much nail right on the head and we talked about obviously our setting those lower rates in 2014 and 2015 and certainly as we shared this quarter it seems like we\u2019re delivering on that. So, at this point, we feel very confident in those guard rails of 1% to 2% that we mentioned over that period of time.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Rusckowski","Hey good morning, Darren.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I just keen to one of your comments, Steve, just around what you said you\u2019re in the process of updating your longer term view. Can you just remind us what is your current long-term view of the market? I recalled at the initial Investor Day that you had hosted you thought it was around 4% market growth and maybe just give us a sense for how you\u2019re thinking any differently about the longer term view.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Sure, well enough you to reiterate what we said in 2012 and I guess we have to update it. So, it\u2019s all decimals, but we\u2019ll tell you what we said. We said that we believe that market place was a good market and that\u2019s this market will be growing at about 4%. Now in that market assumption, we assumed the Affordable Care Act would be taking full force in 2014 and as you know that hasn\u2019t happened, so that was a big assumption in that. Clearly, this has been pushed out. It could be more of a gradual build and we\u2019ll eventually come back to you with our current assessment of the market. This fall we\u2019ll evaluate what our current forecast is as far as the Affordable Care Act. On the Investor Day I said my comments were really arranged [ph]. The population is growing, we\u2019re all living longer and we [indiscernible] will be into the med care system. Also, advanced diagnostics are critical to persist with medicine. These all have very positive effects on other Diagnostic Information Services that are needed in the market place. So, we\u2019ll update this when we have our Investor Day in the fall. Some of the assumptions that we had at 2012 really have changed, but we still are optimistic and bullish of the process with this industry.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That\u2019s all for DGX [ph]. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re suggesting here that the ACA benefits may just come in more gradually and that seems like a key assumption that\u2019s changed and this would be cherished. Are there any other things that maybe changing for the better in your view because we\u2019ve heard a lot from you just about the activity in the hospital domain? And I\u2019m just wondering if you think you gain more traction there such that you have a different view the other way in that part of the market?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah. We\u2019ll see as it\u2019s in our comments. We\u2019re encouraged by the traction we are getting with our dialogues in hospitals. We\u2019ve announced the relationships over the first quarter too a bit about those, and in their [indiscernible] range of difficult relationships that we formed but still got the boasted integrated delivery system. We feel good that they have decided to continue to work with us and for other in our relationship. We also announced the small hospital punitive [ph] hospital in North-western Connecticut this week in [indiscernible] again is a community in North-western Connecticut, but [indiscernible] hospital all these happened [indiscernible] the same thing and their cost structure there is [indiscernible] about that. We also announced with [indiscernible] is that there is [indiscernible] integrated delivery system that has multiple [indiscernible] and all the multimillion dollars as the volume for us and we\u2019re encouraged about that. We started to see some of this. Then we shared this with you because the [indiscernible] is to build our discussion continued to build around and we think about that, but we\u2019re not so optimistic that at this point we\u2019re going to change our guidance because there are so building and you need to bring [indiscernible] will progress. We feel bit of our guidance for this year.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. That helps for me. Just one follow-up really with regard to your Q2 commentary, I guess be implied on flat year-over-year guidance for Q2 is roughly 6% to 7% below consensus on ETS line. Are you saying that most of that is the diluted nature from the DOs? Can you just suppose think about prior year you\u2019re giving us this Q2 flavor at this point?","Stephen Rusckowski","","Yeah, I do appreciate the question. First up, generally, we don\u2019t really address consensus but what I can tell us you is that if we look at the year obviously we\u2019re guiding to something that\u2019s just little bit better than flat year-over-year. So, really the question is how the cord is to get lay down. In the first quarter your nickel [ph] behind and you mentioned that you do have a little bit of delusion in the second quarter from soft business of it, which really implies that we\u2019re going to pay cut nickel or so in order to grow [indiscernible] in the back half of the year as these acquisitions really become creative through the integration synergies that were driving and take a little time to accomplish. So, yeah I\u2019m not quite timed to your 6% to 7% below consensus, some of the priority was about 6% and while we\u2019re not speaking precisely, giving you precise number in Q2 which does try to simulate generally flat, a little bit of growth on the underlying business offset with a bit of delusion on the two recent acquisitions.","","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. That\u2019s all folks. Thanks very much.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Um hmm.","Operator","Next question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig Hallum.","Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum","Hi guys. I also just wanted to say hi to Lydia. I worked with Lydia too and I think that\u2019s a great hire.","Stephen Rusckowski","Great.","Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum","","I wanted to ask a couple of questions too about the hospital deals because it seems to me like those are really starting to take off. That\u2019s the first thing and you probably talked about this before. But can you just remind us sort of what your targeting in terms of return on capital with these deals? How we should think about what the metrics that they really need to achieve for you to want to get involved with \u2013 I assumed margin is probably less of a concern than return but maybe just elaborate and then we\u2019ll have a follow-up.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Yeah. I\u2019m characterizing that every hospital has its own lab strategy. They were approaching peacefully just working in and were having a discussion about the lab strategy and just like so much it helped to see one strategy seem one strategy same for the lab. And what we try to give you is portfolio of all the different opportunities, which we find exciting. People are engaged dialogue with us. It all starts. We have a strong hospital business as you know. We do reference testing for hospitals and people don\u2019t really like relationship and some of these deals will take the form of laboratory management and the deal we talked about that\u2019s a multi-side deal has a portion of that laboratory management. We also have forms of joint ventures in the past. We have a number of successful joint ventures with integrated delivery systems. And finally, in some cases hospitals want to get out of the outreach business and already between [indiscernible] and the [indiscernible] stores selling the remainder of the household outreach that today of course some hospitals coming their way. It is an encouraging time that many systems are now thinking or rethinking what they should do in the labs base in the setting that\u2019s best for them to focus on what they do well and rely on earlier [indiscernible] we do well for them. So, we think that\u2019s encouraging. This supports what [indiscernible] We believe those two large role drivers of value are growth and return on invested capital, and we think that this business or lab professional services business will allow us to restore growth and at the same time be accredited to our return on invested capital targets as before. And I will turn to Mark to add some color to that as well.","Mark Guinan","Yes, Steve mentioned. Bill, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re smart, at least deals come in different shapes and forms. So, we buy a business from average business like they were still like [indiscernible] there\u2019s some of the greater invested capital but you also will get higher margins because you owned the business. Whereas in some of the other deals we\u2019re really just partnering. Obviously, we don\u2019t have as much investments and the margins, therefore, are acceptably lower to still get an attractive return on invested capital. So, we\u2019re really focused on growing our return on invested capital. Certainly, we try to do as well as we can in the margin in every given deal, which suggests that the structure of the partnership deals are going to be lower margin with lower invested capital than the acquisitions. I also want to make sure we\u2019re clear because you mentioned that some of the acquisitions are lower margin that\u2019s really the initial margin, so until we drive those synergies. But as we mentioned and I think I specifically addressed on the January call once we get Solstas, for instance, up and running we expect those margins be comparable to our base overall business.","Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum","That\u2019s helpful. And do you have an actual return hurdle than an acquisition have to gather a deal have they hit that you can share?","Mark Guinan","","Yeah. No that we can share. Well, we have, as I said, we\u2019re really targeting to grow our return on invested capital. So on the acquisitions we do mention that we wanted to be a creative on our RIC basis by the third year but have not shared specific overall RIC targets or hurdle rates. I mean as you know, Bill, there is some subjectivity on this because everything has different levels of risk. So, we certainly would not accept anything below or cost of capital and we turn on getting to grow our RIC, which suggests they all have to be above our current level of our RIC but we haven\u2019t shared special hurdle rates.","Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum","Okay. Great. And then just one final question, I guess, for both of you. There seems to be an ever-growing mass of clear wave especially labs and for the most part you haven\u2019t done a lot in that area, you\u2019ve done a couple, I guess, in the past. But can you just kind of tell us your view on that? Can those be attractive opportunities? Those seem to be growing really fast, but I know that there can be other concerns maybe about integrating them with the business like yours, but I just be curious if you think that\u2019s an opportunity for growth or not.","Stephen Rusckowski","That\u2019s so. First of all, one of our points of our five-point strategy is to build or deliver disciplined capital deployment and as part of that we have a goal to go over 1% to 2% through acquisition. And what we said is we want to use our money wisely. We\u2019re going to look for strategically aligned accredited acquisitions, and as you get from our comments this morning we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making, we are on the high end of that range. We provided it in our five-point strategy. We\u2019re tracking well against it. So, Bill in terms of speciality labs we will consider speciality labs that are strategically aligned and they need to be creative. Every deal is a deal by itself and we need to look at it based upon how we can make money for our shareholders, but we\u2019ll consider it but in the end that\u2019s be aligned. We also would consider make [indiscernible] considerations whether we could do it ourselves and whether it\u2019s wise for us to invest on buyings so that we can do it ourselves, but at the end we need to deliver on our goals of making money for our shareholders and we\u2019ll continue to put up through that filter.","Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum","Okay. Thanks.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Thanks Bill.","Operator","","Next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Good morning, Amanda","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","","Hi guys. So, I just had a follow-up on some of the questions around volumes. I know there is a lot going on in the numbers that I\u2019m curious. What you guys are seeing in terms of underlying dynamics relative to HAS [ph] plans just in excluding reforming [indiscernible] not. Are you seeing that impact Q1 volumes or benefit Q4 volumes at this point?","","Stephen Rusckowski","","Yeah, I think looking at that level of granularity it\u2019s a little bit tough and especially looking at the first quarter, Amanda, with the amount of weather we saw it\u2019s tough to read too much in some of these trends at the moment.","","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Got it. And I\u2019m just curious about the pathology side of the business. Are you seeing, I guess two questions there, one, any attempt to sort of insourcing dynamics that\u2019s given all the reimbursement issues in this phase? And then secondly is that an area that you think maybe - or I guess are you seeing more assets in that area, come to market, is that something that you would consider being more active in terms of M&A?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah. Let me give you some color on pathology. Clearly with the ADA [ph] three or five cuts last year, there\u2019s more pressure on everyone to make money in pathology services and also on the tech side. You would have expected given the pressure that there will be increased interest in outsourcing if you will. What we shared before then really haven\u2019t changed. We haven\u2019t seen enough material change on people\u2019s perspective on this, but we do have discussions with hospital systems, we go department if you will by department talking about what their strategy is in pathologies consideration, but no notable change at this point.","","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Got it. Thank you very much.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Thank you.","Operator","","Next question comes from David Clair with Piper Jaffary.","David Clair - Piper Jaffary","Hi good morning, everybody.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Good morning.","David Clair - Piper Jaffary","First question from me. I was just hoping we could get an update on BRCAvantage and your NITT businesses. How are they performing compared to your original expectations and any color on reimbursement?","Stephen Rusckowski","","Yeah, sure. Let me take that. BRCAvantage as you know we entered the market place in the fall. We did this very, very quickly after the Supreme Court decision in June, we feel good about that. We\u2019re gaining traction in the market place. As you introduced product you first have to introduce it to your customers. There is a variety of segments in this market place from the surgery to radiology to women\u2019s health specialist, and we\u2019re doing that as we speak. We\u2019re actually tracking to our internal plan, which obviously would have a ramp build into it and we feel good that we\u2019re making the progress we would expect. But also non-evasive prenatal testing is a growth market for us, we\u2019re focused on that as well. We feel that with the progress we\u2019re making there we think it\u2019s a fast growth market place. It is a great example where medical guidelines are actually stimulating demand for us and we\u2019re taking advantage of those new guidelines of the market place. So, in summary they\u2019re both tracking, they\u2019re both opportunities for growth for us and we\u2019re looking about their prospects. And Dan, any colour you can give us on reimbursement for using one of those? Mark, would you want to add anything to that?","Mark Guinan","Yeah. We have successfully negotiated reimbursement rates with the typical health plans that we contract with. We feel good about the prices again similar to what Steve said on expectation as not just volume but the reimbursement rates that we thought we could achieve. We\u2019re feeling good about those. So, the reimbursement environment is reasonable certainly like any other task that starts to get lot more attention - the payers start to put some things in place like pre-authorizations, etc. that can slow down the process, make things a little cumbersome and you\u2019re going to work through some of those issues initially to smooth up the process but no major hurdles on reimbursement in those two categories right now.","David Clair - Piper Jaffary","","Okay. Thank you. And then as you look at the portfolio right now, are there any businesses that you\u2019re kind of looking at potentially the best thing or what\u2019s your thoughts there? I know you\u2019ve pointed out in the past that the [indiscernible] products business is something that could potentially be divested.","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah. So again go back to our five-point strategy what we have worked on in the course of 2013 as we\u2019re focusing on Diagnostic Information Services. Back in 2014 we actually sold four assets too small too larger. We continue to evaluate some other portions of our portfolio. When we had our Investor Day on 2012 we did talk about looking at our strategic options for [indiscernible] products, we\u2019re currently still evaluating that. And we\u2019ve got a few others that will evaluate but we\u2019ll keep you informed as necessary. We continue to stay focus on our core business, which is Diagnostic Information Services and there is a few things we might consider changing in our portfolio but we made excellent progress making sure that we\u2019re focused on bringing more Diagnostic Information Services companies into our portfolio with our acquisitions.","David Clair - Piper Jaffary","Okay. And then just one quick one on guidance. I\u2019m assuming the update that you gave at mid March did not include Stewart or the IDN that you\u2019re talking about right now. So, should we assume that these deals just get you more comfortable with guidance or should we assume that there is potential upside here?","Stephen Rusckowski","Yeah. Within the guidance we earmarked with the 1% to 2% for strategically aligned acquisitions. So, while we may not know exactly which acquisitions there might be, we typically have a pipeline. So, the Solstas\u2019 acquisition kind of stands outside that given its size, you should really look at some [indiscernible] and the other two as kind of being within the envelope of that 1% to 2%. So, they weren\u2019t explicitly in the guidance. I think you should assume they were in place of [indiscernible] guidance.","David Clair - Piper Jaffary","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group.","Stephen Rusckowski","Hi Brian.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group","Hi good morning.","Stephen Rusckowski","","Good morning.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group","How large is your clinical trial business? And despite the recent slowdown are you seeing any impact to that business from the recently high level of biotech financings?","Stephen Rusckowski","Mark, go and check that.","Mark Guinan","","Yeah. We have not shared the specific size. It\u2019s one of the smaller businesses within our Diagnostic Solutions. But certainly the slowdown in R&D span has had some impact on the overall market within the clinical trials laboratory area and has made growth a little more challenging. But we also feel good about our service offering and some of the relationships that we have, which really enable us to maintain work with some of our - as preferred provider for a couple of the drug development company. So, it\u2019s been tough headwinds but not anything of major significance in terms of the slowdown and we feel good about that business both today and about its future prospects.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group","Alright. Thanks. And was the doc fix legislation a fact during your acquisition of the remainder of the Stewart Outreach business and more broadly how does it impact the M&A environment?","Stephen Rusckowski","We\u2019ll say that the doc fix legislation had no bearing on your view on our acquisitions that we\u2019ve done in the past and also this year. And as far as the environment going forward it provides the lift, if you will, the cloud that was over the industry where we\u2019re happy about that and it provides us some time now to work on the rule making we feel good about that. So, what it did do the doc fix is it will at least provide us with more clarity around pricing and in 2015 and 2016 some reasonable confidence around the clinical lab fee schedule pricing that we should be considering while we\u2019re looking at acquisitions. So, it\u2019s a part of the conversation, but I can\u2019t say it had an overwhelming consideration for what we do with Stewart.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group","Does the legislation also make scale much more important in the industry?","Stephen Rusckowski","","Well, I think there is a lot of dynamics in general around scale in this industry. It\u2019s true for the broader health care industry. Frankly, what you see us driving is a continuation of what we believe is necessary health care and more and more consolidation. What we did with Solstas, what we did with the other acquisitions are consolidating this industry. We think that\u2019s strategically helpful to us and also we can make money our shareholders and we\u2019re going to get continue to track down that road because we believe it\u2019s the right strategy for Quest Diagnostics and I think it\u2019s consistent with what you see in other parts of health care overall.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Stephen Rusckowski","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for participating in Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2014 conference call.

I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected.

Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations' Quarterly Updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends, and also review progress we are making, executing our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.","Well, we grew revenues, margins, and earnings in the second quarter, and made progress executing our strategy. Revenues grew 1% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 9%, adjusted net income grew more than 8%, and adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.25. This was the second consecutive quarter in which operating income grew faster than revenues. This underscores what we've been doing with executing our five-point strategy. We are not just interested in growth at any cost, we are focused on driving profitable growth. And I'll speak about this more in a minute.","Before we get into our strategy, I would like to spend some time on industry dynamics. After two years of some of the heaviest government reimbursement pressure this industry has faced, we're seeing a moderation of that government reimbursement pressure in 2015, and we don't see any significant headwinds for 2016. Any changes to the clinical lab fee schedule proposed as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, also known as PAMA, would go into effect in 2017. As you know, CMS continues to work on the rule-making process and the data collection that will help determine future reimbursement schedules. We appreciate the work done by CMS, as well as the complexity of this task, and we will continue to collaborate with CMS throughout this progress \u2013 process. So on utilization, we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis during the quarter.","Turning to the Affordable Care Act, we continue to believe it will be net positive for our company and our industry. The Supreme Court removed uncertainty regarding the future of the act in King v. Burwell. As we look at the impact on our business to date, as you know, there are a lot of moving parts and we don't have perfect information, but what we can say is that we are seeing growth in our Medicaid and managed Medicaid volumes in different markets around the country, as well as a decrease in our uninsured patient volumes.","These trends appear to be consistent with our expectations related to the new lives coming into the system. We expect this will improve over time as additional uninsured patients begin to access health care.","With greater certainty related to the Affordable Care Act, payer consolidation has dominated the headlines in recent weeks. Today, Quest serves all major national payers with an unsurpassed national network of laboratories, information services and logistics.","Health care in general and diagnostic testing in particular are characterized by significant disparities in price for similar services. It's not unusual for test performed by a hospital lab to cost two times to five times as much as Quest. We offer tremendous value, providing the highest quality at a competitive price. We are very well positioned to help health plans in our networks achieve the most efficient network design and provide members with outstanding service.","Now, let me shift to the progress we are making on our five-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our core diagnostic information service businesses, and deliver disciplined capital deployment.","Well, starting with growth. This is the third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. It was also the first quarter we recorded revenue per requisition growth in three years. Now, let me talk about a few of the drivers. Our regional sales team are now better aligned with the clinical franchises and the professional lab services team.","We grew revenues in the quarter for several recent clinical franchise solution launches, including BRCA, CardioIQ, Noninvasive Prenatal Screening, and HIV fourth generation testing. We also continue to see growth in prescription drug monitoring. Last quarter, we shared that gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew at the fastest rate in the year. We were pleased to see that the growth rate continued during the second quarter. This focus on esoteric and gene-based testing has continued to be the increase in revenue per requisition.","We continue to grow revenues from new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks by helping them improve healthcare outcomes and reduce cost. Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire MemorialCare Health Systems' laboratory outreach services business. This transaction fits well within our M&A guidelines, and is a smaller tuck-in type acquisition compared to some of the more recent deals we have completed. We expect the transaction to close in August.","Our M&A and business development pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities our team are pursuing. We said before we're enhancing our diagnostic information services to help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. These tools are driving growth and helping us deliver a superior customer experience.","So, for example, for physicians, our Interactive Insights offer provider trending data, interactive features such as customizable reports and additional content, as videos and articles related to specific conditions and diseases. We have piloted these solutions with approximately 70 physician providers and are encouraged by the feedback.","Now, for hospitals, more than 100 customers are now using our IntelliTest Analytics solution. This easy to use tool provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks, physician practices, with timely access to utilization insights to assist with laboratory test optimization decisions and driving cost controls.","And for health plans, we've expanded pilots with health plans for our Quest Analytics platform. This self-service informatics tool enables health plan customers to query our massive database to help manage populations of patients, encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring tests to drive better health and follow guidelines.","We've received very positive feedback. So we continue to build on our data analytics tools and we will update you on our progress.","And then, finally, consumerism is an emerging trend in healthcare, and we offer a number of compelling services in this exciting space. We began to offer our Blueprint for Wellness health-risk assessment directly to consumers in 2010. Now, we're getting ready to offer Blueprint for Athletes, to help athletes and their coaches and trainers, as well as weekend warriors, gain valuable insights into the training recovery regiments, peak performance conditions and optimal dietary consumption.","We also recently announced an agreement with HealthTap, a digital healthcare provider. HealthTap's virtual network of physicians can offer easy ordering of tests for patients from Quest Diagnostics. Doctors can see test results on HealthTap's platform, and patients can access their own results using our patient portal, the MyQuest application.","More than 1.8 million patients have now downloaded our MyQuest application. A growing portion of those consumers are paying us a premium to gaining access to the historical lab results and maintain access to the longitudinal test results. And last result \u2013 last week, we began to offer direct access testing to consumers in Arizona, where a new law just took effect, enabling people to order tests without a physician's script. We're operating this through our joint venture partner, Sonora Quest Laboratories, which builds on the strengths of our partner, Banner Health, the leading healthcare provider in Arizona. Initial interest in this service is very strong.","As the responsibility for managing and paying for healthcare shifts rapidly to consumers, we are well positioned to be the consumer-friendly diagnostic testing provider.","The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. Our Drive program is focusing on delivering a superior customer experience, as well as allowing us to become more efficient. We perform more than 3,000 different diagnostic tests in our large network of laboratories, many of which came to us through acquisitions with different laboratory information systems and billing systems. We're always looking for ways to improve the service we deliver, whether it's providing more than 90% of our results to doctors by 8:00 in the next morning or making more than 5 million phone calls a year to notify physicians of critical results they can act on. Our investor day last fall, we said we would be standardizing systems and processes. Since then, the portion of our legacy systems that are standardized has increased from 70% to 75%. Our latest system conversion occurred without any disruptions to clients, which is very encouraging.","We also drive and track a number of medical quality and service metrics related to a superior customer experience. Many of our service elements, such as availability of our Care360 Physician Portal, and our specimen tracking performance are already at Six Sigma levels. In addition, we have saw improvement in several key areas, including wait times at patient service centers, installation of EMR interfaces to onboard new clients. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, this quarter's strong operating income performance demonstrates the value we're creating from our improved efficiency.","The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We have been focusing on execution and building a performance-oriented culture. Our Quest Management System is the way we run the company by using a set of standard tools and processes. Additionally, we have been training our leaders and recently launched the leading Quest Academy to provide a rigorous form for putting our Quest Management Systems tools to the test. Academy graduates are now hard at work on teams focused on addressing opportunities and challenges facing our business.","The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We've made substantial progress in the last 90 days. As you know, we launched our newest joint venture, Q2 Solutions with Quintiles, in a capital efficient way that provides us with a path to generating better growth and profitability from that business than if we had operated it as a standalone entity.","We have a great partner and are excited about the opportunities for that venture. Quintiles will share more on the joint venture, including expectations related to financial performance, in their upcoming earnings call. We're excited to be working with Quintiles exclusively for a period of time to combine our respective data set to help biopharma customers improve their drug discovery and development process.","Lastly, we continue to review our portfolio, looking at options for non-core assets that can build value for shareholders.","The fifth element of our strategy is delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest expense for years to come. We also deployed our cash to reinvest in the business and continue to make progress on our commitment to shareholders by returning approximately $250 million year-to-date through a combination of share buybacks and dividends.","Now, Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points. Revenues for diagnostic information services or DIS for short improved by 0.4%, compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, declined by 0.4%, versus the prior year.","However, revenue per acquisition was 0.9% better than the prior year and, as Steve mentioned, it was first increase in three years. While reimbursement pressure continued to be moderate at just under 1%, we were more than able to offset that pressure through favorable test and business mix shifts. The favorable test mix shift reflects the strong growth in our gene based and esoteric testing.","Moving to diagnostic solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and the remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. Our diagnostic solutions revenues will be lower on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 as a result of the contribution of our clinical trials business to the joint venture with Quintiles.","To provide you with a representative view of the operational performance of the business, we will communicate our reported 2015 revenue against 2014 revenue on an equivalent basis. Revenue for 2014 on an equivalent basis excludes clinical trials revenues reported in the third and the fourth quarters of 2014. The 2014 revenue excluded is $41 million and $46 million in the third and the fourth quarter, respectively.","Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $321 million, or 16.7% of revenues, compared to $296 million or 15.5% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 120 basis points can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our tests and business mix, Invigorate program and continued integration synergies from our 2014 acquisitions.","Lower amortization in the quarter versus a year ago negatively impacted the comparison of cash EPS to the prior year by $0.03. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew 5%, to $1.25. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $52 million in the quarter, $41 million of which is associated with our recent debt refinancing.","The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions, and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.36. Last year's second quarter included $24 million of after tax costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.16. As a reminder, we also expect to book a gain related to the valuation of the joint venture with Quintiles. We will adjust this one-time gain out of our earnings.","Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.1%. 20 basis points better than last quarter, but up 20 basis points compared to a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, one day lower than last quarter and three days lower than a year ago.","Consistent with the first quarter, we are adjusting our operating cash for the first half of the year to exclude cash charges for the debt refinancing. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $324 million in the second quarter of 2015. Reported cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2015 was $275 million and was negatively impacted by cash charges of $49 million associated with the early retirement of debt, in connection with the company's debt refinancing.","In the second quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $280 million. Typically, cash flow is stronger in the second half. However, this year, we have an extra payroll cycle and a tax payment associated with the previously disposed business that, together, account for about $100 million. Despite these headwinds in the back half, we now expect adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million for the year. Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter, compared to $49 million a year ago.","Moving to guidance, we expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows. Revenues are now expected to be between $7.49 million and $7.57 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% versus 2014 on an equivalent basis. Adjusted diluted EPS is unchanged, to be between $4.70 and $4.85. Adjusted cash provided by operations is expected to exceed $850 million, and capital expenditures are also unchanged to approximately $300 million.","Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we delivered solid bottom line growth in the second quarter. It was our third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth. We continue to make good progress executing our strategy. We thank you for your time today, and we'll be happy to take any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, thanks and good morning. Steve, just wanted to talk to you about volumes in the quarter. They were probably a little bit slower than what we would have estimated. I'm just kind of curious to get your perspective. If you think there's -- are you seeing any type of slowdown in the market or maybe is it more difficult comps from the ACA comparisons from last year or does it perhaps maybe reflect some business that maybe you've walked away from that you deemed to be less profitable? Any sort of color on underlying market trends would be helpful.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Let me start and then I'm going to pass it to Mark. Well, first of all, what I said in the opening remarks is we do this analysis where we look at our stable accounts, and we call it a same provider, same store analysis, and year-on-year what we said they were consistent with the prior years. So on an existing basis, we feel utilization is stable versus the prior year. So that's point number one.","Point number two, as I said in our introductory remarks, we continue to steer our resources, our energy around the higher profit portion of the marketplace, whether that's with better solutions and we've gotten some growth. As a matter of fact, you see our growth in our higher end portion of our portfolio growing faster than our top-line growth. So that focus is paying off. And then it's also paying off in better revenue per requisition and, obviously, our growth and operating income. Some portion of that is related to growing the revenue in the right way to get profitable growth.","And then I'll turn it to Mark because, as you know, in the past we've talked about some business that we have reconsidered over the last few quarters. We still had that in Q2. We'll start to lap that in the second half, but I'll let Mark provide some insight into that. Mark?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, thanks, Steve. Glen, you're correct that I think some of that certainly is driven by some of the business that we've talked about for a while and that we thought was lower value add, and I think the fact that we were able to grow revenue and earnings validates that walking away from some of that volume, it was probably a good decision. And that does anniversary certainly through the second quarter, so we've talked about also the back half having easier comps than the front half.","The other perspective I just want to provide is we talked about the weakness of using requisitions for volume. Certainly, we're responsible for that. That's what we provide, but there certainly are some watch-outs there, so the real important thing is obviously the tests. And I can tell you that test volumes actually grew despite the fact that requisition volumes declined in the quarter.","So we feel good about the volumes. That's what we're trying to drive through our clinical franchise strategy is to actually drive a better outcome for patients, which in many cases means actually filling in more richer req than what it's been maybe in the past and some of the business we walked away were lower value, fewer test requisitions. So again, we just wanted to give you additional perspective. Actually, test volume did grow in the quarter.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Glen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from A. J. Rice of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everybody. Just thought I might ask, Steve, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about what's happening in Arizona with the direct access to tests, the legislation and I'm curious. I'm not sure I've heard you guys opine on that. What's your view about that? Is that something that you would promote in other states? And then more broadly, because Theranos has been in the news and I know they were also part of seeing that legislation pass, any update in your thinking about them or whether you're seeing anything from them competitively?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, thanks for the question. First of all, we continue to look at the best way to engage with the healthcare marketplace by state. Arizona was notable because of the new law, and we're actively participating in that. I think some portion of all markets will access the healthcare system this way, not all, and it will be a growing trend with, as I said, the trend around the consumer and that's become an increasingly important part of our business.","We also have been offering, A. J., access to our Blueprint for Wellness online. That's accessible beyond Arizona. And, as I said, we're expanding that with the Blueprint for Athletes offering. So as far as we're concerned, we're going to continue to evaluate where we get more aggressive in certain starts, where it makes sense, where we can still do it. As you know, all states are not created equal here. Arizona was very strong in this regard. We are trying to see how Arizona goes. As I said, we're actually encouraged by the initial results from what we see in Arizona and we do believe this is a trend we're on top of, and we're very well positioned.","You asked a question about Theranos, they continue to be a regional lab that is getting additional labs, as you know. Probably, it's important for me to mention that part of the attention they've received is around Capital Blue in Pennsylvania. And I just wanted to reiterate for the people on this call that actually Capital Blue is a very strong partner of ours. And actually, interesting enough, despite that news, we actually extended our longstanding relationship with Capital Blue with a new contract in January of this year. And we are their only national laboratory and its preferred provider.","And, actually, I have recently spoken with the CEO there, and he did note that the arrangement that they have with Theranos does not change, in any aspect, the agreement that they have with Quest. As a matter of fact, what we went on to talk about is the difficult challenges we faced in healthcare, and what we could do together to help with the challenges of healthcare cost and help with this membership.","And what we offered to him, with our great quality and our great cost, is an important part of a solution he sees for his marketplace. So we are very well positioned with Capital Blue, and we're, again, one of their laboratories, but we're their only national laboratory and their preferred provider.","So I wanted to share that with you. We obviously didn't share that publicly, but to give you some color of, in fact, what we have for a presence in many of our marketplaces despite news you might hear from others.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, A.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Sir, your line is open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks, and good morning.","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Hi, Jack.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jack.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hello. Just wanted to ask, you mentioned the growth in Medicaid and managed Medicaid in the quarter, and starting to see, potentially, some signs from health reforms starting to come through. I was wondering if you could just maybe parse that out and help us better understand because I think the belief was that new patients were coming through the emergency department. Do you think you're actually beginning to start to see some managed care come through the physician office? And then maybe states that have expanded versus states not expanded, if you've seen some sort of trend there. Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, first of all, and again, I'll start and Mark will add to it. On the managed Medicaid side, we are seeing increased volumes. It is in the states that have expanded Medicaid, to your question. As you mentioned, you can read and what we have heard is those states have seen an increase in those lives entering the system through hospitals. So there's some growth in volumes there.","And also, you probably have seen in the last half, we published a study where we looked at diagnosis of diabetes in those states that expanded Medicaid versus those states that did not, and we actually saw an increase in the diagnosis of diabetes with those states that have expanded Medicaid. So the data is out there that expansion for the low-income portion of our population continues to gain momentum.","For all intents and purposes, it's the lives increase that we have seen, and for all intents and purposes, it's hard to track this, as you know. It is the reduction we see in some portion of our uninsured patient volumes. So we think the momentum is building. The momentum is building for more insured lives, and as we said, back three years ago, we believe when people have insurance, they need what we do. We're at the core of healthcare, and we're 70% of healthcare decision making, at 2% of costs.","So it's a very important part of getting a good baseline understanding of what's happening with someone's life. And, therefore, as they enter the system, we're going to see those volumes. So, Mark, would you like to add some color to Medicaid?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Jack, I'd say, as we've mentioned before, it's directional. We're seeing some growth in that area, but certainly not to the extent of what our fair share might be of over 10 million new lives in the system. Our belief is that it's going to take some of the newly insured a while to learn how to navigate the system. Their experience with healthcare has either been nothing or going to the hospital in an emergency setting for a lot of them. And they continue, I'd say, to utilize the hospital to a greater degree than they will over time.","So, we're certainly expecting to get our fair share, but I think to this point, we're not there yet. And as I said, they need to figure out how to find a primary care physician, how to navigate the very complicated healthcare system, and then we'll see certainly more growth down the road. And we do see a growth that's fairly aligned with the states that have expanded Medicaid, certainly versus the states that have not, and we absolutely are seeing a reduction in the volume of our uninsureds.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Ma'am, your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Amanda.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. I just had a question on the JV with Quintiles. So I'm just curious. I know it's been \u2013 you only recently closed, but wondering if you could share just a general reaction from your side of the world, from clients, as well as if Quintiles might have shared any initial reactions on their side.","And then I know you have a temporary agreement to share data, but any updates on how a relationship might work between you and Quintiles more broadly than the central lab? Thinking about economics of sharing data, and then potentially any revenue synergies that might come out of that data sharing.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. First of all, our initial reaction from customers is quite good. We continue to build volume in the business that we moved over to the JV. When I say volume, I mean revenue and profit, and you saw that in some of our numbers, and then that's now part of the JV. So that's a strong combination with their strong business. We're doing this, as I said in my remarks, to build a stronger business when we put both resources together.","And this is both in terms of addressing the market, so growing faster, and also taking some cost out. So we're going to be more profitable, and that's why we did it. So, reactions from those customers that we've gone out and spoke about how we're going to act together with Q2 Solutions has been quite good, and we're encouraged by that.","The second part of your question, Amanda, has to do with the work we are going to do together now to tease out, if you will, the value we can create for drug discovery. The first part of this is we have this incredible capability in clinical chemistry and our data is very strong. And so, on the testing side, we believe by working proactively with Pharma, we could have an earlier bird's eye access to what we could do with diagnostics and typically have that access to help us be well positioned as the companion diagnostic partner with some of the new drugs that will enter the market in years to come. So that's one area that we're going to put some work into now that the initial JV has closed.","And the second is just the data that we've talked about. We have data, they have data, Pharma has data. And how do we collaborate together to use that data, in a smart way, to improve drug discovery? And one idea that people have talked about, and we already have done some of this with our data already, is with better patient selection. And anything they can do to be more targeted and more precise and help with making drug discovery more efficient is a very good thing for our Pharma partners.","So that's what we're going to spend some time in. As I said in my remarks, we're going to take some time now to work with the management team of Quintiles to see if we can find exactly what we will do. We're proud to say we have formed all of this in a very capital efficient way, and we're going to deliver good value for our shareholders.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Amanda.","Operator","Thank you . Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Lisa.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, Steve, how are you?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning. Doing well.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks. I just had a couple quick questions here. I guess my first question would just be around PAMA. Do you have any thoughts or insights into the timing? I think that many of us are tired of sitting and waiting for it to come, but just wondering if you are hearing anything out of Washington, as far as the timing of that?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, we continue to share the information we have with you all. As we shared, we said the goal was to have the draft guidance out in June. Well, we're past that date. But we continue to hear that we're going to be seeing something, not in the distant future, but hopefully in the near future. They're not specific on timing. And as I said in my remarks, it's because it is a very complex task that we're all taking on.","We're all engaged. We're working proactively with them. Our trade association, ACLA, which I'm the chairman of, is actively engaged with them. So, we're entering this with the spirit of making sure we get the data we need to have to rebase the clinical schedule in 2017. And, again, we want to make sure it's a full view of the market, which includes all laboratories we compete with, and obviously that includes small independents, large nationals and hospital outreach labs because that's a big part of this market, as you all know.","So we know what we have shared and we continue to be anxiously waiting, as you, for the guidelines. We'll have time to comment on that. We have a lot of data to collect in 2016 to get the refresh done in 2017. So that's the schedule we have.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there anything that's changed your view that the full view of the market would be included based on any discussions that you've had in your role?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no, not at all. As a matter of fact, we've shared precisely what we shared with you, as far as the market \u2013 the competition in the market, which includes about a third of the market being hospital outreach. As you know, when you buy a hospital outreach business we have to go through antitrust reviews so, by definition, if you have to go through antitrust review, they are our competitor, and therefore they should be part of a full view of the market. So we haven't got any kind of push-back on that at all. So we continue to believe that we will be included because they should be included.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Sir, your line is open.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Bill.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my call. Sort of a big picture question here on the hospital strategy. I'm just wondering if there's any metrics at all that you can share with us to give us some indication of how those deals are going. I don't know if there's a growth metric at what you've acquired or partnered with or a profit improvement or just something that gives us a sense of how that strategy is going and then just your thoughts on continued activity there going forward.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, yeah. Well first of all, we continue to be very encouraged. I would say that the interest on the lab strategy for hospitals and integrated delivery systems continues to grow. As I said in my comments, we are very encouraged by our funnel and our discussions. When you enter into discussions with large organizations, it takes a longer time to come to conclusion, but we're making progress on some bigger prospects that hopefully we will be sharing with you in the second half.","With all that said, we've talked about us closing on a number ever opportunities already, and what I'll share with you in the back half, you'll see some more. We have not broken it out because typically what we do, Bill, is we take these opportunities and we fold those into our regions and that's how we can get synergies and we can have advantages for hospital systems working with us.","In some cases, we offload some of the hospital test menu and we move them into our closely located laboratories, which allows them to benefit from our effectiveness and our cost structure within that hospital environment. So it's more difficult to tease it out, but we are encouraged by the trend and we think this is something that we've invested in as part of our growth strategy. We feel good that we've put our bets in a good place and there will be more to come on this in the quarters to come.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Bill, as we shared, the six deals we closed in the prior year, were about worth $40 million in revenue. I will also mention that some of the first teals we did were smaller. It was kind of our proof point. So you shouldn't assume that that's the average deal we might close going forward. So as we've gotten more learning, we got more confident. We've engaged actually with some deals with the potential to be much larger than the average we've closed thus far.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Oh, very helpful. Thank you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just looking at the detailed EPS guidance in the press release. The overall number, the $470 million to $485 million is the same. The components moved around somewhat. Would it be possible just to go through those and sort of get some color on what each line item is moving around for?","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Yes, typically in the press release tables, we update some of the line items around restructuring and some of the adjustments just for the year-to-date impact as much as anything else.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So for the restructuring we should expect, I guess, that to continue to increase and then the -","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","That will increase as we move throughout the year with those adjustments, yeah.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And the diluted EPS, I guess, will be offset by that? So sort of assuming all else being equal, the total number to remain unchanged but the components to move around?","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","That's fair.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Any reason you guys do it that way and not sort of put the restructuring where you would expect the spending should be?","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Not particularly. I mean, this is how we've done it historically and it's just based on our latest updates and latest actual results at that point.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Gary, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate a significant gain on the creation of the joint venture, so that will be an adjustment in the other direction. What we also have mentioned is our attempt is to provide better information. That's why we do these adjustments and if you look at a three-year period, from 2012 through 2014, actually adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings are very, very close.","So we have adjustments up, we have adjustments down. We're trying to provide clarity and to Dan's point, the reason we do the tables we have, is not that we're wed to anything specifically, but we're trying to be consistent to make it easier and clearer on our stakeholders.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up, just on pricing, what are you seeing from competitors? Going back to Theranos, Theranos has put out sort of their very specific test menu with prices. Is that having any impact in your conversation with payers?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're tracking to where we expect it to be for this year and also over the last three years. We have shared our guidance about three years ago, as far as what we expect to be seeing for price impact. We're in that envelope. So we feel good about our visibility on that. We've delivered on what we said it would be to you all. So you should have confidence we have a good handle on this.","As far as pricing is concerned for 2016, what we shared is we see less pressure on the government side, based upon what we know about the clinical ad fee schedule and the physician fee schedule. So that's encouraging. And then we already got the question on PAMA what's happening in 2017 and beyond. We'll keep you abreast of what happens there.","As far as visibility and pricing in the marketplace, as you know, the way patients and consumers engage with the marketplace, the question is, when do they actually have the out-of-pocket cost? And yes, we have published our own prices in Arizona and we think those prices are very competitive. When you look at our average price per requisition, if you were just to go through our 10-K and you just make an assumption around test per requisition, you see a very strong value proposition from Quest Diagnostics in the marketplace and as you know, most people in this country have insurance. That's a growing percentage over time.","So therefore, for diagnostic testing, and as you also know, there's a portion of the Affordable Care Act that was related to screening and diagnostic testing. Some portion of what we do does not have out-of-pocket cost to consumers. So, how this all pans out as far as what the consumer will actually pay and how our prices affect kind of general visible and transparency of pricing in the marketplace, we'll see.","The last part of this, I just want to reiterate, if you look at prices in this industry, there's wide disparities on prices. Hospital outreach organizations are sometimes in the neighborhood of two to five times more expensive than our prices. We think transparency around all of that for consumers and for health plans to provide to their membership is very important, and we're right in back of all that because we think that serves us very well, because our quality and our price of that quality is really unsurpassed in our marketplace. And so the more volume we get around that, the better for us, we believe.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, and I just want to add this important distinction. So the direct-to-consumer prices are really a self-pay price. So for anybody who's got commercial insurance, and depending on your plan, even if you make the decision yourself on a test, there could be coverage and there might be coverage, you'll get the negotiated commercial rate. And in fact, our prices with people who have commercial insurance are not all that different than the competitor mentioned.","So we feel pricing is actually an advantage for us. We'd like to see more transparency. Our largest national provider has a tool where people who are a part of their plan can go to their site and can actually shop and we think that's a real positive thing. So we're in support of pricing transparency. But there is a difference between what self-pay price might be and what people have under their commercial coverage","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Michael.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","So, just one quick housekeeping question. I apologize if I missed this. Did you give the acquisition contribution specifically related to volume in the quarter?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We did not because the acquisitions pretty much \u2013 (49:19) anniversaried in Q1 and Summit was at the very beginning of April. So it's just inconsequential, so we didn't tease that out.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Perfect. That's helpful. I just want to type the model there. And then, you talked a lot about the pipeline related to the hospital businesses, and obviously, also, your M&A strategy. As you think about the moving pieces related to regulatory changes between SCOTUS finally being decided, the upcoming pending decision on PAMA, whichever way that's going to shake out, how does that impact the M&A environment? How does it impact the discussions you're having as part of that pipeline? Is there a rush to get deals done in the face of uncertainty related to the moving piece? Is there a wait and see until we get particularly something like PAMA out of the way? So I would think that either way, whichever way PAMA shakes out, it would probably open up some opportunities in terms of closing down or closing out deals in the pipeline versus what you may have right now. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how that's changed the discussion, if anything, if that's had any impact as well on the types of multiples that sellers want from you.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, we just say, in general, it's not changing our pace of our acquisition portion of our strategy. We have always had and will continue to have going forward, as a portion of our Restore growth strategy, of having about 1% to 2% top-line growth from acquisitions. So our growth strategy is both organic and through acquisitions. So, it's an important part of our strategy. And because of that, we've been actively engaged on it. We announced the Memorial deal already. We said that we have more in our pipeline, so you should expect that there will be something else to come.","As far as the deals itself, we continue to be very disciplined with how an acquisition would fit into our strategy, it has to be strategically aligned, and we have to meet our financial thresholds. And when we look at that, we continue to be prospective on what we think might happen with payment going forward. And you did mention PAMA and what could happen with the clinical lab fee schedule, but it is an unknown for the whole industry. So, I would say in general, that's not an active consideration right now, and just what's happening in the general environment is not changing our pace or perspective on any of this right now.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo of Robert Baird. Sir, your line is open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Mark, can you just give us a sense of maybe where you are on Invigorate in terms of realized savings at this point halfway through the year, and what you expect for all of 2015? And then maybe just qualitatively, give us a sense of where you see some of the savings coming from.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, so we haven't broken out the incremental $600 million that we talked about, taking us from over $700 million at the end of 2014 to $1.3 billion over the next several years. So we haven't broken that down by year, having suggested that it's proportional. However, obviously, you can see, as we committed, that some of that Invigorate is now starting to help us to actually grow profitability and not just to offset some of the headwinds. So we haven't teased out the exact numbers at this point, Whit, but you shouldn't expect that it should be skewed heavily in one direction or another. The $600 million is going to be fairly steady over the next couple of years.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then maybe just qualitatively, just maybe where do you see a lot of the savings coming from at this point?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so it's the things we talked about. Obviously, you start with some of the things, basic, such as procurement excellence, certainly some of the lab efficiencies that we're driving through our Quest Management System. We did talk about some things that probably are going to be skewed toward the back end in terms of the full savings that Jim Davis referred to specifically, the three planks about e-enablement, certainly getting paid more for the work that we do and the value that we provide, those things. Some of the things are going to take a little longer, though certainly were in the early stages. We've talked about starting to implement credit cards in our patient service centers, starting to put them in some \u2013 inner office (53:46) to actually get payment more upfront, instead of having to chase it after the fact, more similar to what the rest of the healthcare industry has been doing for quite a while. So, it's not as if some of these things are going to not start until the back end, but some of them are just going to take longer to get to their full level of savings. All of those things, along with some of the things that we've been doing for the last several years, are going to continue to help us drive Invigorate up to that next level of $1.3 billion.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","No, that's helpful. And maybe just one last one for Steve. I mean, obviously, CMS has missed the statutory deadline to publish the clinical lab fee schedule. And just any idea why we haven't seen this, and just any updated expectations and thoughts on PAMA and the data collection process?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All I can share is when we've engaged with them, and I said this in my remarks, this is very complex. There's \u2013 we're one of thousands of laboratories. We have thousands of tests. They need to \u2013 and we have hundreds of payer contracts, and we're one. So if you go through the math, I mean, the degree of complexity by code is significant. So they're trying to understand how they collect the data in a reasonable way, and then curate that data to be able to make some sense out of it. And so as they got into it, it is a tall order for them to try to accomplish. So that's what I would share as the reason why I believe that they have not, missed the deadline and continue to be silent on when they think they're going to get this done.","With all that said, it is what we have to try to figure out, and we do want to continue to work with them in good faith as an industry to get this put together, so we can get the data and have them share with us what they think the clinical lab fee schedule will be in 2017. So that's what I can share, Whit, that's what we know.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. I guess, we'll just wait and see. Thanks.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys, this is Jason Plagman on for Brian. A question on \u2013 so your organic volume growth has been around flat for the last year or so. Are you seeing anything in the market that would lead you to believe that'll change significantly in either the second half of 2015 or 2016?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, what we have shared is that some portion of that organic volume for us is related to decisions we have made. And some of those are strategic as far as where we're focusing our energy in the higher end portion of our portfolio, and some of it is around customers. And we also have shared in the back half, some of that becomes an easier comp for us. And, Mark, why don't you just share perspective on what we've talked about in the last three quarters or four quarters and then what will happen in the back half with our organic performance on volumes and revenue?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, well, as I noted before, you've seen that despite some volume declines, we've actually been able to grow revenue the last several quarters. So first off, I want to mention that. But yes, as Steve mentioned, we did have some of that volume, less profitable volume that we walked away from, and that's gotten behind us. And then we did also cite some competitive losses, Department of Defense was one of them that was a while back. A lot of the implementation really happened over the last 12 months. And then there was a large Blue's plan in Philadelphia, Independence Blue Cross, where we were at par with our chief competitor, and they negotiated a rate to exclude us. So we did have that loss. Now, that again largely gets behind us as we go into the back half of the year. So those two large losses combined with the volumes that we walked away from have made volume certainly a headwind over the last 12 months, but those comps get a lot easier in the back half.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Just to underscore what Mark has said, we continue to share with you that our Restore growth plan is both organic and through acquisition. We feel very good that in the first half, we grew greater than 3% growth in revenues. It's a good number. Some portion out of that is organic and some portion through acquisitions. As you know, in the second quarter, we were lighter in acquisitions, and we provided you guidance in the back half of the year. And that 3% growth has allowed us to grow earnings at the level that we have, and it's real earnings. If you look at our operating income, it's up nicely versus last year. We're proud of that. And, also, we've gotten expansion, margin expansion.","So, we think we've got the right formula here that we're working, and we'll continue that formula because at the end of the day, as you all know, the way we're going to get our value up for this company is to continue to grow our earnings, and we think we're on the right path to do that.","Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Ma'am, your line is open.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Ricky.","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning, and thank you for squeezing me in.","So, a couple of questions, follow-up questions here. First of all, Mark, you highlight the fact that test volumes were actually up despite requisition coming down. So, can you just give us a little bit more detail on, on average, how many tests per requisition you're seeing now, and how does this compares to kind of maybe last quarter or last year? And then also, how does this go over to pricing? I mean, obviously, that should be positive for average revenue per requisition, but just that we get a sense because pricing was positive for the first time in a very long time. I know you talked about esoteric is a positive trend, but if you can just help us kind of like think about number of tests per requisition versus test mix.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Ricky, your first question, we have provided some visibility on our requisition volume over the years and also what tests we have seen annually. And, Dan, why don't you share those numbers we've shared in the past?","Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Yeah, so what we said is in terms of requisitions, we said last year was requisition count was about $156 million. We said that in general, we see, on average, about three to four tests per requisition. When you think about that and on your question about the revenue per requisition growth, just keep in mind, that's a combination of both the pricing and reimbursement pressure that we're seeing, as well as the benefits of some of the test and business mix shifts. So when you think about pure pricing, the reimbursement pressure is a little bit less than 1% for the quarter. And so, how we got to that favorable revenue per acquisition overall is really being driven by favorable test and business mix shifts. Steve and Mark both mentioned gene-based and esoteric testing had \u2013 grew very nicely in the second quarter, grew in the first quarter as well. And so, some of the benefits of those additional tests on requisitions, as well as a richer test in some of the things that we are selling, has benefited that revenue per requisition calculation.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And that outcome is not a coincidence. It is a consequence of our strategy, to steer a larger portion of our portfolio to where we can make more money and where we can deliver value.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Steve, a follow-up question on \u2013 just to get your market perspective. In the past, the number of tests that are offered on a menu has been, I think, a limiting factor or a critical factor for a lab to penetrate the provider segment, whether it's ambulatory or hospital. Is that still the case? And what do you think is that critical number? Do you need to have 250 tests on your menu, do you need 1,000 tests, do you need more than that?","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we \u2013 as one of our elements of our value that we deliver to all our clients, including integrate delivery systems in hospitals, is we have one of the broadest test menu of anyone. So, as you know, we've got the most routine and the most advanced, and we're bringing new science to the marketplace every day. We're proud of that, and we think it will continue to be a differentiator. The hospital market, the referencer (01:02:40) market, is a more concentrated marketplace. It's \u2013 there's no specific number because in addition to the test menu, it includes consideration about quality and service and reputation in the marketplace. And, yes, pricing is a consideration for that as well. So, you have to put all of those elements together to eventually really understand what happens at the end of the day of us getting reference work and more hospital business versus others. So, there's no particular number that we can see.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just what is self-pay as a percent of your revenues?","Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","About low single digits. I think it's about 2%.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ricky.","Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I think we're up on time. So I just wanted to say once again that we believe we had another good quarter. We are making solid progress executing our strategy. We appreciate your time here today and we hope you have a great day.

Go ahead, please.","Shawn Bevec","Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.","For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense. As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Additionally, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior-year comparisons to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that became effective January 1, 2018, and were adopted on a retrospective basis.","Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.","Now here is Steve Rusckowski.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I\u2019ll provide you with the highlights on the quarter and review progress on our 2-point strategy, which continues to drive results. And then Mark will provide more detail on second quarter performance.","The highlight of the quarter was establishing, our long-term strategic partnership with UnitedHealthcare, I\u2019ll share more on this relationship in a few minutes. We delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter driven by revenue growth and the benefits of tax reform. Here are some key highlights from the quarters; revenues were up 3%, despite some headwinds in the marketplace, reported EPS was up more than 14% from 2017, the adjusted EPS grew more than 20%.","Before I describe the progress we\u2019ve made, I like to provide an update on PAMA. We continue to support efforts by our trade association to implement a market-based laboratory reimbursement schedule. On the legal front, ACLA has sued CMS, and both sides have submitted their briefs to the court, we\u2019re awaiting the judge to rule on the briefs or set the date to hear or oral arguments. In the meantime, we continue our outreach efforts to find the legislative solution.","Earlier this month we were pleased to learn that CMS is asking stakeholders to provide comments and also improve future data collection and reporting periods on their PAMA. This is a proper step since as we said all along, PAMA\u2019s current reporting requirements undermine any effort to establish a sustainable market-based PAMA model and deliver the care that patients need. But the key will be what CMS does with the requested comments. And moreover the need for change is now. Changing data collection for the future reported periods does not undo the harm caused by the flawed data collection process that was used in connection with establishing the current rates.","Turning to the second quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. We completed our previously announced acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare in Massachusetts the leading provider of healthcare services for residents and visitors of Cape Cod. Our integration efforts from acquisitions completed in 2017, continue to drive revenue growth and our M&A pipeline remain strong.","As we continued our conversations with hospital system CEO\u2019s from around the country, it\u2019s clear from those discussion there is a growing awareness of PAMA and the impact it has on their outreach laboratory business. CEO\u2019s are increasingly interested in talking more about how we can help them execute their last strategy. As you recall, this can involve improving their hospital lab operations, working with us on reference testing and potentially selling their outreach laboratory business to us.","In addition to PAMA, hospital CEO\u2019s are also seeing the trend in health plans like Aetna and UnitedHealthcare partnering with high value providers like Quest to reduce laboratory spend and bring down the cost of care. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems. In May we announced our long-term strategic partnership with UnitedHealthcare beginning on January 1, 2019, plus we\u2019ll be participating as a national provider of laboratory services for all UnitedHealthcare plan participants.","We\u2019re excited about this partnership, as it includes a broad range of value-based programs rewarding high quality, easily accessible laboratory services at the best value and real-time data sharing to drive more personalized health.","We\u2019re positioning ourselves to be well prepared to provide UnitedHealthcare members with a first-class customer experience. Our commercial team has already begun proactively reaching out to physician and customers to let to know, we\u2019ll be in that work with UnitedHealthcare on January 1. Additionally, we\u2019ll be fielding inquiries from customers who are committed to selling us an increasingly share of their UnitedHealthcare patient specimens in 2019.","We\u2019re delivering on the third element of our growth strategy, which is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We continue to see strong growth in prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON, tuberculosis test, noninvasive prenatal screening. In the second quarter, we did experience three dynamics which impacted the marketplace. First, the growth we saw in prescription drug monitoring marketplace although strong, it was less than expected because of policy changes opposed by some payers to limit testing. We\u2019re engaging directly with these payers to show the medical necessity of this testing and so far have had success getting at least one payer to reverse its policy change.","Second, in the hepatitis C market, we saw a faster than expected decline in genotyping and resistance testing. This was largely due to the rapid acceptance, so that these new hepatitis C therapy which works across multiple genes and does not require the same level of testing as previous therapies. We still see a tremendous opportunity in hepatitis C screening. Our screening business continues to grow and we estimate two-thirds of more than 70 million baby boomers still have yet to be screened.","Finally on vitamin D testing, it did slow the quarter due to increased reimbursement denials. We\u2019re working with payers and providers to ensure the appropriate testing is being performed for patients who need it. We continue to make strong progress, executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers.","Our Walmart locations continue to see increased traffic and the well received by customers. We\u2019re now operating in 12 Walmart locations in Florida and Texas and we\u2019ll be providing more around our consumer strategies including MyQuest, our digital experience and our consumer offering at our Investor Day in November.","The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services. I\u2019m excited about last month\u2019s launch of Quest Clinical Trial Connect a new patient recruitment service to help pharma companies and sterile to speed the development of new therapies. We have already engaged several pharma, biotech and sterile companies with this solution.","In the area of population health in June, we released a study on employer wellness and screening at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Session showing a strong association between wellness participation and healthcare outcomes. The study showed that a third of the at-risk employees identified by screen who then participated in a behavioural health program to reduce diabetes risk, reduce glucose and hemoglobin A1c to normal levels. Also more than one-quarter participants lost 5% or more of body weight reducing the risk of many of BCD related conditions.","This news is catching the attentions of both employers and health plans as they proactively look for opportunities to vendor healthcare cost curve. We\u2019re strengthening already strong position in the marketplace. The second element of our 2-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We\u2019re continued to drive efficiency and effectiveness within Quest to cover the cost of wage inflation and reimbursement pressure. I referenced to digitize our processes are improving the customer experience.","So here are two simple real examples of improving opportunities in front of us. First, as we shared previously, processing a paper requisition takes approximately 4 minutes, the enablement allows us to improve both efficiency and quality. We\u2019re making progress in our efforts to get clients systemic, electronic requisitions today more than 70% of the requisitions we received are sent electronically and this is up from approximately 60% in 2016.","Second, we have developed a client from lead application, which allows physicians and their staffs to order specimen pickups. Since the launch of early last year over 5,000 clients have converted to online tick up through what we call, Quanum HCP Portal and we\u2019re adding 200 clients each week. Each day more than 13% of routine on-demand, pick up requests are received electronically through our new application. And we expect this rapid adoption will continue. Well this translates into \u2013 if you recall to our call centre in a significant fewer occurrences of our couriers arriving to find an empty lot box.","Now let me turn it over to Mark, who\u2019ll take you through the financial performance. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve. Consolidated revenues of $1.92 billion were up 3% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we now report uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of net revenues instead of bad debt due to a change in revenue recognition accounting.","Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew 3.3% compared to the prior year, driven largely by acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.5% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 200 basis points. Volume was softer than expected due in large part to the specific market dynamics highlighted by Steve earlier. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter grew by 20 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price, it includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req.","During the second quarter, unit prices headwinds remain consistent with those observed in the first quarter with a headwind of approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and less than 100 basis points from all other factors. After netting changes to PAMA, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019, as we have indicated previously. Beyond unit price, other mix elements remained strong in the quarter and more than offset reimbursement headwinds.","Reported operating income for the quarter was $305 million or 15.9% of revenues compared to $319 million or 17.1% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $340 million or 17.7% of revenues compared to $343 million or 18.4% of revenues last year. The decline in operating margin was due to several factors including investments using tax reform savings that had a 60 basis point adverse impact on operating margin, some of our larger acquisitions which are in the early stages of integration and therefore not yet delivering full margin and contribution and PAMA.","Reported EPS was $1.57 in the quarter compared to $1.37 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.75 up more than 20% from $1.45 last year. During the quarter uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility, which we now call patient price concessions were flat year-over-year. Cash provided by operations year-to-date was $503 million versus $490 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $151 million compared to $107 million a year ago, which is in line with a higher CapEx spend planned for 2018.","Now turning to guidance. We are narrowing our outlook for 2018 as follows; revenues now expected to be between $7.7 billion and $7.74 billion an increase of 4% to 4.5% versus the prior year; reported diluted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.64; and adjusted EPS to be between $6.53 and $6.67; cash provided by operation continues to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures continue to be between $350 million and $400 million.","In addition, keep in mind that the investments in the business we are making related to tax reform savings will continue to ramp up as we progress throughout the remainder of 2018. Some of these investments are related to preparing to be a national in network provider for UnitedHealthcare.","Our narrowed revenue guidance reflects our performance through the first half. As you think about the second half of the year consider the following; first, the actions we are taking in the areas of PDM and vitamin D testing; second, as Steve mentioned health systems are talking to us more about how we can help them execute their lab strategy. We have a few professional lab services agreements we expect to close in the second half. Taken together we expect the benefit of these items will build as we progress through the remainder of the year.","Finally, last year severe hurricane impacts should make for an easier comparison this year. The majority of the impact was in the third quarter with some carryover in the fourth quarter as well. To sum it up, we expect growth to accelerate throughout the second half and remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2018 outlook.","I will now turn it back to Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks Mark. And to summarize, we grew revenues and delivered strong earnings in the second quarter. We\u2019re excited to build on the strategic relationship that we now have with UnitedHealthcare Group. And we remain focused on executing our 2-point strategy and we are confident, we\u2019ll meet our commitments for the remainder of 2018.","Now we\u2019d be happy to take any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Patrick.","Patrick Donnelly","How are you?","Steve Rusckowski","Good.","Patrick Donnelly","When we think about the shifting payer contracts to nonexclusive, can you just talk through your initial discussions with United ahead of the contract opening up in January? How quickly you think you can capture share? And then just from the outside, what are the key dynamics to understand around the ramp up of business and your focus points going into January?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question. We have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. When we had launched the new relationship, we talked about the opportunities that have access to over 40 million lives. And we\u2019ve already started, and we\u2019ve started working on this aggressively. So we have detailed out by thousands of accounts which sales reps and which geographies will engage with customers.","First of all, making them aware of the contractual changes, talk about what we need to do to potentially serve them in a broader way. And finally is, to be prepared to ramp this up as quickly as possible. And so what I will share with you is we\u2019ve already left the blocks, we\u2019re off and running. We\u2019re engaging with customers throughout the United States. The receptivity of this is quite good. They\u2019re waiting for someone for some time for us to be back on contract. And the biggest opportunity for us is, for those accounts that might have another laboratory because we were not contract with United, now have an opportunity to continue to bring us more of their laboratory services work. And then second is, we have an opportunity just broadly in many accounts to gain more share. So we\u2019re optimistic about it and working hard at it.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just on the capital allocation side, pretty light quarter in terms of M&A activity, can you just update us what you are seeing in the market. Are things developing slower than you anticipate around PAMA driving consolidation or is it more just around the processes inside the hospitals taking a long time to get deal consummated.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Patrick, just to underscore my comments, the conversations have increased. We\u2019re engaged in many more conversations today with CEO\u2019s of integrated delivery systems around their lab strategy. And in that regard, they are considering given what\u2019s happening with PAMA and given the change they see happening with health plans, for what they \u2013 should they going forward with their outreach business if they have it. So we\u2019re optimistic by the prospect.","Again, there\u2019s three parts of our strategy. First is what we call professional laboratory services business. As Mark said, we\u2019ve got a few opportunities in front of us. We\u2019re hopeful in the back half to be announcing a couple of these at least. Second is, it affords us an opportunity to do more other sophisticated testing, which we call reference testing in the hospitals. And usually, when we have those conversations, we then have a conversation around outreach. So there\u2019s more conversation today than a year ago in that funnel and that whole opportunity list continues to build for us.","Shawn Bevec","Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser","Hey, good morning.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Ricky Goldwasser","So first of all, a point of clarification. When we think about the guidance for second half of the year, does that incorporate continued weakness with drug monitoring, hep C and vitamin D?","Mark Guinan","So Ricky, the hep C impact, we don\u2019t expect to be reversed. So that is kind of a permanent change. So we\u2019ll continue to have some headwinds on that particular part of hep C. But as Steve mentioned, screening continues to grow. So it\u2019s still an attractive business, it\u2019s just that the genotypic testing, which is largely going to go away. So continued headwinds on hep C but certainly, mitigating because there will be some business that obviously will remain in other drugs that do require that testing.","On the prescription drug monitoring, we mentioned that we\u2019ve got one payer who changed their position. We are well down the road in discussing that with a couple of other payers who made those changes. We\u2019re optimistic because we think that our view is the medically appropriate approach to this very necessary important area of testing. So we have some plans in place, and we\u2019re counting on not just the one payer being reversed, but there are couple of others we\u2019re feeling like we\u2019re making progress in that space.","And then on vitamin D, it\u2019s really a market that has probably not always been coded appropriately. There\u2019s changes in vitamin D that make a lot of people eligible for vitamin D testing. And there\u2019s some practices where people are still using old coding, not understanding that it\u2019s going to have an impact on the providers. So I think there is an increasing education around the appropriate use of vitamin D testing, which, of course, we support but then ensuring that you coded accurately as well to ensure that the providers could pay. So we\u2019re optimistic that some of that will be mitigated as well. And over time, and that\u2019s why we talked about increasing momentum throughout the back half of the year.","Steve Rusckowski","So the guidance for the full year does contemplating, obviously, what happened in the first half but what we will address for these three issues that we talked about in our remarks in the second half as well. So yes, it\u2019s in.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay, great. And then two thoughts here. First of all, when we think about a step up in SG&A investment in preparation for bringing on the United volume, should we think about that as incremental to the $75 million in investment that are related to tax reform savings that you talked about in the past? And should we think about this as a new SG&A base that will carry over for 2019 or do you just onetime investments? And then the second thought is just on unit price. In the prepared remarks, you talked about the mix versus the unit price headwinds and you mentioned that 2019 reimbursement pressure will accelerate on the unit price. I know it\u2019s a little bit early, but how should we think about the mix versus the unit price in 2019?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So thank you for the questions. First off, the investments that we talked about ramping up are included in that $75 million. So it\u2019s not incremental from the $75 million we talked about. We, in the beginning of the year, we talked about a portion of that being invested in our people in that $500 onetime bonus. We talked about some investments in the areas of accelerated growth, around advanced diagnostics and PBM. Well we didn\u2019t talk about the third piece and we couldn\u2019t because that was really earmarked for United.","So it\u2019s still all contained within the initial $75 million we talked about. And then importantly, it\u2019s not all SG&A. A large portion of it is actually cost of sales. And its investment before the volume comes, but then once the volume comes, it\u2019s just cost of sales. So as we add incremental to draw centers incremental phlebotomist, couriers and laboratory tax ahead of that volume to ensure we\u2019re fully prepared for what we expect to come its in investments. But then over time, obviously, it\u2019s just the normal support you need to deliver our business.","And then in terms of 2019, Ricky, I\u2019m not yet going to give any guidance for 2019. But I can assure you that when we gave the multiyear outlook when I presented in 2016 and we reaffirmed when PAMA was announced last fall, that all of that is contemplated. So we\u2019ll give you more granularity on that \u2013 on all those pieces at the Investor Day later in the year.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may ask your question.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Amanda.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is actually Max on for Amanda. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Just wanted to follow-up a little bit around some unit price headwinds, I know you mentioned the other 50 basis point headwinds from PAMA and 100 basis points from other factors. Can now we speak around what exactly those other factors are. How transitory do you think those factors are going to be moving forward? And that maybe also just some additional context around the benefits from mix in the quarter in terms of how much that contributed?","Mark Guinan","Sure. So the \u2013 we didn\u2019t say it was 100. To clarify, it\u2019s less than 100. So that\u2019s kind of in the normal course of the last couple of years of some of the nongovernmental pricing headwinds that we\u2019ve had. And it has to do with any other part of our business, whether it\u2019s extending third-party commercial contracts, whether it\u2019s the direct business in which we compete through hospital reference testing, or it can even be in the stage where it\u2019s permitted where we are actually billing physicians directly as a client who then mark up that work and then bill it to the third-party.","So we have certainly competition amongst all these areas and while we\u2019ve certainly turned the tide of where pricing was some years ago, as we said, there\u2019s still some degree of headwinds in the balance of our business. And that\u2019s generally going somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points over the last several years quarter-to-quarter and continues to be less than 100 basis points. And we mentioned that when you take price and all the mix elements together, with favorable revenue per req of 20 basis points. So obviously with 50 basis points of PAMA, somewhere south of 100 basis points on other pricing, we have significantly lift from the other mix elements.","And then finally, we\u2019ve talked about professional laboratory services, which is an increasing part of our growth. It is a business that has lower revenue per req because of the unique nature of what it is. It\u2019s basic testing done for hospital in-patients, where typically, we have fewer tests per req and more basic testing. We\u2019re not doing advanced diagnostics in that business and so on. So revenue per req tends to be lower and so that creates the mixed headwinds, it\u2019s math in terms of our revenue per req. It doesn\u2019t in anyway speak to its profitability. It\u2019s still a very attractive, profitable business. It just has a low req volume and more basic routine testing.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Just to reiterate something we always say, and Mark said in his prepared remarks, we do this calculation on revenue per requisition. But really, when you get into managing the business and understanding how that eventually yields margins, there\u2019s a lot of other considerations. Some of this lower revenue per req business actually BNP more profitable than higher req \u2013 higher dollar per requisition. So it\u2019s not necessarily a surrogate for margins at all, so something to keep in mind.","So in the quarter, we improved our revenue per requisition by 20 basis points, but you saw our margin were quite good in consideration for what we had to do with a lot of the different moving pieces, as Mark outlined.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Appreciate the color on that. And following-up on a little bit of a related note. We saw a little over a week ago with the preliminary physician rule that CMS has proposed, tweaked a few thresholds to define what\u2019s an applicable lab for reporting purposes. Just wondered if there\u2019s been any discussions around what the implications could be of this internally or externally as you continue to adopt PAMA here in 2018?","Steve Rusckowski","As I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re encouraged that they\u2019re asking us for input related to how to improve the data reporting. Albeit, we still believe what they did with the current Clinical Lab Fee Schedule was wrong and that needs to be corrected and we\u2019re challenging CMS in that regard. Prospective, we do need to get it right. We are pursuing a legislative solution to that. And we\u2019re engaging, as we have all along, with CMS, on how we conclude more labs and how do we get the statistics to really reflective of the market-based approach to laboratory services. So we\u2019re encouraged by that.","Second, on the physician fee schedule there will be modest tweaks in that. We think it\u2019s for 2019 not necessarily that notable for our business. That was a small piece of our anatomic pathology business that had billed that way. But nothing that\u2019s material for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. You may ask your question.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. First all, just cleanup questions from previous ones. Is there any way that we can quantify the headwind you saw from the drug testing hep C, vitamin D in terms of maybe percentage headwind that represented?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So we have been at a pretty steady rate of organic improvements in organic growth over the last number of quarters. And then obviously, we\u2019ve fallen back from that. Really, the things that we talked about are really the primary drivers of that difference, A.J. So I\u2019m not going to give a specific number. What I would say is those are the reconciliation between kind of the run rate organic performance we\u2019ve been delivering consistently and what we delivered in the second quarter.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So we outlined the three areas A.J., in the remarks. And if you look at the issues that we saw reflect what we thought we could have done versus what we really did do. So those three, we will quantify exactly of the three buckets the total will be broken down from. But they do outline the difference between expectations to the market, our expectations and what we actually delivered.","A.J. Rice","Okay. And then my follow-up\u2026","Steve Rusckowski","Now with that said, we are taking actions for a few of those to reverse it in Q3 and Q4. We mentioned the work we\u2019re doing with payers on the prescription drug monitoring, the work we\u2019re doing with payers around vitamin D. As Mark said, the hep C care business, which is the genotyping and resistance testing business will essentially slow down because it\u2019s no longer needed to give the new therapy for AbbVie. But the screening business continues to be a big opportunity and there\u2019s plenty of baby boomers left that need to be screened. So even though it did slow in the quarter, we\u2019re working on things to reverse that in the second half.","A.J. Rice","Okay. And then my follow-up, I just want to ask you about a couple of growth opportunities. We talk a lot about United, Optum is in the process of buying DaVita Medical Group. I know lots of that medical group practice that volume tends to go to you. Have you look at opportunity that might present for you and given any sizing of that? And then is there any update on your work with HCA, I know about a year, 1.5 years ago, you started working with them in Denver and the idea was just sort of exploring opportunities and that could extend. Any update on those\u2013 that discussion?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So first of all, on Optum, when we talked about our relationship with UnitedHealthcare group, it\u2019s well. We currently are now back in network in 2019 with UHC as an in-network provider laboratory services. That\u2019s big. As you know, we have partnered with them on revenue cycle management. We\u2019re one of their biggest customers. Third is, we provide wellness services for Optum. So we are their somewhat exclusive provider of wellness services for OptumCare when they sell those to payers. Also, we\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re becoming one of our biggest customers. To your specific question in OptumCare, as you said, their buying physicians and they\u2019re buying many of our existing customers. And the opportunity to beat up the physician business supports yet another opportunity.","So if that closes, they\u2019ll be close to \u2013 they have close to 50,000 physicians, and we\u2019re actively working with them on how we can better serve all their physicians, the existing accounts but also growing \u2013 their growing list of physicians in OptumCare. So this relationship continues to build, and we see a good growth prospect of building a bigger and better relationship with OptumCare as they consolidate those practices into their business going forward.","Second part of the question\u2026","Mark Guinan","On HCA.","Steve Rusckowski","HCA. The Denver opportunity which is called the continental division is going well. We\u2019re optimistic that we can leverage that relationship throughout the rest of HCA. We continue to work that. And as Mark said, there will be more professional laboratory services relationships announced in the second half. So stay posted.","Mark Guinan","Yes. I would just add, A.J., and certainly you can ask them, but I\u2019m very confident they would tell you that we\u2019ve delivered the quality and the cost savings that they were looking for target up front. So now, of course, the question is what does that mean? Could it mean we expand to other sites? I would think, at the point in time, if we have something to announce, we are happy to announce it. But I think the good news is that both parties are happy with what was delivered and it\u2019s worked out very well.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, A.J.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Jack Meehan","Hey, good morning.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Jack Meehan","My first question, I was curious if you could weigh in on the Women\u2019s Health Business in the quarter? I think there was some impact in the first quarter from the weather and the flu. Just what were some of the trends you were seeing in the second quarter there?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. First of all, as we\u2019ve mentioned in our remarks, the prenatal testing business continues to grow nicely. So we\u2019re optimistic about that. Second is if you look at just ongoing activity, and we\u2019ve showed this many, many times, if you look at our existing accounts and we do the same account or same-store analysis. And if you look at activity within those accounts that we know we have, we haven\u2019t lost any share. I would say, just in general the market\u2019s stable. And I would say, just in general, that\u2019s true for let\u2019s just call it the more routine portion of our Women\u2019s Health business.","We continue Jack to see a continuation of the slow decline in our path business. The change in practice guidelines back in 2013 did affect the marketplace, where women in the past used to go annually for their check, that\u2019s happening less frequently and that continues to be phased in, even though it\u2019s been about five years. But just in general, the general volume from our Women\u2019s Health business continues to be stable.","Jack Meehan","Great. And then I had two follow-ups on capital deployment. I caught M&A added 2% of volume, what was the total revenue contribution? And then on share repurchase, I think this is the first quarter with no repurchase since 2011. So just if you could give any color on what you think the pacing is from here and why no repurchase in the quarter?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So the contribution from M&A was similar, so there wasn\u2019t a big difference. Obviously what we\u2019re buying, Jack, is a business that\u2019s very similar to our core business. So you wouldn\u2019t see a tremendous mix difference that are differential between the volume and revenue contribution.","Jack Meehan","And then on share repurchase.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So share repurchases, we actually were quiet in the quarter. We stepped out of the market due to what we thought was the impending announcement of UnitedHealthcare. So going forward, as we said, we\u2019re going to do the minimal level to meet our 50% or at least half commitment of cash returned to our \u2013 or free cash flow returned to our shareholders. Certainly, you should expect that level of activity. But any other share repurchases would be dependent on the amount of M&A activity we have in the back half.","Jack Meehan","Great. Thank you, Mark and Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks, Jack.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey good morning guys.","Mark Guinan","Hey, Brian.","Brian Tanquilut","Steve, so I guess, as I think about the recent rule that came out of CMS, the rule proposal, and how they\u2019re still viewing, obviously, PAMA as excluding the hospitals. How do you \u2013 assuming that holds, right? How do you view the recent changes in manage your contracting, with you getting to United, and LabCorp getting to Aetna? How does that impact the repricing of PAMA a few years down the road?","Steve Rusckowski","Well, what they used, Brian, for the majority of the data points for what we got in a refresh of a clinical fee schedule, the vast majority of the data points were from the two large nationals. So that was what was used. And we think that was incredibly flawed in its approach. Imagine what CMS buys from all the laboratories they buy it from thousands of laboratories, roughly 20% of what they buy is from the nationals. So the date they collected was a distortion of what they really buy.","And so this is one of the biggest points we have. They got to collect more data from more laboratories. And as you know, there\u2019s wide variation in this marketplace and the best value is from a company like Quest Diagnostics. So that was the data they collected. We\u2019re hopeful. Given this current request for more data, now they can collect more data. The advocacy by asking the question, they got it wrong and they need to get it right the next time they collected data. And again, we\u2019re challenging what they did in the first time around lawsuit. It\u2019s still in the court. We\u2019re hopeful that, that will progress, and we\u2019ll have a favorable consideration there.","But in parallel with that, we\u2019re also looking for a legislative solution. So we\u2019re currently continue to work this because we believe, at its core, the refreshed clinical \u2013 the lab fee schedule was done wrongly. But given all that, what we\u2019ve outlined in our guidance for this year, what we\u2019ve outlined in our outlook for 2019 and 2020 is assuming worst case. That is if this sticks and it continues to be the case then that in fact will be what we\u2019ll absorb, and we will be able to manage the business and hit our outlook despite it. So hopefully, we\u2019ll have better news in that regard, but we\u2019re assuming the worst case.","And then into the future, yes, there will be data points gathered from payers. But again, hopefully there\u2019ll be more laboratories included in data collection process, so therefore, that will move the needle quite a bit. So hopefully, that answers your question.","Mark Guinan","Yes. So let me just quickly comment, Brian, on its impact on PAMA. So as we shared, we\u2019re very vocal with all the payers, not just getting United, and I certainly can\u2019t speak for our competitor. But I can tell you that when we go in there and say, hey, now there\u2019s full transparency. We know where the weighted volume median is amongst the national provider, we know we provide the best prices. And the fact that you already get the best prices from us and that we\u2019re going to be paying for potentially twice, with PAMA, means like you\u2019re not getting any better prices. And if anything, it\u2019s an opportunity \u2013 it has been opportunity for us to talk about getting paid for more because these are getting paid more because they think we paid a little bit more than we have been recently or historically, it\u2019s still a less better value than the majority of the people they\u2019re paying.","And in fact, in the United contract, when we talk about value-based contracting, as we move volume away from those high-cost providers, part of the contract is what you\u2019d call a bonus rate. So basically, we share the savings with our partner and that will ensure that as we\u2019re saving the healthcare system patients and the payers all money that it doesn\u2019t damage us from a PAMA perspective, but actually, it should be neutral to positive depending on how we\u2019re performing and where that volume growth comes from.","Brian Tanquilut","No. I appreciate that. And I guess the follow-up to that is as we think about the networks built around United and Aetna, how do you think about the pace of market share shift? Not necessarily from your national competitor but from the regional\u2019s. What is that opportunity and how hard of a lift or how heavy of a lift is that?","Steve Rusckowski","Well, that\u2019s the opportunity in front of us, this relationship with United, and we we\u2019re having conversations with all the payers. Despite the two nationals having strong presence, there\u2019s still an opportunity to pick up share for the rest of the marketplace. We talk about the opportunity, when we talk about United, you have roughly more than 40 million lives, you go quickly through the mathematics of that. We basically have shared that their spend \u2013 laboratory spend is north of $7 billion in that regard.","If you look at the two large nationals, it\u2019s still a minority. It\u2019s still the opportunity given the trend in general in healthcare is to move more of those higher cost, more expensive laboratory volumes to us. And so what we\u2019re detailing right now is precisely that. We\u2019re knocking on the doors of many \u2013 thousands of customers, Brian. And they have many laboratories and many of those laboratories aren\u2019t the two large nationals, but there are many others. And in some cases, they have those laboratories because we were not in network with United.","They no longer need those laboratories to serve them and therefore, those supporters are big opportunities. So we need to think about this not just between us and the other large national but more importantly, the opportunity to really continue to gain share, particularly for the regional portion of this market.","Brian Tanquilut","I appreciate. Thanks Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Lisa Gill","Great. Thanks and good morning.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Lisa.","Lisa Gill","Good morning. In your prepared comments, when talking about United, you talked about value-based program. When we think about the contracting for the new relationship, is it a traditional lab relationship when we think about being paid for the req? Or are you seeing changes in the way that your contracting around value-based programs? That\u2019s my first question. And then secondly, if that\u2019s not the case, can you help us understand what some of the opportunities are around value-based programs, especially with United and Aetna as you think about the new contracts?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So Lisa, it is a traditional relationship. We\u2019re paid for activity. Generally, obviously, there\u2019s some portions where they\u2019re fully insured where they have an HMO plan. But for the most part, this is a traditional fee-for-service contract. The difference is that the rate is variable dependent on our performance. So when we talk about value-based contracting, and as I referenced earlier, there is incentive payments that we can earn by saving the money. When I say saving them, I\u2019m talking about not just the United but obviously, the healthcare system and especially the patient.","So there\u2019s an awful lot of work going to high-cost providers. Some of it\u2019s because they have significantly higher prices. So we\u2019ve talked about hospitals and physician-owned laboratories but even some regional players. The other thing is that the payers are becoming increasingly aware that we don\u2019t all conduct ourselves in the same way. So price is one thing but the level of activity for a patient with for a patient with a given condition is also a driver. So you can have some labs that might have lower pricing with same pricing as we do but they\u2019re actually charging more because there\u2019s more activity for a given condition.","So really, the focus around what is the total cost per interaction with a patient in saving money on that by doing things medically appropriate at a good price. And to the extent that, that saves money for the system and overall stakeholder, some of that will come back to us. So there\u2019s incentives for us. A lot more detail will come down the road. We believe that, around the middle of next year or maybe a little ahead of that, United will talk about their preferred network and what some of the conditions are to be a preferred provider. But also some of the structures, including things that we are hopeful about including planned benefit design, where there is actually incentives for patients and others in the decision process financially to drive things towards that preferred network because that preferred network will be at the highest quality and the best value of any of the options within the network.","So that\u2019s about what we can share right now. And we\u2019re very excited about it because that is different from, historically, where we would get a network and to a large extent, it would be kind of good luck, I hope you do well because you have great value. In this case, United and certainly we\u2019re talking with other payers about some of the relationships actually is going to be partnering with us, working to drive that, not just sitting on the sidelines and opening we do all of that on our own.","Lisa Gill","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then secondly, you did comment on the Walmart relationship but is there any update on or any other retail relationships that you have the market?","Steve Rusckowski","Well, first of all, Safeway continues to go very well. We\u2019ve said that we\u2019re approaching 200 stores. The results in those stores have been great. So we\u2019re very encouraged there. Second is we continue to build out the presence in Walmart. And the number will be a significantly higher than 12 stores, I can assure you of that. And yes, it\u2019s putting a draw stations in, but it\u2019s also providing better healthcare, more healthcare services, with what we call extended healthcare services.","The conversation has become very broad and deep. Matter of fact, today, I\u2019m meeting with a very Senior Executive from Walmart about that about that opportunity. Our JV and specifically Walmart is doing in the healthcare. So we continue to build that out. And then third is we are testing. We\u2019re doing some pilots with some other retailers. As we mentioned in the past, we\u2019ve done work with CBS in the Mediclinic\u2019s with their pending potential merger with Aetna. We have great relationship with Aetna, we have a great relationship with CBS. The opportunity that they see also is what we\u2019ve been talking about here. So we\u2019re optimistic of working more productivity potentially with CBS and Aetna as they expand the potential merger with those two companies as well. So a lot in front of us. We have the right strategy, we\u2019re executing it and we\u2019re making a lot of progress.","Lisa Gill","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. You may ask you question.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey Steve, just wanted to follow-up on your consumer comments to Lisa\u2019s question. I guess, as we think about it big picture and holistically, over time, how much do you think all of these consumer initiatives can really add to your growth, whether it\u2019s to volume or revenue?","Steve Rusckowski","Well, we think \u2013 if you take a step back and look at where we\u2019re going. Our access with United would be greater than 90%. So we ought to remove the obstacles of not being in network with many of the majority health plans throughout the United States. And in the big states, as we mentioned, when we announced united relationship, the big states of New York, Texas, Florida and California, our access is greater than 95%, so a very strong access. So when we have access, we have an opportunity to compete for laboratory services and accounts. So that\u2019s number one. So great access, it\u2019s improving every day.","Second is the consumer is becoming increasingly important, particularly as employers have pushed more of the cost in healthcare to consumers. Consumers, patients are asking questions of what they could do to lower their out-of-pocket cost and also serve themselves in a better way. And so our consumer strategy addresses that, that is making sure that we have a great experience for that patient and the consumer. So many aspects are factored into that. One is what we\u2019ve done with our electronic, our e-tools, we call it MyQuest. We not only have over 5 million registered users, the application continues to get stronger every day.","You now can get to lab results, you can schedule an appointment. You could see late times in a Patient Service Center throughout any area you\u2019re in and there will be more to come. So that\u2019s exciting, looking more and more like a contemporary consumer application every day. Second, our access gets better and better. We\u2019re refreshing over Patient Service Centers. You will see that if you go into a number of your Patient Service Center throughout the United States and then we augment that with the access through retailers, so we\u2019ll have more retail-like settings, making it much more physically easy for consumers to go to Quest Diagnostics.","Third is we\u2019ll have products. And we have taken our experience in Arizona and also in Colorado, in Missouri with the direct-to-consumer offering. We now believe that\u2019s close to 20 states that we can go direct to consumers. We\u2019re working on driving that solution there\u2019ll be more to come in that regard in the fall. And with all that, when you take a step back and you say when the physician eventually knows that we\u2019re on network and they ask their patient, who would you like to go to, Quest or someone else? They remember that great experience. We have experiences as far as their data.","And they also know that it\u2019s not ordered by the physicians, they can order product directly from us like a check up on their cholesterol or their diabetes and hemoglobin A1c. So we think directionally, it\u2019s going to help us gaining share in the marketplace because healthcare is becoming increasingly more of a consumer marketplace.","Kevin Ellich","Got you. That\u2019s super helpful, Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Kevin Ellich","And then just a quick follow-up on the headwind that you called out earlier on the call, hep C, drug testing, vitamin D. What \u2013 did that have any impact on your \u2013 or what impact did it have on your revenue per requisition, if any?","Mark Guinan","Yes, really not anything substantive. I mean, those businesses are within the same that cover the overall revenue per req.","Kevin Ellich","Sounds good. Thanks, Mark.","Mark Guinan","Yeah, the one difference is obviously, when you get denials that\u2019s going to have a negative impact. So when you don\u2019t and the tests aren\u2019t ordered like in a hep C case, then it kind of has a neutral impact. But certainly, when we do work and then get denied, obviously, that\u2019s a headwind to revenue per req.","Kevin Ellich","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. You next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Mark Guinan","Hi, Dan.","Dan Leonard","Hello. Just one question on the pacing of M&A. So how much of a catalyst you think UnitedHealthcare contract is going to be by itself with its value-based components? And how quickly do you think that could accelerate some of the discussions you\u2019re having with healthcare system CEOs?","Steve Rusckowski","Well, the first catalyst is PAMA, okay? So PAMA is a substantial change for hospitals renting outreach businesses. So in many hospital system outreach businesses, their Medicare mix is 25%, 30%, so not insignificant. And when they\u2019re looking at essentially a 30% cut over three years, it\u2019s a notable difference. That\u2019s number one.","Second is they are seeing what\u2019s happening with United and also with Aetna. And they there are hearing that what those two large nationals have done will carry over to the rest of the health insurance market place. So they\u2019re realizing there will be pressure on their commercial race going forward for ancillary services and in this case, laboratory services. So with all that, so long as \u2013 we\u2019ve already \u2013 we\u2019ve always had great access around this \u2013 talking to them around their last strategy, but it is accelerating the pace of them considering their options going forward.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. You may ask you question.","Mark Massaro","Hey thanks guys. So your large lab competitor will be coming in that network lab provider to Aetna beginning in 2018. Is there anything your team can or need to do to defend your share of that business? And then secondly, do you expect a resolution from the PAMA lawsuit perhaps in Q3?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So first of all, we\u2019re actively detailing out account by account what we need to do. The way we broadly think about is in three categories. One, we have great accounts. And account \u2013 a client might be using an old laboratory that they have to, because we work with the United, and we\u2019re going directly for those accounts and we\u2019ll try to flip those as quickly as possible. So as I said earlier, we\u2019ve left the blocks and we\u2019re running. And we\u2019re detailing our thousands of accounts throughout United States with our sales force and with our regional teams.","Number two, there is accounts kind of a mixed model where they\u2019re using multiple labs. And now where we have much more of significant share of their laboratory volume because we\u2019re back in network, it\u2019s an opportunity where they potentially get to a tipping point, and we potentially could become the majority of their lab service providers. So we have a number of accounts that the categories that way.","And the third category as we\u2019ve outlined is, in some cases, we are not the majority in our another national competitor has more share. And we\u2019re also detailing out those to make sure we defend what we deliver, our value that we deliver everyday is quite good, our quality gets better, our service performance is outstanding, our consumer strategy is resonating. And so we think we have a very, very strong requisition \u2013 value proposition to defend that piece of our marketplace as well.","Operator","Are you ready for the next question?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. That comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. You may ask the question.","Ann Hynes","Hi, good morning.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ann.","Mark Guinan","Good morning.","Ann Hynes","Just a couple of follow-up questions. One is, your DSOs are up year-over-year four or five days and then up sequentially, is that due to acquisitions? Or is that a lot to do with increased denials for the vitamin D in the drug monitoring testing?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So Ann, the denials are not increasing our DSOs. The denials we don\u2019t recognize revenue. So what\u2019s really driving it is handful of things, one of them is we\u2019re doing a significant laboratory conversion in one of our major labs and billing just ends up being a little more delayed. It\u2019s a rhythm of things that we\u2019ve done over time. It\u2019s nothing to be concerned about. In fact, if you look at the aging of the DSOs, the profile has not really changed. So if you look at the key metric and what proportion of our DSOs are over 90 days, it hasn\u2019t changed even though the DSOs have gone up. So this is just a temporary spike and something that we\u2019re not concerned at all about and very confident that we\u2019re going to hit our $1.3 billion operating cash flow guidance that we provided.","Ann Hynes","Okay. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about you think the growth will accelerate in the second half and you\u2019re confident, you\u2019ll make your guidance. So is that driven by acquisitions? Or do you think that organic growth will improve from the 0.5% that you reported this quarter?","Mark Guinan","So our organic growth will markedly improve. We walked through the drivers. Obviously, it\u2019s an easier compare so that\u2019s part of it. We just to remind everybody about that, the majority of that compares in Q3, but we had a little bit of impact in Q4.","So each of the quarters are going to get some lift from that. We mentioned, both Steve and I, that we have some professional laboratory services deals that we feel are very close. That\u2019s organic. And we\u2019re expecting to get some volume for that in the back of the year, with that accelerating sequentially. And then the actions that we talked about that we\u2019ve taken around prescription drug monitoring and vitamin D denials, where we\u2019ve gotten some of those addressed, and we\u2019re optimistic that a couple others are in the cusp that they will help as well.","And then of course, as we near the entry to the United contract, we would expect that some of that volume will flip over a little bit early. So when you put all of those pieces together, that\u2019s why we\u2019re highly confident. So we\u2019re not depending on executed M&A but obviously, to the extent that we do some deals between now and the end of the year that would just be additional upside.","Ann Hynes","Okay, great. And just one last test. With the hepatitis C testing, I think you highlighted that the drug monitoring testing and the vitamin D should come back once you work with the payers, but the hep C won\u2019t. Is that a huge percentage of volume as a percentage hep C testing?","Mark Guinan","No. It\u2019s not a huge percent. It\u2019s a small percentage. But every several million dollars makes a difference in quarterly performance. I think a lot of that is behind us, because we\u2019re not experts, but we believe that AbbVie has more than half the market already. And therefore, a lot of that is already behind us.","Steve Rusckowski","And the other part is \u2013 there\u2019s two parts to what we call a hep C care, which is the testing we do if you\u2019ve been prescribed the drug that is going to decline. Second part is the screening piece of this. So we did see a small decline in the growth rate, and we\u2019re hopeful there\u2019s still a tremendous opportunity in front of us that we\u2019re going to work with the pharmaceutical companies to continue to build on the awareness necessary in the marketplace. Because as I said in my prepared remarks, there\u2019s still a majority of baby boomers, 70 million of us, that still need to be screened. So that\u2019s slow as well in Q2. And we\u2019re hopeful in the back half with some of the work we\u2019re doing to build awareness with pharma, that should pick up as well.","Mark Guinan","But just to be clear, it\u2019 still growing, it just didn\u2019t grow as fast.","Steve Rusckowski","Grow fast. Yes.","Ann Hynes","Okay. Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Steve Rusckowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Hopped on a little bit late, so I\u2019m not sure if you gave this, but do you have a baseline of how much drug monitoring, hep C and vitamin D all in makeup of total requisitions? Just a rough ballpark?","Mark Guinan","Ralph, we haven\u2019t provided that. We have other franchises, other testing segments that are obviously a lot larger. Certainly, our chemistry panels and our lipid panels and so on. I think these are already \u2013 obviously areas, not Vitamin D as much, but the Hep C and prescription monitoring are major growth drivers for us. And prescription drug monitoring, as Steve mentioned and I did as well, continues to be a growth driver. It\u2019s just slowed somewhat because of these policy changes that we, again, feel are inappropriate.","It really has to do everything with \u2013 around covering definitive testing after screening. The traditional practice has been, if you do a screen and it\u2019s positive, you move automatically or revert to the definitive on the same day with the same sample. And some of the payers for reasons that we are pushing back on deciding they would change that and make the patient come back in for a second trial. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s medically appropriate.","So that was a big headwind in PDM why we slowed our growth. And then on hep C, certainly, we expect that to continue to grow. It\u2019s a nice business, but certainly, it\u2019s nowhere near some of the routine testing or other requisition volume that we see within our business.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. So what we did is we outlined three areas that caused us to have less than what we had expected in Q2. We started working already on Q2 on some of the remedies for that slow down. And so the ones that we outlined particularly around prescription drug monitoring, the growth rate was strong but not nearly as strong in the past, and again, what we talked about with Vitamin D.","So we\u2019ve already started to work on these in Q2 that will carry over and will have some rebound in the portion of this. But what we want to do is provide visibility where we thought we were going to do \u2013 have a stronger performance in Q2, we did not. And we outlined those in the three that we provided to you.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And is there anything separately \u2013 is there anything with the timing of the UNH contract we need to be aware of? In other words, I know the contract starts Jan 1, 2019. So you remain out-of-network for this year with UNH and sort of still charge the out-of-network rate or have you agreed to sort of annual network rate sooner even without the open network?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So I\u2019m not going to comment on any specifics around rates, but we remain out-of-network, we\u2019ve been adjudicated out-of-network for the balance of the year. And then as we said, starting January 1, we\u2019ll be in for majority of their plans, there\u2019s still some HMO plans that we are working for the details. But for the vast majority of United, we\u2019re going to be in network as of January 1.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Last one if I could squeeze it in. Just \u2013 and I know you\u2019re going to guide for 2019 at this point, but can you give us a directional sense of margin as we think about next year? There\u2019s a lot of moving parts, obviously, with PAMA headwinds, UNH coming on, Aetna opening up, the investments you\u2019re making. In your mind, does that mean that make there\u2019s sort of a revenue boost and we should think about margins as generally flat? Or do you think you can get margin expansion or vice versa? Do you think there could be some margin contraction as we think just directionally of the margin trend for 2019?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So Ralph, as I am sure you would expect, I can\u2019t comment on 2019 in any way specifically. But what I did talk about was on a multi-year basis that we would grow earnings, not earnings per share, but earnings faster than the top line over multi-year. So certainly, from a given year-to-year, that formula might be a little bit different. So we \u2013 that obviously implies continued margin expansion.","Now margin \u2013 net margin, so obviously with tax reform, we took advantage of that and made some investments, which actually reduced our \u2013 before tax margin slightly this year, had some impact on that. But we would expect to continue that over multi-year look, and we\u2019ll give an update on that in November on our Investor Day.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right, thank you.","Steve Rusckowski","Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your support, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call.

During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.","A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.","Now here is Steve Rusckowski.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Over the last 2 months, I've had an opportunity to meet with many of you. And for those of you that I have not had an opportunity to meet, I'd like to spend just a minute explaining why I joined Quest Diagnostics. First of all, this is a company that has an impact on healthcare. We touch about 150 million patients each year, and I believe there's an opportunity to touch more lives.","Second, this is the high-quality company in many ways. Healthcare professionals particularly have high regard for Quest Diagnostics. And then finally and most importantly, I believe there is a significant opportunity to drive shareholder value.  So over the past 2 months, I've met with many of our stakeholders. I've met with employees, customers and investors. I visited many of our operations, and I'm rounding out my perspective on Quest Diagnostics, where the company is today, and how it can grow stronger. I really appreciate the feedback I've received. Now I'd like to share the results for the second quarter.","In our Q1 call, we cautioned that despite our positive volume performance, the underlying market conditions remain sluggish, and that it was premature to conclude that the market was recovering. Our caution was warranted. In the second quarter, our volume growth slowed. Sluggish market conditions continue to affect our business, and we saw softness across many of our businesses.  We also could have executed better in the quarter. For example, we did not see the benefits we expected from actions we have taken to drive revenue growth in areas like women's health and the benefit from the narrowing of certain health plan networks. As a result, we intensified our actions to manage our costs, allowing us to deliver bottom line growth and margin expansion of the quarter and maintaining our earnings outlook for the year.","Specifically, despite essentially flat revenues, we increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 or 4.5%. We expanded adjusted margins by 70 basis points to 18.4%, and we generated $251 million of operating cash flow. Clearly, it is imperative that we continue to be vigilant in improving productivity, reducing costs and improving quality. We are executing a plan in this regard, and we now call it Invigorate. It is expected to deliver $500 million in run rate cost savings versus 2011 as we exit 2014.  And I will share with you that we are firmly on track. Well, this is a top priority for me. From my first week on the job, I've been personally involved in Invigorate. I've shared with the organization that I'm personally chairing this effort. I've met with the teams focused on the biggest priority, the areas like lab operations, procurement, general administration, IT, to name a few. We will continue to meet on a regular operating rhythm. Each of these teams are required to manage their projects with structured, disciplined and rigorous program management approaches, and I am assuring that proper resources are properly deployed to these efforts. Finally, I am challenging the teams to additional -- to look for additional opportunities and to accelerate the pace at which we implement the program.","An opportunity we've already acted on was to accelerate the launch of a voluntary retirement program offered to certain qualified employees. We expect this program to deliver $40 million in annualized cost savings, a portion of which will be realized this year, with the full amount realized as we exit the first quarter of 2013. Now as we look at the market, we continue to see weakness in the near term. We believe that this industry will grow 4% to 5% in a normal economy, and that Quest Diagnostics should be able to grow at or above the market growth rate. One thing that we believe will enable growth is the Affordable Care Act, which we expect will have a positive net impact on the company in the industry's growth rate beginning in 2014. The act will increase covered lives, which will drive diagnostic testing volume. But at the same time, many of the newly insured will be covered by insurance products with lower price points and, therefore, the full impact on our business is still unfolding.","In parallel with Invigorate, we have work to do to restore growth and be in a stronger position when the market recovers. Over the past 2 months, we have been conducting a thorough review of our businesses and our operations. This effort includes an evaluation of our selling and marketing efforts, how we prioritize our innovation investments, and our ability to leverage our unique assets to bring diagnostic solutions to the market. We do have some good examples of what we need to replicate to grow this business. Specifically, our expanding prescription drug monitoring business, our introduction of neurological tests at Athena, and our launch of new companion diagnostics like STRATIFY JCV test are a few good growth examples. So I look forward to sharing with you later this year the growth plans that results from this process.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Bob for more detailed analysis of the numbers. Bob?","Robert A. Hagemann","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Q2 revenues of $1.9 billion reflect growth of 20 basis points over the prior year. In the second quarter, comps were more challenging than in the first quarter. Specifically, we anniversaried the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, and did not experience the favorable weather impact we saw in the first quarter.  These 2 factors combined contributed just over 5% growth in Q1. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Q2 revenues were down about 0.5% from the prior year. This compares to about 1% underlying growth in Q1.","As Steve noted, market softness continued to impact our business. We didn't execute as we had planned and, as a result, our volume growth slowed. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were about 1% for the quarter, all attributable to volume. Revenue per requisition was essentially unchanged from the prior year, with reimbursement pressure offset by favorable test mix and an increased number of tests per requisition. Recall that year-over-year growth in revenue per requisition we reported in Q1 was principally due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera, and we have anniversaried that benefit this quarter.","Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 5% in the quarter, in line with the growth of the last 2 quarters. Q2 revenues in our nonclinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and healthcare IT, were about 5% below the prior year. As you've heard, despite what was an essentially flat top line, we expanded margins -- earnings and margins in the quarter as a result of disciplined expense management and beginning to realize the benefits of our Invigorate program. Adjusted EPS of $1.17 was $0.05 above the prior year, and adjusted operating income at 18.4% was 70 basis points above the prior year. The restructuring, integration and CEO transition costs totaling about $16 million reduced reported operating income by 80 basis points and reported EPS by $0.06.","Last year's second quarter included $20 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, which reduced reported operating income by a full percentage point and reported EPS by $0.10.  Our Invigorate program continues on-track to deliver roughly $100 million in run rate savings as we exit this year. This represents about 20% of our $500 million goal, with the remainder expected in 2013 and 2014. As you heard from Steve, we're continuing to evaluate opportunities, which could potentially increase our goal for this program.","As we previously shared, common themes across most areas include standardizing systems, processes and databases, increased use of automation and technology and centralizing the selective outsourcing. As we noted last quarter, over the next few years, this will require some increased level of capital spending to standardize systems and upgrade IT infrastructure.  In addition, as we disclosed in last quarter's 10-Q, our high-level estimates of charges we expect to incur over the next several years in connection with this program are between $100 million and $175 million, consisting primarily of employee separation costs, facility-related closure costs, asset impairments and systems conversion and integration costs.","As Steve mentioned, in connection with the Invigorate initiative, we have offered a voluntary retirement program to certain qualifying employees. We estimate this program will contribute approximately $40 million of annualized savings once fully implemented, which we expect by the first quarter of next year. The program will allow us to reduce the size of our workforce, reduce our average wage bill and update the skills of the workforce. In connection with the program, we expect to record charges estimated at about $50 million over the course of the next several quarters as employees leave the workforce. An area which is already benefiting from Invigorate is billing and collections. We have consistently produce industry-leading metrics in this area, but still have room to improve. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 3.5% in the quarter and reflects improvement from both Q1 and in the prior year. DSOs were 44 days, unchanged from last quarter.","Cash from operations was $251 million in the quarter compared to $60 million in the prior year. Note last year's cash flow was reduced by the net impact of the Medi-Cal settlement payment.  Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter compared to $40 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 882,000 common shares at an average price of $56.70 for a total of $50 million. We also repaid $112 million of outstanding debt in connection with our stated objective to delever by $500 million to $700 million this year.","Turning to guidance. Based on our performance in the first half and our latest view of the market, we now expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenue to grow between 1% and 2%; operating income to approximate 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion; capital expenditures to approximate $200 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.45 and $4.60.  Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Thanks, Bob. So in closing, we delivered earnings growth and margin expansion in the quarter despite flat top line growth. We are accelerating our efforts to improve productivity, reduce costs, improve quality and restore top line growth. I want to reaffirm our commitment to increasing shareholder returns and improving our ROIC. This includes our intention to return the majority of our free cash flow to investors upon achieving our targeted leverage ratio.","In the near term, we do not expect to complete any large acquisitions. However, we will continue to consider value-creating, fold-in acquisitions.  We are being thoughtful and disciplined in developing our plan to restore top line growth and improve shareholder returns, and are performing a thorough review of our businesses and operations as part of this process.  I'll share with you that I believe we're moving with the appropriate speed and intend to share our plan with you in the fall. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Tom Gallucci with Lazard.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, I have 2 questions. Steve, when you had met with some of the analysts recently in a breakfast in New York, I think, you had mentioned that you were sort of meeting with a lot of different constituencies within the company and outside the company. And I think, specifically, you had talked about maybe having some upcoming meetings with some of the payers like in Aetna, for example. The lack of pricing sort of, of late has stood out. So can you discuss any takeaways maybe that you've had thus far with your interactions with major payers? And how they are viewing you and what your -- what, again, your key takeaways may be so far?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, sure. I appreciate the question, Tom. First of all, I have done that. I've met with a number of payers. And specifically what I'd share with you is they're thinking about our business and specifically us to help them manage their cost structure. And yes, that will be a discussion around price at some point. But more importantly, more at a strategic level, is what we can do to help manage plans together to improve quality and lower cost. And specifically, some of that conversation has lended itself to what we have from information, what they have from information and how we can provide more helpful insight into managing overall cost with the lives that they're managing. In parallel with that, they're also understanding that the U.S. market will go through tremendous change with the Affordable Care Act. They're trying to prepare themselves for the change. We obviously are preparing ourselves for the change. And in that context, they believe that they need to do a better job of working with us on narrowing their networks for what would they provide. So therefore, they hope to work more closely with us to make sure that we work together because we're both incented to do that. So the conversations I've had so far, Tom, have been very, very good conversations with the spirit of cooperation. We are working together to do what's right for this industry, improving quality, lower cost and at the same time, we find some opportunities to help our businesses.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my other quick question was just on healthcare reform. Sorry, I jumped on a couple of seconds late so if you covered it, I apologize. But just wanted to see if you had any takeaways at this stage on sort of how you think about the impact and what some of the moving parts are for Quest in particular?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so healthcare reform, the Affordable Care Act, we do expect to have a -- excuse me, a net positive impact on our company and the industry growth rates. And we believe this will start in 2014. First of all, the number of lives will increase. We know that, and that will drive volumes. That's good news. But at same time and what's not clear yet is what will happen with those newly insured lives and what insurance products they will move to. And our sense is that some, if not a large majority, will go to lower-price-point products and, therefore, it's not quite clear at this point how this will all unfold. So we have not put together specific indication of what it will mean for our business. We're watching it carefully. There are some positive sides of it, and there's clearly some negative sides of it. And in collective perspective, it will have an effect. We believe, again, it's net positive impact for our business and for the industry, but it still has to be cleared up over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Steve, just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the reimbursement pressure that you saw this quarter. Is that coming from any specific contracts? Or what's going on, on that front?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, first of all, we don't share specifics on what's going on with our contracts, but we have shared in the past that we are seeing pressure on price. And let me give the microphone over to Bob to share some of the specifics of what we have shared in the past and how that is folded through our numbers.","Robert A. Hagemann","Kevin, yes, I would tell you that this is nothing new. I mean, we've been talking about increased reimbursement pressure for a while, and what we're seeing was fully contemplated in the guidance that we put together at the end of the year. So there's no change from our perspective there. And essentially what you're seeing is that reimbursement pressure now is being offset though by a number of tests per requisition and a continued favorable test mix. And as we go forward, we expect that those dynamics will continue, continued reimbursement pressure to a large degree offset, if not fully offset, by test per rec and positive mix.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sure. And then, I guess, since I have you, Bob, just wondering what are your thoughts on the Medicare pricing headwinds that you face in '13? And also the impact of the new Molecular Diagnostic codes that are likely to go in effect in '13?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Kevin, the Medicare change for 2013 is estimated to be about 5% or so. I think we've shared with folks in the past that we've got roughly $1 billion in Medicare business. The vast majority of that reimbursed off of the clinical lab fee schedules. So we're looking at a $40 million to $50 million impact next year. And as you think about that, we're hoping that much of that now is going to be offset by the actions that we've taken at the Voluntary Severance Program, which kick in -- fully kick in by the time we exit the first quarter of next year. And with respect to the impact of the changes around Molecular Diagnostics and the new coding there, we don't expect that to have a significant impact to us. There are a number of codes which are impacted, but the total revenues that are subject to those changes are less than 5% of our total revenues. And as we've said in the past, the objective there is really to get better visibility into what's being billed, making sure that what's being billed is medically necessary. And we do feel very good about the tests that we have in our profiles, and the medical necessity attached to them.","Kathleen Valentine","And Kevin, as you know, CMS hasn't determined yet how they're going to reimburse for these new molecular codes and also which fee schedule they will be placed on. And at this stage, based on the meetings they had earlier this week in Washington, it sounds like we won't hear anything definitively until later in the fall, some time on that.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then just one last quick one for Steve. As you've gone around the company and looked at the various business units and met with different people, just wondering if you've had a chance to think about some of the other businesses like India in the point-of-care, HemoCue business. If you have any opinions on those fronts, we'd love to hear what you have to think or have to say?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure, well, I appreciate that. And what I've said in my opening remarks is that we are conducting a thorough review of all businesses and operations. And we have nothing to share beyond that today. What I've also shared is that sometime in the fall, we will be giving an update of our strategy and in that update we'll give you more forward-looking visibility and transparency of what we're thinking about in terms of restoring growth, improving our margins in going forward for the company.","Operator","Our next question is from Dane Leone with Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","I was actually just kind of looking for some clarity on the revenue line and maybe some additional commentary on the Athena and Celera business. Maybe I just kind of misheard, I think, maybe Bob's comments. But it seems like the product line may have declined year-over-year because the revenue per rec was flat, volume was up, but overall revenues were flat. Can you just maybe add some color or provide some clarity on that?","Robert A. Hagemann","Dane, let me try and give you some more color on it. Year-over-year, consolidated revenues were essentially flat, up 20 basis points versus the prior year. In that, the clinical testing business was up about 1% or so. The other businesses, which make up about 10% of our revenues, which include clinical trials testing, risk assessment, the point-of-care business, the healthcare IT business, they in total were down about 5% versus the prior year. And when you look at the clinical testing business, the year-over-year revenue improvement was principally driven by volume. And as we indicated, the revenue per rec was essentially flat year-over-year.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay. Was there -- I guess, the product growth had been additive up until this point for the last couple of quarters. Well, what kind of changed there?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Dane, the principal contribution to product revenue growth that we had in the last several quarters was the result of the operations that we -- the products operations we acquired with Celera, which anniversaried this quarter.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay. So okay, that's helpful. And just on Athena, the -- is that business still growing much higher than the regular business? I was just -- it closed at the end of February last year, so it still had -- thinking about the higher growth rate of that business, maybe it could have added something to revenue per rec this quarter? I was just curious if there was anything there and maybe the Celera business as well.","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, Athena is continuing to perform very well, growing nicely, highly profitable business. And Celera, as you know, there were multiple pieces to that business. There was the products business, which continues to perform solidly. And then there was BHL, which as we noted is in a turnaround and we're still working through that, although I would tell you that we're making some progress there as we integrate that now and start to leverage the infrastructure that Quest Diagnostics has to offer to Celera.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then a final question for me. Just looking at the kind of working capital inventories and accounts receivable, you kind of like edged-up year-over-year even though revenues were flat. Is there anything to read into that or is it just timing?","Robert A. Hagemann","It's just timing. If you look at DSOs, they were essentially flat. We're actually down a day from year end. And if you look historically at how receivables themselves track from Q1 to Q2, that's pretty -- from year-end to Q2, that's pretty consistent.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions here. The first one is on healthcare reform. And Steve, what percent of your book currently do you estimate is from the uninsured population today?","Robert A. Hagemann","Ricky, this is Bob. It's a small portion of our total revenues. If you look at what we describe as patient billed revenues, it's in the range of 5% to 10% of our total revenues. Roughly half of that is from the uninsured. The other half is really deductibles and co-pays and things like that.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And when we -- when you think about the opportunity, do you expect to basically see a similar share gains that reflect your overall exposure to government business? Or do you think that you have an opportunity here to gain share above that kind of, that 15% government that you currently...","Stephen H. Rusckowski","And as we said, we do believe it's a net positive impact for our company. And as you know, this is still unfolding and so we're trying to understand it better and better every day. We'll -- there'll be more lives. There'll be more people getting tested. But the question is how will they be insured? And then, specifically, how does that factor into our business? And we have not provided a specific effect on the business because it's not quite clear yet. So can't provide you any more transparency or visibility beyond that at this point.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then a top line question, and I apologize if you have discussed it already. I just had to jump on a little bit late. When we think about the top line growth for the second half of the year, your guidance implied some continued decline. It sounds as if your view is based on pricing trends in the second half the year. Can you share with us your views on kind of like volume trends in the second half and how can you drive volume growth with your internal initiative?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so first of all, what we did share is that sluggish market conditions did continue in the second quarter. It did affect our business. And in fact, in Q2, we did see the volumes -- the volume growth slow. And we saw slowness across many of our businesses. And what I also shared in my opening comments is we do have an opportunity to execute better. We missed some opportunities in Q2, and then we specifically called out that our women's health business could have executed better. And specifically, we have some opportunities around narrowing of certain health plan networks, and we didn't see the impact of that in Q2. And so what I have shared is that in the process of building our plan going forward, we do need to restore growth. And so we are looking at the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs. We're looking at our investments. We're looking at how we product-ize solutions to the marketplace, and that work will be helping us to some extent in the second half, but we still need some help from the market.","Robert A. Hagemann","And Ricky, just a little bit more color on your question. If you look at the implied guidance for the second half, at the midpoint, it implies that revenues are sort of flat for the most part. At the high-end, it implies revenues are up about 1% and at the low end, it implies they're down about 1%.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And at that high-end where revenues are going to be up 1%, based on your pricing comments, should we assume that most of the growth is going to come from volume in the second half?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, again, as you know we don't give guidance relative to price or volume. And at this point, we don't necessarily see that changing. Although I don't think that the dynamics in the second half are going to be materially different than the dynamics in the first half.","Operator","Your next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Gavin Weiss, in for Lisa Gill. You mentioned your conversations you've been having lately with payers. Do any of these conversations include discussions around different payment models? Or is it still really around a fee-for-service?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, there is conversation about different payment models. We are going through this transition and the question is as we go forward with the Affordable Care Act...","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","I apologize. If we're ready, we can go on to the next question. We do have a question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Security.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Steve, for a long time, there was pricing stability. And it then seems like 5 to 6 years ago, the industry started to see pressure on price. I mean, given what you've seen so far, do you think there is a path back towards pricing stability and what are the challenges with getting there?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, well, first of all, that's quite an interruption. So Gary, good question. And frankly, as Bob said, we don't give guidance on price. The market is unfolding with all the different changes, and we have this mix issue going on. So we're managing it carefully. There's no question in our mind though that we need to be vigilant on productivity improvements, reducing costs and improving our operations and that's why I've been personally involved in Invigorate and will continue to be involved. We need to improve our cost structure, and that will help us offset whatever price erosion we see going forward. So Bob, I don't know if you'd like to add to that?","Robert A. Hagemann","The only thing I would add, Gary, is we're going to continue to be price disciplined as we go forward. And as Steve mentioned, the payers and our other partners are looking for ways that we can work with them to reduce their total costs. Pricing is an element of that, but there are other ways as well that we can help them manage their costs down, and we expect to use all of those opportunities.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, maybe, if I could ask it another way, Steve. I know -- without you guys commenting on price, specifically, but more generally -- with the large labs being the low-cost provider of the service, significantly less in some cases than hospitals, what's putting the pressure on the price? How did -- what was the catalyst that started the pricing pressure, and how do we get away from that?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, there's price pressure in this whole industry as you know, so the catalyst is healthcare in general. Healthcare costs from a provider perspective continues to rise and that's the challenge with health plans. And they're trying to manage an aging population, sicker and sicker lives every year and, therefore, the -- and costs that continue to rise. So there's more pressure throughout this entire industry and as you know, we've been in this industry for over 28 years. That price pressure will continue. The question is how does that unfold and how does that relate to this market, specifically, with the changes that we see going forward? We are seeing people wanting to narrow their networks. Therefore, there should be more consolidation in the volumes around fewer suppliers of laboratory testing services that plays nicely into what we are all about and what this industry is all about. Second, is as hospital systems are acquiring physician practices, they're looking at what they need to do in terms of what of their capabilities are strategic and not strategic. And as they start to look at forming Accountable Care Organizations, what they do with their laboratory operations and they are starting to have more conversations with us in terms of how we can help them with laboratory management services, where we could potentially look at outsourcing, where we can look at reference testing. And so the future trend, despite price pressure, I think, lends itself to support the long-term normal growth rates we see in this industry. So I see some other dynamics that will help us offset some of the price pressure that we will see like the rest of the industry.","Robert A. Hagemann","And Gary, when we talk about price pressure, we're not talking exclusively about the commercial payers. As you see on the government side, there's continued reimbursement pressure. Medicare is a great example. The Medicaid -- each of the states is looking at how they can reduce their overall costs, and healthcare is a big element of their total cost and they're trying to manage it down. So it's not exclusively the commercial payers that we're talking about when we talk about reimbursement pressure.","Operator","And our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","There's been articles on benefit design, and you certainly talked about narrowing networks and particularly, we've seen or heard about changes at Aetna that could potentially push more volume your way. I guess, did you recently renegotiate with Aetna beyond the extension from a couple of years ago sort of in exchange for some of the narrowing network there?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, we don't comment on specific renegotiations or discussions with our health plan partners. But we do believe there is an opportunity to work with them to narrow their network, and you brought up Aetna as an example of that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then going back to sort of some of the discussion around reform, can you help us right now in terms of collection on the uninsured. What percentage of what you bill do you collect?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, Bob will handle that, yes.","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, one way of thinking about it is the majority of our bad debt, which this quarter was 3.5%, comes from patient bill. And about half of that bad debt is related to co-pays and deductibles for people that have insurance. The other half is related to the uninsured. That's the big opportunity that we have as part of healthcare reform. What we can get that down to, it's not clear at this point but certainly, there's a big opportunity to reduce that piece of the bad debt. But again, that's a little less than half of our overall bad debt.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But I guess I'm getting at -- do you have sort of an average price point for the uninsured today? What's that average price point?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, it's significantly higher than it is for the average that we have across the network. And if you look in our 10-Q, you'll see that the volumes associated with patient bill are -- the percentage of volumes associated with patient bill are about half of the revenues associated with patient bill. So it implies that the revenue per requisition is in the range of 2x or more the average revenue per requisition. So it's a very rich requisition, but it carries a significant bad debt attached to it.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Bob, just to run through the numbers though, is it fair to say that today, that you'd rather have an insured or uninsured patient walk through the door given net collectibility?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, yes, certainly from a collectibility standpoint, an uninsured patient is much more difficult. But yes, I'm not sure that at this point we're prepared to make a call as to what sort of patient we'd rather have walk through the door. We're happy to serve all patients.","Operator","Our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First off, I realize this is somewhat of a hypothetical question, but in the event that some of those CRA royalties do become material revenue streams, would you be able to comment on whether you'd let those flow through the P&L? Or would you try and seek to monetize those assets in another way?","Robert A. Hagemann","Look, I think that we would certainly consider monetizing future royalty streams. But yes, I think we'd have to have some better visibility as to what they are before we would do that. But certainly, it's something we would consider.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then Steve, if I could just maybe ask a question on the cost savings plan. If you could maybe bucket the low-hanging fruit as you see them across a couple of major areas: labor, supply chain and then maybe vendor pricing? Just trying to think about out how you see the best opportunities in the next couple of quarters to start realizing those savings.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, so I appreciate the question. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, I am personally spending a lot of time on this. And I've shared with some of you that you really need to think about this in 2 categories. Yes, there'll be some shorter-term opportunities that we're going after, and then there will be some harder opportunities that will require investment that will take a longer period of time. And we're looking at both. In the short run, we already mentioned that we're looking at productivity. Specifically, our Voluntary Severance Program that we put together was one of those options for us to look at being more productive where we can do that. So we selectively identified qualified individuals, and that will help us some in the short-term. Second, is we're continuously looking at productivity opportunities because a large portion of our cost structure is our wage bill. And therefore, we are very, very tight on any hire we make and specifically looking for opportunities to drive productivity. Now some of this, as you would expect, happens in our operational teams throughout the company. This is in lab operations, logistics operations, patient service centers. But also, what we are looking at is what we need to do in, let's just say, broadly defined general administration areas. And there will be some opportunities to look at becoming more efficient, if you will, with our cost structure of our overhead going forward. And I also commented to that I spent some time with the procurement team. We did see some opportunities show up in Q2 related to do doing a better job of managing our purchases from outside suppliers. It is the second category to a wage bill that we will see some near-term improvement in that we will see sooner rather than later, and that will continue throughout the period of Invigorate. And then finally, there's opportunities related to a number of improvement efforts that are happening at the grassroots level. There's a number of our regional labs that are working through improvement programs, and I could tell you the support for our employees to contribute to this effort is very, very remarkable. And we're seeing some nice short-term gains from small incremental improvements at the regional level. But if you take those and you add them all up, it's real numbers. And if you take those and extrapolate it throughout entire business, it's substantial. So we will those in the short run. But as I said, there's also some longer-term, re-engineering change management programs that we'll need to invest in, and that will be in the later part of the period of  Invigorate.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Last question, if I could, on capital allocation. You guys certainly continue to generate pretty healthy cash flow given a tough volume environment. So can you maybe update us on the board's latest thoughts regarding how that cash will be deployed? Last year you obviously hiked the dividend quite nicely. Is there a walk to the long-term dividend profile that you can give us here, the incremental update?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Absolutely, Bob will give you an update on that.","Robert A. Hagemann","Isaac, look, as we told you, this year our priority is to do some delevering to make sure that we can sustain the credit rating that we have. We believe that, that's critically important to us because at the end of the day, it allows us to minimize the overall cost of capital and ensure that we've got appropriate access in liquidity. So that's the priority now. As we've indicated though, beyond that, once we've gotten a delevering done, we expect to return a majority of the free cash flow to investors, whether it be through dividends or share repurchases. We did a pretty significant increase to the dividend this year. We'd expect that the dividend is going to grow with cash flows and earnings over time. And at this point, we're not prepared to make a commitment as to what the dividend rate will be. I think as we go into the fall and as we figure out what the strategy is going to be, that's going to drive the capital and allocation. So in the near term, no change; but you'll hear more about this in the fall when we come out and share with you some of the longer-term plans for the company.","Operator","Our next question is from Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Steve, I had a follow-up question for you on the sales infrastructure so if -- given the cost-cutting initiatives that you have in place, I'm just curious how you're thinking about the sales force and the patient service center infrastructure. And you talked, for example, about productivity and effectiveness. I'm curious if you can provide a little more color there? That will be helpful.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes. Thanks, Amanda. Well, first of all, everything's on the table, and we are focusing on improving our productivity and reducing cost. And in that respect, we're looking at every area which includes all overhead: overhead on the backs of people in our labs, overhead on the backs of our sales force, overhead in the backs of our patient service centers. So that is critical. We're also looking at improving the workflow of how we take a sample and then eventually collect cash. And Bob will share with you one example of how we feel pretty good about some progress we've made in our billing center. But specifically to the sales force, at the same time -- and I mentioned in my introductory comments, we do need to restore growth. And so we are -- and I am personally looking into how we have gone to market; what type of investments we've made in our sales and marketing efforts, and specifically, how that has contributed to what we have done so far; how we have executed against our plans so far; and what are the right investments for this company going forward to restore growth. I don't have specific comments to make in that regard as I speak. But I'll assure you that we'll make the appropriate investments in our sales force, in our go-to-market organizations to restore growth, which may mean that we'll take some of the freed up spending that we see in Invigorate and reinvest it in portions of our organization to help with restored growth, and that may mean our sales and marketing efforts. But it's too early to share with you specifics on that, but it's being reviewed as I speak with you today.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just another comment you made earlier is just about missed opportunities when it comes to narrowing networks and women's health. I'm curious if you could provide a little more color about specifically what was missed there and has that or will that change your strategy going forward in those 2 areas? Obviously, you've talked a lot about private payer conversations.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Well, let me take narrowing network. We do have an opportunity with some of our partners, our health plan partners to help them narrow the network, and we're working -- this a great example, working together with the health plans to get more volume and they see an opportunity in their cost structure, and we see an opportunity with our volumes to do that with them. We hoped for some in the second quarter, it did not materialize, but we still see it as a great opportunity going forward. And so that's what my comment was about, is that we hope there's some in the second quarter. And frankly, I think, if we executed it better, we would have got some pick-up in our volumes in the second quarter, but unfortunately, they did not materialize. But as I said, with -- in our view of our sales and marketing efforts, we will look at that and we will deliver more of that in the second half. And I'd like to turn it over to Bob in terms of his comments on women's health.","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, women's health is an area that we've seen as an opportunity. It's an area that's continued to grow. But yes, as we've stated earlier, we've had some product gaps, which we filled. And we expected that after having filled those product gaps, we'd be able to start to regrow that business at a faster rate. Again, that hasn't materialized yet, but we continue to see that as an opportunity. We continue to focus on it from both the sales side and the product offering side. And again, it's an area that, while we didn't execute as well than we would have liked in the second quarter, we believe that it will be an opportunity that will drive growth as we go forward and address some of the execution issues.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just had 2 relatively simple questions. First on the kind of sequential slowdown in volumes, are there any takeaways in terms of geography type of testing for this in specialty? Anything that's notable that you saw sequentially?","Robert A. Hagemann","Gary, nothing specific. Obviously, we don't comment on geographies, but as Steve mentioned in his remarks earlier, we saw a slowdown across most of our businesses. So it was relatively widespread. Nothing specific to point to.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on the growth and revenue per session, can you just remind us a little bit what's the driver behind that and it's specific -- again a specific type of physician specialty outside of primary care that's helping to drive that? Or what do you -- how do you view the sustainability of that trend?","Robert A. Hagemann","Well, certainly, physician specialists in the esoteric mix that they order contributes to improvements in revenue per requisition. But it's also the number of tests order per requisition, some of which we may think of as esoteric today, but ultimately are going to be routine, like Vitamin D, for example. The benefit of the growth in Vitamin D has really shown up in revenue per requisition to a large degree. That and other new tests that we introduce, in many cases, show up in revenue per requisition because they're ordered in conjunction with other tests. And that's an area that we believe will continue because we expect that the pace with which new tests are introduced will continue to accelerate over time.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I may have misspoken. I meant to ask about the number of tests per session or per requisition, but you kind of covered that. And is it fair to say that -- I mean, Vitamin D is still growing, but not nearly I would imagine at its growth rate we saw a year or 2 ago, is that correct?","Robert A. Hagemann","That's a very fair assessment. Yes, as you think about that, it had a really rapid ramp-up. It's become much more of a mature test at this point. And as a result, the growth rate just obviously slows down.","Operator","Our next question is from Sandy Draper with Raymond James.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All my questions have been asked and answered.","Operator","Our next question is from Derrick -- I'm sorry, Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So we've heard you comment a few times just on disappointing execution in the second quarter and in a number of areas. And I guess, my question, Steve, is just as you think about how you are setting expectations for the team and attempt to increase the accountability, can you just talk about some of the process changes you're making in running the company? And just how you sort of are managing that execution question as you move forward?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure, sure. First of all, in this review of businesses and operations, clearly, we need to look at do we have the right structure to execute any strategy we have in place. And we are looking at that. And then second is, I've been asked this before, clearly, you need to have the right leadership team in place to restore growth and improve our shareholder returns. And as everyone would expect, that's being considered as well. But specific to the approach, and I mentioned in my Invigorate comments, what I am bringing into the company is a disciplined structure and rigorous approach to deployment of strategy. And I gave the example of Invigorate, but I'll also share with you that will be my approach for restoring growth as well. So strategy is important, but it's also very important and I would argue more important to work on the deployment. And in my past experiences, what I will do going forward, and I'll share this in the fall, is we'll have a very structured rigorous deployment of each of the strategic programs we put in place, some of which will be around productivity gains and improving our cost structure going forward, but also will be equally put in place related to restoring growth. And related to that is once we agree what we're going to do, then we need to make sure we have the right proper plan that's properly resourced. So with that rigor, with that discipline and with that structure, I'm insisting once we agree to do something, that we have the resources and then those resources are held accountable to deliver. So that is my philosophy in general, and I gave Invigorate as an example of that, but it will extend itself to everything we do in the company going forward.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then if I could just ask you, you have talked about the $40 million associated with early retirements. I'm curious just to know on the senior management team, have there been any decisions made about who will take early retirement? And is that something that has been decided yet?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","No, we're not prepared to share anything related to specific individuals. What I'll share with you is the participation in the program is broad throughout the organization. And I -- Bob, would you like to share any insight into the people that opted into the program and how that ties into the savings?","Robert A. Hagemann","There's not a lot specifically, Steve. It's a very broad-based program. It's covering just about every part of the organization, although I would tell you that we very thoughtfully designed the program. There were certain parts of the organization, certain employees that we felt were critical that were not offered the plan, and we maintain the ability to not accept certain people as well, so that we could manage any potential adverse impact that the program would have. And then lastly, we maintained the ability to determine one person would actually lead the workforce. So we've been able to ourselves, I think, manage it pretty effectively, but it's a broad-based program.","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Yes, and just adding to that, we surgically looked at specific work areas and thought forward in terms of the skill mix of some of those work areas. So we used it as an opportunity to think about the workforce in general. So yes, some people will leave from this program, but also we saw it as an opportunity to affect our wage bill in specific areas where we have a skill mix going on with our operations. So it is a very comprehensive, robust program that will help reduce some costs; but at the same time, help improve our productivity as well.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And just one last thing to clarify a comment Bob made in response to the royalty portfolio from Celera. Bob, you said you need better visibility on the revenue opportunity, I think, is sort of the comment. But does that mean that you need those products to be commercialized in the market? I'm just trying to understand sort of at what point you would seriously consider monetizing the royalty?","Robert A. Hagemann","Yes, it's a interesting question. And I don't want to be too specific at this point because it is premature to gauge what the actual opportunity will be, not only from the Merck drugs, but the other drugs that Celera has rights to as well. But I think for us to get the appropriate value for those drugs and those assets and those royalties, we have to have a pretty good view as to what they'll realize for us.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, I think it's an interesting situation nonetheless, so nice position for you to be in.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bob, I was just surprised the deleveraging wasn't more material in the quarter. I thought that was a bigger part of the strategy going forward. Are you kind of happy with the outstanding debt levels currently?","Robert A. Hagemann","Bob, it's pretty much as we had planned. As you know, we generate the majority of our free cash flow in the back half of the year, and the delevering is really following the way the cash flows come in. So this is pretty consistent with what we had anticipated.","Operator","Our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I apologize for earlier. That was directed at a salesperson, clearly not at Quest. I just had a quick follow-on question around acquisition opportunities and just around hospital outreach, labs and what you're seeing in the marketplace and how things have gone with your existing relationship, and if you see opportunities going forward?","Stephen H. Rusckowski","Sure, appreciate that. Well, first of all, as I said in my opening comments, we don't anticipate any large acquisitions. But we will consider what we call tuck-in acquisitions that we could fold into operations that could be reasonably accretive in the short term. That would include what we could do on a regional level. And also I made some comments about what hospital systems we're looking at and integrated delivery systems we're looking at in terms of where they add value, what's strategic and what they need to rely on others to do, and there might be some opportunities for us on that. So we are looking at all of that and there are some opportunities.","Robert A. Hagemann","And Lisa, I would to add to this. We think about hospitals and the opportunity to work with them to grow our business. Certainly, there's the opportunity to acquire their outreach business. There's still a big opportunity to gain additional reference testing from them. We look to manage some hospital laboratories. And in selective cases, we've looked at joint venture in certain markets where it makes sense. So we continue to think about multiple ways to work with hospitals to grow our business and help them compete effectively as well.","Operator","Thank you.

Go ahead, please.","Shawn Bevec","Thank you and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.","For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections \u2013 including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are Compound Annual Growth Rates.","Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.","Steve Rusckowski","Thanks Shawn. And thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I\u2019ll discuss the third quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates to our 2019 guidance.","We had a solid quarter of top and bottom line growth. While PAMA reimbursement pressures persist throughout the industry, our expanded network access and laser focus on driving operational excellence are enabling growth.","Based on our progress to date we have updated our outlook and are well-positioned to meet our commitments for the year. For the third quarter, we grew revenues 3.5% despite continued reimbursement pressure. Reported EPS was $1.56, up nearly 3% from the same period in 2018. Adjusted EPS was $1.76, up nearly 5%. Volume growth remained very strong at 5.1% and year-to-date volume growth is up 4.3%.","Now, I\u2019d like to briefly update you on the three fundamental changes in the laboratory marketplace that we discussed at last year\u2019s Investor Day. And as you know they are our PAMA, our expanded network access and increased consumerization of healthcare.","First, PAMA, the reimbursement pressure remains a catalyst for structural change in the marketplace. And there is mounting evidence that PAMA is hurting this industry. We see and hear the negative impact that PAMA is having whenever we evaluate potential lab acquisition targets. And CAP Today, a respected industry journal, recently highlighted how PAMA and other reimbursement pressures are already starting to drive consolidation in the industry.","As you know, here at Quest, we took a series of actions earlier this year to further reduce our costs to align with PAMA cuts. Some decisions that we made were difficult, and our employees have felt the changes. More PAMA reimbursement cuts are coming in 2020. Our industry continues to fight PAMA\u2019s flawed implementation in the courts and in Congress.","We recently received a favorable U.S. Court of Appeals decision to allow the lower court to review the merits of ACLA\u2019s case. ACLA submitted its initial brief last week, and a decision is expected in 2020. This is encouraging news, and so is the introduction of the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act, or LAB Act, introduced in June by six members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and now with nearly 40 cosponsors. ACLA is also working to build support for a Senate companion bill to include the LAB Act in a larger end-of-year health care extender bill.","The second fundamental change affecting our industry is our expanded network access and payers becoming more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend. We are partnering with UnitedHealthcare to move testing volume to high-value labs like Quest from high-cost hospital and out-of-network labs. UnitedHealthcare began offering a product with zero dollar member out-of-pocket charges for laboratory testing for the majority of fully insured lives in select states on October 1. UnitedHealthcare will also make the lab savings program available for their self-insured employer groups beginning in 2020.","And then finally, we continue to see the ongoing consumerization of health care with more and more health care costs borne by consumers. In September, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that the annual premiums for employer sponsored health care coverage grew 5% for families, surpassing $20,000 for the first time. The number of employees in high deductible health plans has increased over the past decade.","Turning to our recent progress, the first part of our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth, which has five elements. To grow 2% per year through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally support population health with data analytics and extended care services.","Now let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. Our acquisition pipeline remains strong. As we\u2019ve said before, most deals in our pipeline are taking more time to develop than they have in the past.","Conversations with hospital systems are getting broader. Hospital CEOs are also interested in how we can help them with their professional lab services and taking on more of their reference work. As a result of this complexity, proposed relationships take longer to develop. ","Hospital systems are also interested in learning more about our recently unveiled Quest Lab Stewardship, an innovative new service that employs machine learning to help optimize laboratory test utilization. We have partnered with hc1, a health care IT company, to provide a solution that gives Quest a differentiated offering in a competitive hospital marketplace. ","We continue to see revenue and volume growth as a result of our expanding network access. In aggregate, growth continues across our top 50 major health plan customers. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included drug monitoring, continued strength in tuberculosis testing in both QuantiFERON and T-Spot; STD testing; and CardioIQ. Each of these test categories posted solid contributions to revenue growth in the quarter.","The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain on track to deliver 3% cost efficiencies for 2019 by continuing to drive increases in productivity. We have some examples which include using digital technology to enhance the customer experience. We now have more than 8.2 million patients now making appointments and receiving their results through our MyQuest digital platform.","We\u2019ve continued to drive productivity improvements across logistics, patient services and lab services, enabling us to reduce our overall cost per laboratory requisition. We are also putting new innovations to work while reducing costs. We are in the process of consolidating and simplifying our immunoassay platforms, moving to a single supplier. This approach enables greater throughput, a more efficient footprint, and is expected to save tens of millions of dollars per year.","Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through our financial performance. Mark?","Mark Guinan","Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.96 billion, up 3.5% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 3.7% compared to the prior year driven by strong volume growth and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.1% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 3.7%.","We benefitted from an extra revenue day in the third quarter, while the impact of Hurricane Dorian was a modest volume headwind. The net impact of these two items added roughly 1% to organic growth in the quarter. ","Recall, we also highlighted last quarter that we recently exited some capitated contracts. In the third quarter, this change represented a headwind of nearly 1% to our organic volume growth. ","Importantly, we continued to see a modest acceleration in our volume growth associated with our UnitedHealthcare contract. Revenue per requisition declined by 1.2% versus the prior year primarily driven by higher reimbursement pressure. ","Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.5% in the third quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA which amounted to a headwind of approximately 120 basis points. As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule as well as modest indirect price changes from Medicaid and a small number of floating rate contracts. ","Reported operating income was $313 million, or 16% of revenues, compared to $304 million, or 16.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $349 million, or 17.9% of revenues, compared to $333 million, or 17.7% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our Invigorate initiatives, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Additionally, patient concessions are down year-over-year.","Reported EPS was $1.56 in the quarter compared to $1.53 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.76, up approximately 5% from $1.68 last year. Cash provided by operations was $895 million year-to-date versus $905 million last year. Capital expenditures were $228 million year-to-date, compared to $232 million a year ago.","Now, turning to guidance, our updated outlook for 2019 is as follows: Revenues expected to be approximately $7.72 billion, an increase of approximately 2.5% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be between $5.48 and $5.53 and adjusted EPS, to be between $6.45 and $6.50.","Cash provided by operations is still expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million.","I will now turn it back to Steve.","Steve Rusckowski","To summarize, we had a solid quarter of top and bottom line growth. While PAMA reimbursement pressures persist throughout the industry, our expanded network access and laser focus on driving operational excellence are enabling growth. Based on our progress to date we have updated our outlook and are well-positioned to meet our commitments for the rest of the year.","Now, we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning, Ralph.","Mark Guinan","Good morning, Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe","Good morning. Good morning. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask on the pricing side, and just your comments on sort of the higher reimbursement pressure. I guess what\u2019s \u2013 just help us on sort of what\u2019s driving that outside of PAMA? And then if you could maybe just level set the expectation on sort of where expectations are for that pricing mix that kind of going forward, exclusive of PAMA? Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Mark, do you want to\u2026","Mark Guinan","Sure. So as we\u2019ve shared before in the Investor Day last year, then also coming into this year, this year\u2019s pricing pressure is primarily driven by two factors, one is PAMA. The second one is getting back in with United. We moved from out-of-network rates to a market-based in network rate. So obviously, we have grown our volume dramatically. As we\u2019ve said this year, we expected and we \u2013 still we are delivering enough incremental value to offset the price set, but it is a significant price headwind relative to the rates we were being reimbursed as out-of-network lab.","You don\u2019t have the typical pricing pressure that this industry has faced in the past. We\u2019ve talked about it being for around 100 basis points or less. Number of those pricing pressures are coming from the client bill, it\u2019s not all third-party reimbursement where we\u2019re contractually agreed with the health plan and what those rates are in the hospital business and also where we sell directly to physicians and they\u2019re allowed to build a third party. There is a lot of competition. A lot of pricing pressure in that area and so while we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re going to be price disciplined when we certainly walked away from some contracts that haven\u2019t made sense. The reality is that it\u2019s a very competitive environment. And that has not really changed.","So the big change over the last two years, obviously PAMA last year, but it wasn\u2019t fully implemented, because you had some offsets to it in the first year that we\u2019ve talked about previously. This was the first year of the full 10% of PAMA. And then additionally, we have the United price as well. And going forward, as we shared, we would expect this to get back to more of its historical rate. I\u2019m not going to give any specific guidance for a given year. But there is no reason to believe once we get through the transition period in the United that we should be really facing in kind of the traditional pricing pressure in PAMA. ","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And could you just quantify that UNH pricing pressure this year?","Steve Rusckowski","Ralph, it\u2019s going to be $40 million to $50 million.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, Bill.","Bill Quirk","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Bill Quirk","So Steve, I want to follow up on a comment that you made concerning the decision to consolidate the immunoassay vendors. Can you speak a little bit about whether or not there\u2019s an opportunity here to consolidate some of your other testing methods things like clinical chemistry and hematology and such. And if so, can you just help us think a little bit about the timing? This is something we should think about over the next couple of years to help offset some of the PAMA pressure. Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, sure, absolutely. So Bill, we were working on this for about seven years, getting smarter and more strategic with all our suppliers, and so we\u2019ve done a lot of consolidation in the past and we\u2019ll continue to do more in the future. So as far as immunoassays, we\u2019re close to deciding on the supplier. I believe that will be announced shortly who that is. Of course it\u2019s a nice opportunity. And this is all part of our 3% productivity gains that we are dialing in to be able to offset PAMA. We need it to be able to offset PAMA deliver on the earnings uplift that we\u2019ve provided at Investor Day.","And so part of that 3% is working with our suppliers and part of that working with the suppliers and the example of that is immunoassay while there is others. Another example would be the automation we\u2019re putting in place in some of our newer facilities, particularly we\u2019re investing this year in our branding facility here in New Jersey \u2013 in Clifton, New Jersey. It\u2019s a big project for us. That will have us new platform, but equally it will have us our latest approach to automation, which will increase our productivity, but also allow us to consolidate some facilities into one, so we get some productivity gains from that. But that\u2019s all part of that 3% when we need that 3% to offset the price pressure particularly with PAMA next year and maybe the year after.","Mark Guinan","And I just want to add some color there, Bill, make sure they understand this is not just consolidating our purchases. This is actually a new innovation in the platform where we can do multiple tests that previously were performed on separate pieces of equipment on a single piece of equipment. So this will drive, not just procurement efficiencies, but actually will drive operational efficiencies in our labs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, Donald.","Donald Hooker","Great. Good morning. So I \u2013 maybe you guys in terms of that new collaboration you announced with hc1. I know you guys do a lot of interesting things in the population health space. I\u2019m just trying to maybe \u2013 can you elaborate on that a little bit? What exactly are you doing? I mean is this something that I guess you\u2019re...","Steve Rusckowski","Sure. Sure. What we\u2019re doing for our hospital client as part of our five-point strategy, we talk to them about three things in regards to the lab strategies. One is, can we make them more efficient in running their inpatient laboratory? So this is where we talk about Professional Laboratory Services or sometimes we use the acronym PLS, and we continue to have that dialogs about making them more efficient.","We can \u2013 with good evidence now, save them about 10% to 20%. Part of that typically also is looking at the sophisticated send out of testing referred to as reference testing. And in that regard, consolidated was buying from \u2013 like potentially give them a better price. But the third part that we\u2019re looking at and this new offering allows as a tool to do a better job of getting smarter about what they\u2019re testing in the hospital is interrogate their order patterns and look for variation of their order patterns and look at ways of optimizing what the order within the hospital.","And there\u2019s two part to that. One is to get more efficient at what you\u2019re ordering. So maybe third quarter as much in some cases, you should also order more because it\u2019s smarter diagnostic workup for the inpatient today, but the second part of this, which is more \u2013 even more intriguing what many hospital administrators are interested in is making sure that we have the right diagnosis.","And if you look at the total quality and outcomes for our hospital stay, there\u2019s nothing more expensive than buying diagnosis. So what this tool allows us to do is to work with our clients on getting smarter on their inpatient diagnostics and as part of that, we clearly become more strategic than this vendor providing reference testing within that account.","And then finally, the third piece of what we work with hospital systems when we have those discussions is you want to stay in the outreach business and we have bought some outreach businesses from hospitals. We have some within our numbers for this year and will continue to aggressively pursue buying outreach businesses as this industry consolidates. And I would tell you that many hospital systems are now well aware of PAMA and well aware of other reimbursement pressures they are having in their laboratory outreach business. So, as we mentioned in our commentary that funnel of discussions continues to grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Erin.","Erin Wright","Hi. In terms of the timing and magnitude of contributions from the managed care access, I guess, can you break out what you\u2019re seeing in terms of underlying market growth and what portion of volume may be stemming from the managed care contracts and possibly also the PLN in early days and are you still anticipating those contributions to ramp from here? How should we conceptually be thinking about that ramp? I\u2019m not asking for 2020 guidance, but how should we be thinking about that ramp into 2020?","Steve Rusckowski","Sure. So what will share with you \u2013 we always shared this every quarter. It feels like the market is stable. We don\u2019t see any notable changes in terms of volume increases within the marketplace both outside the hospital, and also inside the hospital so stable. So if you look at volume growth, we\u2019re clearly gaining share. And a large portion of that share of gains is coming from managed care relationships.","What we have also said is that our access changes, which is the best in over a decade, we\u2019ll continue to grow. It will continue to grow this year in 2019, but it will also have growth in 2020 and probably in 2021 as we take advantage of that opportunity that we see in front of those. That will be helped in 2020 for certain with \u2013 for lab network, particularly with UnitedHealthcare. So you should look for in 2020 continued growth again because of our expanded network access. So Mark, anything you\u2019d like to add to that?","Mark Guinan","Yes. So, you asked about the PLN, it\u2019s still very, very early. To this date, I\u2019d say very little, if any growth has come from the PLN is still in front of us, which is the good news. We talked at Investor Day about kind of three tranches of volume growth, Erin. We sized the new managed care access at about $1 billion at our price, our fair share. We fully expect to get to our fair share. But it\u2019s going to take several years there was a easier to convert accounts obviously came quickly, we call them Quest loyalist where we had the rest of the book of the office and they were sending some of the managed care work that we were out-of-network to those, to other labs that were in-network and they immediately moved that to us once we were in network.","We never had some of the accounts where they have multiple labs. We showed you the picture when they were three, four sometimes five boxes outside. We\u2019ve done a better job of consolidating some of that getting a more larger share of wallet per se in those positions that will take a period of time, but certainly, we\u2019ve gotten some growth from that, but that will continue into the future.","And then there was the ones where we have had no, none of the work and a lot of that is in the hospital stay, hospital outreach and in some of the physician-owned laboratories that\u2019s where we really think the preferred lab network is going to be a big driver. We would be able to have a very simple message to patients. Hey, if you use one of the preferred labs and obviously we\u2019re one of the five zero out-of-pocket. That\u2019s a very simple message instead of trying to compare how expensive, what option might be the there, it\u2019s free to view if you use this lab. So we\u2019re very confident, very excited. This will be a multi-year tailwind and we\u2019re going to get to that fair share eventually of about $1 billion in our price.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Michael.","Michael Newshel","Hi, good morning. Maybe to follow-up on that. Do you have any visibility at this point after the selling season from United on the level of uptake in the self-insured base for the PLN for 2020","Mark Guinan","They have not shared specific information, obviously. They are questions you could ask them because we\u2019re not the only preferred lab. So we obviously get the same information that preferred lab network providers do. They talk to us about, as we\u2019ve shared the states where their role in the south making this available, and then they talk to us about the fact that their marketing into those whole insurance sponsored plans for 2020, rolling that out, still very early in that process, and they didn\u2019t give us any specific proportionality or percentage of their overall insured lives that are adapting this, but they \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard them talk about it, we\u2019ve heard them talk publicly and in the conversation we have, they are very, very confident that this is going to be something that people will embrace and that is going to make a difference.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Kevin Ellich","Hey, Steve. Two quick things. So first M&A pipeline. You said that the deals are taking a little bit longer to materialize. Wondering if the environment has changed or if this is what you\u2019ve experienced historically. And then also could you talk about maybe any tailwinds you\u2019re seeing from the opioid testing and the opportunities within behavioral health facilities?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes. Sure. So on the first one, as I mentioned in our opening remarks, these deals are getting bigger and more complicated. And if it\u2019s more complex, it takes more time and there is good news in that and there is bad news in that. One is, it takes more time. That\u2019s bad news. The good news is, the bigger the more complicated. It\u2019s therefore we\u2019re clearly having discussion around how they could be \u2013 their partner for laboratory services around the three topics that I mentioned earlier.","And what I did also share is that the interest level around what we can do when partnering continues to grow because of more people are well aware of the pressure on this portion of their business. I would say that was not nearly where we were last year at this time. So if you look at our growth rate from acquisition year-to-date, they\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s just a little shy of that 2% we indicated last year. We\u2019re well north of that 2%.","We still feel confident that over an extended period of time, we\u2019ll continue to be 2% or greater. And so, we feel confident between the three buckets that we acquire. One is hospital outreach, [indiscernible] (0:29:03) lot of engagement around that. Second is, regional laboratories. As I mentioned in my remarks, there continues to be interest in evaluating options for smaller operators because of the pressures that they see. And then finally, we continue to build capabilities and we have a number of acquisitions in the past around that. A good example of this immune attack, which is bringing us new capabilities around tuberculosis testing and also fit for an illness testing.","So all three continue to be our focus going forward and you will see that and we\u2019re still confident around our guidance we provided around 2% on a CAGR basis over a multi-year period of time.","Mark Guinan","And you asked about opioid testing and the tailwind certainly our prescription drug monitoring business, which is subset of that opioid testing has been a strong growth engine for us for a number of years and continues to be a nice growth driver. Like anything else, when something gets large enough, the payers start putting in policies and all sorts of barriers to reimbursement that dampen that somewhat, despite some of those restrictions around frequency of testing, pre-authorization, and other things that they\u2019re putting in, it\u2019s still a nice growth driver for us. It just will be even larger if they hadn\u2019t made those changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi Jack, good morning.","Jack Meehan","Good morning. So I just wanted to focus on the margins here, so in the quarter, nice to see the expansion. Can you maybe walk us through the moving parts between pricing impact, efficiency programs in the calendar? And as we look to 2020, as you pull all these pieces together, do you think \u2013 what\u2019s the right way to think about, are margins flat is PAMA too big of a headwind to grow through? What are some of the things that you\u2019re thinking about?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so let me first touch Jack on the longer term. So I\u2019m not going to talk to 2020. But what I did talk about at the Investor Day was on a full year outlook that we could grow earnings faster than the top line. And talked about the assumption, although that may not play out depending on how we deploy our cash, but that\u2019s on the flat share count, so therefore we\u2019re actually growing earnings not earnings per share. So that implies margin expansion that I can tell you that we are not expecting some sort of the tax windfall. So that\u2019s before tax margin growth.","I can\u2019t assure you that will happen every quarter. I can\u2019t assure you that I\u2019m not going to get into 2025 adding every year, but over multiple years, we expect to grow our earnings faster than our top line. And it\u2019s really having the efficiency program continue, we talked about it being 3% per year, we\u2019ve got really good at that. We need that. We\u2019ll continue to do that with over time tempering pricing headwinds. In this quarter, we shared the pricing headwinds of 250 basis points. Obviously, that all drops to the bottom line for a very small piece for the bad debt element, but basically it drops to the bottom line.","So we had enough efficiency and some lift from volume, how much of that is the extra day, how much of that is just the volume growth. Obviously, we have a higher drop through we shared on organic volume growth, enough to offset the pricing headwinds and basically hold our margin pretty flat in the quarter.","So I may be getting any more precise than that, I\u2019d be stretching my credibility and ability to give that map. So I would just say that, you can see that despite some pretty significant pricing headwinds, is how their margins in this quarter and that as we continue to drive strong organic volume growth and deliver our 3%, over a period of time, we\u2019re going to grow our earnings faster.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Could you talk a little bit about the fourth quarter guidance? The revenue guidance is in line with model, the EPS fall short. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any accelerated spending, are you may be trying to position better for 2020 by spending more in 2019? Can you give us a little color around the fourth quarter and may be higher thinking about spending in 2020?","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so we\u2019ve raised our guidance for the year. Importantly, we\u2019re signaling stronger finish to the year than we did at the beginning of the year. And until now we\u2019ve not signaled anything above original guidance. So, hopefully people are taking that as a positive message, which we\u2019re saying based on our performance through three quarters of the year and what visibility we have for Q4, we\u2019re feeling confident that we\u2019re going to over-deliver relative to what we said at the beginning of the year.","So, in terms of the spending, there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary in Q4. The only thing that\u2019s out of the ordinary is the easy compare on the top line which we\u2019ve talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Tanquilut","Good morning guys.","Steve Rusckowski","Good morning.","Brian Tanquilut","Mark just to follow-up on Jack\u2019s question earlier, as I think about the G&A line, you\u2019ve obviously done a good job bringing the G&A percentage down. It flattened out this quarter at about 17.8%. So as I think about your efficiency program, is there more to squeeze out of that or how should we be thinking about that number, it seems like it\u2019s bottoming out here in this 17.8% range?","Steve Rusckowski","Let me start on this. For some reason, there\u2019s always a lot of focus around G&A thinking about a lot of our invigorated savings show up in the expense categories. To the contrary, most of our invigorated savings actually sort of show up in our costs of sales. So if you think about what\u2019s in our expense category, a lot of it is G&A and we\u2019ve made really good progress over the last seven years. So getting more efficient with everything that\u2019s in the category in the P&L, from IT cost to cost running our finance organization, the cost associated with our billing operations, with our relationship with Optum. And outside the general and administration, it\u2019s our sales and marketing costs, which we\u2019re always evaluating and getting more efficient.","So we have taken a lot of cost out already. And we\u2019re also leveraging that fixed cost going forward. So the lift we generally get now has to do with that operational leverage related to the top line growth while maintaining the same cost perspective and that\u2019s what you see this year. So a lot of the 3% productivity gain will show up in productivity gains in our cost of sales and not in the expenses.","Mark, do you have anything you\u2019d like to add that?","Mark Guinan","Yes, I just would like to add that yes, over time, well Steve is absolutely correct that a large proportion if not a majority of that efficiency is going to drive margin and gross margin will be in the cost of sales will continue to focus on G&A. You can\u2019t really look quarter-to-quarter. In this quarter, we had some couple of high-cost health claims. Over time, we\u2019re going to deliver what we expect, and we\u2019ve done a really good job in managing, it\u2019s very, very minor increases in our self-funded employee healthcare costs. But in a given quarter you get a couple of large claims that can make some noise quarter-to-quarter.","So there\u2019s no trend, where there\u2019s \u2013 nothing should be read in terms of we\u2019ve lost our ability to continue to drive efficiency, there\u2019s always going to be noise on that line quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good morning. How are you?","Steve Rusckowski","Hey, good morning.","Derik de Bruin","Good. Hey, I just want to follow \u2013 two questions. One is a quick follow-up to Bill\u2019s question on the vendor consolidation, platform consolidation. Can you talk a little bit about that process and that how is that going to look and sort of like how you\u2019re judging the different vendors and basically how many you have now particularly the IA and going down?","And then the other question I wanted to follow-up on was, when you look at the fourth quarter last year, obviously you had a number of weather issues, but there were issues of patient concessions, lower cash collections, in that sense. Can you just sort of talk about going into the fourth quarter how we are relative to some of these issues, I know you mentioned concessions were down. But just to talk a little bit more about the comps and some of the different things you\u2019re sort of going on in fourth quarter versus\u2026","Steve Rusckowski","Okay, so let me take the first part Mark will take the second part. And the first part, so this is a comprehensive review that we perpetually look at with our suppliers on how we run our laboratories. And we work actively with all our suppliers and that over the past seven years we\u2019ve worked hard to make sure that we really have more of a strategic relationship with all our suppliers, particularly those that are driving a large portion of our spend. And so in that regard, in the IVD automation states, there is consolidation with a number of those platforms as Mark mentioned. And there are a number of suppliers that we buy from that are bringing to the marketplace platforms that will allow us to replace up to about five different work cells with different manufacturers over time.","And so what we have done is evaluate those vendors that have a product either in the marketplace or will have a product in the marketplace and we do that through a review process with their sales force on understanding what they\u2019ll have, and what they\u2019ll have for functionality at one time, and then also what the economics around their offering are. We narrowed that down to a few. We actually put in place a few of those platforms in some of our facilities to do some trial runs and then we\u2019re at the final strokes of selecting one of those suppliers going forward. And we believe that we will choose a vendor that meets all the requirements of what we need.","And yes, a portion of this is economics. That is how cost \u2013 how much productivity we\u2019re going to get for getting more throughput by \u2013 being able to consolidate those operations. But also we think about it holistically. You need to make sure that you have good confidence around their ability to service us, good confidence around their quality, good confidence around what\u2019s in their installed base. So it\u2019s a very comprehensive, operational review of who will be our strategic provider for this new platform going forward. And as I said we\u2019re at the final strokes of deciding that and shortly it will be announced.","Mark Guinan","Yes, so on your second question, last year there were a couple of drivers that led us to the change in estimates and obviously the change that we made in Investor Day on our outlook for 2018. Two of them really relate to patients. The first one was that there was more patient responsibility in the year than we saw it coming. And again, we\u2019re always accruing based on a forward-looking expectation of how the revenue is going to play out. We looked at all the available data at the beginning of the year as we shared whether great growth with the amount of people with high deductible plans, we assumed it would be a pretty flat year in terms of the proportion of our revenue from patients. And instead what happened was there were more patient responsibility because the deductibles themselves have gone up markedly as we found out in the September timeframe, which started to actually validate why our cash collections were lagging what we expected from the payer. ","So anytime, as we\u2019ve shared, we almost collect a hundred percent of the accepted claims that we\u2019re owed from third party payers. And we\u2019ve shared that we collect about $0.70 on the dollar from patients. So you move 1% of revenue from the third party to the patient. That\u2019s a 30 basis point headwind. So it\u2019s pretty significant.","The good news is this year nothing changed significantly from last year. We\u2019re very confident with that, there was no surprise. Obviously going in, we were very, very diligent in watching that, being conservative and there\u2019s no surprises in terms of the proportion of our revenue coming from patients. ","The second piece really with patients was we had more patient concessions, not just because more revenue was coming from them, but we actually had some issues we\u2019ve talked about in our lab conversion in the south. And that delays some billing because of the way these conversions go. And because of that the more bills age out, the more you\u2019re going to have concessions less like you are going to collect it. So that\u2019s well behind us, we\u2019re fully converted, we don\u2019t have that anymore. So that\u2019s behind us.","And then also related to that we had some higher level of denials because of some time with filings, and so on, because lab conversion themselves we always have been dealing with denials, but they spiked the mid to late last year when we went to this lab conversion. So when you add all those things up, they\u2019ve been cleaned up. The issues that we had last year are well behind us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. ","Steve Rusckowski","Hi Matt.","Matt Larew","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask for an update on progress in the retail setting, first just broadly in terms of the footprint transformation in the Walmart and Safeway stores. And then also anything that you think you are doing with the new Walmart health initiative. I know there\u2019s a first center that just opened up in Georgia that you\u2019re participating in. ","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so we\u2019re continuing to move forward with our retail strategy as we call it. We have about 2,100 patient service centers and of which can you characterize from above 35% to 40% of those are more retail like, several of which are within Safeway stores and Walmart. The Safeway relationship continues to be a good one. We actually have some new opportunities with Safeway going forward as we kind of work that relationship, so we\u2019re optimistic there.","And then second, as we continue to build our presence with Walmart as well. And as you mentioned, they opened up new health concept store and we are their laboratory provider for that store, so they\u2019re still working through how that works. And as you know if you know anything about Walmart, they probably like a lot of things and they\u2019re seeing how well that goes to be able to tune out and we\u2019re working with them proactive on that content going forward. ","And as what we said is our goal is to be north of 50% of our patient service centers. So we have some ways to go. And there\u2019s a number of things for us, one is we think it\u2019s a better customer experience, consistent with our strategy, could be the most consumer-friendly laboratory. And we think this will continue to be a differentiator for us in the marketplace.","Second is it\u2019s better for employees in a lot of ways and it also allows us to manage the demand and when people are there if we can have larger patient service centers with more providers, it just gives you a lot more operational flexibility to manage the demand based upon location and time of day that patients are coming in over extended period of time.","And then finally as the patients really the feedback is quite good. They come in, they have flexibility to walk the store where they wait they have flexibility to do some shopping after their visit. Then we believe that improvement in access and the quality of that access will allow us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and pick up share gradually over time. So it\u2019s going well, we\u2019re pleased with it.","And then lastly, I will just say, yes, we have the relationship with Safeway, and yes we have relationship with Walmart, but we continue to work with others in the marketplace, so we continue to work with CVS, Aetna, the MinuteClinic and what we\u2019re doing around their strategy is they are a partner of ours. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Ricky. Good morning.","Mark Guinan","Good morning Ricky.","Alexa Desai","Good morning. This is actually Alexa in for Ricky. Thank you for taking my question.","Mark Guinan","Hi, Alexa.","Alexa Desai","I just wanted to come back to the United Health PLN. You guys mentioned, I think, in your earlier remarks that they\u2019re offering starting October 1, zero dollar member out-of-pocket charges. So I guess my question is, are there any other things that are looking for to do over the balance of the year to continue kind of incentivizing the use of the PLN and how does that zero pocket compared labs not in the network?","Steve Rusckowski","Mark you want to take that?","Mark Guinan","Yes so for labs not in the network, it would be the typical out-of-pocket determined by their plan benefit design. So, with a high deductible plan they just had some sort of cover insurance, but there won\u2019t be zero. So if you think about the average requisition being somewhere between $40 and $50 and typical patient responsibility over time, employing proper responsibility over time by be it 20% to 25% of their healthcare dollars, with the balance being paid for by the company, you can do the math. Now that\u2019s an average. Obviously there\u2019s some very high cost tests. So it\u2019d be a big, big advantage if you have a genetic test or some of the other screening tests that could run hundreds of dollars. ","But just the simplicity of the message of not having to worry that, hey the same series of tests would be $50 from a national lab and $500 from this hospital. And what does that mean for me? It\u2019s just you don\u2019t have to worry about it. They\u2019re not as good and it\u2019s not just about price, it\u2019s also about quality, and service and access. So those are all the metrics that were required to get in. We did not change our price with the United in order to get into the pervert lab network, nor do we think anybody else did, but we know we definitely did not. So this is really about the total value of the offering. So if you want to go to the best lab with a great price and also have zero out-of-pocket, it\u2019s a very simple decision for the patient. So that\u2019s important.","There\u2019s also in United you should talk about this, but there\u2019s also some things that they\u2019re doing around in sending physicians as well. So it\u2019s not just a patient-driven initiative and I\u2019ll let you talk to United about what they\u2019re doing on that end. ","And then obviously you can imagine we\u2019re doing a lot of work in the field with our own commercial sales force to make sure that physicians are aware because this is really good for patients. And most physicians their number one priority is their patient, not their owner, not anybody else, so when they know this was good thing for their patients, they like that. The other thing is it\u2019s a source of some patient satisfaction is getting a bill.","And so now you don\u2019t have to call to the office about, hey, that lab you ordered from me, I got a bill, I thought it was covered by the office visit, et cetera, et cetera. So reduces noise for the payer, reduces noise for the physician\u2019s office, obviously a good thing for us and a good thing for patients.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes I\u2019ll just add to what Mark just said, obviously the savings here is zero coinsurance and copayments, but the biggest driver as you\u2019re moving through the laboratory that has a significant lower reimbursement rate then if they\u2019re working with enough for lab network. So the savings to the consumer is very considerable. But the biggest portion of that has to do with the rate differential, not necessarily with the patient responses they might have or not have with us. So a big opportunity and we\u2019re hopeful. As we mentioned it\u2019s just getting started this month, it\u2019s early. But we\u2019re hopeful, this change coupled with the changes that we spoke to take place in 2020 will continue to allow us to grow our presence and our share with United, but also with other payers because we do believe it\u2019s a trend overall in the marketplace. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hey Mark.","Mark Guinan","Hey Mark.","Mark Massaro","Hey guys, thanks for the question. I guess my first question is for you Mark. Obviously the volume growth is the strongest we\u2019ve seen in a long time. You talked about the one extra revenue day in the quarter. But you also talked about health plan access with United continuing to build. So can you just give us a sense for whether or not the 5% growth is a level that you think can continue? Can you just give us a little sense of the puts and takes around some of the drivers there?","Mark Guinan","Yes, so we talked about the fact that the about the fact that the extra day net of hurricane Dorian gives about 100 points. So you can kind of take that math in your thinking. Obviously each corner has different puts and takes in terms of the amount of revenue days, and we usually try to be very transparent about how that all plays out. At the beginning of the year we\u2019ve talked about Q1 having Saturdays and Q3 having an extra day. And obviously next year we have leap year and the quarter\u2019s will play out a little bit differently. And we\u2019ll give you as much transparency on that as possible. But really when you think about the whole year the next year you\u2019re just thinking about generally revenue days are pretty similar year-over-year other than when you have a leap year.","And then we did talk about the capitated volume, which is not impacting the bottom line. But if you\u2019re just focused on revenue, at some point next year we laugh that change. So that was about a 100 basis points this quarter. If you recall, we shared about 70 basis points in Q2. So at some point that volume headwind gets behind us. ","Now I\u2019ll just to share a little additional color in the quarter, our a employer pre-employment testing business is actually a headwind to our growth that was pretty flat. So that\u2019s the non-DIS if you remember then about a 20 basis point higher growth rate I shared at the beginning of my prepared remarks for our core clinical business. So we\u2019ll see how the pre-employment drug screening business goes, but that was if you want to really think about the clinical business, which is what where we\u2019re benefiting from the expanded access and the volume performance is actually slightly stronger than it may have appeared on the surface.","So, is it going to be 5%? Obviously we\u2019re not going to have an extra day every quarter. But is it going to continue to be really positive organic revenue growth into the future? Absolutely that\u2019s our expectation as we work our way to that fair share I talked about as eventually getting into $1 billion of revenue in these new lives with the three expanded access plans.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.","Eric Coldwell","Hey thanks very much.","Mark Guinan","Hey Eric.","Eric Coldwell","At the end of the quarter you have been head on. But I think it\u2019s always helpful to get maybe a little more emphatic or explicit commentary. It\u2019s all around the M&A and then the capital deployment around M&A. Inorganic growth will really start to abate here in the fourth quarter based on the timing of prior period deals. I\u2019m hoping you can give us some sense on what you\u2019re expecting from inorganic growth in 4Q.","Also, you have a long-term model of 2% plus M&A-driven growth. To the extent that the analysts have built in a place holder here, it sounds like we need to be pulling that in for 2020, at least in the beginning of the year. Can you give us a sense on what you would be comfortable with if people have built in a placeholder?","And then third, as you see these elongated decision cycles on M&A cash is building. So are you more comfortable with us leaving that cash on the balance sheet or would you be comfortable with maybe assuming some accelerated repurchase activity as you have those unnecessary balances that start to build? Thanks very much.","Mark Guinan","Yes, so let me go back to our capital deployment strategy. So as we\u2019ve shared, we\u2019re going to do M&A where it\u2019s value accretive to our shareholders, there\u2019s a clear path. We\u2019re not going to do an M&A just to meet some outlooks that we gave. But with that said, we\u2019re very confident in that 2% CAGR. So we never include unexecuted M&A in our guidance. So just because we at this point are implying a low level of M&A either in Q4 or early in the next year, doesn\u2019t mean that we might not be close to something, but that\u2019s just not in our practice. So we don\u2019t actually include M&A in our guidance until we have a signed contract, and so on.","So we\u2019re very confident in that 2% CAGR. If you look at what we\u2019ve done, last year and what we\u2019re applying this year we\u2019re going to be well north of that 2% after two years. We\u2019re highly confident that in the next two years to complete that four year CAGR. We\u2019re going to be at that level if not beat it, because there is a lot of interest. As Steve shared and as we\u2019ve talked about these deals have just taken a while it doesn\u2019t mean they have fallen by the wayside, we\u2019re still working on the same deals that we thought we\u2019d would have gotten done several months ago. But we\u2019re very optimistic some of these are going to get completed.","And I\u2019m not going to give you any guidance for 2020. What I\u2019m comfortable with obviously we\u2019ll give guidance in late January for the year. I\u2019ll talk about the organic M&A mix and then at that point if we have some additional deals that have closed in the interim those will be included. But otherwise we don\u2019t typically do that \u2013 include that in our guidance.","Operator","Our last question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Rusckowski","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen Baxter","Hi, how are you?","Steve Rusckowski","Good.","Stephen Baxter","I want to follow-up on the patient concessions question. So I\u2019m glad you mentioned the Kaiser report. I was flipping through it and it looks like we\u2019re seeing a fairly similar trend in this year\u2019s report. As discussed at the Investor Day last year in terms of high deductible enrollment, not really increasing that much, but deductibles continuing to march upwards at a similar clip. So I was hoping you could clarify a little bit of what you\u2019re seeing in 2019 relative to 2018 in terms of where in the ecosystem you\u2019re seeing improvement in collections and your level of visibility into that versus this time last year.","And then finally in terms of quantification, would you be able to give us a sense of what the collections of improvement has contributed to this year\u2019s growth? Is it reasonable to think about it as offsetting the United out-of-network impact or should we be thinking about something less than that? Thanks.","Steve Rusckowski","Yes, so at this point we share where our sources of revenue are. And so at this point, patient responsibility is not grown significantly year-over-year. So despite what the Kaiser report is talking about in terms of increased deduction, this year it\u2019s not impacted us per se year-over-year. One of the things we did in response to some of the surprise we had last year was we shortened our timeframe. So the way we do our revenue recognition, we\u2019re looking at more recent trends that we use to have a longer term trend that worked for us for years, and years and years. So we\u2019re looking at a lot more recent, which would allow us to not have surprises like we had last year.","So we\u2019ve been on top of this. We\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019ve been accruing. We\u2019re very comfortable with our cash collections. We have a very robust process. And as we look at that we\u2019ve done better on patient concessions, partially because last year was a particularly poor year for some of the reasons I shared earlier, but part of it is we continue to roll out the tools and partner with Optum, our partner around doing things like offering credit card collections upfront. ","We support that with our real-time estimation tool, where if you come into our patient service center, you go to an office where we have an in-office lobotomist. We can tell you on the spot whether the test is covered or not and importantly what your responsibility will be based on that coverage decision and then have an opportunity to say and how would you like to pay for the upfront like most of healthcare has done. So we\u2019re collecting more of our cash up front that makes a significant difference in the overall collectability.","We\u2019ve also seen an improvement in denials. So some of the things we talked about last year, especially in the PBM space where we\u2019re surprised by a couple of major payers, I will tell you as I shared earlier, the payers in general continue to throw us curve balls, we\u2019re always having to deal with new policy changes, new opportunities for them to deny, but we cleaned up some of the things last year that were more significant. So we\u2019ve reduced our overall denials in a couple of key test periods. That\u2019s helpful.","We\u2019ve also shared in the past that we continue to get some preferential treatment from a couple of payers where they put in pre-authorization requirements for certain tests and they actually wave that for a couple of labs, including us because they know we do things, right. We don\u2019t do excessive testing, we partner with them on what clinically appropriate panels are and approach to testing are. So that not only reduces our denial rate because pre-auth is great challenges for the labs, but it also makes us advantageous for the prescriber because they don\u2019t have to worry about pre-auth based on the work to us.","So all of those things together are actually helping revenue growth, and they\u2019re helping our overall margin and part of our Invigorate is on the top line. It\u2019s not all on costs, some of it is actually getting paid for more of the work we do as Jim Davis has said at multiple Investor Days. So we\u2019re seeing good positive improvement in that space.","Shawn Bevec","Okay. Well, we thank everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your support.
