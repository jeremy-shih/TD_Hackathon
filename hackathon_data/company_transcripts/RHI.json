Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. As is our custom, we would like to start today's call with a reminder that comments made on the call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. They represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions.","We believe these remarks to be reasonable, but we remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","We've described some of these risks and uncertainties in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update statements made on today's call.","Now let's discuss last year's fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.08 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Income per share was $0.49, an increase of 16% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Cash flow from operations was $98 million during the fourth quarter, and capital expenditures were $21 million. We paid a $0.16 cash dividend to shareholders on December 16 at a cost of $24 million. We also repurchased 500,000 Robert Half shares during the fourth quarter at a cost of $20 million. Approximately 8.1 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. We saw a continued strength in our staffing operations in the fourth quarter, during which, growth rates accelerated for substantially all of Robert Half's specialized staffing divisions.","Our Technology staffing, as well as our permanent placement divisions, reported the strongest staffing revenue gains compared to the year-ago quarter. Protiviti also reported another excellent quarter, with revenue up 18% year-over-year. This was Robert Half's 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share growth on a year-over-year basis.","Return on equity was 29% for the quarter. Earnings per share of $1.83 for 2013 is the highest reported ever by the company.","Now I'll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As Max mentioned, global revenues were $1.08 billion in the fourth quarter, which is an increase of 5% over the previous year on both reported and same-day constant-currency basis. Global staffing revenues increased 3% on a same-day constant-currency basis, with the U.S. growing 6% and international staffing revenues declining by 3%. U.S. staffing revenues were $714 million in the fourth quarter, while international staffing revenues were $228 million. We have 345 staffing locations worldwide, including 99 locations and 18 countries outside the U.S.","We calculated 61.9 billing days in the fourth quarter compared to 62 billing days in the fourth quarter of 2012. The effect of which was a 0.2% decrease in reported year-over-year staffing growth rates. The current quarter has 62.4 billing days, as compared to 62.2 days in the first quarter of 2013.","Currency exchange rates had no meaningful effect over reported fourth quarter 2013 staffing revenues. A supplemental schedule accompanying our earnings release shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business from both a reported as well as a same-day constant-currency basis. The schedule further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. Operations. You can find this schedule in today's press release and in the Investor Center of our website. This is a non-GAAP financial measure meant to provide you with information on certain trends and our staffing operations.","Fourth quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $142 million, including $112 million in the United States and $30 million outside the U.S. Global revenues for Protiviti grew 18% year-over-year, with the U.S. up 20% and non-U.S. revenues up 12%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations, 25 countries.","Now let's review gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 36.5% of applicable revenues. This was a 10 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2012. The fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012 include workers compensation and other payroll-related credits of $2.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.","Permanent placement revenues were 9.1% of overall staffing revenues for the quarter compared to 8.8% reported 1 year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margin previously discussed, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 30 basis points versus 1 year ago to 42.3%.","Protiviti's fourth quarter gross margin was $45 million or 31.8% of Protiviti revenues compared to $32 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues a year ago. The increase is due primarily to higher staff utilization.","Turning to SG&A costs. In the fourth quarter, our staffing SG&A costs were 33.0% of staffing revenues compared to 32.0% reported 1 year ago.","We ended 2013 with 10,300 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 8% from the prior year.","Fourth quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 20.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 22.4% of revenues reported this time last year. We ended 2013 with 3,100 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 7% from the prior year.","Fourth quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $87 million or 9.3% of staffing revenues. Temporary and consulting divisions reported $75 million and operating income for the quarter were 8.7% of applicable revenues. Fourth quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $12 million or 14.7% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating income was $17 million in the fourth quarter or 11.7% of revenues, compared to $5 million in the fourth quarter a year ago or 4.5% of revenues.","Accounts receivable were $552 million at the end of the fourth quarter, with implied day sales outstanding of 46.3 days compared to 45.1 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012.","Now let's turn to guidance for the first quarter of 2014. We saw the following trends in the fourth quarter and so far in January. In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions accelerated in October, accelerated more in November and slowed modestly in December. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement divisions accelerated in October then slowed in November and December.","Outside the U.S., year-over-year temporary and consulting staffing growth rates, while still negative, improved consistently throughout the quarter. For placement growth rate, slowed in October, but improved in November and again in December.","For the first 2 full weeks of January, revenues for our temporary and consulting operations were up 2% on a same-day constant-currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 4% and non-U.S. temporary and consulting revenues down 5%.","For the first full 3 weeks of January, permanent placement revenues were up 4% on a same-day constant-currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. perm revenues up 4% and non-U.S. perm revenues also up 4%.","We remind you, however, it's difficult to read a lot into these trends given the short time periods they represent. Taking this information into account, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion; income per share, $0.40 to $0.45. Please note, our estimated first quarter income tax rate increases to 39%, up from 36% in the fourth quarter of 2013. This is primarily due to fewer available unused foreign tax benefits. The higher tax rate lowered our first quarter guidance by approximately $0.02 per share. We lowered our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.","Now I'll turn it back over to Max.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. Our professional staffing units and Protiviti finished the year strongly, with U.S. operations leading the way. We saw improving year-over-year revenue trends in all staffing lines of business and, most notably, in our Protiviti subsidiary. Protiviti had an excellent year, marked by demand in its internal audit, technology, consulting and financial services advisory practice areas, among others. We also were pleased with the ongoing collaboration between our staffing divisions and Protiviti on joint business opportunities.","We see encouraging economic signs and positive trends in our markets right now. The United States unemployment rate is at a 5-year low, and the number of temporary workers as a percentage of total U.S. employment is at an all-time high. We believe demand for flexible staffing has momentum far beyond these post-recession years. More companies are benefiting from variable cost labor and, as a result, are including skilled temporary professionals in their human resources mix. We see stable to improving trends outside the United States as well. The difficult economic climate in Europe has affected staffing demand for a number of quarters. Economic data in the Eurozone began improving in the second quarter of 2013, and the U.K. staffing market appears to be returning to growth. We feel our non-U.S. staffing operations are well positioned to benefit in a stronger economic climate.","As we head into 2014, we see other encouraging signs. Small and midsized businesses are hiring. This is a key market segment for Robert Half. Companies of this size often lack their own human resources department, and as a result, they value our personalized, consultative approach. Small and midsized businesses are keenly aware that our fees are not expensive when compared to the cost of hiring the wrong person. The regulatory and compliance space is one area where we are seeing a greater need for skilled finance and information technology talent. Financial services regulations such as Dodd-Frank are creating demand by companies for compliance expertise. Likewise, U.S. health care reform and consumer protection regulations are fueling demand for our services. The global regulatory environment is creating demand for both Protiviti and staffing services. We also see upside in our technology staffing business. The push by companies to implement new technologies is driving new business for us, particularly among small and midsized clients. These businesses are investing in customized software, IT security, robust websites and social media. In addition, technology-driven marketing strategies and e-discovery are catalysts for our creative staffing business and for Robert Half Legal.","At this time, we'll be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R. W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering if you could -- first, I heard from others that they -- that everybody got kind of a blurred take from your guidance, Keith. Just the -- whatever audio you have fuzzed up. Can you just repeat the revenue guidance?","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. It's $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion.","Harold Max Messmer","Was that clear, Mark?","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That was clear. With regards to RH Technology, you're clearly seeing really terrific acceleration there. I'm wondering if the SG&A ramp is really tied into, in particular RH technology? And are you going to continue to over-index your investments there, given that -- in light of the good results? Or are there -- is there anything else that's going on with SG&A?","M. Keith Waddell","So SG&A certainly was higher this quarter than it would typically be. We talked a little last quarter that not only have we invested in headcount in Robert Half Technology, which is over-indexed to use your term, but we also began adding more broadly to our other divisions as well. We felt like, at the time, that things were getting more positive, the environment was getting more positive, so we began to add to headcount in the third quarter. We continued to add to headcount throughout the third quarter and into the early part of the fourth quarter. As we disclosed in our earlier remarks, we did add 8% to our overall headcount for the year, which is significantly faster than our revenues grew during the year. So in short, we were trying to get ahead of these positive trends. We clearly hired earlier than the revenues would otherwise dictate it. But frankly, the acceleration we saw in the fourth quarter, if anything, confirmed our belief that it was a good time to add to headcount broadly, not just limited to Robert Half Technology. As you then roll that into the first quarter, since most of the hiring took place at -- toward the back end of the third quarter and the front end of the fourth quarter, there's not much extra SG&A, if you will, that rolls into the first quarter. So our assumption would be, as a percent of revenue, that the first quarter, given the revenue guidance we gave, the first quarter SG&A percentage shouldn't be heavier than the fourth quarter, and if anything, will tick down a little bit.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then just switching gears over to Protiviti. Can you just give a little more color with regards to the areas that you're seeing the strongest level of demand? Obviously, it's been terrific. Looks like you may have also taken pricing up, given the sequential trends in gross profit relative to revenue.","M. Keith Waddell","Protiviti did have an excellent quarter. The prior quarter areas of strength continued, financial services, risk and compliance, IT security, continuity, controls, et cetera. The big upside relative to our own forecast was in the internal audit area, which had a huge fourth quarter. What we're finding there is as the PCAOB routinely performs its inspection of the Big 4 and their audits, what they're finding is that more documentation and more testing is needed of internal controls. That clearly trickled down to Protiviti. It saw a nice spike in its internal audit practice pretty much across the board and accounted for a lot of the upside in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Keith, could you start by going over what do you -- what is the implied constant currency same-day revenue growth in the first quarter guidance? And then my question around that is how did you take into account the couple of hundred basis points lift that we'll get as we move through the first quarter, as we anniversary that unusual January 2013 project end?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. So if you look at our guidance, at the midpoint, we're showing revenues growing to a little over 5%. So a 200 basis point acceleration versus the fourth quarter just ended, as you correctly stated, we should get a lift of 200 basis points from anniversary-ing the mortgage alone when we dialed in. Beyond that, because of the slow start that we had, which was largely weather-impacted, and as you know, we rarely invoke weather, but when we've had major offices lose 2 and 3 complete business days due to weather, it clearly impacted our start out of the gate this quarter, and we were, therefore, more conservative for the full quarter given that start. But overall, the midpoint of our guidance assumes a 200 basis point acceleration globally on year-over-year growth rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair & Co.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just to follow up on the SG&A, I guess, you talked about -- it sounds like you kind of slowed down the pace of additional hiring as you get early into the fourth quarter. I guess, were you -- what's your thought process as we move through the year? Is there a lot of capacity there, I guess, that you want to wait and see how that ends up? Or would you even -- do you feel like coming back on that if you don't see it? I guess, where do we sit just in terms of additional headcount that you mentioned?","M. Keith Waddell","We felt like we added a lot of capacity in staffing across the board in 2013. Given the revenue trends, we're happy about that. For the next quarter or 2, we believe, given the capacity we've added in '13, we can take it easy on the headcount additions and lever the investments that we made. It'd come later in the second quarter into the third, if the revenue trends continue, as we've seen recently, we would, again, dial the headcount up. But over the course of the year, you should see more normal relationships between headcount and revenues. Should the trend turn around on us, as we've proven we'll do many times in the past, we would reverse some of that investment if market conditions dictated. That said, I'll tell you, having spoken to our people, not only in staffing, but in Protiviti, and frankly, they're as optimistic, they are as positive as they've been in a long, long time.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, international, it seems -- for Protiviti, it seems that you saw the international piece pick up here. I know you've mentioned internal audit. But I guess, can you -- is that piece of Protiviti starting to kick in like you've seen in the U.S.? Or is it too early to say that?","M. Keith Waddell","So international Protiviti, we had a very good year in Europe with international Protiviti, with the revenue growth rates. I'm happy to report that Europe Protiviti was profitable not only in the fourth quarter. It was profitable for the full year, which was a huge improvement from where it had been in the past. Our profitability challenge remains in Asia, and we're working hard to diversify the revenue sources to rationalize their cost structure and to improve our operating margins there. But I'd say, internationally in staffing, we also saw improvement during the quarter. If we kind of take a quick tour of the world, in the U.K., the fourth quarter got more positive year-over-year. The outlook is for even more positive than the first quarter. Belgium was less negative. The outlook is, we might even turn positive in the first quarter. Germany was slightly negative in the fourth quarter. The thinking is we might actually go positive in the first quarter there. France was less negative. The outlook would be to get even less negative again. Australia, same. Less negative in the quarter. Outlook is for less negative again. And Canada was more negative, slightly, and the outlook is that stays about the same. So when you put all that together in staffing, while we might not get to even year-over-year in revenues, we think we can get close in the coming first quarter, which is a nice improvement and a continuation of the trend we've seen for the last 2 or 3 quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you give us an update on pricing trends and bill pay spreads?","M. Keith Waddell","On pricing, it was pretty consistent. I think we were up 1.7% year-over-year. Pricing in the U.S. actually got a little better quarter-on-quarter. Pricing non-U.S. declined a little bit quarter-on-quarter. Pay bill spreads were pretty much consistent between the third and fourth quarter. The spike you saw in gross margin was almost entirely attributed to the workers' compensation accrual adjustment pursuant to the outside actuarial review, and we broke that out for you, it was $2.7 million pretax.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then 2 other quick questions. The first is, Keith, could you give us the number of days for the rest of the year? And then second, Max, in your comments you mentioned health care reform as being one driver. I'm wondering if your clients are really focusing on that yet, and how those discussions are going?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay, as to the number of days, let me just give you by quarter how we calculated 2014. So for quarter 2, 63.2. For quarter 3, 64.2. For quarter 4, 61.7. Full year, 251.5, compares to 251.6 a year ago. As to health care reform, we're not seeing much in our small business clientele, trying to stay below 50, the way we've talked in the future. We are seeing some pockets of strength with both health care providers and with insurance companies in their customer service functions, primarily with OfficeTeam, as they deal with the transition to ObamaCare. So a different kind of demand, and we've talked about in the past, but it did, for OfficeTeam, move the needle a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Keith, I think you'd mentioned, I think, it was a quarter or 2 ago, there was sort of 300 basis points for mortgage. And now it's sort of 200 basis points. Was the 100 basis points of loss from the weather, is that the difference? And then second, can you just give us an update on the drag from mortgage processing? Is it getting worse or same?","Harold Max Messmer","I'm sorry but we only heard the last few words of your question. There must have been a technical problem. Would you mind repeating that, please?","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sure. I was asking about 2 things. One, mortgage processing. Can we get an update on that? Is that more of a drag, less of a drag than it's been in the past, the last couple quarters? And then, I thought that the cycling of the foreclosure work was 300 basis points of acceleration, but it seems like it's now 200 basis points, is the difference the weather impact year-to-date?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay, for the foreclosure look-back, the 300 basis points is Accountemps and management resources. That has an impact of 200 basis points for all divisions combined. So that's how the 300 and the 200 relate. As to the impact of mortgage refinancing, mortgage origination, unrelated to the look-back project, it's been pretty stable the last couple of quarters. And the fourth quarter frankly didn't look much different than the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Back to Protiviti, I know you'd mentioned that headcount for both employers and contractors was up about 7%. I'm not sure if you're willing to talk about it. But I was wondering did you have this beginning [ph] of the year, was it added towards the end? I'm just curious how this is trending currently?","M. Keith Waddell","It's -- Protiviti is back down, got added pretty consistently for the course of the year. And -- so maybe we should talk a little about it, a little about Protiviti guidance into the first quarter generally. So Protiviti has tremendous momentum going into the first quarter. As we've learned for many years, particularly in internal audit, seasonally, that declines in the first quarter, and our expectation would be that on a quarter-on-quarter sequential basis, revenues would be down somewhere in the 8% to 9%. That said, it still puts revenues up year-over-year on a double-digit basis. From a Protiviti operating income standpoint, again, year-on-year, the expectation for the first quarter will be very strong, up 80% to 90%. But sequentially, that's going to be down 50% or 60%. So when you do your modeling, let's not forget that seasonally, Protiviti declines as internal audit work gets crowded out by external audit work in the first quarter. And given Protiviti's contribution to our overall profitability, that seasonal decline has a much larger impact than it has for several years.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great, that was helpful. A couple of numbers questions, just for 2014, what you're budgeting for capital expenditures and what tax rate we should use for the rest of the year?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay, CapEx, our forecast is $60 million to $65 million, which is up a little bit from 2013. But 2013 was actually a little below what we had forecast for 2013. And importantly, the tax rate, we're looking at 39%, which is up 200 to 300 basis points from 2013. We did some restructuring in late 2012 that allowed us to use tax credits during 2013. Those have pretty much been exhausted, so our tax rate for 2014 returns to a more traditional level. And that more traditional level is closer to 39%. So again, when you do your comparisons, a year ago between quarter 4 and quarter 1, the tax rate went down. This year, between quarter 4 and quarter 1, the tax rate is going up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Keith, I think you just answered my question, but I wanted to just clarify. It looks like the revenue guidance is similar -- is basically the same as Q4. The EPS, I know, $0.02 of it is kind of from higher tax. The incremental kind of $0.02, is that just lower contribution from Protiviti. Or how should we think about that?","M. Keith Waddell","It's precisely that mix issue. Protiviti's seasonality provides that on a sequential basis, their operating income goes down. But notwithstanding that, year-on-year, their operating income is up between 80% and 90%. So it's going to be a hell of a quarter. But measured against their blowout quarter in the fourth quarter, it goes down somewhat for very traditional, very understandable, seasonal reasons.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Understood. I know you typically don't talk weather, if it's 2 to 3 days, any sense of what the revenue impact in terms of dollar amount would be just as we're thinking about the Q1?","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. So our U.S. revenue per day is about $11 million. And we're not talking every office losing 2 or 3 days. We're talking about primarily east of Chicago. But we've had major offices lose 2 and 3 full days, even the Southeast yesterday was impacted. So it's very hard to kind of quantify, putting all of those together, precisely what the impact is. But when 1 billing day, 1 equivalent billing day for the whole country is $11 million, it impacts the revenues quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The first question, on Protiviti. Since you had -- I understand the internal audit, the demand growth in the financial compliance area and technology, are those seasonal as well? Or is that more evenly spread? I guess I'm wondering if it's seasonality, that business will be reduced if those continue to be strong demand drivers over time.","M. Keith Waddell","You are precisely correct. There is not the seasonality in FSI risk and compliance and IT consulting that there is in internal audit. And over time, as they become a larger portion of the total, there will be less seasonality into the first quarter. That said, a lot of the outperformance during the fourth quarter was, in fact, internal audit. And it's that piece that's the most seasonal. And therefore, when we're looking sequentially, there's a larger impact than what we've seen in the last few years. But it's a good thing. Internal audit did really well in the fourth quarter. They had an extremely good quarter. We talked about Protiviti getting to double-digit operating margins forever. Well, guess what? We were solidly [ph] double-digit in this fourth quarter, and we still had some drag from Asia outside the U.S. So we're very pleased with Protiviti's fourth quarter. We're very pleased with their profitability. But there is seasonality in the business, which impacts our guidance for the first quarter.","Harold Max Messmer","But just to emphasize your comments on internal audit, it is very much annuity-like in large part, and obviously, we like that.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. No, no, I totally understand, it makes sense. I'm just wondering if it might shift over time. It sounds like it could if those practices do well. The follow-up question, just on the temp segment, SG&A on the temp segment, operating margins, despite the workers' comp credit, the margin went down a little bit sequentially. And I guess just how should we think about that moving forward? Is there -- do you think that the slowing headcount growth [indiscernible] versus this year should allow that to start moving back up? Or is there anything else going on?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, frankly, it's all about headcount and field compensation of recruiters and sales people. And as we get ahead of the revenue curve and the second half of 2013 it directly impacts temp [ph] operating margins","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing some technical difficulties. Please standby. Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse North America.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could give a little more color on what you're seeing in the Accountemps business. It seems that business has been pretty stable in terms of dollar revenue per quarter. Any color there? And maybe some more color on Canada. That business, you said, got more negative but has stabilized.","M. Keith Waddell","Well, Accountemps, we're very optimistic about. We just anniversary-ed foreclosure look-back, which for that division alone adds 300 basis points. I said earlier that as we've spoken with our people internally, they couldn't be more optimistic, and that includes Accountemps. So we feel good about the momentum going into 2014 as it relates to Accountemps. As to Canada, the market has been a bit softer there. We've had some internal management changes over the last 6 to 9 months.","[Audio Gap]","3%, 4% of revenue overall.","[Audio Gap]","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry, I think you guys just cut out again.","M. Keith Waddell","I see. So I said, as to Accountemps, we remain very bullish. Our people are very pleased with the momentum we have going into the year with Accountemps, including the anniversary-ing of the foreclosure look-back business a year ago. As to Canada, the market there has been somewhat weaker of late than is the case in the United States. And to add to that, we've had some management changes that we feel good will produce even better results as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about what you feel like your ability is to harness pricing power if your businesses continue to accelerate, we get a little bit of a macro tailwind. So it's kind of a more of a medium- and longer-term question.","M. Keith Waddell","On pricing, history would say, as macro gets better, there's pressure on wage rates. We have to pay our temporary employees more. As we pay our temporary employees more, our clients understand that the market firms from a candidate point of view, and then that gives us an opportunity to not only pass-through the higher wage rate but to get a little more margin on it as well. So traditionally, we do quite well in improving macro environments from a pricing standpoint, and we certainly hope to do the same again. In the U.S. this quarter, our pricing did improve a little, but that got offset by a little bit of decline outside the U.S.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And my follow-up question is, is the 39% tax rate the right rate to think about longer term, beyond 2014?","M. Keith Waddell","If you look back for a few years, you'll see 39% or 40%, in that range, as more of a typical income tax rate for us. It was low for 2013 because of the utilization of the foreign tax credits, as we talked about earlier.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Randy Reece of Avondale Partners.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Is there any difference in your interest, willingness, eagerness to invest in permanent placement capacity versus temporary and contract staffing, recruiting and service on an incremental basis right now?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I would say that we've -- relative to recorded revenues, we've invested more in the temp business over the course of 2013. That said, we've also over-indexed, to use the prior term, the hiring we've done in the perm business. Our temp business is about 90% of prior peak, and our perm business is about 75% of prior peak. We actually believe we got a good shot at exceeding those peaks. So given that, we're not bashful about adding to headcount, either area.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I was surprised at the pickup in growth in Robert Half Technology, especially given that kind of a difference in billing days. Is there any difference between U.S. and international growth there? And to what do you attribute the acceleration?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as the U.S. versus international, we have a much smaller exposure internationally in tech than we do most of our other divisions. It's limited primarily at this moment to Germany. So tech non-U.S. doesn't move the needle overall. As to the acceleration, we've been making investments in Tech internally now for several quarters. We get more traction as our people get more experience, more up to speed, become better recruiters. It's a very candidate-driven market. We typically have more orders than we do candidates. So it's all about recruiting. As our newer staff become better recruiters, the growth rate reflects that.","Operator","Today's last question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one question, on typical seasonality for the first quarter, you were kind enough to remind us about Protiviti. I think for the rest of the staffing business, there's some both headwinds and tailwinds as you go into the first quarter. What does your guidance anticipate in terms of seasonal trends for the staffing business, the non-Protiviti business?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, it's all baked into the 5% year-over-year midpoint growth rate. But as we look at the divisions, OfficeTeam in the fourth quarter benefits by holiday-related customer service demand, which falls off in the first quarter. So it typically has the largest headwind in the first quarter. The Tech business and management resources, which are project-based, many projects in December and you have a little more difficult time getting them restarted in January. That typically means there's a little seasonal softness in tech and management resources. And Accountemps typically does just a touch better. But when you put them all together, there isn't a huge staffing seasonal impact.","Harold Max Messmer","That was our last question. We appreciate you joining us on today's call.

Income per share was $0.61, cash flow from operations was $82 million in the fourth quarter and capital expenditures were $20 million.","We returned $28 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.22 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $51 million.","We have 6.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan; these results were within the range of guidance we provided last quarter. Robert Half continued to benefit from a tightening job market and solid service demand domestically and in our non-US markets during the fourth quarter.","International staffing operations performed particularly well, and Protiviti also reported year-over-year revenue gains. For a while now, we have highlighted on these calls our unlevered return on equity, which remained strong during the fourth quarter at 29 %.","I will turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our fourth-quarter results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As Max just noted, global revenues were $1.265 billion in the fourth quarter. This is down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2015 on a reported basis, and down 1% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.","Fourth-quarter staffing revenues were down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $845 million in the fourth quarter, down 4% on a same-day basis.","Non-US staffing revenues were $219 million, up 5% when adjusted for billing days and currency-exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.","The fourth quarter had 61.4 billing days, compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter one year ago. The current quarter has 63.4 billing days, compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter of last year.","Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis.","This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","Currency-exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the fourth quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.6%.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $201 million in the fourth quarter, with $170 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the U.S.","Protiviti revenues were up 5% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were also up 5%.","Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.5%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.","Now, let\u2019s turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter.","This is a 70 basis-point improvement from the same period one year ago, and relates primarily to higher pay\/bill spreads and lower insurance and payroll tax costs.","Our fourth quarter results include $4.3 million in workers\u2019 compensation credits, pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers\u2019 compensation accruals.","Fourth-quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 8.9 % of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down 30 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 50 basis points versus one year ago, to 43.5%.","Fourth-quarter gross margin for Protiviti was 57 million, or 28.3% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin one year ago for Protiviti was $62 million, or 32.0% of Protiviti revenues.","Staffing SG&A costs were 33.6% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter, versus 32.5% in the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter. We ended 2016 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, flat with the prior year.","SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.0% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2016 with 4,000 full-time employees and contractors for Protiviti, up 5% from the prior year.","Operating income from our staffing divisions was 105 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income, a decrease of 9% from the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.4%.","Operating income for our permanent placement division was 14 million in the fourth quarter, down 22% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 14.4%.","Fourth-quarter operating profit for Protiviti was 20 million, a decrease of 26% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 10%. At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were 703 million. Implied days sales outstanding was 50.6 days.","Before we move to first-quarter guidance, let\u2019s review the monthly revenue trends we saw during the fourth quarter of 2016 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency.","During the quarter, average daily revenues for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions were essentially flat with the immediately preceding third quarter. In years past, we often had sequential growth during this period. Accordingly, on a year-over-year basis, our growth rates were negative and became slightly more negative as the quarter progressed.","We exited the quarter down 2.5% in December versus the prior year, compared to a 1.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first two weeks of January was down 2.6% compared to the prior year.","Global permanent placement negative revenue growth rates were fairly consistent throughout the quarter, with December revenues down 4.2% versus a 4.9% decline for the full quarter. So far in January, permanent placement revenues are down 18.8% compared to the same period last year.","This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But, as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time, and they cover holiday periods, which can be volatile.","With that said, we offer the following first-quarter guidance: Revenue, 1.250 billion to 1.310 billion; Income per share, $0.55 to $0.61. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 2% on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis, including Protiviti, and an EPS decline of 9%.","We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We ended the year with annual revenues that once again surpassed $5 billion and, in fact, reached an all-time high. We saw solid demand across the board for our professional staffing and consulting divisions, although clients were more cautious during the quarter, particularly in December.","All indications are that the U.S. job market continues to tighten. Unemployment for college -degreed workers 25years and older is just 2.5% today. This is placing pressure on the labor supply, particularly at higher skill levels.","And the number of temporary workers as a percentage of the overall U.S. workforce remains near an all time high, a sign employers are building flexible staffing options into their human resources plans with increasing frequency.","We are also encouraged by recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business that showed that, while hiring levels did not increase in the fourth quarter, small business optimism reached its highest level since December 2004. Outside of the United States, we also see improving markets. Our international staffing operations had a solid fourth quarter.","As we look at the coming year, we are optimistic about the technology investments we have made, which are designed to foster and accelerate continued innovation. In 2016, we migrated our global staffing teams to a new unified front office CRM system, and we moved Protiviti\u2019s North American operations to a new resource management system.","Going forward, we will continue to expand our client and candidate facing digital functionality. We have already introduced new online services, including the ability to search candidate profiles on our websites.","To serve up the best matches, we have developed intelligent matching algorithms based on nearly 70 years of placement experience. And we are constantly working to improve these algorithms through machine learning.","We offer innovative matching technology to find temporary and full-time job candidates with the right skills, but technology alone cannot produce the right fit.","There are many steps in the staffing and on boarding processes, including assessing the chemistry and business culture fit between the employer and the job candidate and, in the case of temporary assignments, the person\u2019s availability.","Our major competitive advantage lies in the combination of technology and personal service that we provide, because it gives our clients the best opportunity to avoid costly and disruptive staffing mistakes and find the right person every time for their business needs.","Finally, a few closing notes about Protiviti, which had a solid fourth quarter. We are optimistic about the considerable opportunities in the year ahead for this business.","Protiviti has focused on diversifying its service offerings, developing and growing a loyal client base, and hiring and rewarding great talent all with very good results. This business is seeing solid demand across all practice areas right now.","At this time, Keith and I would be happy to respond to your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird.","Mark Marcon","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we could talk about the U.S. staffing trends just a little more color there. Can you discuss on to what extent do you think it was driven by caution among potential employers and if there was any sort of vertical concentration in terms of that caution. And then two what extent would you attribute the trends to both tightness of the labor supply and the ability to fill the orders? Thank you.","Harold Messmer","Sure. Mark. As it relates to U.S. trends and toner business, on the one hand conversationally our people would tell you that client optimism, client sentiment has clearly and markedly improved. With that said when you look at their actual activity levels as we speak.","There is a little sense of urgency, they are waiting for the perfect candidate, they take more time to that, more time to interview, it's more a wait and see and show me as it relates to the more optimistic view that they have, as confirmed by the NFIB study that we cited, the University of Michigan Sentiment Index, the PMI services that came out today.","So our clients clearly feel better, they are more optimistic but that's in the future and they are waiting to see more activity in their business before their hiring activity reflects that.","I would say there is not a particular vertical concentration it's pretty much across the board, our clients across our verticals are pretty much middle market companies.","From a supply and demand standpoint, we would observe it\u2019s more about demand than it is supply. On the one hand, when they wait for the perfect candidate you have fewer perfect candidates than you have candidates overall.","That said, if there was more urgency in their need, they would be more accepting of the best candidate available. So our people would tell you between having more A level orders versus having more candidates, they would take more orders than they would take candidates.","Having said that, we would observe that our order levels have improved in the New Year, which would be expected following the holidays, which we have experienced again this year. So tone of business, the conversations are more upbeat, there is more optimism, but as far as actual hard making placements, getting starts on the temp side, it remains sluggish.","Mark Marcon","I appreciate the color, just with regards to the comment that you made about the orders picking up, obviously seasonally that would occur. Is it also, are the orders improving on a year-over-year basis relative to the recent trend. And typically when you start hearing some more positive chatter from the clients, is there a historical precedent that you would say here is the rough benchmark between the time that they start chattering a little bit more positively versus real action. Thank you.","Harold Messmer","Well we have never gotten too granular with order data, because kind of the quality of the order and the urgency of the order is just as important as the quantity of the order, there is no question there is a lag between better order activity and actual hours billed and that lag also changes over time.","So we don't want to make too much of the fact that order activity has improved, because some of that is seasonal, that said it's certainly consistent with the better optimism and the better sentiment that anecdotally our people are seeing with their clients.","Mark Marcon","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Great thanks and very helpful commentary. Keith it looks like the revenue guide is pretty close to Q4 and kind of a Q1 which typically there is some seasonality where I know where but I would have typically expected a step down, but there is a delta in the EPS, can we just kind of walk through what the delta on the EPS. Is it kind of payroll tax reset, is that additional investments in sales force as you position for this optimism, is there any way to frame kind of the bridge between the EPS guide relative to the revenue and again the revenue seems relatively consistent with Q4, but there is a delta on the EPS.","Keith Waddell","Well the revenue, the midpoint of the revenue pretty much assumes that the trends existed in the latter part of the fourth quarter continue into the first. Gross margin, we don\u2019t have in the first quarter the payroll tax and insurance true up credits that we had in the fourth quarter, and those credits are about 68 basis points when you add workers\u2019 comp to state and federal unemployment.","So the absence of those credits impacts profitability clearly, further your SG&A dollars are about even year-on-year, but your slightly lower revenues give you some negative leverage and then Protiviti seasonally the first quarter is their seasonally slowest quarter, so if we are looking sequentially they never do in their first quarter what they do in their fourth, but I will say this, if you look at that sequential trend there is less falloff in our guidance in Q1 2017 sequentially in their operating income then was the case in Q1 2016 so that's a good thing.","So, generally speaking, it's less revenue, it's the absence of the true up credits, the tax rate will be higher, so the tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6 which was a little under trend which is 38ish. Our tax rate guidance for the first quarter is somewhere between 38.75, 38.5 and there is always volatility there so little of its tax rate as well, but it's mostly revenues, a couple of points lower, gross margin, the absence of the credits, SG&A a little negative leverage because of the revenues and a higher tax rate.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. I mean it sounds like fundamentally things are in this holding pattern until we get one way or the other from the macro perspective. Just real quick if I could, with the new administration and there is been talk about H1Bs and stuff like that going away, how does that impact the model particularly as we think about the IT business?","Harold Messmer","Well first of all we do virtually no H1B directly as far as the people that we supply to the extent that the industry uses fewer H1Bs, and therefore everybody focuses on the domestic supply, potentially that tightens the supply and generally speaking, we would think that's a good thing.","I mean it's already tight at the high end on the development side, but as I said earlier, if you ask our people technology included, technology development included, they would tell you that they take more orders if they had to choose between more orders and more supply.","So, we don't expect that the supply thing is growth constraining to a significant degree and H1B certainly directly won't impact our business, potentially they could indirectly impact it.","Kevin McVeigh","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Henry Chen","Hey good afternoon, it's Henry Chen calling for Jeff. Just had a follow-up question on the impact of the new administration. I'm just curious what type of initiatives that are you most paying attention to from the new Trump administration or policies? Thanks.","Harold Messmer","Well I think the most directly impactful would be the discussed reduction in corporate tax rates. Understand that we are a full tax rate company; we pay 35 federal, 3.5 state to get you to the 38.5 I just talked about. Further understand that about 97% of our global income is taxed at U.S. rates.","So, not only is our U.S. income taxed at U.S. rates, much of our non-U.S. income gets taxed at U.S. rates as well, and further I would say to the extent there have been discussions about the new tax plan having offset we would have no interest deductibility offset.","We would have essentially no deemed repatriation tax offset, we would have no order adjustment or order tax adjustment offset, so frankly based on everything discussed so far we get all the benefit and none of the offset.","Henry Chen","Got it, okay. And just a question on your hiring outlook if trends kind of stay in this kind of sluggish environment how you are thinking about hiring or adapting the temp business in this kind of environment? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","So I would say it's a little bit bifurcated, non-U.S. things are improving particularly Germany, Belgium. There we are adding to headcounts in support of that growth in the U.S. where our growth rates are a bit negative were essentially holding the line.","Particularly given the optimism in the air that we hope converts into actual hours billed and placements we are holding the line. So you are going to get a little bit in negative leverages I just talked about and the short-term, but we think prudent given anticipated market conditions.","Henry Chen","Got it, okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair and Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Just want to ask a little more in productivity the gross margin being down year-over-year. It was a tough comp but there is also a comment I think Max in your prepared remarks by trying at the first business and investing in it. So I guess how do we think about the gross margin kind of there and the margin profile more so that I know you talked about first quarter but just more broadly how we think forward from it on that business?","Harold Messmer","And so Tim the Protiviti gross margin came in very close to what we have predicted it would the issue year-on-year is the mix of business where as a year-ago we had a higher mix of higher margin FSI regulatory compliance work versus this year we have a lower mix of that and that which we do have has a lower margin than it did a year ago, although that margin is still higher than our average margin.","So it\u2019s essentially a mix matter, it's a matter we have done with now for a few quarters. The good news is staring in Q1 2017 you are anniversaring that mix issue such that in Q1 2017, we think the gross margin percentage will be flattish versus down year-on-year, which it has been for a few quarters now because of that mix issue.","Tim McHugh","Okay, and you are not is there any reason to think that mix will continue to change I guess would be and I guess your answer says no, but just to make sure.","Keith Waddell","Mix is stabilized FSI regulatory has flat now it actually got a little better quite frankly. So we are optimistic that in worst case it's stabilize and it maybe it's gets a little better.","Tim McHugh","Okay, and then just the follow-up on second question. The new tools you Max refer to them in the comments they both internal as well as some of the things you put on the website. The market is obviously not great. So I guess it's maybe tough to tell, but anything you can tell us about to the extent they are having a difference internal operations efficiency, kind of lead flow or is it just too hard to tell too early to tell in this environment?","Keith Waddell","I guess what we can say is we track the extent to which we are getting leads that then converts to revenue from our digital sources what is hard to know is how much of that would you have gotten anyway. So if you look just at the absolute numbers they are encouraging, particularly how early day it is and particularly how we hadn\u2019t rolled it out thoroughly to all location. So we feel good about to the extent to which we are interacting with our clients in a digital way, which is significantly more than we ever have before.","Harold Messmer","I would just add what Keith said, it's early and I think the feel will get better and better at using these tools as we go forward, but results to-date are encouraging.","Tim McHugh","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Anj Singh","Hi thanks for taking my questions. First a follow-up on Protiviti. With some of the potential changes in the regulatory landscape under the new administration what is your outlook on the strength this business has been seeing from increased regulatory scrutiny in areas like financial services and could you update us on perhaps Protiviti's end market mix as it stands today.","Keith Waddell","Okay, as to changes in the regulatory landscape as we talked about before on these calls, FSI regulatory for Protiviti is principally anti money laundering and consumer lending practices and regulation thereof.","So the view of Protiviti is the anti money laundering piece of what they do probably doesn't get impacted very much by proposed changes to regulations if anything to the extent it relates to protecting our border, it might get better before it gets worse.","On the consumer lending side while there is some discussion about relaxing the CFPB and other consumer lending, the thought there is based on what has been proposed at least, there is not a view that there would be a significant impact.","On the positive side the discussions about cyber and the importance of cyber and the regulations related to cyber particularly for FSI would be an opportunity for us, because of the technology consulting practice that Protiviti has is very focused on security and cyber would be right in their wheelhouse.","Further Protiviti typically works with the largest of the money center banks and it's viewed that the banks that would most benefit from a relaxed regulatory environment would be more the middle market the non money-center banks to the extent CIPI designation moves to a larger size and probably isn't going to impact Protiviti's clients as much as they would smaller financial institutions.","So net-net it\u2019s the view internally at least as to what's understood today is that it shouldn't have significant negative impact and on the cyber side there could be some upside.","Anj Singh","Okay, got it, that's super helpful, and then Max wanted to get your thoughts on the earlier comments made on the disconnect between the small business optimism and the lack of increase in hiring levels. As you see this translate to actual hard making of placements as referenced by Keith earlier. Do you anticipate this to show up more markedly, for your temp business or your perm business considering that the tightness in the labor market where temp penetration stands today.","Harold Messmer","I think to some extent we are speculating, I'm personally not surprised that you haven't seen a big pickup yet in terms of the NFIB report for example. Optimism has to precede hiring and if you looked at the fourth quarter through much of the quarter people seem to be in a very bad mood, negative about the election and so forth.","At the end of the day our types of clients are the types that they want to, they are from [indiscernible], wait and see, show me and so forth. So I think that the good news is the optimism is up as they start seeing more activity and so forth among their own clients, I think their hiring levels will pick up they'll move more rapidly our placement processes might get condensed. so if you want to be an optimist there is a lot to be optimistic about.","And when Keith talked about the tax proposals that the Trump administration, I have to admit it\u2019s hard for us to constrain ourselves because I don\u2019t see anything negative at all in any of that for us, so that would be a very good thing for us.","But I think we'll just have to wait and see what happens, we are optimistic though that these changes if they continue in terms of optimism and so forth will need to increase the placement activity as well as temporary activity.","Anj Singh","Okay thank you and one last quick housekeeping question from me. Could you just comment on bill pay spreads in the quarter and conversions at both Q4 and Q3?","Harold Messmer","So bill pay spreads were stronger during the quarter, the conversions which often follow permanent placement per se were softer during the quarter they were around 2.9% of revenue which was down 20 basis points from the third quarter, so conversion softer, pay bill spread stronger.","When you put the package together with the credit, the true up credits we got on the pay roll taxes overall they were up. Our guidance for the first quarter is that year-on-year you will get 10 to 30 basis points of improvement, which is principally higher pay bills spreads, for the moment and we have held everything else pretty constant.","Anj Singh","Okay, thanks so much I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good evening gentlemen. I guess the near-term trends still look like they're tough to you guys, but there were signs of optimism thinking out a little further ahead, and the one question I had around that was capacity like, I guess how should we think about the utilization that was today if things do start getting better like you need to ramp up, do you have the capacity, any way to think about that?","Harold Messmer","I would say that in the short-term particularly we are carrying capacity, we have pretty much held our U.S. headcounts level for a few quarters, we have added to headcounts modestly outside the U.S., but in the short-term if we see an increase in the activity levels in the U.S. I think there would be a few quarters where you could do that without a commensurate increase in our staff levels.","Manav Patnaik","Okay that\u2019s helpful, and I guess just the follow-up was just around the ACA, when that first come out there was a lot of noise around your stock and what that could mean. I guess it ended up being not much of an impact really, but just curious on if how you guys think about whether the repeal and replace if that will have any impact on the other side?","Keith Waddell","So, early on there was optimism about the revenue, the incremental revenue we would get because of ACA with smaller companies trying to avoid thresholds by using temporaries, that never really came to pass. On the flip side, there was concern that many of our temporaries would qualify for medical insurance that theretofore had not, that never really came to fruition either, because those they qualified tended not to elect the coverage. So, frankly just like there ultimately wasn't much impact initially we don't think there would be much impact by the replace and repeal, or appeal or replace.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee","Hi good afternoon. On the perm business, I guess I just wanted to ask what is implied at the midpoint of the guide or the range of outcomes for Q1. Normally that improves sequentially on a dollar basis as you get into budget year, and is that happening or should we think that the weak start to January that you referenced is an indication that you haven't seen that normal seasonal but I realize it's early but?","Harold Messmer","So, the first thing we would say about the January start and if you look back in history, the perm start relative to the ultimate quarter is the least predictive of all and so you don't have to look back to many quarters where you see us down double-digits, where we end up down much less than that or even up.","So, we read very little into the start, particularly when the start includes a couple of holidays, which it always does in January, the holidays they fall on different days, peoples patterns about the time they take off differs to some degree based on which day of the week the holiday falls, so it's a noisy start, it's always noisy, but it's even noisier based on day of week.","Our guidance assumes a little bit of sequential dollar growth, a little bit but less than what we have seen in the past, and therefore year-on-year the growth rate would be more negative in our guidance for Q1 than what we just saw.","Gary Bisbee","Okay thanks and then just a follow-up, on Protiviti, outside of the financial regulatory, which you have talked a lot about in recent quarters can you just give us some color on how the rest of the business is doing should we think that. I think IT and some of the other areas that you have talked about in the past that have been doing well are those slowing as well as it is just a comps issues or just any update on demand outside of financial regulatory? Thank you.","Harold Messmer","The story is good there the two other major practice areas Protiviti are internal audit and the other one is technology, which is principally security and those have been very solid. The one that's been the most volatile has been the FSI regulatory compliance consulting area, but internal audit done very well, you still got PCA or B hammering external audit firms about their client controls, which ultimately trickles down to the benefit of internal audit that Protiviti benefits from IT security, cyber hardly a day goes by where there is it some kind of reach something in that areas that needs attention. So we have very solid a year or two or three in internal audit and in technology security and we remain positive into 2017.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you. Question for you about the changes to the tax code that are being discussed. I think you addressed it from your own internal cash flow perspective, but historically when you have seen kind of broad changes to the tax code what has been the impact on demand for your services and kind of where if anywhere have you felt change in demand as a result of these kinds of changes that are being discussed currently? Thanks.","Harold Messmer","Well tax code changes, changes are always good, in that clients have to figure out what is new, what is different, and comply with the new regs. So change is always good. The more the change the better from the standpoint that you need help to comply, has it been a major driver of incremental revenue no, but at the margin it\u2019s good more so than it's bad.","Tobey Sommer","Okay, in terms of the tax page. Have you been hearing from your customers an increased tenancy for kind of domestic labor there seems to be a lot of push back against off shoring into the extent that of that occurs less over the next four years. Do you have any expectations what that can do for other demand protect and or kind of bill rate and growth rates? Thanks.","Harold Messmer","Well, first of all because we deal primarily with middle market companies, there has never been that much appetite from our clients for off-shoring and therefore it's never had that begin impact. Clearly you hear more about reassuring, your hear more about insuring there is several terms that get used for domestic. But other than the extent to which it pressures supply, we don\u2019t think our business would be that impacted one way or the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Reece from Avondale Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Randy Reece","Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about how labor supply is affecting your growth potential in your view first then you asking them outside the U.S.?","Harold Messmer","So it is true that as clients take more time they are more selective and they want only what they view is the perfect candidate and clearly our supply of perfect candidates is different than our supply of solid candidates and therefore one could say that our growth is being constrained by candidate supply.","However we wouldn't really articulate it that way, because in a normal demand environment where there is more sense of urgency to get your projects done, to get your people hired, they are more flexible in adjusting to market conditions the candidates that are available.","So as we said earlier, if we were given a choice today between more quality orders and more quality supply we would take the order side. If we had to choose, we will take both but if we have to choose we will take more quality orders. Non-US while supply is always an issue it certainly hasn't risen to the level of significantly growth constraining issue.","Randy Reece","Very good, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie, your line is open please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] queuing in for Hamzah. You guys had a cultural base as you guys have mentioned it's mostly small mid-sized companies can you give us a sense of whether there is a correlation to your sales from small business competency mix, because that's been up recently and you guys see that impacting either presently or going into a 2017.","Keith Waddell","I don't think there is a hard correlation if you are talking about NFIB optimism index, there is certainly a directional correlation and therefore we are encouraged to see the optimism index improve and in fact improve significantly based on what it had.","I think if you look at NFIB, if you look at University of Michigan Sentiment they're both back to 2004 levels, that's a really good thing and we are encouraged by that.","But if you do a Lee Squares correlation on that index versus or either those index versus our revenues, I don't think you are going to find a number that's going to be that meaningful overall, but again directionally I do think it's helpful and I do think it's predictive.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray, your line is open please go ahead.","Adrian Paz","Hi this is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. I just wanted to touch on account temp specifically and see if you could discuss trends that you are seeing for the U.S. and if there is any specific areas or weakness or increasing competition or if there is a, you know just a broad based slowdown.","Keith Waddell","So similar to the other divisions, account temps flattened out during the fourth quarter, didn't go down in an absolute sense, it flattened out based on where it had been in the third quarter and that compares to a typical fourth quarter where you get some sequential lift, therefore the year-over-year comparison is a negative, but in an absolute sense it\u2019s not negative it\u2019s flat.","If you look at the components of account temps the accounting operations portion of account temps which is accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll the transactional [physicians] (Ph), they are the most impacted, that's expected, that's consistent they are the most macro sensitive positions within account temps.","Our guidance for the first quarter is that on a sequential basis they decline a little going into the first quarter but not significantly but you're still going to get a year over year negative from that phenomenon.","Adrian Paz","Thanks and can you discuss pricing trends in the temp segment and how you balance between pushing bill rates and margins versus targeting higher bill rates.","Keith Waddell","So our bill rate for the quarter were up 3.6% year-over-year that's very consistent with last quarter, which was 3.5%. You are always balancing pricing and volume. We provide our people with a lot of authority, a lot of autonomy in that way, but 3.5ish up to 4% bill rate\/wage inflation has been pretty consistent last few quarters.","Adrian Paz","Do you think that's impacting placement negotiations, or your placement for temps?","Harold Messmer","Well they are always part of a negotiation, but with a middle market client they typically need one or two people for a few months, and the bill rate is rarely the most important part of that discussion, not that it's not important.","I think you will find that our pricing power has been intact for almost 30 years that\u2019s now something we are quite proud of, but it's also a function of the [1sy, 2sy] (Ph) nature of the volumes at which we place as well as the middle market accounts that we deal with.","Adrian Paz","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking my question. We have a very pro-growth President, I mean this seems unprecedented, I mean do you think there is any chance we would be getting into a new cycle or do you see this just a continuation of the prior cycle?","Harold Messmer","I'm not sure you can parse a reacceleration as to whether that means it's new or whether it's a continuation of the prior. As long as it gets better frankly it doesn't really matter what you want to label it. We will take and our clients feel better, they do, our clients are more optimistic.","You just don\u2019t see it yet. But we are encouraged that our clients are encouraged, we would be more encouraged if our clients were actually acting on it, but they need to get to encouraged before they start acting on it. So, we will take what we can get.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you and as a follow-up if we did get a tax reform, what would you do with the cash?","Keith Waddell","As is consistent with our practice for many-many years we first look into the needs of our business from a capital standpoint, we deal with those, our cash flow has always been in excess of that, the residue, we typically return to shareholders with more dividends, with more repurchases and it would be our expectation is that's what we would do with any tax savings that we have.","There have been a few questions about whether that tax savings would be competed away by our competitors essentially returning that through lower bill rates back to the clients. I will tell you in 30 years we have never seen anything like that, nor would it be our expectation that that be the case here, particularly since it's an income tax and not a payroll tax.","If it were a payroll tax it would be more germane to the discussion with our clients, but since we are talking about an income tax it's our view that it would not get competed away and that we would - then our cash flow would benefit which could ultimately benefit the level of repurchases and dividends we could do with that cash flow.","Unidentified Analyst","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Harold Messmer","Yes, the bottom line as Keith said it there would be more money for dividends and repurchases. That was our last question; we would like to thank everyone again for joining us on today's call. We appreciate it.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

As you noted, fourth-quarter revenues for the company were $973 million, an increase of 14% from a year ago and a decrease of 1% sequentially, before any adjustment for billing days and currency fluctuations. There were 61 billing days in the fourth quarter compared to 62 billing days in the fourth quarter a year ago and compared to 64 days in the third quarter of 2011. The current quarter has 64 billing days. Volatile currency markets impacted revenue trends during the quarter.

This compares with 34.5% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 35.5% of revenues in the third quarter of 2011.

The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $64 million of this amount or 8.1% of applicable revenues. Fourth quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $6 million or 7.9% of applicable revenues. Protiviti operating income was $2 million in the fourth quarter or 2.2% of revenue.","Our fourth quarter 2011 income tax rate was 40.9% comparing to 38.8% in the third quarter of this year. The resulting $1.5 million negative impact was due primarily to lower utilization of foreign tax credits. Accounts receivable were $493 million at the end of the fourth quarter, with implied days outstanding or DSO of 46.1 days, which compares to 45.2 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010.

On a same-day sequential basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in October, down in November and down again in December. ","For the first 2 weeks of January, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 17% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of January, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 38% compared to the same period last year. We caution, however, it's difficult to evaluate revenue trends over such short time periods. ","Taking into account these factors, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues, $960 million to $1,010,000,000; income per share, $0.25 to $0.30. It's our policy to limit guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Max.","Harold M. Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We finished the year strongly with double-digit revenue growth rates on a year-over-year basis. We were pleased to see continued strength in Technology Staffing during the quarter as well as year-over-year and sequential revenue gains in our other Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions. As we end one year and begin a new one, it's time to reflect not only where we've been in the past 12 months, but also what we believe are business opportunities ahead. ","We do feel the company is well positioned for several reasons. The unemployment rate among college-degreed workers is half that of the overall U.S. rate, which underscores the demand for professional level talent. The unemployment rate also is low in many of the occupations in which we specialize. The unemployment rate for Web developers, for example, is 3.6%, and for accountants and auditors, it is 4.9%. All of this has contributed to a stronger pricing environment for us. ","The U.S. economy added more than 1.6 million jobs last year, 400,000 more than the year before. There's been an increase in hiring by small and midsized businesses, which make up the largest percentage of our client base, as you know. This was reflected in the strong performance of our Permanent Placement division through the year 2011. ","We believe the revenue growth in our Temporary and Consulting divisions has been partly the result of more companies using variable cost labor as a component of their overall human resources strategy. In the coming years, we hope to see even wider adoption by employers of flexible staffing models, including the use of temporary and project professionals. ","Our headcount investments last year are benefiting us most notably in our Information Technology staffing division. We are optimistic about the possibilities within this technology sector. We also were encouraged by the growth potential of the accounting and finance segment, where we have long been the recognized leader. We were also pleased to see higher demand for Protiviti's Consulting and Internal Audit Services in 2011, particularly in the United States. Demand was strongest for Information Technology related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry. ","Our blended service model that combined skilled interim professionals from our Staffing divisions with the consulting expertise of Protiviti is creating a good business opportunity for us. We are delivering a full range of staffing and consulting services to our clients at what we believe is a very competitive price. We have solid leadership in our staffing operations in Protiviti. And I am confident in their abilities as we head into 2012. ","Finally, we are in a strong financial position. We had positive operating cash flow of $256 million in 2011, which helped us to fund approximately $142 million in RHI stock repurchases, $57 million in capital expenditures and the payment of $80 million in dividends to stockholders. ","At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. Please limit yourselves as customary to one question and a single follow-up. If time permits, we'll certainly return to you later in the call, if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Co.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess, Keith or Max, I'll direct it to either one of you. But you gave some helpful numbers on the U.S. versus kind of international growth rates. I guess, just if you can provide some more color or commentary on what you saw out of Europe, I guess as the quarter progressed and how that influences kind of what you're expecting going forward.","M. Keith Waddell","Well, so we did see some slowing in Europe during the quarter. Part of that's because of really tough comparisons, and part of that's obviously related to the deleveraging that's taking place over there. If you look at the month-by-month trend lines, I -- probably the biggest difference of U.S. versus non-U.S. would be December, and U.S. December Perm was actually up and non-U.S. December Perm was down. So that was the biggest divergence. That said, frankly, coming out of the gate the first 3 weeks of this year, Europe Perm has been solid. So our out-of-the-gate numbers this quarter Temp are actually better than what we reported fourth quarter. Our out-of-the-gate Perm, the same.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, and then just, I guess, relating that to the guidance, then. Are you assuming a, I guess, you're assuming a slower growth rate than what you've seen early in the quarter. Or is there a big currency hit as we get later into the quarter? How are you going to -- any more color around what to expect in the guidance? And then I guess, just specifically around the tax rate in the guidance.","M. Keith Waddell","Okay, so let's talk guidance, generally, let's talk currency and let's talk tax rate. First of all, currency, understand at the income line, at the earnings per share line, currency has very, very little impact. The only reason we gave currency-adjusted figures is so you could better understand the revenue trends, particularly when you've got the kind of swings that we've had the last few quarters. So at the income line, currency is noise. At the revenue line, it helps you understand trends. Tax rate, one of the biggest differences between our expectations and what actually happened in Q4: We expected our tax rate to come down in Q4; it actually went up. That's related primarily to -- we made less money in Europe than we expected, and we had unused tax credits we had expected to use that didn't get used. As far as the guidance, our thinking is that the tax rate will be down a little bit again, but to be prudent, maybe you model it the same. So we had a 41% rate in the fourth quarter. Frankly, we expected to be down again in the first quarter in part because there are structuring ways for us to get those credits that we didn't get in the fourth quarter. So call it 40% to 41%. With a little luck, it might actually be a little lower. But again, biggest difference between guidance and actual for the fourth quarter actually was the tax rate. And now talking about guidance generally. So if you look at the high end of our range on the temp side, we're pretty much assuming that the growth rates we saw on a same day basis continue into the first quarter. We obviously have 3 more days which helps the absolute numbers. On the Perm side, we built in a little more conservatism into the first quarter than was the case -- than what we actually reported in the fourth quarter. That said, as I've talked about, we've had a pretty good start to the year. Perm order flow is still good even outside the U.S. The sales cycle does continue to get a bit longer. It's a bit unusual in that on the one hand, clients are getting more selective; they want to see more candidates. And at the same time, candidates are getting more selective. They're getting multiple offers, they're getting a counter from their employer. So it's a bit unusual that at the same time, you've got clients and candidates getting more selective. Usually, it's one or the other, depending on where you in the cycle. Clearly, Perm is stronger in the U.S. than it is non-U.S. But we did grow non-U.S. 19% year-over-year, which isn't chopped liver. Germany is obviously the strongest, followed by France and then Belgium. Clearly the most challenged is the U.K. Australia is what our people call a 2-speed economy. You've got mining and minerals that's doing really well. You've got the rest that's not doing so well. And our growth rates in Australia have been impacted as well. So back to guidance generally, we are more conservative in our Perm forecasted growth in the first quarter than we were -- we reported actually in the fourth quarter. If you then look at gross margin. We won't have the 30-basis-point lift from the workers comp credits that we had in the fourth quarter. So that will be a headwind in the first quarter. Further, we expect state unemployment rates to rise by about 20 basis points. We'll pass some of that through, but not all of that through. But net, we expect our temp gross margin to decline sequentially for the absence of the workers' comp and the higher SUI. At the SG&A line, we're considering that on the headcount side, Perm is going to be about flat. We're actually going to adjust the heads downward outside the U.S., and we're actually going to ramp up the technology Permanent Placement headcount in the U.S. to that extent. So it will be a push and be about the same. Temp, we continue to plan low single-digit additions to headcount. You'll get leverage from the 3 more days of revenue which will help SG&A to get down to the operating line. Temp would be down a little bit because gross margin's down the way I just described. Perm would be in the same range depending on how Perm revenues perform. Protiviti, sequentially Protiviti, it's toughest quarter is the first quarter. Revenues are typically down 10% to 15%. We lost a little money a year ago in the first quarter. While we're going to try not to this quarter, I think it would be prudent to forecast a loss of $1 million or $2 million as well in Protiviti. So that kind of defines the high end of the guidance. We then back off virtually all of those assumptions to get to the low end of our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with RW Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the receptivity to increasing the bill rates at the clients. You did mentioned the bill rate, the bill pay spread did improve. Do you think there's more room for that? Do you think you can offset the SUTA pretty quickly? How should we think about that?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, first of all, let's quantify. So year-over-year bill rates are up 4.6% in the first -- excuse me, fourth quarter. Sequentially, they were down 1.5%. But if you dissect that further, they're up in the U.S. and they're down in the non-U.S. Reacting more specifically to your question, we are cautiously optimistic that we will continue to expand our gross margins, that we will ultimately pass on all of the extra SUTA increase. It may take more than 1 quarter, however.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then can you talk a little bit more about the longer-term opportunity on the IT side? Clearly, that's the area of strongest growth. Is it primarily small and medium-sized businesses? Is it -- are there any verticals, any geographies? How -- what inning are we in?","Harold M. Messmer","Mark, it's Max. Keith will comment in a second. If you saw the Journal this morning, they had a very interesting article about the demand for Information Technology personnel and assistance in small to midsized businesses, which they tended to define as 500 employees or fewer. They could have said anybody below the FORTUNE 1000 in general is struggling to get enough help. So as far as what inning we're in, I'm not sure the game has started. It's very early, I would argue, in the sector that we're seeking to develop. So I feel the market opportunity is huge. The biggest challenge, I think, as Keith alluded to a moment ago, will continue to be getting qualified candidates, because the demand is very strong. Want to comment on it, Keith?","M. Keith Waddell","Yes, with the FORTUNE 1000 firms, technology is 3x to 4x as large as accounting. And we typically haven't played in that in a major way. So the question is, with small to middle sized firms, what's the opportunity for technology? Do we think it will be 3x to 4x accounting? Maybe not. But do we think it can be as large as accounting? Absolutely. And so the question is, over what period of time can we get there? But you can observe looking at our numbers, we've had several quarters in a row now where our technology growth rates have been significantly faster than our accountant rates, not that our accounting rates were bad.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Absolutely. And then last question, just on the international side, particularly U.K. How quickly would you be able to make the adjustments on the headcount? I'm assuming that's the primary, it's the internationals, what drove the Perm EBIT margin.","M. Keith Waddell","It's precisely correct. And their answer is, we can adjust that headcount in the first quarter of 2012.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And so what would you hope the margins could be on the Perm side?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, again, the -- my guidance comments were, \"be conservative and assume they stay at third and fourth quarter levels.\" Hopefully, there's some upside to that, but given that Perm wasn't quite what we hoped it to be in the fourth quarter, it's not exactly leading us to be overly aggressive for the first quarter. Notwithstanding, we had a pretty solid start to the first 3 weeks in Perm, including non-U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is about Accountemps. Seasonally speaking, going into the first quarter, this is by far the strongest quarter for Accountemps on a historical basis. If you actually go back over the decades, it's twice as much as other quarters in terms of sequential increases. Are you expecting to have a normal seasonal pattern to Accountemps, given the strong start overall to staffing?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, Andrew if --","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm talking about first quarter.","M. Keith Waddell","If you break out that sequential lift, a very large portion of that is the additional number of days. And clearly, we're going to have the days lift that we always have, and that's significant. If you then further look at U.S. and non-U.S., non-U.S. is actually even a little stronger sequentially in the first quarter than is the U.S. And so we're a little cautious on that given the environment. But net-net, our high end guidance says year-over-year, our growth rates sustained themselves from the fourth quarter. And as we told you, our start out-of-the-gate, we actually accelerated our temp year-on-year growth.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And in particular, including Accountemps, right?","Harold M. Messmer","Correct. Accountemps accelerated year-over-year in the first 2 weeks versus its year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You talked about turning some Protiviti international operations into franchisees. How's that going? It didn't seem like there was any impact to numbers this quarter or in guidance. So how is that progressing?","Harold M. Messmer","We've been in discussions for some time with the conversion of some of the Protiviti franchisees. The financing environment in Europe at the moment isn't the best. But we're cautiously optimistic that we'll get it done. But we're not giving them away, which means that the other side has to finance that conversion. And financing in Europe, as you know, is a little stressed at the moment.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then there's been talk in the European papers about the possibility of larger scale staffing acquisitions. I know you've been conservative in the past about only really doing smaller deals, but if there was an opportunity where you could greatly expand your international presence at an attractive price, would you consider it?","Harold M. Messmer","Well it's certainly our focus for 25 years has been primarily organic growth. We never say never. There are cultural issues as well as financial issues that have to be considered. The Robert Half way is typically very different from an operations standpoint than most other staffing firms, which would also have to be considered. So we never say never, but clearly, our focus are organic growth rates, which we think drive higher rates of returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just wanted to focus on a couple other divisions, specifically OfficeTeam and Management Resources. If I look at the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, which was very good, it did slow somewhat from what we've been seeing over the past few quarters. Was there anything specifically going on in either of those 2 units?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, clearly, the non-U.S. portion of those growth rates declined somewhat, consistent with what we've talked about. But on an absolute basis, they were solid, and they were in the range of our expectations for the quarter.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Nothing out of the ordinary in either of those divisions.","M. Keith Waddell","No. No, we were pleased with both.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, good. And in terms of -- just clarifying some of the guidance, and specifically for 2012 for the year. The tax rate guidance you gave, should we apply that for the whole year?","M. Keith Waddell","Oh, boy. The tax rate is a Rubik's cube, Jeff. Our hope is with some legal structuring, we'll be able to better utilize some unutilized tax credits, foreign tax credits, during 2012. But clearly, there's a pretax income component of that, that there's uncertainty around. So what I want to tell you is that the tax rate for all of 2012 should go down and should be 40% or lower. But sitting here having been somewhat burned by what we thought the fourth quarter tax rate was going to be versus what it was, I'm a little cautious.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I understand. And maybe something with a little bit more certainty in terms of your guidance for capital spending for this year.","M. Keith Waddell","All right. So I think we ended 2011 at $57 million. We're thinking we'll ramp that up, so let's give a range of $60 million to $70 million and we'll tighten that up as we go through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Keith, could you remind us, just as you think about the Europe overall, what percentage is Germany, France versus Belgium in the U.K.? Just the revenue contribution.","M. Keith Waddell","So if you look at non-U.S., it's about 1\/2 Europe, 15% U.K., so let's call it 2\/3 of non-U.S. are Greater Europe. And so that's about 20% of total revenue. We've always said the big 3 are Belgium, Germany, France, in that order. We've never specifically broken them out. Clearly, Belgium remains the largest, but Germany is coming on fast in a good way.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","And is that a function of just kind of Perm trends or the Protiviti aspect of it? Or just a macro?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I think from a macro standpoint, there's no question that Germany's the big winner in Europe and our numbers reflect that. While their -- Germany's year-over-year growth rate slowed during the quarter, it was from an enormous growth rate to a slightly less enormous growth rate. Germany did very well during the quarter.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Super. And then just real quick on the buyback. Not as significant as it's been. Is it a function of how strong it was earlier in the year? Or how should we think about that going forward?","Harold M. Messmer","So we've talked about -- we spend our free cash flow for dividends, repurchases. We've gotten ahead of that a little bit for the first 3 quarters. We'd spent more than our free cash flow for the first 3 quarters. So we throttled back a little bit during the fourth quarter. Still for the year, I believe our free cash flow was around $200 million and we spent $220 million on dividends and repurchases. So consistent with our long-term commitment that to the extent we don't do acquisitions, we returned our free cash flow to shareholders, we did that again in 2011. We got a little ahead of the game the first 3 quarters. We caught up a little bit in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could give us some more detail specifically on IT and tech staffing versus your overall book of business, kind of in terms of bill rate increases, bill pay spread, the duration it's taking to fill the jobs, kind of additional color comparing and contrasting IT over the rest of the business.","M. Keith Waddell","What -- generally speaking, IT is a bit stronger across all the metrics that you talk about. The growth rates are better, the bill rate trends are better, the spreads are better. Clearly, it's a more candidate-driven market than is accounting. It's a firmer market somewhat than is accounting. But for all the reasons we've talked about already, we feel great about tech, we feel great about the trends in tech. We continue to invest in an outsized way in tech. We're going to reallocate some Perm heads from the European operations into tech during the quarter. So we're certainly bought into tech.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Are there any influences that you saw in 2011 on that demand that you don't anticipate being present in 2012? And kind of conversely, are there any new catalysts that you're aware of that weren't present last year, that might be this year?","M. Keith Waddell","Nothing comes to mind. You've got all of the technology, driving down -- technology demand driving down to smaller sized companies. The Journal article this morning Max talked about is a perfect example of that. You've got Web, you've got social, you've got cloud, you've got mobile. I mean, all the things that drove demand in 2011 will drive demand again in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Samford with Citigroup.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to -- at a high level, wondering if you're getting any feedback from your small and medium-size business customers as to their concerns about no longer being decoupled with Europe. Obviously, the results show that they're still decoupled here, but any feedback from the demand side and domestically on impact from Europe?","M. Keith Waddell","Each quarter, we spend a fair amount of time with all our geography leaders. Europe, U.S. as well as line of business leaders. And to a person in the U.S., our people felt same or better than they did 90 days ago. They were very upbeat to the extent that there was any moderation in their enthusiasm, it was a bit in Perm placement. And there's this, this kind of double -- clients and candidates getting more selective at the same time. It's a little bit of an unusual situation that gave everybody a little pause on Perm as we go forward. But on the temp side particularly, in the U.S., notwithstanding whatever's happening in Europe and whatever impact it may ultimately have, our people were bullish on the Temp side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Giri Krishnan with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Giridhar Krishnan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just had a couple of questions. First was involving Protiviti where we've had some, in the past, disruption from Japan. Has that largely dissipated? Or do you still expect some moderate impact on margins?","Harold M. Messmer","So Protiviti Japan clearly did have a disruption with the earthquake tsunami. I'd say, generally speaking in the fourth quarter, all Protiviti non-U.S. operations, virtually all improved sequentially versus the third, including Japan. That said, on an absolute basis, Japan is still challenged. It's something we're working on, we're trying to help them with the diversification of their revenue sources, we're trying to get more tech, we trying to get more financial services in Japan, which frankly has been the driver in Protiviti U.S. that picked up the gap created by SOX some number of years ago. So Protiviti Japan still challenged, getting better, not there yet. And we're providing resources from the United States to help round out their revenue sources.","Giridhar Krishnan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one other question. I don't know if you made a comment on your Temp to Perm conversions. Can you just talk about how much potential there is for upside in 2012? I know you're historical range is around 3% 5% of revenue. Could you make a comment on that, please?","M. Keith Waddell","You're correct, 3% to 5% is the range. We went below the 3% in this cycle. We climbed back to 3%. We backed up just a touch during the fourth quarter. But we're still optimistic we can at least get back to 4%; 5% would be wonderful. But back to 4% would be a full point of margin improvement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just looking at the sequential decline in SG&A in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Was there any cost cutting initiatives in the fourth quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, first of all, you've got to understand that just like currency reduced revenues, currency reduced SG&A by a substantial amount as well. So adjusted for that, the absolute dollars don't look as down as they otherwise might. But did we have major cost cutting in the fourth quarter? No. I mean, the fourth quarter is always the time when to the extent you've estimated accruals, field compensation, et cetera for the first 3 quarters, you true all that up during the fourth quarter. We're always a little bit conservative as we go through the year, and therefore you get a little bit of adjustment in the fourth quarter. But the currency and a little bit of that is really what drove the fact that it was down.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I'm wondering if there's -- if you're seeing much difference in accounting staffing demand at the higher end versus lower end.","M. Keith Waddell","Well, seasonally, the fourth quarter, you start getting tax-related, income tax-related demand. And that's more at the accounting operations side than at the higher side. So we saw some typical seasonal tax-related demand in the fourth quarter which continues into the first. But that certainly swings in the favor of accounting operations versus the higher-level accounting demand.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, but nothing as opposed to typical seasonality.","Harold M. Messmer","For that, no.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Janesky with Avondale Partners.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","On Perm Placement, I know it's a short period of time in the first quarter, only the first 3 weeks. But out in the field, I mean, what are the folks saying about why it was up so strong? Was it pent-up demand from the cautiousness going into the end of the fourth quarter? Or was it growth?","M. Keith Waddell","Jim, you've also got the holidays right in the middle that, right? So there are multiple theories of why it was a little weaker than we expected in the fourth quarter and how it's all coming back in the first quarter. But the facts are over those short of time periods, there's -- you can't say anything definitive. But the point is, we did start the quarter on solid footing, and that's not because the year-agos were easy, by the way. And it's not because of some currency lift either. In fact, if anything, currency's continuing to go the wrong way still. So no definitive trend that we would call out, but it's better to start out solidly than not.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And just overall, is the Perm growth throughout the current cycle coming more from churn or from growth? So churn, like turnover of...","Harold M. Messmer","I would say both have been a meaningful part of demand to this point. And if you look at that Department of Labor JOLTS report, I think they call it separations. And I think business and professional services has the highest number of separations of any category. So in your words, churn.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you give us depreciation and amortization for the quarter including stock comp?","M. Keith Waddell","So let's see. In the -- in our press release, we disclosed depreciation at $12.8 million. CapEx, $14.8 million, and then stock comp, just a second, $12.7 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ato Garrett with Deutsche Bank.","Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have 2 questions on Permanent Placement. First, what percent of European revenues are from Perm? And second, what are the 3 biggest countries in Europe for permanent placement?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. The Perm is roughly 1\/2 of our European revenues. Our 3 biggest countries are Belgium, Germany, France.","Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then also comparing your European clients to U.S. clients, is there any difference in size between those 2 groups?","M. Keith Waddell","I'd say, generally, European clients skew a little bit larger than is the case in the U.S. But it's certainly not FORTUNE 1000 larger.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Last month, you published your CFO hiring -- quarterly CFO hiring survey which showed, I think it was like the best hiring expectations in a decade or something; years certainly. I guess, did you glean anything from those survey results that would -- that's interesting in terms of demand other than the high level drivers you've been talking about over the last few quarters?","M. Keith Waddell","We're...","Harold M. Messmer","That was limited to the U.S. only. Isn't that correct, Gary?","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, yes. Exactly. It looked like a big bump in terms of, from the last few quarters and in the absolute number of net firms looking to hire versus get rid -- downsize was like significantly better than it's been in a long time. And so obviously, your results are strong, but I wondered if there were any drivers you could point to or anything. And maybe another question, as I think about it, how well has that done historically in terms of predicting what actually happened when you look back on that survey result?","Harold M. Messmer","Well, so the answer to your second part answers your first part. So I think if you did a regression analysis historically, there isn't a huge correlation. But directionally, there's a correlation. We're very encouraged that it was as positive as it was. That said, we don't tend to do our guidance based on that. But we obviously  noted, it was very optimistic. And we hope it's true.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And then a follow-up question. Within the financial services business, you've talked in the past about some of the regulatory changes in Dodd-Frank and this stuff driving demand. Or at least being a big potential opportunity. Has that really begun to kick in yet? Or is this more something, you think, could help later in 2012 or 2013?","Harold M. Messmer","I think a lot of the regulations are still unfinalized. And there hasn't been a huge amount of present demand but everybody remains optimistic that it will be a demand driver as we go forward.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last clean up one. I heard you say the bill rate changed, but did you give us the pay rate? Or if you did, could you please repeat that, the change year-over-year versus last quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","And so we don't disclose specifically the pay rate changes, but the fact that our spreads widened said that they were less than the bill rate changes.","Harold M. Messmer","That's all we have time for today. We appreciate your interest. Thank you for your time.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

The term as adjusted reflects the impact to our 2017 and 2018 provisions for income taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Cash flow from operations was $123 million and capital expenditures were $15 million in the fourth quarter. In December 2018, we distributed a total of $34 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.28 per share quarterly cash dividend. We also repurchased 2.4 million Robert Half shares in the fourth quarter at a cost of $137 million. We have 6.7 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We ended the year strongly, with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income on both a quarterly and annual basis. Full year 2018 revenues and operating income reached all-time high levels for the company, with broad-based strength in our staffing and Protiviti operations. U.S. labor market remains very robust, with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines. During the fourth quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%.","I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% from the year-ago period on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis.","Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term \u201cas adjusted\u201d, in this case, reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","Fourth quarter total staffing revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $934 million, up 7% on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 14% on an as-adjusted basis. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The fourth quarter had 61.7 billing days, compared to 61.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. The current first quarter has 62.2 billing days, compared to 63 billing days in the first quarter one year ago.","Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $12 million in the fourth quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth by 1%.","Fourth quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $263 million, with $204 million coming from business within the United States and $59 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 19% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.","On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while non-U.S. revenues were up 30% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.9%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 83 locations in 26 countries.","Now, let's turn to gross margin in the fourth quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues, compared to 37.0% of applicable revenues in the same period one year ago. Expanding bill\/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees contributed significantly to the increase.","Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues, versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 120 basis points versus one year ago to 44. 4%.","For Protiviti gross margin in the fourth quarter was $80 million, or 30.2% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 30.0% of Protiviti revenues.","Fourth quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.5% of staffing revenues, compared to 34.1% one year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's overall SG&A ratio. We ended 2018 with 14,900 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year.","SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter, compared to 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2018 with 4,700 full-time employees and contractors, up 18% from the prior year.","Fourth quarter operating income from our staffing division was $120 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $102 million in operating income, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%.","In the fourth quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million. This was down 2% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 14.4%.","Operating profit for Protiviti was $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 32% from the prior year's fourth quarter. This produced an operating margin of 12.9%. At the end of the fourth quarter accounts receivable were $794 million and implied days sales outstanding, DSO was 48.1 days.","Before we move to first quarter guidance for 2019, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency and billing days.","Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues up 6.7% versus the prior year, compared to an 8% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first three weeks of January were up 10% compared to January of 2018.","December revenues for our permanent placement division were up 15.5% versus 2017 compared to 13.5% increase for the full quarter. For the first four weeks in January, permanent placement revenues were up 15% compared to the same period last year.","This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know they represent brief periods of time and we caution against reading too much into them.","With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance, revenues $1.460 billion to $1.525 billion; income per share $0.92 to $0.98. The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 10% on a same-day as-adjusted basis or 7% on a reported basis before adjusting for billing day and currency drags and EPS growth of 21%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subjects to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We ended the year with record results and we continue to benefit from a very strong labor market. Companies are having trouble locating the talent they need and Robert Half is expert at doing this work for them. We are experienced in helping our clients find and more importantly hire candidates with hard-to-find skill sets many of whom will have competing offers from other employers. Our success is due to our personalized approach something we have done well for 70 years.","I'd like to talk a little bit about the economy and how we view the current environment. If you look at Main Street particularly the small and midsized companies that make up the majority of our staffing clients, they need people to continue growing their businesses. According to NFIB research, business optimism remains near historically high levels for this group. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index which also measures small business optimism has recently shown a modest weakening in business confidence from a very high level, yet hiring plans remain robust. This tells us that small business owners are moving forward with hiring plans.","In fact, the NFIB reported a record number of job openings last month. Not being able to fill these jobs fast enough is the biggest barrier to growth. 60% of business owners said they are hiring or trying to hire and 90% of those reported fewer or no qualified applicants. These are compelling statistics and we believe they are evidence of a job market that is going to remain strong for the foreseeable future.","Skill shortages are global and we are confident we can be a valuable resource to companies as they navigate this tight market. It's one of the reasons we have invested heavily in developing our proprietary matching technology and laying the foundation for a world-class client and candidate experience online. But we believe you need a combination of technology and season staffing professionals to be truly effective at finding and making the right match between client and job candidate. We are making digital investments and we are making people investments to ensure we have the right mix of both.","Quarterly results for Protiviti also reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with how this business is performing. Financial services continues to be Protiviti's biggest industry sector. They are also putting greater focus on the technology sector. Protiviti's cybersecurity services remained strong during the quarter as did their wide range of internal audit and risk and compliance solutions such as anti-money laundering services and work in the area of digital transformation. And we are optimistic about the successful go-to-market strategy with Protiviti and our staffing operations. We are providing a full spectrum of consulting staff augmentation and managed services to our clients.","Now Keith and I will be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Mark Marcon","Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the divergence between the international trends relative to the domestic trends that it is contrary to kind of the narrative that's out there in terms of international slowing. And I imagine it's primarily Germany and Belgium. Would love to hear a little more commentary with regards to that and in particular with regards to the strength in Protiviti international which was a lot stronger than what we were looking for? Thank you.","A \u2013 Max Messmer","Okay. IZ versus domestic trends while there was some slowing in Europe, it was slowing from a very high base with very tough comps. We still have double-digit growth in the International Zone, which actually exceeded the growth rate in the U.S. So we're still doing quite well internationally. As we talked about for many quarters, we were led by Germany, Belgium. More recently, Canada and Australia have participated nicely.","As to Protiviti, internationally it's been very strong in Europe. It's strong in Australia. This quarter it was also very strong in Canada. The interesting thing and the very nice thing not only Protiviti international, Protiviti U.S. as well is how broad-based across their solution offerings it is. It's internal audit. It's technology consulting Cyber privacy. It's also risk and compliance and financial services. So it's very broad-based by solution offering and that's true both in the United States and in the U.S. As we talked about last quarter, we transferred some accounts that previously were in Management Resources on the staffing side to Protiviti that gets adjusted for in the pro forma non-GAAP analysis that we provide. But absent that Protiviti's growth rates are also quite strong. And I will add that in the International Zone for Protiviti as well as in the U.S. the go-to-market together with staffing also continues to be very robust and was a significant contributing factor to the outperformance that Protiviti had during the quarter.","Q \u2013 Mark Marcon","Great. As a follow-up, can I just ask with regards to you added 9% to headcount on staffing in perm side and 18% on the Protiviti side? Can you talk a little bit about the plans for headcount investments as the current year unfolds?","A \u2013 Max Messmer","We've also talked about for several quarters, because the labor economy continues to be so strong that we intend to participate in that fully and we do that by adding to headcount in line with our expected revenue growth. You'll notice that the growth rates you just quoted for 2018 closely mirrored the revenue growth rates for those lines of business. So we expect to continue to add to headcount in line with our expected growth rates in revenues.","Q \u2013 Mark Marcon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. Keith, could you just break down the 10% in the guide the middle of the range of the guide on the same-day constant currency basis? How do you see that forming Protiviti staffing firm?","Keith Waddell","Well, we typically don't get that granular our guidance. I will say that, frankly if you take your major segment revenue growth rates for the fourth quarter and you roll them into the first quarter, they don't look that different. They're all within one point or two of each other at the midpoint of our guidance. So good momentum. We had one of the strongest reentries in January of this year that we've seen in many years. You saw from what we disclosed that our growth rates in January actually accelerated. It had into the fourth quarter. So we're very pleased with the start we've had across our segments in January actually accelerated.","Andrew Steinerman","Right.","Keith Waddell","It had into the fourth quarter, so we're very pleased with the start we've had across our segments in January.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Dolev from Nomura. Your line is open.","Dan Dolev","Hey, guys. Thank you. I'm sorry if I missed it. I was in another call, but did you discuss the pricing and volume components of organic growth already? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","We have not. So our bill rates were up 5.2% year-on-year. That compared with 4.9% of prior quarter. We expected that the prior quarter's rate increases would progress 5% as we've talked about before. We saw increases between 2004, 2008 annually for five straight years in the 5% range. We're just now getting into that range, which was reflective of the strong labor market that continues.","Dan Dolev","Understood. Great. Thank you so much for taking my question.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Wanted to circle back to Mark's earlier question about your internal headcount additions. Can we get a little bit more color on the staffing side, if they came more on the perm side than on the temp side? And within the temp side, any divisional color would be helpful as well? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","So, generally speaking, our headcount changes mirror our revenue changes. And so because perm is growing significantly faster than temp, we added heads in perm significantly faster than we did in temp. Within the various segments, you can look at the various segment growth rates and pretty closely predict what the headcount changes were.","Jeff Silber","That's what I figured. I just wanted to hear that. I appreciate it. Then just my follow-up, just a little more color on guidance. And I know you don't give annual guidance, but can you tell us what we should be modeling for tax rate and capital spending for 2019? And also billing dates for the rest of the year would be great? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Okay. So tax rate, first of all, for the quarter, the range is 25% to 26%, which is lower than a year ago, because a year ago we had an adjustment to the Tax Act deferred tax valuation that is not expected to repeat. For the full year, I broadened that range to 25% to 27% with kind of 26% being in the middle.","CapEx, we're predicting $60 million to $70 million. That's up quite a bit from 2018. It's consistent with the run rate. We just reported $15 million in the fourth quarter, so the run rate is $60 million. I'd also add that if you look on a 10-year basis on average, we've spent about 1.2% of revenue on CapEx. And at the high end of $70 million, we'd be at 1.1%. So while it's somewhat higher than 2018, it's pretty much in line with our traditional range. Most of that additional spending is in the digital transformation area.","As Max mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on improving our client and candidate digital experience both on the web and with the mobile app. We're ever broadening our use of AI. We use it in recruiting for candidate discovery. We use it when we fill jobs with matching engines. We use it in marketing where we micro-target candidates and clients where we individualize the message by candidate and by client. We use it in sales where we prioritize for our field staff the leads using our scoring engines.","Remember that our algorithms are driven by proprietary data which is based on post-placement performance. We analyze the candidates with the best outcomes and we work backwards from there to determine our algorithms. We believe we have more accounting performance data than anybody on the planet that we use to inform those algorithms.","That said, you still need human beings to assess soft skills, to assess attitude, professionalism, demeanor, and you still need human beings to close candidates that have multiple opportunities. It's a long-winded answer to a pretty short question, but the point is the $60 million to $70 million is somewhat higher than the $42 million we spent in 2018.","Jeff Silber","Great. I'm sorry. And then billing days by quarter?","Max Messmer","Okay. Billing days by quarter Q1 62.2; Q2 63.4; Q3 64.1; Q4 61.7. So, as we talked about reported growth versus as-adjusted growth in our guidance, the 10% versus 7%, notice that we have one fewer billing day in this year's first quarter and we'll make that up in the third quarter, but it does impact reported versus same-day for the first quarter.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys, good afternoon. I guess just the first question on the guidance. Any more color you can provide on the trending of margins within the guidance? And was there anything you'd call out as unusual? I know you true-up the workers' comp credit, I don't know if that had any benefit to Q4, but that would be helpful.","Keith Waddell","Yes. So, on the margins, first of all, temp gross margins, we expect the momentum we've seen with our pay bill spreads to continue into the first quarter. We're thinking somewhere between 50 to 70 basis points increase year-over-year.","Protiviti, the gross margins will be flat to down slightly because remember their staff gets their annual salary increases on January 1. And it takes some time over the course of the year to recover that, but that's ordinary.","From the standpoint, was there anything unusual? So, first of all, with workers' comp, a year ago, we had $1 million credit. This year, we had virtually zero. We did have and we always have in the fourth quarter where we true-up our estimates for state unemployment, federal unemployment, FICA, et cetera. So, we did have a little 20, 30 basis points something in that range where we cleaned up all of those accruals and adjusted them to actual, so that doesn't repeat into the first quarter. But again that's very typical for the fourth quarter and the first quarter guidance.","From an SG&A standpoint as we talked about earlier, we're continuing to hire in line on headcount. Note that overall, the SG&A percentage for staffing will go up call it 50, 60 basis points. Half of that\u2019s because of mix.","With perm growing faster than temp and with perm having a higher SG&A, significantly higher SG&A percentage, mix alone impacts the overall reported rate. But when you put everything together, SG&A as a percent of revenue for the company first quarter ought to be in line with what it was a year ago plus or minus 10 or 20 basis points either direction.","So operating margins overall for the first quarter don't look that different than the fourth quarter, which means they would be up 30 to 50 basis points versus a year ago, which we're very happy with. We basically take a 7% -- at our midpoint, we take a 7% reported revenue increase to a 21% increase in earnings per share.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. That's very helpful. And then the perm SG&A stepped up. This was just hiring in line with that strong revenue trend? Or was there anything else within that you'd call out?","Max Messmer","So we hired just a touch heavier than the revenue trend. But, yeah, it's all about hiring. I mean, it's not perfect to the person, so we were a little strong. But over time it averages out for the year just as our full year headcount numbers indicated.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.","Ryan Leonard","Hey, this is Ryan Leonard filling in for Manav. Just a question on the 1Q revenue guidance. At this time last year, there were some storm-related headwinds from some East Coast storms. Is there any impact in terms of the growth rate on the first quarter of 2019?","Max Messmer","Well, so we clear we haven't had any storms of note, although it's really cold in the Midwest at the moment, but we haven't had storms of note so far that impacts this years first quarter. But last year's first quarter, January if you look at the growth rates, the year-over-year growth rates, a year-ago, January, February, March. January had the smallest last year year-on-year growth rate. So if anything, January, has the easiest compare versus a year ago as any of the three months.","Ryan Leonard","But for the quarter, it's no meaningful impact?","Max Messmer","No, no. And we said that I believe when we had last year's quarterly call, no.","Ryan Leonard","Okay. And then\u2026","Max Messmer","We've never had a quarter in our history where there was a significant impact due to storms.","Ryan Leonard","Fair enough. And then the pace of buybacks, it stepped up throughout 2018. I mean, is that you guys are just getting more confidence in deploying that cash? And should we expect that to continue?","Max Messmer","Well, as things would turn out for the full year, our free cash flow was $485 million and our spending on buybacks and dividends was $490 million. So consistent with our long, long, long policy, we take our free cash flow. We return it to shareholders and dividends and repurchases and for the full year that was the case as well. With the price coming off as it did in the fourth quarter, we were happy to step up the pace and get the full year in line.","Q \u2013 Ryan Leonard","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Kevin McVeigh","Great, thank you. Nice color on the bill rate. Keith if you said it I missed it but what was the wage inflation in the quarter? And what did the spread look like?","A \u2013 Keith Waddell","Well the wage inflation trailed slightly the bill rate increase such that we did increase the spread between the two a bit, but there wasn't a huge difference between the two. Our bill\/pay spreads are at all-time highs. We're proud of that. With the wage inflation we expect to continue, we expect to be to pass that on and continue to widen our spreads a bit from here. As I said our guidance there's 50 to 70 basis points of gross margin improvement year-on-year embedded in our first quarter guidance for temp staffing.","Q \u2013 Kevin McVeigh","Got it. And then just real quick, it doesn't look like you see as much of a seasonal step-down in the EPS guidance relative to Q4. Is there kind of anything in there? Or is that just a function of -- normally I think it's a couple or $0.05 or so. It doesn't look like it's that pronounced. Is there anything to kind of call out that kind of takes that out of what historical trends have been?","A \u2013 Keith Waddell","I would say one; we've got a stronger start in staffing. It's the strongest reentry in January we've seen in quite a while. So sequentially that would play out there. I mean frankly because of that candidate shortage, many of our clients whereas in years past when something ended toward the end of the year, our temporary would come back to us. This year because they were fearful they couldn't get them back if they wanted, they extended and\/or moved them into new projects, so very much a reflection of the tight labor market that played to our advantage for their reentry into this year.","Protiviti the seasonal pattern Q4 to Q1 as is always the case, internal audits quite strong in Q4, but in Q1 that gets crowded out to some degree as clients work with their external auditors to get their external audits done and that has a seasonal impact on Protiviti. So I would say if you compare the pieces sequentially, it's more about staffing strength relative to the fourth quarter than anything.","Q \u2013 Kevin McVeigh","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Tobey Sommer","Thanks. In Robert Half Technology, when you look out this year, do you expect the faster rate of growth to continue above some of the other lines of staffing? And if so what are the top factors you've been driving on tech demand?","Max Messmer","We do expect the momentum we have in tech staffing to continue and we would expect that the growth rates that are elevated relative to our other lines of business we would expect that to continue. Tech demand broadly is strong. It's cyber. It's cloud. It's digital transformation both from a consulting and an IT operations point of view. We've talked in the past about how we broadened the focus of the positions we specialize in, that's played nicely and our revenue growth rates have responded accordingly.","Further, we're having increasing success going to market in tech with both Protiviti and with staffing where Protiviti manages the tech projects. And often much of the staffing comes from Robert Half Technology. So a factor of all of those we would expect the growth rates in technology Robert Half Technology staffing to continue to outpace the other lines of business.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you. And for my follow-up with respect to Protiviti and staffing where are you \u2013 you think in the evolution of the joint go-to-market strategy? Is it early days? Or are you already working together in the areas you think that are appropriate?","Max Messmer","We've said very early days. Many of the solutions we haven't even rolled out to all of our locations. So we would argue its very early days. Where we have it, it's done very well. We're aggressively expanding that. The view is that ultimately we'll offer everything everywhere. But particularly in technology, it's even newer where we go to market on the accounting finance side with management resources and Accountemps together with Protiviti. But particularly in technology, it even lags going to market in accounting finance.","Tobey Sommer","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Yes. Thanks. Just on Protiviti can you \u2013 I guess a few questions. One is, I guess who you competing with? Is it still the Big 4? Or has that changed at all? I know you talked about digital transformation work which is a little different than I would've thought two or three years ago. Secondly, I guess also just at a high-level what's different this year? I mean, growth really just kind of accelerated. So is this partnering with staffing the answer? Is that truly moving the needle as much as we're seeing in the growth rate? Or would you attribute it when you look back at 2018 to something different?","Max Messmer","Well, who we're competing with continues to be primarily the Big 4 and the Big 4 have moved into the digital transformation space as well. So frankly that has \u2013 while there are digital-only digital-first competitors by and large Protiviti's principal competitors are the Big 4. And what's different clearly the go-to-market with staffing and Protiviti is different and more successful and more advanced and success breeds success. Both the staffing organization and the Protiviti organization have totally bought into, we have something special, we have something no one else has under one roof. We have world-class consulting and world-class staffing, nobody else has that.","The clients understand it. The clients buy it. The clients benefit not only from a quality point of view, but from a price point of view as well because by blending staffing in, the average hourly cost goes down.","So I would give a big assist to their acceleration to the go-to-market -- the combined go-to-market together with Protiviti having the confidence that they can sell engagements that they might have not the full-time internal staff for, that they have the confidence that they can find the staff on a just-in-time basis through our staffing organization which also benefits the growth rates across their service offerings.","Having said that, as I spoke to earlier, it's not just about one of their service lines, it's internal audit, it's technology consulting and it's financial services regulatory compliance. It's amazing how balanced it is, not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S. as well.","So from the kudos to Protiviti and it's not just Protiviti remember that, we report revenue externally based on who has the contract with the client. So we have engagements where 80% of the hours are performed by our staffing organization. But what you see reported externally all shows up in Protiviti.","And in fact if you looked at the out-performance in revenues for the quarter at least based on our internal expectations, externally it all sells Protiviti. But we know internally that 75% of that was performed by our staffing organization. And it's a beautiful thing because when it works together like that, it's almost magical. ","Tim McHugh","Okay. Great. I mean, I guess you kind of touched on given the diversity of it, its above consulting business. I guess you worry about scaling in comps. I guess after you see consecutive periods of growth like this. So I guess any thoughts on that? I guess, does diversity make you comfortable that there's no big I guess items you have to grow over?","Max Messmer","Well diversity in revenue sources helps. You worry about tough comps a year from now and enjoy the good quarter at least for a day. ","Tim McHugh","Fair enough. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. ","George Tong","Hi, thanks good afternoon. Your midpoint of guidance for revenue growth in 1Q is 10% which is consistent with the growth you've seen in the first two weeks of January. Can you talk about what conditions for bill rate growth and volume growth you need to see in order for you to deliver on the guidance of 10% growth this quarter given more difficult year-ago comps? ","Keith Waddell","So George, you're right. Notwithstanding the more difficult comps that get tougher by a couple of points. Our midpoint projects no further slowing or no second derivative deterioration, if you will.","The pricing versus volume expectations would be, that the pricing would be at or slightly higher than what we've seen in this past quarter and what we've seen out of the gate so far in 2019 and the volume to be consistent as well. So, pretty much the momentum we have in the fourth quarter continuing into the first notwithstanding the tougher comps, we still think we can hold our growth rates.","George Tong","Got it, that's helpful. You indicated that staffing SG&A as a percentage of revenue will be up 50 to 60 bps in 1Q, half of which will be due to mix from perm. Can you elaborate on the other expected drivers of increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenue?","Keith Waddell","Sure. It's headcount to some degree and it's spending all these digital initiatives that I talked about earlier. And we like to think in terms of our -- the lump, if you will, in SG&A due to our digital transformation strategies is measured in nickels per share per quarter, not in dimes or in quarters.","And so given how important we believe that to be to the future of our company, we think investing in terms of nickels per quarter per share is frankly pretty modest. But when you look at SG&A as a percent of revenue, we do expect to turn pick it up in 2019 consistent with what I talked about earlier.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good evening. Thank you. My first question is just on the bill rate, you talked about 5% bill rate. When you compare the bill rate to what you're seeing in wage inflation in past cycles is that 50 to 70 bps gross margin on temp is that what you've seen normally in past cycles when your bill rate is 5%? Or is this sort of abnormal then we see temp gross margins move up?","Max Messmer","Frankly, it's very normal. And the point I tried to make is that relative to this 5% and above range, we just got there in this cycle. And in the last cycle, we were there for five straight years. And during those five years, not only did we increase bill rates in an absolute sense; we widened gross margins as well.","But it's quite normal at 5% increases in bill rates that you can do that and expand your gross margins at the same time. Clients understand that it's a candidate-short market. Again, as we've spoken to in the past, all you have to do is lose out on your first choice, then lose out on your second choice, settle on your third choice, or settle for someone pretty significantly less experienced than you first hoped for before you understand you have to pay more. That's not unusual; we've seen it in every cycle.","We as a management team individually have all been here over 30 years. We've seen this before. This is very normal. This is very typical. And the good news about our business where many companies worry about their input costs rising and that's diluting their margins, our input cost are rising and we're expanding our margins and that's normal and that's a good thing. ","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Very helpful. And just my follow-up question just around you talked about January accelerating despite tougher comps. Just curious as to how you think about visibility in your business? Is it three months, six months, one month? And any change -- are your customers more positive, less positive versus last quarter? Just any thoughts as to customer sentiment, how that's changing? I realize there's a lot of macro uncertainty out there, but I also realize your customers are U.S. midsized companies different than sort of multinationals. But any color you can give as to what you're seeing there? Thank you.","Max Messmer","Well, so the facts of this business as to visibility are that there's very little and that's always been the case. Companies hire temporaries in part to have flexibility, so when they no longer need them, they no longer have to pay them and that's been the case for 30 years. Sometimes, that's a good thing, sometimes, that's not, but essentially no visibility. That hasn't changed. As far as customer sentiment, as we alluded to earlier from a confident standpoint, whether it's NFIB, whether it's CEO Vista there's many, many, many studies that says their sentiment is not quite what it was, but on an absolute basis, it's still quite high.","But what's key for us and what's kind of not open for dispute is that the labor markets stayed very strong. Supply and demand on the labor side is clearly still tied from a labor point of view. So, our willingness to continue to invest in headcount is because we're in a very strong labor economy. And we can all debate interest rates, tariffs China, the Fed all of those are interesting discussion points, but the point is we're in a candidate-short market not only in the United States, but globally. And that benefits our business and that's what we're investing in.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And your last question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi. Just one quick follow-on and maybe you just answered it with that last statement, but the -- you commented on the strength in overseas. I think the macro forecast for GDP especially in Europe is for some real slowing. And historically, your business has followed that trend. Is there anything unique today in the professional staffing areas overseas that for the core staffing business are driving the strength that are different if you will? Or is it just that candidate shortages in some of your key areas remain in place outside the U.S. in addition here? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","And to be clear we have said that we have seen some slowing in Europe, but it's slowing off very high growth rates that's settling in and growth rates that are still double-digit and that are still higher than the United States because as you just alluded to we still have candidate shortages. You mentioned Germany or somebody mentioned Germany. There are still candidate shortages in Germany. There are still candidate shortages in Europe generally. So notwithstanding Brexit, notwithstanding German exports to China, there's still candidate issues that are more relevant to our business.","Q \u2013 Gary Bisbee","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Max Messmer","That was our last question. Thank you very much for your time and for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Our hosts for today\u2019s call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Max Messmer","Thank you and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that comments made on today\u2019s call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable; however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today\u2019s 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today\u2019s call.","For your information, our prepared remarks also are available on our website at roberthalf.com. From the home page, click on Investor Center at the bottom left of the page, you will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link in the Investor Center.","Now, let\u2019s review Robert Half\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of 2018. Company-wide revenues were $1.466 billion. This is up 11% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of last year.","Net income per share in the third quarter was $0.95, up 39% compared to the third quarter of 2017.","Cash flow from operations was $185 million and capital expenditures were $10 million in the third quarter. We paid a $0.28 dividend to stockholders in September at a total cost of $34 million. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares in the third quarter, at a cost of $79 million. We have 9.1 million shares available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan.","All of our staffing divisions and Protiviti reported solid year-over-year revenue gains in the third quarter. Our permanent placement and Protiviti operations performed particularly well during the quarter.","Skills shortages persist globally, driving heightened demand for skilled talent, especially in the professional-level segments in which Robert Half specializes. Also buoying our business is the sustained optimism among small and midsize companies, particularly in the United States, which is leading to increased hiring activity by this key client base.","Return on invested capital for the company was 41% during the third quarter. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our third quarter results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you. As Max just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.466 billion. This is up 11% from a year ago period on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis.","Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. These figures further are broken out by US and non-US operations. The term \u201cas-adjusted\u201d reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain inter-company adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","Third quarter staffing revenues were up 10% on an as-adjusted basis, comprised of US staffing revenues of $920 million, up 7% on a same-day basis, and non-US staffing revenues of $293 million, up 18% on an as-adjusted basis. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The third quarter had 63.3 billing days compared to 63.1 days in the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days compared to 61.3 days in the fourth quarter one year ago.","Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the third quarter, which reduced the year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.8%.","For Protiviti, third quarter global revenues were $253 million, with $200 million coming from business within the United States and $53 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 18% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.","Third quarter US Protiviti revenues were up 17% from last year on a same-day basis, while non-US revenues were up 20% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the third quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth by 0.6%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 81 locations in 25 countries.","Now, let\u2019s turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations during the third quarter was 37.8% of applicable revenues, compared to 37.2% of applicable revenues in the same period one year ago. Expanding bill\/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees offset larger fringe benefit costs.","Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues compared to 10.0% of consolidated revenues in the third quarter one year ago. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 110 basis points versus one year ago to 44.5%.","Protiviti gross margin in the third quarter was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $62 million, or 29.6% of Protiviti revenues.","Third quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.1% of staffing revenues, versus 33.8% in last year\u2019s comparable period. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 40 basis points to this quarter\u2019s SG&A ratio.","SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18% of Protiviti revenues in the third quarter, compared to 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period.","Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $126 million, up 17% from the same period one year ago. Operating margin was 10.4%.","Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $103 million in operating income, an increase of 17% from the prior year\u2019s third quarter. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.5%.","Operating income for our permanent placement division was $23 million in the third quarter. This was up 15% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 17.7%.","Operating profit for Protiviti was $25 million in the third quarter, an increase of 4% from the same period in the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 10.1%.","At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $834 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 51.1 days.","Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let\u2019s review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter of 2018 and so far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.","Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 9.0% versus the prior year, compared to 8.9% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first two weeks of October were also up 9% compared to that same period in 2017.","For our permanent placement division, September revenues were up 19.1% versus last year compared to a 17.4% increase for the full quarter. For the first three weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 20% compared to the same period last year.","This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and so far in October. But as you know, they represent brief periods of time, and we caution against reading too much into them.","With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance:","Revenues, $1.430 billion to $1.495 billion. Income per share, $0.88 to $0.94. The midpoint of our fourth-quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 9% on a same-day as-adjusted basis which included Protiviti and EPS growth of 40%.","We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. It was another strong quarter. Year-over-year revenue growth rates were solid across the board for our staffing divisions and for Protiviti. We were particularly pleased with the performance of Robert Half Finance & Accounting and Protiviti in the third quarter.","In the United States, hiring by small and midsize businesses, our primary client target, is at historic levels, according to recent research. This year, the NFIB reported 45 year highs in measures for job openings, hiring plans and actual job creation. In the most recent Vistage CEO Confidence Index, 63% of CEOs at small and midsize businesses reported plans to expand their workforce in the year ahead.","Other indicators are equally positive. The number of job openings in the United States hit a record 7.14 million in August, according to the most recent JOLTS report from the Department of Labor. The number of quits was also near an all-time high in the same survey. This is often seen as a sign that employees feel confident in leaving an existing job for a better one. US unemployment remains very low at 3.7%, and in professional occupations it is much lower than that.","Employers need help identifying and hiring skilled talent in this tighter market. And with our rich candidate database, proprietary matching technology, and local market knowledge, we are well positioned to partner with them on their efforts.","Demand is also strong for the consulting and internal audit solutions provided by Protiviti. Protiviti has expanded its service offerings and continues to nurture and grow a loyal client base. We are also pleased with the collaboration between our staffing divisions and Protiviti. Together, these teams provide us with a key differentiator: the ability to offer businesses highly regarded consulting solutions and technologies combined with access to a vast network of experienced interim talent to implement these solutions.","Now, Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we\u2019ll certainly try to return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Mark Marcon ","Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about international. You maintained a very strong growth there despite much tougher comps. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing, if you're seeing any signs of weakness in any markets on the international side? ","Keith Waddell ","Mark, I'd say that the strength we've seen for several quarters in staffing internationally has been Germany, Belgium, to some extent the UK. This quarter Canada was particularly good. And other than comps getting tougher, those markets are still quite bullish about their prospects. Some of the other countries are much smaller as a percent of the total. But generally speaking, our country managers feel pretty good as we move into the fourth quarter. ","In Protiviti, internationally, very strong in Germany, very strong in Australia and the UK had another solid quarter. So frankly, the sentiment our internal people have about tone of business as we go into the fourth quarter in those countries where our strength is, feels pretty good. ","Mark Marcon ","That\u2019s great. And then can you talk a little bit about RH Technology, I mean really nice acceleration there. I\u2019m wondering how much of that is due to what perceived to be the market relative to your go-to-market, fine tuning in terms of collaboration with Protiviti as well as some of the initiatives that you have from a technology perspective? ","Keith Waddell ","Well the short answer is it's a combination. We did have a particularly good quarter in technology, while the year-on-year comparisons were relatively easy. The sequential comparisons were not and sequentially we grew almost 4% in technology for the quarter which we're very proud of. And so first of all, we\u2019ve higher small business confidence comps, higher tech budgets. So a rising tide raises all boats from the standpoint of the small business client base. In addition to that, you've got secular strength in cyber, cloud, digital transformation. ","We've talked before about how we've broadened the metrics of candidates that we focus on up and down the stack, support the development including DevOps. As you mentioned, we are getting more and more traction where we go to market together with Protiviti in technology as well as in finance and accounting relative to Protiviti and Management Resources in the latter case. So really solid quarter in technology, some of it's the market, some of it's our strategy, some of it\u2019s the unique positioning we have between staffing and Protiviti. ","Mark Marcon ","Terrific. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Gary Bisbee","Hey. Good afternoon. You commented on the tougher comps international. I guess just any thoughts on how that plays out in the US? Obviously you started to really accelerate fourth quarter a year ago. ","Keith Waddell ","Well, so as we talk about our guidance the backdrop to that is the comps get 5 points tougher year-on-year and particularly so in perm placement and in Protiviti. That said, the midpoint of our guidance still has a strong 8% same-day constant currency growth rate embedded there. The momentum we've had the last couple of quarters continues into the fourth. So we're pretty pleased that with our midpoint of 8% given how much tougher the comps get. ","Gary Bisbee","Yes, that sounds about right. I guess all of the economic data we've seen look good. You cited a bunch of small business et cetera. What are you hearing from clients about some of the things that have caused market sentiment or market malaise over the last month or two, is -- are the trade issues, are higher interest rates. Is any of this stuff flowing down to the level of your customers or is everything you hear there continuing to be quite strong? I know the backwards looking data looks great but just any more updated forward commentary? Thank you.","Keith Waddell ","I\u2019d say so forward the sentiment does remain quite strong as does confidence. Trade issues and higher rates have not yet trickled into the conversations we have with clients or their buying habits. So, so far so good. There's no question given our results, given our data. The underlying US economy is quite strong, particularly for small to midsize businesses. ","Max Messmer","Gary I'd add one comment we hear is that, a lot of the small to midsize business people like to talk about Main Street versus Wall Street. They read about all the concerns of Wall Street but all they recognize is that business is very good and they expect it to continue that way. So, so far all things look good to them. ","Gary Bisbee","Glad to hear it. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Steinerman ","Hi, it's Andrew. I wanted to ask you about bill rate increases. I definitely caught your comment that the bill\/pay spread was positive in the third quarter. Could you mention your bill rate gross in the third quarter? Give a comment about wage inflation and do you think this will pick up prospectively?","Keith Waddell ","So bill rates were up 4.9% year-on-year. That's an increase from last quarter where it was 3.7%. That's a direct reflection of some higher wage inflation that we're seeing across our lines of business that not only are we passing through but we're actually expanding our margins as well which our numbers reflect. The 4.9% is getting into the range we saw during the last recovery where we had five straight years of 5-ish percent year-on-year bill rate increases that were slightly higher than year-on-year pay rate increases. ","Andrew Steinerman ","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. And again let me add my congratulations on a strong quarter as well. In terms of operating margins, if you drill down on two of the divisions, perm and Protiviti, operating margins were down a bit year-over-year. Was there additional spending going on, I'm just curious what was behind that? ","Keith Waddell ","Well so both relate to investment in internal heads and resources of perm placement where we've had several quarters in a row now of double-digit growth that we continue to invest in hedge pretty much commensurate with the top-line growth. And Protiviti as we talked on the last call significantly added to its headcount between the second and the third quarter. For Protiviti that shows up in gross margin for staffing, that shows up in SG&A, both were expected, both were bullish on as to prospects, and therefore the investment in the heads. ","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. And then on the tax rate I know this is minor, but it was a little bit lower than what you had guided. If you could just give us a little bit color why that was and what are you incorporating in your guidance for the fourth quarter? Thanks. ","Keith Waddell ","So tax rate, third quarter, we always reconcile our books to the tax return and the tax return, we had some credits that had not yet been recognized for book purposes. So that reconciliation drove a reduction in the rate. For the fourth quarter, our range is 26% to 27% and that's up a couple of points from what we just had in the third quarter which was 24%. ","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. Thanks so much. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thank you. Hey Keith, it looks like the Q4 guide is pretty similar to Q3. Can you just help us understand obviously a real nice step up in bill rates? What's kind of the bill rate implied in that Q4 guidance? And then what would kind of cause you to be at the higher end versus the lower end. And is there any way to maybe just give a little more color on what you'd expect it at temp versus Protiviti versus perm. Any thoughts on that?","Keith Waddell ","Okay. So there are several questions here. So implied bill rates, we would expect the trend we've seen the 4.9 we just saw we would probably see getting into the low 5s, that\u2019s something in that range. What would make us be at the higher versus the lower end? It's all about revenues. If you looked at our third quarter, if you looked at how we finished the third quarter, and if you look at how we began the fourth quarter, pretty much across the board there was no slowing. That said, we\u2019ve built in somewhat slower growth rates in the fourth quarter on the basis that the comps got higher, got tougher later in the quarter. But to the extent we improve sequentially during the quarter as we have in the past, maybe that won\u2019t come to past and there\u2019s some upside on the revenues. To the extent we would come in on the lower end, there are some concern that because clients have had a pretty good year, because many of our candidates have had a pretty good year, they're going to take more time off during the fourth quarter and that more time off would slowdown the process whereby we convert candidates to revenue. So if you ask what's the biggest risk to the revenues? We would argue it's holiday impacted. As you know for following us quite a while, perm placement in December is always lumpy. Some companies close shop and do their hiring at the beginning of the next quarter, some try to get ahead of that. So current December is particularly hard to predict. So with that in mind, we still feel good about our guidance, but upside, downside would be revenue related. ","Protiviti, notwithstanding their comps yet a lot tougher, I think it's 9 percentage points. They still think they can grow double-digits on top of that with the momentum that they have which is good. ","Kevin McVeigh","Thank you. Very helpful. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Ryan Leonard","Yeah this is Ryan filling in for Manav. Just a question on the hiring. The decision to hire commensurate with growth. In the past when you've seen robust demand, have you tended to higher above the revenue growth rates? And I guess can you maybe give a little color on that decision to kind of keep it in line at this point in the cycle? ","Keith Waddell ","It's a subjective call we make every quarter in concert with the top people we have in the field, temp, perm and Protiviti. Our thinking is given that we added more capacity than revenue supported a couple of years ago, we're holding to that capacity by continuing to hire in line with revenue growth. So the dry powder, if you will, that we created a couple of years ago stays intact as long as we continue to hire in line and that's our strategy. We think we can grow the way we've just shown or projected or guided for Q4 given that strategy, but it's -- there is some art as well as science there.","Ryan Leonard","Understood. And I guess, if you look across your client mix, are there any exposures to people who would be more impacted by any trade wars or anything like that?","Keith Waddell ","Well, on the staffing side, the good news is we don't have any client concentrations period. Typically our clients on the staffing side, we have one or two temporaries out on assignment at a time, irrespective of how large the company is. Protiviti deals with larger companies. Protiviti's exposure is principally in FSI larger banks, and I'm not sure of if the trade wars are projected to specifically, directly impact the larger banks. So it's not the direct impacts that's the concern, it's the second order impacts of how does that impact confidence, how does that impact sentiment more so than how it directly impacts our client base.","Ryan Leonard","Understood. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh ","Thanks. I guess one, can you just elaborate on the comment that you are able to expand the bill pay rate spread, even as you're having to pass through higher wages both I suspect to the workers and you're able to price that with clients. Is there anything else going on and why you feel like you're able to do that and do you think you can continue to do that where we continue to see high wage inflation?","Keith Waddell ","Is there anything else going on? I mean, clearly the candidate is king in today's market. A combination of our technology investments plus the experience of our recruiters together has done well for us on the recruiting side.","Further, we're having to help clients with alternatives to their first choice. Clients tend to be very title centric when they're looking for someone. And what we have to do often is to coach them on, there are different titles that have similar skills. If you're looking for a financial analyst, if we don't have a financial analyst, maybe a budget analyst has many of the same skills and you wouldn't ordinarily look for a budget analyst when you're looking for a financial analyst. But the point is, we're having to consult with our clients to help them get similar skills even when the titles don't match. And you'd probably be surprised how title sensitive many are. That's just one way we're helping our clients deal with the labor supply that we have. ","Now can we continue to expand our gross margins? Clearly they are at absolute high levels such that we're going to be careful not to run them up too much on an absolute basis. But from a directional standpoint, we do think we can pass through as supply continues to tighten and clients more and more accept that that's the reality of the marketplace.","Tim McHugh ","Okay. And then just the other question, the technology investments that you've made internally over the last year or two here, I guess, can you give an update? I mean, is there -- how tangible is the impacts, I guess how are -- is the deal responding to using them, I guess any more color on that?","Keith Waddell ","Well, first of all if you look at internal productivity it's essentially flat and I would argue that what your technologies help you do is offset the dilution you would have from dealing with a tight candidate market where candidates are harder to close, where candidates have multiple opportunities and it takes longer to close candidates. We've been able to offset that by streamlining the discovery part of the candidate sourcing and recruiting process with our technology investments. So net, our productivity is flat, I would argue, but for our technology investments, our productivity would be down.","The other thing, as we talked about on the call last quarter, clearly we're making a big push into digital marketing. And we're pleased with how that's proceeding. We continue to expand the places where we apply our AI with machine learning in the marketing space such that ultimately I think the larger payoff will come from extending the markets that we reach into, extending the candidates that we interact with, extending the clients that we're able to identify and interact with. So to me, it's as much about better revenue growth because of digital investments as it is about internal productivity growth.","Tim McHugh ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jason Thomson ","Hi. This is Joseph Thomson on the line for Tobey. Thank you for taking my question. Last quarter you mentioned that you were focused on revenue growth maybe more so than profitability growth. To what extent do you see this -- would you see this -- would you say this still defines your approach so far in the fourth quarter of 2018 and what's your plan for 2019? Thank you.","Keith Waddell ","Well, I'd say not much has changed since last quarter. That said, I still think we can grow and grow very profitably. We're going to lever our fixed cost as we grow. So some margin expansion is in order and the facts are the margins we reported for the third quarter are higher than we had guided to. So we're optimistic that we can grow and grow profitably, but we're not going to optimize totally for higher profitability because we think the market is conducive for us to continue to grow.","Jason Thomson ","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari ","Thank you for taking my question. You talked about bill rates approaching a little over 5%. Do you -- how sustainable do you view that? Is that just a function of sort of wage inflation or do you view that sort of as a stronger market backdrop with clients willing to pay a number of years? Well, I'd probably say a couple of quarters ago you had talked about clients being frugal. So just wondering if there has been a change post tax reform or you view this as more wage inflation related? Thank you.","Keith Waddell ","Well, it starts with wage inflation which is a function of supply and demand. As the labor markets tighten, it's just logical that you have to pay more for it. Clients understand that. Given the economic backdrop, they're willing to recognize and pay for that. So they are all very interconnected. How sustainable is it? If you look back to 2004 to 2008, you had five straight years where our bill rates increased by roughly 5%. So we've certainly had periods of time in the past where we had multiple years, much less multiple quarters of bill rate increases in the 5% range.","Hamzah Mazari ","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sean Kennedy from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sean Kennedy ","Good evening, gentlemen. Nice job on the quarter. I was wondering what conditions would be necessary to accelerate our growth from the current 4% range to the 6% range to achieve double-digit temp growth? And is there any chance we see it this cycle? Thank you.","Keith Waddell ","Well, currently demand is quite strong and the heavier lifting is on the candidate supply side. And so to take the hours growth up a couple of points, we would have to get even more efficient in delivering candidates to assignments. We've certainly had many periods in the past even in low unemployment periods where we've grown faster than we're now growing. So it's certainly not impossible and we've also had several quarters now where we've actually accelerated our rates of growth. We hope we're being conservative with our newer guidance because of the tougher comps. With a little luck, we'll do better than what we've guided. So candidate is king. And to the extent we recruit more candidates, we convert more candidates to revenue on assignments, the growth rate accelerates and that would be the focus.","Sean Kennedy ","Great. Thank you.","Max Messmer","That was our last question. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half International; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that comments made on today's call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described some of these risks and uncertainties in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on this conference call.","Now let's discuss the third quarter. Global revenues for the third quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 8% from the third quarter of 2011 on a same-day constant currency basis. Income per share was $0.41, up 33% from the third quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was $76 million. Capital expenditures were $12 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 per share at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares during the third quarter at a cost of $27 million. In August, our board authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to an additional 10 million shares of the company's common stock. There are approximately 12.6 million shares still available under this board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We were pleased with the company's operating performance during the third quarter. For the ninth consecutive quarter, U.S. staffing revenues saw double-digit year-over-year growth rates. In addition, global operating income grew by 31% with higher gross margins, lower selling, general and administrative expense ratios and strong Protiviti results.","Now turning the call over to Keith Waddell for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As you noted, third quarter revenues were $1.03 billion, a reported increase of 5% over last year. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 8% year-over-year with the U.S. growing by 12% and international locations declining 1% on this basis.","U.S. staffing revenues were $674 million on the third quarter, while international staffing revenues were $240 million. We have 351 staffing locations worldwide, including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. We calculated 63.3 billing days in the third quarter compared to 64.1 days in last year's third quarter, the effect of which was a 1.3% reduction in year-over-year staffing growth rates in the third quarter. The current fourth quarter has 62 billing days. Currency exchange rates reduced third quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million and third quarter year-over-year revenues by $19 million. This had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 2% in the third quarter.","Earlier this year, we began providing a supplemental schedule with our earnings results. The supplemental schedule is a non-GAAP financial measure that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as same-day constant currency basis. It further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You can find the schedule in today's press release and in the investor center of our website.","Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $119 million, including $93 million in the U.S. and $26 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 8% globally, with U.S. revenue up 10% and non-U.S. revenue remaining flat. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries. Now let's look at gross margin.","Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 36.2% of applicable revenues. This was a 70-basis point increase over the third quarter of last year and a 40-basis point increase from the second quarter of 2012. The improvements reflect continued strength in pay bill spreads, modestly lower fringe benefit costs, which more than offset slightly lower temp-to-hire conversion fees. Permanent placement revenue was 8.9% of staffing revenue for the quarter, slightly lower than the 9% of revenue from 1 year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 50 basis points versus 1 year ago. Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $32 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues compared to $30 million or 27.5% of revenues a year ago.","Turning to selling, general and administrative cost, in the third quarter, our staffing SG&A's cost were 32.3% of staffing revenues, down 120 basis points from the 33.5% reported a year ago. Third quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 22% of revenues. This is a 260 basis point improvement from the 24.6% level reported last year.","Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $88 million or 9.7% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $76 million in operating income for the quarter or 9.1% of applicable revenues.","Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $12 million or 15.3% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $6 million for the quarter or 5% of revenues compared to $3 million in the third quarter a year ago or 3% of revenues. Accounts receivable were $557 million at the end of the third quarter, with implied days outstanding of 49 days compared to 47.7 days at the end of the third quarter 2011.","Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the third quarter and the first few weeks of October. In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions decelerated in July, then remained fairly constant in August and September. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement division decelerated in July, but reaccelerated in August and September. Outside the U.S., our year-over-year growth rates decelerated throughout the quarter, turning negative in August and September.","During the first week of October, revenues for our temporary and consulting businesses were up 7% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 2 weeks of October, permanent placement revenues were up 36% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would again caution that it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short time periods.","Taking all of this information into account, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.38 to $0.43. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risk mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any additional amounts for the settlement of outstanding legal claims.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. Year-over-year growth rates for the staffing business in Protiviti remained solid during the quarter, particularly in the United States. International operations were impacted by continued economic uncertainty in parts of Europe. We have limited exposure in the hardest hit European countries, but the debt crisis resulted in a more cautious business climate overall, which did affect international operations. As we noted on last quarter's call, we are taking proactive steps to reduce our non-U.S. operating cost.","Taking a look at Protiviti, as noted earlier, we were pleased to see solid year-over-year growth in this business. As was the case with our staffing divisions, growth in U.S. operations was largely responsible for the strong results. Information technology consulting and financial services risk and compliance services remain 2 of the fastest-growing business segments for Protiviti's services. In our staffing operations, our U.S. offices are seeing rising demand for professional staffing and consulting services. This was evidenced by solid growth rates for account temps in Robert Half Management Resources during the quarter. Demand for flexible staffing solutions also has remained strong. Temporary and contingent workers now make up 1.9% of total U.S. non-farm employment, up from a low of 1.34% in June 2009. Current penetration rates are approaching the all-time high level of 2% in April 2000, notwithstanding the high current U.S. unemployment rates. That U.S. unemployment rate declined from 8.1% to 7.8% in September. The unemployment rate for skilled college degree workers, which is our sweet spot, remains at approximately 1\/2 that rate.","This underscores the dual job market we have referenced many times. Our clients are facing candidate shortages in many of the fields in which we specialize. Helping them to hire this hard-to-find talent is what we do. Our professionals have both the time and expertise it takes for personal interviews, technical skills evaluations, reference checks, soft skills assessments and finally, making the best match with a company's unique culture. We do bring the clients a unique insight into candidate skills and personality fit gained through our proprietary testing processes, direct interaction with the people we place and most important, direct client feedback.","At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] If time permits, as usual, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And our first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Congratulations on the strong results, particularly in light of what's happening internationally. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what you're doing in some of the international markets in terms of the cost reduction that certainly comes through in terms of taking a look at the SG&A as a percentage of revenue, but I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit more about that. And then if you could also discuss 2 other things, one would be the perm revenue, what your expectations are over there for the fourth quarter that's implied in your guidance. And then lastly, Max, I appreciate the comments that you gave at the very end of your prepared remarks with regards to the value that you add. Can you talk a little bit about -- obviously, I think most of the people on this call are aware of that one report that came out from somebody who doesn't follow the industry about potential disintermediation. Can you talk just a little bit about the client profile that you have, particularly on the perm side on both domestically and international just in terms of the size of those clients, and how likely it would be that they might disintermediate you?","Harold Max Messmer","Okay. You had a lot of questions. I'll let Keith start.","M. Keith Waddell","Yes. So international market's SG&A. First of all, if you look country by country, we still had very strong numbers in Germany that were up solid double digits. We were up year-over-year in Australia. The other European and other global markets did have negative year-over-year growth rates, which were expected. As we talked about last quarter, we have more intently focused on our SG&A cost outside the U.S. They again did a very good job matching their cost structure with their revenues. We would expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. We are reducing headcount where the revenues dictate. By the same token we are investing headcount in the countries where that makes sense, principally Germany. Regarding perm revenue expectations for Q4 internationally, understand that unlike Q3 where the August holidays have an impact disproportionately on perm non-U.S., you have a longer quarter in the fourth quarter. That said, there's always uncertainty about December with clients running out of hiring authority from a budget standpoint. If you look historically, perm, globally, U.S. and non-U.S., in the fourth quarter, is flattish to slightly down sequentially with the third, and our guidance wouldn't be that different. This issue around disintermediation, client size, et cetera, so I'll get to the clients -- the easy part first, is our client size, in our sweet spot, is 75 to 100 employees. That client group, for the most part, chooses not to have the fixed cost of carrying their own recruiters and instead, outsources that to us on a risk-free contingency basis. And the social media opportunities of the last few years haven't really changed that. But let me back up a little and just to make sure we level set and everybody's talking about the same information, first of all, with respect to our temporary and consulting divisions, which are 80% of our consolidated operating income, understand that very few companies, regardless of size, want to recruit and manage their own temporary pools, which is very labor-intensive. A large motivation there is they don't want the co-employment risk. They don't want to worry about whether the temporaries have to or would qualify for their various benefit plans. Further, it's very, as I said, labor-intensive to manage temporary pools. Further, these social media sites are primarily catering to passive candidates that already have a job. For the most part, passive candidates who already have a job overwhelmingly are not willing to consider temporary assignments. Further, digital candidate databases for active job seekers, which are relevant to our temporary business, have been around for more than 10 years, i.e. the job boards. And we've coexisted just fine. I would further say that there is actually a net positive to our temporary and consulting divisions in that our temporary recruiters do use social media for client development and do use social media for candidate referrals. So now let's move to the impact to our permanent placement division. I would first, from a context standpoint, set forth that our permanent placement operating income is about 13% of our consolidated total. I would further say that candidate identification is a small portion of the full placement process. There's a long lead time involved to convert a passive candidate into a newly hired employee. The full placement process is very time-consuming. You must engage, you must interview, you must evaluate hard and soft skills, you must match, all of which Max talked about earlier. Further, we would say that there is some diseconomies of scale in that the better candidates are already being bombarded with solicitations from recruiters. To the extent more recruiters use social media, the better candidates are going to get further bombarded, meaning they're less likely to respond. We would further observe that this huge pool of passive candidates to a recruiter, in many cases, are tire kickers. They love to hear about all of the possible job opportunities available to them, but frankly, they're not willing to change jobs, again, making the full placement process even more time-consuming. The majority of our candidates still come from referrals, not social media, still come from RHI's internal databases and our other traditional sources. Our recruiters, which we believe are some of the best on the planet, have unique insights into candidates through testing, through client evaluations. You're never going to get client feedback on a social media site. Our recruiters have the benefit through prior interviews, through prior work experience with our clients of that feedback that you're never going to get no matter how good social media gets. Further, social media's success is not a zero-sum game with recruiting agencies. Remember, recruiting agency-assisted placements are about 9% to 10% of the jobs filled in the United States. So a success on a social media site does not translate to the detriment of recruiting agencies on a one-for-one basis. And finally, I'll stop where I started to say, our middle market clients essentially outsource recruiting to us on a no-risk contingency basis rather than carrying more fixed internal cost of recruiters.","Harold Max Messmer","Mark, I think Keith pretty much said it all. There's not a whole lot to add. I would mention that with respect to the temporary business, when Keith referred to co-employment risks, you might remember that Microsoft paid over $100 million in damages when they attempted to manage their own temp pool. They got in trouble with the IRS and had all sorts of other legal issues. I think surveys of HR managers will convince you that at companies large, small and in between, there's no desire to try to manage their own temp pools. And you'll find that virtually almost no temps are recruited via social networking sites. Again, I think there's also a misunderstanding about the percentage of our net income that comes from our permanent job business. As Keith noted, it's more like 13%. I've talked to some investors that think it's half and so forth. But I think Keith laid out the case pretty well. I -- my personal opinion is you'll continue to see our permanent job business do very, very well. And you'll find that just as the job boards didn't seem to hurt us, nor have the social networking sites. And in fact, they're probably helping us.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Everything you just said is consistent with my following of the industry for the last 18 years so including when the first round of the job boards came around and the same sort of discussions. The one question that I do think is legitimate is just what percentage of the perm business would come from larger clients? I'm talking about FORTUNE 1000 clients.","M. Keith Waddell","Yes, Mark, just as on the temp side, we focus on middle market companies. The same is true on the perm side. Might it be slightly larger on the perm side than temp? Yes. But it's a relatively small percentage even on the perm side.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So somewhere in that 20% to 30% range?","M. Keith Waddell","Yes. Remember that on the perm side, with larger companies, they're more apt to have their own HR recruiters.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. But that's precisely the reason...","M. Keith Waddell","Therefore, they're less -- they've always been less apt to use our services, which has not been our focus or sweet spot.","Harold Max Messmer","Sometimes when the larger companies [indiscernible] markets for harder-to-fill positions. What I think gets lost in the discussion sometimes about both agencies, social networking sites and so forth is that what's really expensive are not agency fees. What's expensive is hiring the wrong person. And again, as Keith said, we have a no-cost contingency approach. If we don't fill the order properly, we don't get paid. So we're a pretty attractive alternative for a lot of companies. The bulk of that, again, is our small to mid-size client base. But larger companies will use us sometimes for harder-to-fill assignments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you talk about what you were seeing in bill rate trends? And if you could talk about -- in terms of any pay rate inflation that you might be seeing in the U.S., I'm particularly wondering given that it is, in fact, a relatively low unemployment rate for a college professional.","M. Keith Waddell","So bill rate trends globally, our bill rates were up 0.2% year-over-year. And that's down about a point from last quarter. That said, that's currency impacted and it's non-U.S. impacted such that in the U.S., we've still got low- to mid-single digit year-over-year bill rate increases we've enjoyed for some number of quarters. As to pay rate information, given lower white-collar unemployment, there clearly are some positions where there are supply shortages, notably some tech positions. In accounting\/finance, senior accountants, financial analysts would be more in demand. And where there's somewhat short supply, frankly, that's usually an environment where we add even more value, where we're able to source that where others aren't and charge for it accordingly.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a separate follow-up, really impressive reacceleration in Protiviti's revenue. Could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the flow of projects? Do you think that kind of growth rate is durable? And I'm wondering if the fourth quarter flow should be helped by internal audit projects flows?","M. Keith Waddell","So Protiviti revenue, seasonally the third quarter is typically its best. That has happened again. We were quite pleased with how it's gone with internal audit, with financial services risk and compliance and with IT, security and asset management. So it's the same solutions that we focused on now for some quarter, performed quite well during this quarter. In addition, we've gotten more and more traction going to market together with our staffing divisions where Protiviti manages the project for the client and many of the arms and legs are provided by our staffing division consultants. So good, solid quarter for Protiviti. The fourth quarter, because of the holiday impact, which is somewhat greater in Protiviti than for staffing, where many of its clients take the entire period between Christmas and New Year's, there's typically a larger fourth quarter holiday impact for Protiviti. And that usually shows up in slightly lower sequential revenues. But year-over-year, we still feel good, and Protiviti is very optimistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Max and Keith, I wanted to jump in on the 7% growth for flex staffing in October, same-day basis constant currency year-over-year. Keith, that's for worldwide, right? And if you could, so at 7%, really, it's not that much different than what you just grew in the quarter overall. Does the business in October feel quite as good as it had kind of earlier in the summer?","M. Keith Waddell","The short answer is yes, and I would make these observations. I would say that intra-quarter trends in the third quarter were better than they were in the second quarter. If you remember, in the second quarter, there was a consistent deceleration such that we grew 13% during the quarter, and then post quarter, it dropped down to 8%. In the third quarter, we dropped down somewhat in July. It's been consistent thereafter such that for the third quarter, we've reported 8% growth, and we're out of the gate at 7%, roughly the same number. So we do feel that the trends are solid as we speak. Clients have gotten a little more cautious. It is a modestly tougher market condition. There is economic uncertainty that's impacting our clients. But that said, the intra-quarter trends and post-quarter are better this quarter than they were a quarter ago.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Cool. And also, Max, you said something quickly in your last remarks about flex staffing penetration coming back to a high. I hope -- just to make sure we got your point right, you, in no way, were suggesting that penetration rates for flex staffing or for professional flex staffing was peaking, right?","Harold Max Messmer","I think I was trying to imply we're going to go past those peaks, at least that's our view. If you think about it from our perspective, we feel like we've been doing very well in a very difficult labor market. So we would expect if and as the labor markets improve, and we get some clarification in terms of the fiscal cliff and all the other things going on out there, that frankly, the converts to the use of flexible staffing that have been the silver lining of this recession will come into play, and that you'll see new penetration and new peak rates achieved. That's our hope.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes. Maybe just at a high level, can you talk a little bit about kind of the incremental profit margins here? It seems during the last couple of quarters, in particular, this quarter on, even on slower growth, the pace of margin expansion on a year-over-year basis is picking up. Is that just leveraging some of the tech investments you've made or more aggressively managing international as you talked about, or are there other factors we should think about?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, Tim, we have expanded our margins. We're pleased with that. We've continued to expand our gross margins starting with our pay bill spreads. That's certainly a major contributor to the higher incremental margins. In addition, we've done a better job at controlling our costs, starting with non-U.S. But we have leveraged some of the earlier investments we made in tech, all of which have our operating margins approaching prior levels, but by no means peaked out. Again, as we've said on prior calls, look at what we're doing at high 7s, low 8 unemployment rates, and imagine what we could be doing with typical mid-cycle unemployment rates, which are much lower. But I think our margin recovery in this cycle so far is one of the highlights of how we performed.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And the gross margin here, what's your outlook kind of moving into the fourth quarter? I know sometimes you'll have adjustments to the accruals. And I guess just in the context of the bill rate, at least on a global basis flattening out, can you continue to expand that?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, on a sequential basis, our modeling would say that gross margins would be flattish. But that still gives you growth year-over-year. So no big changes in the fourth quarter. You always have the -- to the extent you've estimated unemployment, FICA, workers' comp, those things all get trued up at the end of the year, which will result in little adjustments, but we don't think anything big's coming of that.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, and last, just numbers question quickly, the tax rate. Was that improved profitability internationally, or was there something unusual that brought it down to 39% and then kind of what should we think about going forward?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, depending on whether you're comparing to a year ago or to the last quarter, it goes down or up. But I think the important thing is, as we look forward, we think the tax rate for the fourth quarter will be in the ballpark, around the same level that it was in the third quarter. That said, there's always -- I mean, there's more variability, let's call it a point or 2 in either direction based on the composition of your income from a country standpoint, and whether there are any settlements with taxing authorities. There's a lot of moving parts when it comes to the tax rate. But I don't think there's going to be any major change from the third quarter just ended to the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just 2, first on Germany -- I'm sorry, France, Belgium, U.K., your major European operations. Can you talk about which is the most difficult and if things are stable there over the last couple of months? And then just looking at your SG&A growth over the last sort of 5 quarters, it's been decelerating. Do you think we're now -- on a year-on-year growth basis, it's been decelerating, so we try to look at it organically. But do you think we're sort of at the growth rate now that where SG&A growth starts to accelerate again?","M. Keith Waddell","All right. So let me -- I'm writing here. The -- as to Germany, France, U.K., Belgium, the most challenged is the U.K. consistent with prior quarters, combination of tougher market conditions, and we walked away from lower margin business. The sense is the U.K. has stabilized and maybe bottomed out, only time will tell. Belgium, slightly negative this quarter for the first time. Those market conditions clearly impacted by the debt crisis there. France, a little better than Belgium from a growth rate standpoint, not significantly different. And then Germany, as I said before, just solid finance and accounting, as well as tech, temp, as well as perm. As to SG&A growth decelerating, so now I guess we're talking dollars and not percentages of revenue. As we move forward in time, as our revenues grow, we should cover our fixed cost better, be it administrative compensation out in the field, be it the back office central cost out here in California, which would say you get some operating leverage from future revenue growth. I'm confusing myself a little bit about accelerating, decelerating, depending on whether we're talking percentages or dollars. But I guess the point is, we should get more operating leverage as a percentage of revenue as we move forward and grow our revenue as we expect our headcount additions to swing, as do revenues, and not necessarily make outsized headcount investments on the one hand or reductions on the other.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I was trying to get whether you were just sort of following your revenue trends, or you were coming to the end of an investment cycle. I didn't know which was the bigger driver.","M. Keith Waddell","I'd say we're following our revenue trends. The end of the investment cycle, we are always investing according to the revenue trends based on productivity as we've done forever. So I would say we will continue to invest proportionate to our revenue growth, or we'll continue to reduce proportionate to our revenue decline, depending on the country that you're talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just wanted to circle back quickly to Protiviti. You guys did a great job expanding operating margins despite the fact that gross margins fell. Can you just talk about why gross margins contracted? Is that something we should expect going forward?","M. Keith Waddell","The seemingly anomaly there, Jeff, is actually pretty easy to understand. You have a much higher percentage of contractors from staffing on Protiviti engagements than we did a year ago, and you get a lower gross margin from those individuals than you do on Protiviti full-time individuals. So given the mix shift, the overall gross margin declined a bit. But that gets more than made up at the operating income line, and we want as much of that as we can get.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, got it. Just a couple of quick numbers questions. Just in terms of what's embedded in your guidance for share count for the fourth quarter and what we should expect for capital spend.","M. Keith Waddell","Share count should be flat to down a bit as our repurchases follow us in the share count. CapEx, we're talking around $15 million, which gets you to $50 million for the year, which is a little light of what we expected, but it's more timing than it is any absolute reduction. But some of that will carry over into next year.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, great. And then just jumping ahead, I know you're not giving first quarter guidance. Is there a -- are there fewer billing days in the first quarter 2013 because we're lapping the leap year?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. So first quarter 2013, I don't have in front of me -- I'll just have to get, but we haven't -- we actually go through this calculation based on actual experience around holidays. The issue is the day before a holiday, the day after a holiday, based on the day and week of the holiday, based on our history, how many effective days do we have? So it's not as easy as looking at the calendar and figuring out what the billing days are. And we just haven't made those calculations yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anj Singh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Anjili Singh","Just a couple of quick questions from my end. I noticed that your Robert Half Technology business declined the most on a relative basis, Q-over-Q and year-over-year. I was wondering if you can talk about what drove that weakness and just generally if you could talk about pockets of strength or weakness by a vertical market within your U.S. client base.","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. So first of all, on a same-day constant currency basis, Tech sequentially grew the fastest during the quarter because a year ago, it also grew the fastest. On a year-over-year basis, it had the toughest comparisons. So while its year-over-year growth rate looks lower, it's because it had the toughest comparisons of the group. If you just look quarter-on-quarter, second quarter versus third, you adjust for currency and billing days, tech grew the fastest. As to pockets of vertical strength, we are very diversified with our middle-market client base by geography, by vertical, and there's no vertical that's driving our growth.","Anjili Singh","Okay. And just -- I know last quarter, you gave out a percentage of revenue mix internationally and by European countries. Would you be able to provide that again?","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. It's not that different, and we will probably post updates within the next few weeks to our website, but I'll tell you what we're going to show. So international overall is 27%; Europe would be 13%, and that 13% would further break down 5% Germany, 4% Belgium, 3% France, 1% other. The most noteworthy thing there is for the first time ever, Germany is bigger than Belgium, both in terms of revenues and in terms of operating income, which is no surprise given the growth rates we've talked about. So that's Europe. Outside of Europe, you've got Canada, which is 6%; Asia-Pac, which is 4%; and the U.K., which is 4%. So no major swings there relative to a quarter ago.","Operator","Next, we have Gary Bisbee with Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the first question, I'd like to go back for a second to the SG&A. The year-over-year growth in absolute dollar terms was 0 or flat for the whole company. I'm sure that part of that was the FX impact. But following on Paul's question, it's decelerated sharply. Just based on the revenue guidance and how you're thinking about this, are we likely to see SG&A costs in aggregate begin to grow again, or is this sort of sustainable for another quarter or 2 based on how you're thinking about the revenue outlook?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, our field compensation plans are highly variable and tied directly to revenues. So you first have to start with your revenue assumption to determine that cost component. Outside of that, just as we focused on SG&A costs this quarter, we plan to continue that into the fourth quarter. And traditionally, in the fourth quarter, we do pretty well with our SG&A cost. So we're cautiously optimistic that when we talk a quarter from now, you'll be similarly pleased with our SG&A costs, either because, on an absolute basis, they were flat to down again or because revenues grew more than you expected. We paid our people more.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just a follow-up, can you give us a sense as to how to think about the trend line of activity on the international business? I mean, does it feel like it's getting worse and the growth rate could get worse for a couple of quarters, or is it -- is enough of it like Germany doing okay, that it's likely to be weak, but stabilizing, and not seeing the pace of decline accelerate?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, if you look at the last few quarters and the trend line in the IT business, clearly, the growth has decelerated. So in this quarter overall, it was down 1%. Last quarter, it was up 3%. Quite frankly, that's less deceleration than we would have expected for the third quarter. Into the fourth quarter, our people are cautiously optimistic that it's leveled out. But I think it's prudent to consider a similar amount of deceleration into the fourth quarter that we've seen in the third. The economic conditions haven't changed dramatically. We're not in free fall. It's not panic time in the countries we operate, which are mostly northern Europe. But I think it would be reasonable and prudent to model further international deceleration into the fourth quarter. And, hopefully, we're all pleasantly surprised.","Operator","Next, we have Randy Reece with Avondale Partners.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Avon calling. I was wondering, the year-over-year change in temp staffing gross margin, how much came from geographic mix shift. How much came from the faster growth of Management Resources and Tech versus the rest of the business?","M. Keith Waddell","So the pay bill spread strengthening was pretty broad-based in the U.S., clearly, non-U.S. when you say geo, if we're talking U.S. versus non-U.S., it's totally A Tale of Two Cities there. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we also benefited from modestly lower fringe benefit cost, which are primarily how many temporaries qualify for holiday pay, which moves around within the course of a year. So those -- that wasn't necessarily MR or Tech. So I don't think you can look at the mix shift as principally driving the improvement in gross margin. But instead, a more broad-based pay bill spread expansion as well as modestly lower fringe benefit cost, which is also pretty broad-based.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Also, can you give the depreciation expense for the quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Depreciation for the quarter, hold on. Let's see. It's $12 million.","Operator","Next, we have Tobey Sommer with SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give some commentary specifically with regards to the IT growth rates and kind of bill pay rate spreads domestically. Were they -- you do give extra information in the tables over the last couple of quarters, I appreciate that. But I was wondering if you could give commentary specifically on the IT portion?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as I think we discussed last quarter, we don't break out our lines of business between U.S. and non-U.S. But I would say that the technology U.S. trend isn't that different than the overall trend, U.S. versus non-U.S. And the comments I previously made about sequential versus year-over-year and tougher comps apply in spades to the U.S.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And could you give us a sense of your capacity now in your recruiter base? Because I guess you did show some impressive SG&A control, I think in the quarter, that contributed to good margins. And I'm just kind of -- want to get a sense for what kind of positive revenue growth, like kind of reacceleration may require you to kind of shift and start adding more resources.","M. Keith Waddell","So there were 2 types of investments we made in Tech. One, I'll call field managerial infrastructure, which would be branch managers and above. That was largely a 2- to 4-quarter phenomenon that we continue to lever to this day. The other were recruiters and account managers on the ground. We made outsized investments in those particularly early. They've grown into the size of their businesses such that as we continue to grow in Tech, we will need to add more Tech recruiters. However, we will not need to add more Tech managerial infrastructure, so you -- we would still expect to see operating leverage in Tech even as we continue to add recruiters commensurate with revenue growth.","Operator","Next we have Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Keith, it sounds like the revenue guide is pretty similar to Q3 yet you've 1 fewer day sequentially and going into kind of Q4, some holiday impact. Can we kind of assume things are getting a little bit better, or is it just a function of additional contribution from different regions? Just any thoughts around that. Again, it sounds like there's 1 fewer billing days. Is there anything to read into there?","M. Keith Waddell","So it's true that our revenue guidance for Q4 is the same as Q3, and it's true that notwithstanding the same revenue guidance, the earnings guidance is $0.02 higher at the low and at the high. And so what we're doing is, we're rolling forward the higher gross margins that we actually experienced in the third quarter. And to some degree, we're rolling forward the lower SG&A costs, neither of which we anticipated in the third quarter to the extent that were actually realized. So said differently, the better-than-expected profitability in the third quarter, to some degree, got dialed into our fourth quarter guidance on the same revenue base that we -- the range of revenues that we guided last quarter.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Understood. And then just -- as far as I can remember, this is the first time where there's kind of been a decoupling between Europe and the U.S. in terms of overall GDP. How does that impact the way you're managing the business? And what's kind of been some challenges around that?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, the challenge has been that the revenues outside the U.S., given economic and market conditions, are slightly declining, and we're having to adjust our cost structures accordingly. But that's something we've now dealt with, with a few quarter -- for a few quarters. I think our teams outside the United States are doing a very nice job doing that. And, oh, by the way, it's actually tougher to adjust downwards your headcounts outside the U.S., and they're still doing a nice job with it. So that's the biggest differential between how we're managing the U.S. and how we're managing Europe.","Operator","And as we are approaching the end of our time today, our last question comes from Jennifer Huang with UBS.","Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the expense question one more time. Can you comment on how much of your SG&A expenses are more or less variable, sort of like compensation, versus fixed?","M. Keith Waddell","It's somewhat difficult to answer that question crisply because it depends on your time horizon. So is the cost of one of our recruiters, one could say, well, their salary is fixed and their incentive pay is variable. But if in your time horizon, you're willing to reduce that headcount, the whole cost is variable. So we've shied away from fixed versus variable because our history and our intent is to manage our headcounts as closely as we can to the top line, which makes it more variable than the salary incentive pay mix would otherwise indicate.","Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe in a slightly different way, I noticed that the office count actually was flat in Europe and was down by 2 offices in the U.S. Are there opportunities as you look forward given the environment in Europe to manage the office counts down in Europe for -- in the relatively near term?","M. Keith Waddell","We have many fewer offices than most staffing firms. We cover a broader territory than most staffing firms. The -- while there might be some satellite locations that we'll consolidate in Europe, there's not going to be a major reduction in the number of locations in the U.S. or in Europe.","Harold Max Messmer","Stated differently, since we deal with higher skilled workers, they are readily willing to travel greater distances between offices. We don't have to have offices every few blocks, so to speak, as some light industrial firms might. So that's why we don't need as many offices.","Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then last question on -- just digging deeper into Germany. You've obviously seen very solid growth there. Do you think the growth that you're seeing is a function of the investments that you've made in the past year or so, or are there actually pockets of strength within the German economy that is also supporting this double-digit growth rate? And if it's the former, can you maybe comment on where you're seeing sort of market share shift in your favor?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, the 2 are very related because Germany, I think virtually everybody would agree, is the big winner in Europe, it certainly -- the markets there are much stronger than they are in most places. For that reason, we've been willing to invest. We've made outsized investments in Tech because we didn't have much of a tech presence there. So because the market was stronger, we made more investments. Because we made more investments, our growth rates were higher. And as we sit here today, our intention is to continue to make investments in Germany because our market outlook there remains very positive.","Harold Max Messmer","And we have a very strong management team and, obviously, our goal is to gain market share everywhere, and we hope that's happening in Germany, but that's hard to measure. But we do have a very good team on the field.","That was our last question.

Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Messmer","Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us.

From the About Us tab, go to our Investor Center, where you will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link.","Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.308 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the second quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.64, both revenues and EPS were slightly above the midpoint of our previous guidance for this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $253 million, capital expenditures were $11 million.","During the quarter we returned $31 million to our stockholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares for $47 million during the quarter. We have 4.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","Second quarter revenues were strongest internationally, but we were also pleased with the quarter-over-quarter sequential performance of our domestic staffing operations. Every U.S. staffing line of business reported higher sequential revenue growth this year than the same period a year ago. Sequential revenue growth for overall U.S. staffing operations was 2% in the second quarter versus a sequential decline of 1% a year ago. Robert Half return on invested capital was 29% during the second quarter.","I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results.","Keith Waddell","As Max noted, global revenues were $1.308 billion in the second quarter. This is down 3% from a year ago on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis.","Revenues for our staffing businesses were down 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $872 million, down 3% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $239 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The second quarter had 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of 2016. The current third quarter has 63.1 billing days compared to 64.1 days in the third quarter of last year.","Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","The effect of currency exchange rates decreased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the second quarter which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.7%.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $197 million in the second quarter with $164 million coming from revenues in the United States and $33 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 1% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis.","U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 2% from the prior year on a same-day basis and non-U.S. revenues were down 1%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.","Now let\u2019s turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 20 basis point decline from the same period one year ago primarily due to the absence of prior year workers compensation credits of $1.4 million and slight lower due to higher conversions.","Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.1% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter, which is up compared to last year's 9.9%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin fell 10 basis points versus a year ago to 43.7%.","Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.","In the second quarter staffing SG&A costs were 33.5% of staffing revenues versus 32.3% in the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.","Operating income from our staffing divisions was $114 million in the second quarter, down 13% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.3%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $93 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 13% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%. Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million, down 14% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 18.7%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% from 2016, producing an operating margin of 8.4%.","At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $708 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.3 days.","Before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and so far in July, all adjusted for currency.","Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues down with 2% versus the prior year compared to a 1.6% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first two weeks of July was down 2.9% compared to the prior year.","For our permanent placement operations June revenues were up 5.4% versus last year compared to a 1.4% increase reported for the full quarter. For the first three weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were up 9.8% compared to the same period last year.","This information covers trends we saw during the second quarter and in July. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time and include holiday impacts from the 4th of July.","With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance, revenues, $1,305,000,000 to $1,365,000,000; income per share, $0.66 to $0.72. The midpoint of our Q3 guidance implies reported revenues are down slightly or negative 0.3% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues are up 1.1% adjusted for days and currencies. EPS is down 2.5%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and our SEC filings.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We were encouraged by the second quarter results particularly the continued strength in our non-U.S. staffing operations and the sequential progress of our U.S. operations. Although GDP growth in the United States has been sluggish the business outlook is positive since the start of 2017 U.S. business leaders particularly owners of small and mid size companies have expressed confidence in their prospects. If GDP growth improves, we believe hiring activity should not be far behind. The Fed Reserve Beige Book report that economic activity expanded across all 12 Fed Reserve districts in June with the pace of growth ranging from slight to moderate.","Fed also reported that employment across most of the nation maintained a modest to moderate pace of expansion. The common thread among many of these business sentiment surveys is concerned over the lack of available talent, as skill shortage has become more pronounced to professional occupations. Robert Half is positioned to help companies locate and hire that\u2019s hard to find talent, it is what we do best.","We\u2019re investing continually in technology innovation to better serve our customers, but technology has it\u2019s limitation and a great many steps in the hiring process require human skill and judgment we believe Robert Half\u2019s competitive difference is our ability to offer both innovative technology solutions and personal attention backed by our nearly 70 years of experience.","Protiviti also had a solid quarter, particularly its U.S. internal audit and risk and compliance practices. We believe Protiviti is well positioned in the market place.","Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. We ask if you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we'll return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. Hey Keith, I wonder if you could just help us, I mean, seems like you've seen a nice uptick in then revenue. I think if memory serves me right, you went three quarters of literally the same revenue range and now you're seeing a kind of an uptick in that, which you're seeing some leverage, their earnings.","Any sense of kind of some of the puts and takes, the low end versus the high end and then what tax rates implied in the EPS guidance?","Keith Waddell","Okay. First of all the tax rate is 37.5%, which is a little lower than Q2, we're going to get some credits in the third quarter. Puts and takes on low and high end. So, generally when are talking staffing now, tone of business clients remain wait and see, they remain measured, although Sentiment does remain high, hiring is selective, it's methodical.","We are seeing sequential demand improving slowly, perm a little better than temp. Candidates have many options and must be sold on the opportunities presented. Europe remains strong. So, the third quarter guidance, we focus first on sequential progress given the trends, the second quarter June was a little softer than the first two months but not significantly so.","There is a lot of noise in the post quarter because of the force. So, we believe that starting in the U.S. will continue to have a little more sequential improvement that's dialed into the midpoint. U.S. remain strong led by continental Europe particularly Germany and Belgium.","We expect that would continue so that year-on-year for the first time in several quarters adjusted for days in currency will actually show positive revenue growth. As we talked earlier, it is one day shorter than the quarter a year ago, so there's a differential between report and same day.","But generally speaking, the second quarter wasn\u2019t that different from the first, it was a little better. And our expectation at the midpoint of our guidance is that the third quarter gets a little better than the second quarter just reported.","Kevin McVeigh","That's super helpful. And then just one quick one, any thoughts on why the perm basin's been so much stronger than temp, just on a relative basis?","Harold Messmer","And that's its relatively new, we've had several quarters were perm was weaker than temp. We've now had a few rather where it's a bit stronger than temp. the thinking is there is pent up demand clients have differed hiring and as things begin looking a little better, they're now more willing to pull the trigger and catch up what they had differed and procrastinated on.","Generally speaking, we think perm and temp are highly correlated and we would expect temp to follow perm but it is true for the last few quarters perm has been stronger than temp and that continued right through the post quarter period we just talked about.","Kevin McVeigh","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Marcon from R. W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about philosophically how you would think about investing on a go forward basis. Assuming that the trends don\u2019t change materially, so maybe they are going on an upward slope but it's a slower grind. In other words, when we think about the SG&A, how should we think about that and operating margin expectations given kind of this kind of slow growth environment?","Keith Waddell","And so, on a go forward basis from an SG&A standpoint you've got two things going on. First of all with Europe earlier cycle growing nicely, we're aggressively adding to headcount. In the U.S. which is slightly negative, we're continuing to pretty much hold the line such that when you put the two together, we got compensation cost growing faster than revenue growth.","Further in the internal technology arena, we continue to invest heavily in our digital initiatives. Many of those are expensed rather than capitalized because their improvements of existing solutions rather than brand new solutions. So, together you've got some negative leverage from SG&A because of the headcount, because of the technology spending.","And by the way, a lot of what we've done in the past, in the recent past from a technology standpoint, has been software as a service, so we're having to pay those license fees currently which are expense as well.","So, when you put it all together as we said in our guidance, at our midpoint, same day constant currency, revenues were up 1% and EPS is down 2.5%, so there are some negative leverage one to the other but they're not totally out of balance.","Mark Marcon","No, they're not. That was very helpful. I mean, what level of and this is obviously on the whole and it would matter depending which segment. But what level of revenue growth which you need to get to in order to think about margins basically stand stable given the current pace?","Keith Waddell","I mean, low to mid-single-digits would certainly get us there. And a lot of what we're talking about investment wise is discretionary. So, we can always throttle lever down but given current conditions given the outlook, given the still the possibility of regulatory reform in the United States, given all of those things, we're thinking as I described.","But to the extent we can get mid low to mid-single and this quarter at midpoint we're talking about 1% growth. So, we're getting there. Things are improving, they're not getting worse, they're improving from a mix standpoint more with perm that's higher margin, so that's helpful. So, we're getting there.","Mark Marcon","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hey, Keith. I don\u2019t remember in past second quarters you're being so emphatic about saying watch out for the timing of July 4th. I guess we understand why you would say that in the second quarter but it doesn't seem like it's your usual transcript type comments and what I look at the temp revenues' being down in July, yet your total revenue being up in the guide.","I just don\u2019t quite get it, is it that maybe after July 4th like last week you saw an inflection positive. So, is it kind of looking at the individual weeks that make you feel like we're nudging positive?","Keith Waddell","Well, the July 4th, Andrew simply put an exclamation point on, it's a short period, it's two weeks.","Andrew Steinerman","Yes.","Keith Waddell","And the two weeks was inclusive of July 4, which fell on Tuesday rather than Monday a year ago and there are 1000 theories out there about whether Tuesday's better than Monday that we don\u2019t need to go there.","Andrew Steinerman","Right.","Keith Waddell","But the point is the post quarter, we view as noise. And so, just like last quarter where we had a great March that we didn\u2019t totally roll into our guidance. This quarter June was so-so, and we didn\u2019t totally roll that into our guidance either.","We've gone through the same bottom up process, discussions with all our key field people, Protiviti and staffing alike and based on that we've come up with a guidance that we have. But clearly, the guidance is more positive than the month of June or the start in July.","Andrew Steinerman","Uh-huh, right. And could you just make a quick comment about Protiviti in the guide?","Keith Waddell","So, Protiviti internal audit's strong, staged strong, companies continued to focus on stricting their controls. The growth there has been moderating because they've had some large consulting project ends that they hadn\u2019t yet fully replaced. Those are in the technology area as well as the risk in compliance area.","The international zone for Protiviti had some monster comps a year ago if you look and some of those projects are ending which will have to be replaced. So, net net our guide for Protiviti is that revenues year-on-year will be flat to slightly negative and that's principally about replacing the large project ends.","And as you know in the consulting business, you can't perfectly time the new projects versus the ends of the old projects.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Just I want to ask maybe on June. What was the feedback from the reviews you did with the field staff, was there any difference in behavior, any kind of reason that you kind of gain from those conversations?","Harold Messmer","There was nothing earth shattering, Tim. It I mean, there are some give and take month-to-month. The improvement has been a bit uneven, it's not happening in a straight line. That said, notwithstanding June and notwithstanding the early July, everybody standing by their guidance for the third quarter. Where generally speaking the United States included, things are getting a little better.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And then can you talk about the tax segment in more detail what you're seeing there. I think a year ago you talked about kind of one large customer that you'd kind of I think walked away from or something like that if I recall right. But I think we should be getting close to anniversering that. So, just can you elaborate what you're seeing within that vertical?","Keith Waddell","Well, certainly it's there's no one large customer impact. I would say generally we find with our middle market companies that their tech spending has a larger discretionary element than is the case for their accounting and finance spending.","In accounting finance, you got closes that you have to do, you've got filings that you have to do. In tech, particularly in tech support, you don\u2019t have those same deadlines, further there is more discretion as to when you start new projects.","So, generally speaking we're finding there is more discretion in our clients tech spending and therefore the revenues are a bit more impacted than is the case in accounting finance.","Now, that said, again looking sequentially, tech we had growth there as well as we talked about every single one of our lines of business including in the U.S. did have sequential growth. That would include tech and we were encouraged by that.","Tim McHugh","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, good afternoon. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just a question on the sequential improvement in the U.S. and what's implied in the guide. Is that more a function of the environment improving or is there anything internal that you've done that you can point to drive some of that improvement?","Harold Messmer","Well, you never know for sure. We're always trying to get better internally and the further away we get from the sales force conversion last August, the more that's in their rear view mirror. But generally speaking, we would observe that the environment has got a little better.","And to me, perm is usually more economically sensitive than as temp and it seems to be what's leading at the moment which is which boards well for the environment.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, okay. And specifically for account temp, but is there anything that you're looking forward to release within this year or next year like the part, like greater demand for accounting sense?","Keith Waddell","Well, in accounting there are always change. So, we have got wherever that change going on as we speak. You've got lease accounting which is expected to be more process intensive and impact a broader number of companies than REVRAC [ph] has. So, we have that to look forward to. But there is always something going on in accounting.","So, there is nothing that's going to move the needle in a major way. But change is good and there is always change and there is change on the horizon. And those are two examples that come to mind.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks, so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. This has kind of been touched upon in some of the earlier questions, but just wanted some more thoughts. Are you actually feeling the business pick up or is it just easier comps, I know you mentioned perm as a leading indicator.","But you're implying a 2% acceleration from 2Q to 3Q midpoint. I mean, your comp is also easing by 2.5 points. So, maybe as it relates to what you're assuming for contribution from U.S. temp, how much of this is just easier comps versus actual strengthening of business?","Keith Waddell","Well, one reason we talk sequential rather than year-on-year is because it takes the comps out of the argument. So, clearly the year-on-year comps are getting easier as you described but when you're looking sequentially, we're talking about the third quarter versus the second quarter just ended.","So, the comps are a lesser part of the story when you look sequentially. So, we do think things are slowly picking up. Slowly picking up and the comps do get easier year-on-year and part of the reason, one of the reasons why year-on-year you're seeing improvement is because the comps get easier but the other reason you're seeing year-on-year improvement is because we're growing sequentially.","If you grew sequentially every quarter, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about year-over-year, it takes care of itself.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay, got it. And then for my second question, realizing you guys don\u2019t really guide more than a quarter out, but in light of Protiviti margins year-to-date and what you mentioned with regards to your growth outlook there. How should we be thinking about what you've stated in the past that you can do sort of double digit margins in that business on a full year sort of basis.","Is that realistic for this year and any reason why you didn\u2019t show the typical seasonal uptick in Protiviti margins at 2Q?","Keith Waddell","So, Protiviti margins given their revenue performance, I would consider strong. And in fact, the big sequential increase for Protiviti comes in the third quarter as many companies do their annual Sarbanes-Oxley compliance work for the quarter. We do expect Protiviti operating margins for the quarter to be well into double digits and our expectation is for the full year and long term it's a double digit operating margin business.","We've just got some noise around replacing older larger projects with newer projects and their puts and takes always in that way. But we haven\u2019t in any way reduced our margin expectations long term for Protiviti.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay, got it. Thanks, so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Ryan Leonard filling in for Manav. You mentioned beginning of the call talking about the confidence in the U.S. has improved notably since 2017. You mentioned that there has been some perm hiring as people are kind of really taking action on a pipeline that they let build up a little bit.","So, I guess what are the take for that increased optimism in some of hiring perm to then kind of filter in to the temp side. I mean, your conversation with clients, is it are they supply issues or are they still waiting for regulatory clarity, I think you can broaden on your client conversations, would be helpful.","Harold Messmer","Well, on supply what's interesting is is that there is no question that supply is tight. But what's interesting is our temp bill rates were up 2.5% this quarter on a year-over-year basis.","So, we now had four or five quarters in a row where we have less wage inflation than we've had the immediately prior quarter. So, what we're seeing is that our clients they're just unwilling to pay more because they don\u2019t believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients.","So, it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines. So, what we need to see more temp growth, we need to see clients with more activities themselves like and their wait and see, when they see it they'll do it the transactional accounting operations positions that are a big part of Accountemps, they need more transaction volumes at our clients which follow Sentiment.","So, regulatory reform would definitely help. It's clearly been delayed as everyone knows. But if you look at our chart over 10 years, you'll see perm and temp are highly correlated. Perm's getting better, we would expect temp to get better.","Unidentified Analyst","So, I guess to follow-up on that, I mean you did say that it's unprecedented. So, historically they have been indicators. But what data are you looking at that will cause you to go out and hire a lot of recruiters saying we think things are getting better and we talked about the trough in 1Q.","So, I mean what is that you think would indicate the underlying volume is picking up?","Harold Messmer","We would see weekly ours billed pick up, we then measure productivity per person internally. We would see that getting stretched and as we saw that getting stretched, we would begin to add to headcount, which is what we're doing outside of U.S. or simply holding the line in the U.S.","Unidentified Analyst","Helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys, good afternoon. Any more margin commentary you can provide about just thinking through the guidance, sometimes you give a little more color by segment or some of the puts and takes. Thank you.","Keith Waddell","From a margin standpoint, we think our gross margins will stay flat, we did not get the workers comp lift this quarter that we've got in prior quarters. To keep the gross margins where they are, they're at pretty high levels.","So, we're not unhappy to keep gross margins flat both year-on-year and sequentially. SG&A as we talked about, is a bit pressured from the aggressive addition to heads outside the U.S. coupled with holding the line in the U.S.","We continue to make internal tech investments that we talked about, such that year-on-year there is some margin compression on the staffing side. Protiviti, there's a little margin compression year-on-year. But sequentially there is a nice improvement in the third quarter which is seasonally their best quarter such that when you put it all together from an operating margin standpoint, you will see some delusion year-on-year less than a percentage point.","And sequentially you'll see some improvement led by Protiviti sequential lift.","Gary Bisbee","Great, thanks. And then, how meaningful is the incremental margin on the lost revenue from the change in number of days on EPS. I guess, really what I\u2019m getting at is, was it a meaningful impact in Q2 and well at being Q3 the fact that you\u2019re facing down year-over-year number of billing days to EPS?","Harold Messmer","Well clearly, it has an impact all your fixed costs are the same yet your cover was less margin because of the shorter quarter. So it\u2019s impactful and it\u2019s more impactful than your average margin because your fixed costs are your fixed costs. So clearly, more days is better than fewer and this quarter we\u2019ve got one fewer than a year ago.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, fair enough, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you. Within PERM I was wondering if you could compare and contrast the performance within the various signs for the accounting occupations that you traffic in with IT and perhaps demand in the creative group as well? Thanks.","Harold Messmer","We never breakout per say the components of PERM, I would say the improvement in PERM demand is broad based and it includes all of the segments that you talk about, but we don\u2019t specifically comment on one versus the other inside of PERM.","Tobey Sommer","Okay. And then, growth within the creative group is it comparable to the segment growth or somehow different?","Harold Messmer","And again, we do not breakout for materiality reasons the results of the creative group, but it\u2019s doing fine.","Tobey Sommer","So to be on the better side?","Harold Messmer","It\u2019s doing fine.","Tobey Sommer","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Kim filling in for Hamzah. You made some comments about the strength in the non-U.S. staffing operations. Could you maybe give us a little more color around that in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the international staffing markets, where do you, is there any particular countries or geographies that you see moving in and out of any cycles?","Keith Waddell","The story is almost all good we\u2019re led by Germany and Belgium on the continent. France has certainly picked up nicely. Canada doing well, U.K. flattish as Brexit impacts at least Centamin in the U.K. Australia doing well as well. So outside the U.S. pretty much across the board with the U.K. being flat everybody else growing nicely and continently the Europe the best of all. And the nice part of that is we get our best margins, non-U.S. margins in Germany and Belgium and they\u2019re two of the strongest markets that we have. Further you got the euro appreciating relative to the dollar and so that\u2019s even more icing.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s really helpful, thanks Wad. And maybe follow up to that is, on the regulatory side is there any changes in the international space that either you\u2019re on the lookout for positive or negative impact?","Keith Waddell","No. I know there is discussion in France out sometime in the distance about changes and their payroll laws, labor laws. France is of that bigger deal to us one way or the other so I don\u2019t totally understand what\u2019s being proposed. But from the standpoint of its impact on Robert Half it would be de-minimus. There is nothing else that moved the needle, I mean there are always some changes back and forth, there is some anti-money laundering regs come in non-U.S. I mean, there are some things happening but nothing that moves a needle in a major way.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Your last question comes from David Silver with Morningstar. Your line is open.","David Silver","Yes, hi, thank you. I guess, I would like to just maybe go back to the question about the differential performance offshore as opposed to the U.S. and I think couple of your peers have also noted stronger results in Europe in particular. And I hope I\u2019m not splitting hairs, but would you say there is something just basically economics driven to the differential performance here or would you say it\u2019s something I don\u2019t know either regulatory or cultural in other words typical large employers let\u2019s say in Germany or Belgium are structurally more likely to utilize the services of staffing company relative to those in the U.S. In other words keep their full time employment levels down or prefer to use Robert Half as a conduit let\u2019s say between the employee and the employer? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","We would observe that cultural differences haven\u2019t changed much off late and that [indiscernible] results favoring non-U.S. are more macroeconomic than anything else. All of the cultural differences you noted are true, but they haven\u2019t really changed that much in the last few quarters. But what has changed is that the macro in particularly Canada and Europe is currently improving and staffing is participating that\u2019s true at Robert Half, that\u2019s true in the industry generally.","David Silver","Okay, thank you for that and just one last question. Big picture it\u2019s been kind of a turbulent legislative session in Washington this year and number of companies had hopes for economic legislation or economic incentives or reforms. From Robert Half\u2019s perspective are there one or two key legislative proposals or legislative issues where a change in the momentum in Washington would make a difference in the perspective of your customers in terms of pulling the trigger on more of that backlog or that potential hiring pool that you\u2019ve cited?","Keith Waddell","Well, I think if you survey that clients and there are many surveys out there, they would tell you two things. They would tell you tax reform and they would tell you regulatory reform and regulatory reform has happened to some degree. Tax reform has not but many shareholders have hope that it will as I said earlier. The sentiment remains high amongst our middle market client base, but they\u2019re wait and see type companies and they\u2019re still waiting to see. That said, things are getting a little bit better. They progressively gotten a little bit better over the course of the year and we expect that momentum to carry over into the third quarter and it\u2019s that foundation that we use to give our guidance for the third quarter which says things get a little bit better.","David Silver","That\u2019s it, thank you very much.","Harold Messmer","Could I add a comment to that and that is that as a full taxpayer with no debt of course, Robert Half itself would benefit greatly from tax reform as with our small to mid size clients. On your first point, I agree with Keith at the end of the day we think we\u2019re very well positioned to the extent that GDP growth in the United States picks up, you should see us pick up. Nothing would help us and our clients more than a pickup in GDP right now.","David Silver","Thank you.","A - Harold Messmer","Thank you. I think that was our last question, we appreciate everyone being with us on the call today.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference, if you have missed any part of the call it will be archived in audio format in the investor center of Robert Half\u2019s website at www.roberthald.com.

Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks you for joining us. As is our custom, I would like to remind you there are comments on the call today that contain predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar such expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable; however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call. For your convenience, our prepared remarks also are available on our website at roberthalf.com. From the About Us tab, go to our Investor Center, where you will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link.","Now let's review our fourth quarter 2015 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.305 billion, up 7% from the fourth quarter one year ago, or up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis. Income per share was $0.71, up 14% from this time last year. Cash flow from operations was $111 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million. We returned $27 million to our stockholders during the quarter through a $0.20 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1.4 million Robert Half shares for $67 million. In October, our board of directors approved the repurchase from time to time of an additional 10 million shares of common stock. All told, we have 10.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","Demand for our professional staffing and consulting services remained strong in the fourth quarter fueled by a healthy U.S. job market and low unemployment in numerous professional occupations, as well as a more positive economic backdrop in many of our non-U.S. markets.","We saw year-over-year revenue growth across the board in our staffing and consulting operations both in the United States and abroad. This was the company's 23rd straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 37%.","I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our fourth quarter results.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you. As Max said, global revenues were $1.305 billion in the fourth quarter. This is up 7% from the fourth quarter one year ago on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis. Fourth quarter staffing revenues were up 8% on a same-day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $892 million in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $217 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 332 staffing locations worldwide, including 92 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.","The fourth quarter had 62.3 billing days compared to 61.7 billing days in the fourth quarter a year ago. The current first quarter has 62.7 billing days compared to 62 billing days in the first quarter of last year.","Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates for our staffing lines of business on both the reported and same-day constant currency basis. This is further broken down by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","Currency exchange rates have the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $30 million in the fourth quarter, exchange rates also decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 3 points. Global revenues for Protiviti were $195 million in the fourth quarter with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $31 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 15% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15% and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from the prior year.","Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 2%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.","Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the fourth quarter was 37.3% of applicable revenues. This is a 40-basis-point improvement from the same period a year ago. The improvement relates primarily to higher pay\/bill spreads. The fourth quarter of 2015 also includes a $1.2 million workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits. Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.2% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is unchanged from last year's fourth quarter.","Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 40 basis points versus a year ago to 43.0%. Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $62 million or 32% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin one year ago for Protiviti was $53 million, or 30.7% of Protiviti revenues.","Staffing SG&A costs were 32.5% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with $12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 14% from the prior year. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter, compared to 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2015 with 3,800 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 15% from the prior year.","Operating income from our staffing operations was $117 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $99 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.9%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.3%.","Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $27 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 14.0%. At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $705 million. Implied days sales outstanding, DSO was 49.2 days.","Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter and in January, all adjusted for currency. Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consultant staffing divisions accelerated modestly in October, then decelerated in the latter part of the quarter. We exited the quarter with December growing 6% compared to 7% for the full fourth quarter. Revenue growth for the first three weeks of January was also up 6% compared to the prior year.","Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also accelerated in October then moderated the balance of the quarter with December growing 8% compared to 8% for the full quarter and then for first four weeks in January, permanent placement revenues increased 7% compared to the same period last year. This information designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But, as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers, as they represent very brief periods of time. That said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues $1.270 billion to $1.330 billion, income per share $0.61 to $0.67.","The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 8% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 10%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Keith. We were pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and we are optimistic about our prospects. Annual revenues in 2015 crossed the $5 billion mark for the first time. We anticipate the high demand for skilled talent will remain a growth driver for us, and we have every confidence in the opportunities ahead for Protiviti. While the stock market has been volatile and economic uncertainty persists, the U.S. labor market remains strong and international markets have also started to rebound.","In the United States, nearly 300,000 jobs were created in December alone, and 2.7 million jobs were added over the course of the year in 2015. A number of professional occupations are near full employment, which is placing pressure on the supply of available talent and increasing our value to clients. This is particularly true in technology staffing, and we are responding with investments to capitalize on this potential; locating hard-to-find talent is a specialty at Robert Half. The secular demand for temporary staffing also is ongoing. The use of flexible workers matched an all-time high during the fourth quarter. Temporary employees now represent 2.06% of the U.S. workforce.","And the word about Protiviti, we continue to be pleased with how Protiviti is performing. This is a very good business with an excellent management team. Protiviti has successfully diversified its service offerings, built a loyal and growing client base, and is seeing steady demand in all of its major consulting segments. Protiviti serves its clients in areas such as internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and information technology consulting, among others.","At this time, Keith and I'd be happy to answer questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. Wanted to focus on the additions of full-time employees you'd mentioned in your staffing divisions. I think you said it was up about 14% year-over-year. Were they weighted to any specific area? And if you could also talk about when was most of the hiring done? Was it done throughout the year, towards the beginning, or the end? Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Jeff, we did add about 14% to our staff. It was very back-loaded to the second half of the year. We talked about that a little bit on the last call. Our thoughts are the quarter we're now in, the first quarter, we will absorb the hiring that we did in the second half of 2015 and wouldn't add significantly to head count during this quarter. As to the line of business, it was pretty broad-based. It was a little heavier toward permanent placement, a little heavier toward technology, but certainly all of the divisions participated in the head count increase.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then, just a couple of numbers related questions. I was hoping you can give us what your expected tax rate and capital spending budget will be for 2016. Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. The tax rate, volatile as always. It was low in the fourth quarter because we had more benefits from foreign operations than we expected, plus when Congress passed in late quarter the tax extenders, which I guess was the PATH Act, that freed up some payroll tax credits that we recognized. We would not expect those to continue to that degree into the current first quarter. So the tax rate we're using for the first quarter and 2016 is around 39%, but as you know from prior quarters, that means somewhere between 38% and 40%.","CapEx, we do expect to increase our capital expenditures during 2016. The range we would give would be somewhere between $90 million and $100 million; midpoint would be $95 million. That's up from $75 million in 2015. Two or three things going on there. We're upgrading our IT internal infrastructure to cloud-based systems, both for our front office client and candidate relationship management systems on the staffing side. We're converting to a cloud-based HR and staff payroll system as well.","Further, we continue to invest in data science, data analytics, artificial intelligence as it relates to identifying, matching, prioritizing both leads, clients and candidates. And then further, we've got more lease expirations in 2016 than in 2015 and there would be more tenant improvement costs that relate to that. But as a percent of revenue, CapEx in 2016 would be a little bit higher. I think the historical average is 1.5% of revenue. And I think 2016, it's going to be 1.7%, 1.8% of revenue.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi. Keith, could you make a comment about the Protiviti fundamentals that are implied in the fourth quarter guide, particularly on both the revenue side and the profitability side, noting first quarter is usually a lower profitability seasonally for Protiviti.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So for the fourth quarter, Protiviti had another very good quarter of mid top line growth, much better than that bottom line growth. Going into the first quarter, year-on-year, we would again expect a mid double-digit top line growth and bottom line growth at as least as much as that. Sequentially, because the first quarter seasonally is Protiviti's slowest, sequentially it will be down as it is as always the case. But year-over-year, we expect very solid revenue growth. We expect a little bit of margin expansion, which means nice operating income growth.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. And when you say mid double-digit, you mean mid-teens, right?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. I just wanted to ask, you gave the color obviously by month. And I know you caution us not to over-read them, but given the stock market movements, I guess, what's your read of just sentiment from clients? Is there something to read into the difference in growth rates later in the quarter and in January even though they're not very much. But are you hearing any different? Are you sensing any different I guess environment out there right now?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, I would say that our people would observe that in November, December the clients got a little more cautious, whether that's due to market uncertainty or other reasons, the headlines about China, oil, et cetera, we could all debate. But our clients did get a little more cautious, not significantly more cautious. Further, December is always a somewhat odd month, because our internal staff have had a very good year in 2015. They probably checked out a little earlier, as did our clients frankly. So we felt like we've had a little more December effect than we would typically have.","But, generally speaking, the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. I mean, I think we were within $5 million of the midpoint of our $1.3 billion estimate. And generally speaking, our guidance for the first quarter isn't significantly different. So it's mostly more of the same. The fourth quarter wasn't that different from the third quarter. The first quarter guidance isn't that different than the fourth quarter. Now the tax rate swings things around. So the tax rate Q4 was low as we talked about, the tax rate Q1 goes back up. So if you look at sequential progress, one to the other, the tax rate has a big impact.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","What about with perm? I mean, was that sensitivity more felt in perm? I guess, the growth rate there is just \u2013 the year-over-year growth rate was a little slower in Q4 versus before, what would you, I guess, attribute that to?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, we would say, the clients becoming more cautious certainly impacted perm. It's odd in that on the one hand clients are still picky; candidates are also harder to close. They're accepting counteroffers, they're accepting competing offers, they're declining offers. So it's a little odd that at the same time clients and candidates are being picky. And that has the effect of increasing the days to fill or increasing the sales cycle, however, you'd like to describe it. But the point is perm was a little bit light of what we had projected for the fourth quarter. It wasn't dramatically light. We believe that current tone of business in perm is solid, and the guidance we've given for the first quarter reflects that.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Just in light of your \u2013 the comments that you just made, Max and Keith, how are you thinking about adding to head count over the course of the coming year? I mean, you've got solid business, but, obviously, there is some concerns and maybe on the margin some increased cautiousness among both candidates as well as employers. So I was just wondering how you're thinking that through.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, just as we back-loaded the head count growth in 2015, we've essentially front-loaded the head count for 2016. So clearly, in the first quarter that we're now in, we don't expect virtually any net additions to head count. We'll see how that goes. We'll then look toward the end of the first quarter as to what we do in the second quarter. But it's not that unlike 2015, where the head count was backend-loaded and the first half of 2015, there wasn't a lot of head count addition, either.","So we should have a couple of quarters where we leverage our SG&A better than what we've done intentionally the second half of 2015 by being more aggressive with the heads. I mean, frankly, it's been a few years since we've added more heads than our top line grew by. I think in rough numbers, we added 14% to our staffing head count and our revenues were up 10%. So simple math says, we've front-loaded, we've added to capacity at the beginning of 2016, we'll play it by here for the rest of the year.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And the 10-K is going to be out shortly. But do you have the actual number in terms of the internal head count?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes. The staffing number was 12,800. The Protiviti number was \u2013 just a second \u2013 3,800. So staffing up 14%, Protiviti up 15%.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then, one last question, if I may. Just with regards to RH Technology, on a sequential basis, it was down a little bit. Is there anything that you're seeing there?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","The theme is similar to the theme we just talked about. Clients got a little more cautious in the fourth quarter. We had the December wealth effect, where internal staff checked out sooner, clients checked out sooner. There is always natural project ends near the end of the year. That's something you deal with every year. So tech was a little bit lighter than we would have expected for the quarter, but not significantly so. Similarly, as we roll into 2015, tech is solid. Our Q1 guidance reflects that. We feel good about tech. But it was a little light, but not significantly so for the fourth quarter.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Keith. Thanks so much for the color into January from December and the fourth quarter globally for both perm and temp. Was there anything to talk about U.S. versus international as the trends went from December into January?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","There's no significant different story there, Paul. I would say, generally speaking, when we look outside the U.S., the UK remains solid, Germany remains solid. We had a nice quarter in Belgium, which should continue into the first quarter. Those were the three markets outside the U.S. that were the strongest. We've talked about Canada with energy impact, we've talked about Australia with energy impact. And France, that's running a little behind for us what the other Continental European countries are. But no major difference between how we re-enter 2016 versus how we exited 2015 between U.S. and non-U.S.","Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you run us through your expectations for the first quarter in a bit more detail around temp versus perm expectations, how you're thinking about gross margins in temp and SG&A trends overall? Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So embedded to the midpoint of our guidance and all of this is adjusted for currency and days, we see temp growth continuing to decelerate slightly. We see perm growth stay bullish. The comps helped us out there a year ago. The comps get a little easier. We see Protiviti year-on-year growth flat to down a little bit on very tough comps. Sequentially, due to normal seasonality, Protiviti will be down. Temp gross margin, year-on-year we see 10 basis points to 30 basis points of improvement, which is principally a carryover of the higher pay\/bill spreads that we've experienced through 2015.","SG&A, year-on-year will still be up 10 basis points, 20 basis points, because of the carryover impact of the head count additions. But, sequentially, we should be down 10 basis points to 30 basis points as we lever that head count as revenues grow in the first quarter. Protiviti SG&A year-on-year flat to up slightly as they make some infrastructure investments, they also are redoing their front office over the course of 2016.","Staffing operating income, flat to down, slightly year-over-year for the reasons I just talked about. Protiviti up 30 basis points to 50 basis points year-on-year; strong mid-teen top line growth, bottom line growth at least to that degree; tax rate 39% as I talked about earlier, which is about flat year-on-year, it's up sequentially as we discussed; shares down 1 million or so as a flow-through of the buybacks that we did during the fourth quarter. We \u2013 again, as we've done many, many, many, many, many quarters, we spend our cash flow \u2013 our free cash flow on some combination of dividends and share repurchases. And then, CapEx, as we mentioned earlier, our 2016 range is $90 million to $100 million as we make the infrastructure investments as I talked about.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Very thorough. And then, just two other quick ones. Perm operating margins were down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. I'm assuming that's because of the hiring, but wanted to check.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Perm's internal cost structure is more payroll-dependent than any division we have. So it's almost per se. If it's up or down, it's going to be because of head count.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And presumably, you expect to see some leverage on that as the new staff gets ramped up?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Sequentially, yes. Year-over-year, it will take some time to absorb that.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then, last question. Could you update us on bill rate trends?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Bill rates for the quarter were up 5%. Globally, adjusted for currency, that was up a touch relative to last quarter. It's essentially the first time in this cycle, we've gotten a 5% in front of a bill rate increase. Our pay rate increases lag a little bit, the 5%. All this discussion on cycle (31:31) we continue to believe as you compare to prior cycles. From a GDP standpoint, this cycle has been much more sluggish. From a wage inflation standpoint, not only for the economy generally, where the Employment Cost Index is up 2%-ish rather than high 2s in prior cycles. But for Robert Half, we've also seen a lot more wage inflation in cycles past than we've seen in this cycle. But we are, as I just mentioned, for the first time, seeing bill rate increases begin to touch 5%.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to dig into the perm side of the business a little bit. I appreciate the comments earlier. But just wondering, are you seeing any difference in the tone between your U.S. clients and your international clients? Just trying to get a sense of if there is more apprehension on a relative basis to the recent trends in the respective regions as you look ahead?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","I'd say that we continue to be bullish in the UK and Germany, particularly in perm placement. We added head count later last year outside the U.S. in those countries than we did in the U.S. So IZ, the international zone perm growth has lagged what's happened in the U.S. and that's in part because we haven't invested the head count. But we did do that more recently late in the fourth quarter. So we're hoping that that will help see some acceleration in perm growth in the UK and Germany. Other than that, I would say the general discussion of clients got a little more cautious during the quarter would also apply outside the U.S., particularly to Europe as it did inside the U.S.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And obviously you guys have been through several cycles. And I also realize you've noted that this cycle is unlike others. So hoping you can discuss a little bit more about what your outlook is for perm as we get further into this cycle? Should we be taking the wage inflation that we're seeing, the bill rates that you're seeing increasing as a sign that the perm acceleration is still yet to come? Or do you think it should still be a little bit stubborn as you said earlier?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well as I said earlier, this recovery has been very sluggish relative to the past. And you can look at peak-to-peak growth rates during past to peak-to-now growth rates perm and temp. And clearly, this recovery has been more sluggish. Outlook-wise, we continue to be positive about perm. If you look at perm versus temp last cycle, every year during the last recovery cycle, perm outgrew temp. That's no surprise. A perm takes a much bigger hit during a downturn does than does temp.","If you look at this cycle so far, while more sluggish than past cycles, perm has also outgrown temp every year and this cycle as well. So that's not unusual. The degrees or something, I guess we could have a discussion about. Our outlook for 2016 and our guidance for the first quarter of 2016 essentially assumes we continue to see more sluggish growth the way we have for several quarters. Yet quite frankly, we're pretty proud of how we've done the last several quarters. So to tell us there is more sluggish growth ahead, we can deal with that. We've shown the world what we have done with that. Our planning is that that's what continues for the near term.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate those thoughts. One quick one if I may. On your business levered to energy in Canada and Australia, could you just talk a little bit about what your client conversations there are like? Are you seeing more declines with oil at these levels? Or are you perhaps seeing cuts beginning to stabilize? Just any color as we try to understand the go-forward impact energy may have. Thank you.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well first of all, none of those operations are material to Robert Half. So we don't have a lot of super-detailed discussions on the topic. Those discussions we have certainly aren't getting any more positive. We'll put it that way.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. The first question I wanted to ask was, in the prepared remarks, you said you guys were planning to respond with investments to capitalize on the technology staffing opportunity. I was just wondering, are those the same things as you refer to around data quality and artificial intelligence and so forth? Or is there something different to it? And just around that like, is that going to be all internal build? Or is there an opportunity to acquire a technology or so forth with respect to that?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","So when we talk about investing in our technology division, it's a combination of adding more head count, which is a combination of recruiters and salespeople. It's also investing in internal tools. Those internal tools for the most part relate to all of our lines of business. Some because our technology clients and candidates are more technology savvy, we often go first to our technology division as we roll out new initiatives. So the data analytics, the data science, the use of algorithms, all the things that I talked about would particularly relate to our technology division, clients, candidates, leads, but those relate more broadly to all of our lines of business, perm and temp.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then just around the geographic comment, you mentioned France was lagging behind. I was just curious if you could elaborate on if that was internal factors, external factors, combination of both, just any color there.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well first of all, France is not a very large portion of our business. And when I say lagged, I mean it was a few percentage points behind the rest. So I certainly don't want everybody in France to be mad at me because I singled them out negatively, because I didn't intend to do so. But while they're listening and being competitive, they didn't do quite as well as the UK and Germany.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just last one. Modeling-wise, do you have the number of billing days for each quarter for this year?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Let me find out and I'll tell you. So Q1 62.7, Q2 63.9, Q3 64.1 and Q4 is 61.4 to give you 252.1 for the year.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot, gentlemen. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. I'm curious if you noticed any differences in the technology segment among your traditional small- and medium-sized business customers and the slightly larger ones that occasionally you touch in that line of business? Thank you.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, since most of our business in tech is small- or middle-sized businesses, while they're modestly larger companies than we service with Accountemps and OfficeTeam, there's still significantly smaller than the Fortune 1000. So we don't tend to do a whole lot of analysis between our typical sweet spot middle market tech firms and those, let's call it, Fortune \u2013 the minority of those Fortune 1000 firms that we also work with. But having said that, there's certainly nothing that screams at us that would bubble up a trend worth noting.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, within the Accountemps segment was the business in The Creative line of business, was that a wizard \u2013 kind of a discernible difference in the growth rates or trends there?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, it seems like you're trying to get read through potentially to others. Our Creative business did very nicely in the fourth quarter. We don't break that out, as we've talked about in the past. But we're very pleased with our Creative business. There's synergies between our Creative business and our Technology business, among others. They're managed by the same leadership group at Robert Half. We're pleased with how Creative performed.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. My last question has to do with the Technology segment, do you expect that to be the fastest rate of your bill rate growth in 2016? Or should it just be kind of on par with the company average?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","No. I would say, more than likely it will be mostly on par. On the one hand, the candidate shortages are more acute than they are in our other divisions. On the other hand, Technology clients tend to be more dollar-per-hour-sensitive on bill rates than they are either mark-up percentage or gross margin percentage, which some of our other divisions would be more attuned to. So I wouldn't think that Technology bill rates would grow that differently than our other divisions. And for the fourth quarter just ended, our bill rate increases in Technology were not that different from the bill rate increases we saw in the other lines of business.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I guess, I just wanted to ask you, a year ago you discussed the potential for temp margins to potentially go 100 to 150 basis points above prior cycle, if the cycle kept going based on unemployment taxes, rising wages, a bunch of different things. I guess, given a somewhat slower pace of revenue today, is it still reasonable to think if the cycle goes on for a while that is something that could happen?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, so first of all, let's talk about 2015. And I think we absolutely delivered everything we talked about with respect to gross margin expansion. And, in fact, if you look up and down our P&L, probably, the single most impressive thing that happened in 2015 is the way we expanded our gross margins led by pay\/bill spreads.","As we move into 2016, given where our margins start from, incrementally, you shouldn't expect as much improvement in 2016, as you saw in 2015. But, our conversions, as an example, are still low relative to the past 3.2% versus a range of 3.0% to 5.0%, midpoint being 4%. We still have that upside on state unemployment rates. As the national unemployment rate goes down, as the unemployment claims that get filed against Robert Half go down, our unemployment rate as we go forward, should continue to trend down.","There's upside there. Let's call that another, I don't know, at least 10 basis points to 30 basis points depending on how aggressive you want to be. So that's still ahead of us. Just on the pay\/bill spreads, we brought those a long way already. And while the environment will be conducive, if there is wage inflation to us getting not only that pass-through, but a little more for the House, incrementally, that won't be what it was in 2015.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks. Hey, Keith, can you give us a sense of how much FX weighs on the Q1 revenue guidance and earnings from a dollar perspective?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, so from an earnings standpoint, it's probably no more than $0.01 per share. From a revenue perspective, it's certainly not as impactful as it has been for the last few quarters. I want to say it's in the neighborhood of half of what it's been. So I think we're $30 million this quarter, it's $15 million, call it, half of that in the current quarter, because you're starting to anniversary FX rates that are less different than it has been the case the last couple years. So if you look at our Q1 guidance, essentially, the extra billing day due to leap year offsets the impact of FX and your reported and your currency-adjusted growth rates are about the same orders of magnitude.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. And then, given where we are, it definitely sounds like there's some candidate shortages out there, is there any way to frame how much of that impacted revenue in the fourth quarter? And was that primarily in Technology? Or was that across all segments in terms of just sourcing tougher-to-fill slots and things like that?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","So clearly, in technology, we're seeing technology development, the programmers, the engineers. We're seeing the most acute shortages, accounting, internal audit, financial services, regulatory compliance. There are also pockets of accounting and finance where there are also candidate shortages. As I talked about earlier, we're simultaneously dealing with pickier clients and pickier candidates. Candidates are getting more counteroffers. Candidates are getting competing offers. Candidates are turning down offers that our clients give them.","There's an art to deciding whether to work with a candidate as to whether they're a tire kicker that you're going to take through the process, and at the end of the day, they're not going to take the job or whether they're sincerely interested. There's an art to deciding which orders to work, whether it's an impossible to fill order that you spend a lot of time on, that you never fill, or it's a fillable order. So there's an art to deciding, which candidates. There's an art to deciding, which clients. But there's no question that there are candidates shortages.","But we believe manageable candidate shortages with there is more exposure, there is more transparency to the candidate, the availability of candidates than ever with social media, with the job boards, with job aggregators. We feel like we're exposed to a larger portion of the labor market than has ever been the case. And that's certainly something we're trying to address with our technology initiatives, so that we continue to manage our way through the candidate shortage.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Reece with Avondale Partners. Your line is open.","Randle Glenn Reece - Avondale Partners LLC","Afternoon. Various people in the recruiting business keep telling me that any day now we're going to see some alternatives to contingent search are taking share in that neighborhood. I'm just wondering if there are any new entrant adjacent to your business that really matter at all yet. Or if that is more just marketing noise?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, as I just explained, it's getting harder and harder to close deals, because you've got to close the client, you've got to close the candidate. There's an art to both of those. As to new entrants, there certainly has nothing that's come around in the last couple of years. We've talked about LinkedIn at length in calls past, and LinkedIn is still there. It's a source; it's not the source of perm candidates for us. It's not particularly impactful to sourcing candidates for our temporary businesses. So on balance, are there any new entrants that are moving the needle? I'd say no.","Randle Glenn Reece - Avondale Partners LLC","Yeah. Are there any sources of candidates coming out of weaker industries that might help a little bit as we go through 2016?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, our candidates tend to be geographically-focused. So if we're talking Houston, so clearly, we have Houston oil and gas candidates that are freed up by those economic conditions. But for the most part, they're available to the Houston market and not available to markets all over the country. So there is some availability created by pockets of weakness. But it's not like we can transport everybody around the country to fill a three-month engagement in Boston because we have somebody available in Houston. For the most part, it's a local business. The temp business particularly is a local business that's confined to the local market.","Randle Glenn Reece - Avondale Partners LLC","It's been a few years since we've seen U.S. Protiviti be sequentially down in revenue in the fourth quarter. Is there any message there or any carryover? Or is it more of a timing issue?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, let's remember now that year-on-year Protiviti grew 15% on monster comps. So Protiviti had a wonderful fourth quarter. It is true that during the fourth quarter in the financial services, regulatory compliance area, they had a couple of projects that ended earlier than expected. They had one larger project where the client ran out of budget and delayed the project for a few weeks until the new year when they got a new budget. So there is always going to be project variation with Protiviti. And by the way, management resources, which nobody's asked about, it actually did better than expectation in the fourth quarter sequentially and year-on-year. And it's just the opposite story where again in financial services they had some big projects come online better than expectation. So project timing hurt Protiviti a little bit. Project timing helped management resources.","So it's just kind of the ebb and flow of projects that impacts those results. So there's nothing particularly earth-shattering about Protiviti's fourth quarter sequential performance. And here again, Protiviti had a great quarter. Protiviti had a great year. They've had the toughest comps. They've grown the fastest top line and bottom line; profitability 14% for the quarter is wonderful. We're at that mid double-digit profitability level we've long talked about. We couldn't be happier with Protiviti. But there is project variability in their revenues.","Randle Glenn Reece - Avondale Partners LLC","Yeah. I learn something every quarter. I'm not used to seeing you beat my expectations in temp staffing and miss on the perm side. Usually when one is stronger, the other one doesn't fall short, but this is an interesting environment. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Keith, I'd like to further explore the growth outlook for Protiviti. What trends are you seeing in pricing and competitive dynamics, customer demand and customer penetration that could have contributed to the deceleration in growth and that might impact longer-term growth?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, so the deceleration in growth we're talking about, rather than growing 20% on 20% on 20%, or instead growing 15% on tough comps. So it certainly isn't viewed as a major issue that Protiviti slowed down from 20% to 15%. The underlying trends in internal audit, financial services, regulatory compliance, technology security, privacy, infrastructure, we did a small acquisition during the quarter that relates to IT, business intelligence, data analytics. We're very proud to have them part of our team. We feel good about Protiviti. We feel good about its prospects. We've posted very good numbers for two or three years running. We expect that to follow into 2016. Competitively, we're very well-positioned against the Big Four. We believe we've got Big Four level resources that are much more responsive and much more agile for clients given our relative sizes, so.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. And I guess as a follow-up, Max, a follow-up on the question around the rebound in international markets. Can you provide some data points that show which verticals or end markets are seeing the most positive inflection?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we talked about the UK and Germany of course. And they've been strong more or less across the board I would argue.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. It's just not necessarily any vertical, just as we are in the United States, we're very diversified. We don't have a huge client concentration by industry, et cetera. And therefore, while our non-U.S. clients are modestly larger than our U.S. clients, we still don't have any big concentration.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my follow-up. I was just wondering, are you seeing anything that's different in California or elsewhere on the regulatory front that's impacting the business in any way, shape or form?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, the only regulatory thing I can think of, there are sick pay regulations that initially were limited to Northern California, San Francisco more specifically, that have now been extended statewide. There are a few other cities slash states around the country that have also mandated sick pay benefits for temporary employees. Those put a little bit of pressure on gross margin. We're trying to pass those through. But I can't think of a regulatory requirement, a new regulatory requirement that's moving the needle in any way.","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's not exactly a response of your question, but let me just add that I was at a business meeting with the bunch of CEOs recently, and it was noted that there are over 75,000 pages in the Federal Register this year alone. I would say that the regulatory state is a great ally of Robert Half. We live in an environment, where there are more and more rules and regulations, and of course, we're in the business of helping people deal with those. So on a positive note, regulations can be our friend as well as our enemy.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Fully appreciate that, Max. Thank you.","Harold M.

Our hosts for today\u2019s call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Messmer","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone there are comments on the call today that contain predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today\u2019s Form 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today\u2019s call. For your convenience, our prepared remarks also are available at our website at www.roberthalf.com. From the About Us tab, go to our Investor Center, where you will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link.","Now let's discuss Robert Half's third quarter 2016 results. Revenues for the quarter were $1.339 billion, up 2% from the third quarter one year ago. Income per share was $0.71 compared to $0.73 on last year's third quarter.","Cash flow from operations was $153 million and capital expenditures were $20 million in the third quarter. We paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on September 15th for a total cash outlay of $28 million. We also repurchased 1.2 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $46 million. We have 7.5 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan.","We saw solid demand in the third quarter, particularly for our accounting and finance related professional staffing and consulting services. Our Accountemps and Robert Half Management Resources, Staffing Divisions and Protiviti, reported the highest year-over-year revenue gains.","Our international operations also posted strong results. Unlevered return on equity for the company remains strong at 33%.","I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our third quarter results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, as Max mentioned, global revenues were $1.339 billion in the third quarter, this is up 2% from the third quarter one year ago on both a reported and a same day constant currency basis.","Let's break this out between our staffing business and Protiviti. Global staffing revenues were up 1% in the third quarter on a same day constant currency basis from one year ago. US staffing revenues were $890 million, roughly flat with last year, and non-US staffing revenues were $231 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and exchange rates.","We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 84 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. The third quarter had 64.1 billing days, compared to 64.2 days in last year's third quarter. The fourth quarter has 61.4 billing days, compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2015.","In the third quarter, currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $3 million, exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%.","Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $217 million, including $183 million in the United States and $34 million outside of the US. Overall revenues for Protiviti were up 8% from one year ago on a same day constant currency basis, US revenues were up 6% and non-US revenues were up 17% from last year's third quarter.","Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by 300,000 in the third quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.","Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same day constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by our US and non-US operations. This is a non-GAAP measure we offer to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","Gross margins in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues in the third quarter. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period one year ago as higher pay\/bill spreads offset slightly lower temp to hire conversion revenues.","Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.4% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down modestly from last years 10.0%. This modest mix shift caused overall staffing gross margin to decrease by 20 basis points versus one year ago to 43.3%.","Gross margin for Protiviti was $67 million in the third quarter or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues. Last year's third quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $66 million or 32.9% of Protiviti revenues.","Staffing SG&A costs were 32.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.1% in the third quarter one year ago. SG&A cost for Protiviti in the third quarter were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues versus 17.2% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.","Operating income from our staffing division was $118 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 10.5%. This compares to an operating margin of an 11.5% in last year's third quarter.","Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income resulting in an operating margin of 9.6%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 19.3%. Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $28 million, yielding an operating margin of 13.0%. Accounts receivable were 743 million at the end of the third quarter implied day\u2019s sales outstanding or DSO was 50.5 days.","During the quarter, we successfully implemented a new front office CRM system for all US staffing branches and a new project management system for Protiviti. The conversions went smoothly and the related disruption and out-of-pocket costs were at the low end of our previous range. We estimate that revenues and EPS for the quarter were impacted by $9 million and $0.005 [ph] per share respectively.","Before we move to fourth-quarter guidance, I'd like to talk about the monthly trends we saw in the third order and thus far in October. Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the third quarter and we exited the quarter with September revenues roughly flat versus the prior year, compared to a 2% increase for the full quarter.","Revenue growth for our staffing consulting services in the first two weeks of October was down 1.5% compared to the prior year. Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the first part of the third quarter with September down 4% compared to the 5% decline for the full quarter.","For the first three weeks of October permanent placement revenues increased 1% compared to the same period last year. All of these trends I described have been normalized for billing days and currency. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.","With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance. Revenues $1.250 billion to $1.310 billion, income per share $0.60 to $0.66. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to risks we mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.","Now I'll turn it back over to Max.","Harold Messmer","Thank you, Keith. The U S economy added fewer jobs in September than economists had expected and the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 5%. Unemployment levels in the professional fields we serve remained much lower than the overall US rate.","But we do continue to see our clients taking longer to make hiring decisions. We have talked about this longer timeframe on prior conference calls. Internationally, we continue to see solid growth in many countries, most notably Germany.","Business's appetite for specialized talent in areas important to the growth and profitability remained intact. The - for computer systems design and related services, for example, the average unemployment rate in United States is 2.3%. Overall the average unemployment rate for college degree workers 25 or older is now 2.5%.","Employers continue to encounter a widening skills gap in key areas and they need help finding professionals who are fit with their needs and work environment. We were pleased with the results for Protiviti.","Protiviti has been doing solid business in all of its practice areas and it currently works with 70% of Fortune 100 companies. Their sweet spot, of course, is teaming with client to protect and enhance enterprise value by identifying, anticipating and solving critical business problems.","At this time, Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you if you have additional question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon","Max and Keith, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color with regards to the pace of deceleration that you ended up seeing over the course of the quarter. And related to that, if you saw clients taking even more time as the quarter progressed, you'd spoken about that during the second quarter. So I just wondered if that\u2019s changed or if it\u2019s gotten incrementally longer?","And then, also if you could address specifically, you know, how the implementation of the CRM system ended up impacting the quarter, just in terms of from a timeframe perspective when everything was completed and what sort of results you're seeing from that new implementation?","Keith Waddell","Okay. Several questions here. Now, on the pace of deceleration, I\u2019d say that July, we actually ended July stronger than we began it, we were encouraged by that. August wasn\u2019t bad. But then September, where we usually start getting a sequential lift in September, we didn\u2019t see the lift we typically get, instead, it was sequentially about flat.","And then again, traditionally we get even more lift yet again in October and we didn\u2019t see that lift either. So it\u2019s essentially sequential flattening starting in July, rather than the lift we typically see in September and early October.","The issue around clients taking more time, I mean, clearly they remain cautious with little sense of urgency. It\u2019s in part due to macro uncertainty, impart due to election uncertainty. They cite budget pressures, they cite cost control measures.","They therefore get even more selective, they only want your ideal candidates that in turn pressures candidate supply when they are only looking for the top tranche of the [indiscernible] you have. They spend more time vetting. They want to do more interviews.","Its not that we have an absent of orders, its more that the orders that we do have, it just takes longer to get a start if we\u2019re on the temp side or it's longer to make a placement if we're on the perm side. So frankly, markets it\u2019s a continuation of what we\u2019ve talked about for two or three quarters, notwithstanding the easier comps.","On the Protiviti side, they had very tough comps, notwithstanding those comps they still grew you know, mid single-digits, generally speaking, we were pleased relative to expectations on Protiviti.","As to CRM, we were very pleased with the conversion. That happened the week of August the 22nd. Most of the impact frankly was during the weeks preceding that, where all of the training took place, where we essentially took our best producers out of production as they train the trainers who in turn trained our staff.","So from a financial impact where we first estimated a half a day to a day and a half on the staffing side, it came in closer to half a day. Protiviti came in virtually precisely where we estimated it to be. So, from a revenue standpoint, the 9 million splits out to 7 million staffing, 2 million Protiviti, the gross margin of 5 million impact breaks out between 3 million staffing, 2 million Protiviti. The SG&A impact was about what we expected at 4.5 and that splits out 3.5 staffing, 1 million Protiviti.","So, virtually, no surprises on the out-of-pocket cost impact. The revenue disruption impact actually better than we expected. It was quite a large undertaking. We are elated to have it behind us and we are elated with the capabilities that it has and provides to us as we move forward.","Mark Marcon","On that point, Keith, can you talk a little bit about how quickly you ended up seeing a productivity ramp in your international office this post-implementation?","Keith Waddell","Well, so as you are alluding, we did this in five countries pre-United States and the United States experience turned out being very close to what had happened in those five countries, even though we worried that the impact would be more.","I'd say, short term, Mark, this isn\u2019t about getting more short-term productivity. Short-term it\u2019s more about replacing our old 15 year legacy system with something we could maintain, with something that provided global mobile access because it\u2019s cloud-based.","With something as we move forward in time, as we provide more and more digital services to complement our traditional services, we needed an infrastructure that would facilitate that.","So, this isn\u2019t a short-term productivity play, its more a long-term, make it easier to support, make it less expensive to support, but more importantly, we needed a platform that we could integrate to the client and candidate facing services that we intend to provide.","Mark Marcon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman","Hey, Keith. I am going to kind of ask you the question that\u2019s the tough one about the cycle. My 20 years of covering staff success [ph] I don't remember Robert Half trending down outside of a recession.","Yet, our economist are saying real GDP looks really solid in the third and fourth quarter and I am just asking you how you could kind of give a little context for the cycle you think we're in right now?","Keith Waddell","Well, first of all to reinforce what you said, I think most economists think we're looking at 2% GDP next year, which frankly would be an up-tick from the last \u2013 from the fourth quarter of '15, first two of '16 that we\u2019re\u2026","Andrew Steinerman","That's right.","Keith Waddell","Most economists only think there is a 20% chance of a recession in 2017.","Andrew Steinerman","Right.","Keith Waddell","But one thing we did look at, we have not only bill rates, which by the way were up 3.5% this quarter year-over-year, which is down a bit - from I believe it was 4.8 last quarter. So we not only look at bill rate trends, but we also looked at ours bill trends. And while they\u2019ve gone slightly negative and are projected to go slightly negative in the fourth quarter, if you look back at 2001 and if you look at back at 2008, they fell much more abruptly than what\u2019s implied in what we forecast.","So, if you just look back at Robert Half volume data, unit data, what we saw in the third quarter, what we\u2019re forecasting to the fourth quarter would not be near as abrupt as what we've seen in the past in the early parts of a down cycle.","Andrew Steinerman","Right. But there is really no context that you could point to that this is similar to in the past, right?","Keith Waddell","Well, this has been a more sluggish recovery than what we've seen in the past. Some therefore surmise that if there is going to be a downturn, it will be less severe as well. But to the extent I compare this to 2001 and 2008 in the early periods of those downturns, it drops and drops fairly abruptly. And again, I'm talking hours billed, I'm trying to take rates out of the equation. We have not - nor are we projecting that kind of abrupt negative turn in our volumes.","Andrew Steinerman","Keith, if you'll let me one more question on the Robert Half Technology side, is that also about just getting a better sense of urgencies and orders or is there anything on the recruiting side that you feel like Robert Half Technology has been or could be doing to firm up the revenues on Robert Half Technology?","Keith Waddell","Well, first of all on Robert Half Technology, let\u2019s not forget the year ago comps, we grew 15%. So we do have tough comps, we're comparing to in tech. That said, the general trends that I described also apply to tech and as respects to tech development which is where we had seen most of our growth, that\u2019s now where our growth is most under pressure.","And as clients get even more selective even in that area, it further puts pressure on candidate supply. If they will only take your best candidates, the supply of your best candidates per se is a smaller universe than your overall supply, even of solid candidates.","Andrew Steinerman","Totally agreed. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Keith, how are you approaching spending at this point, it looks like if I strip through kind of the systems upgrade that you pulled back a little on the spending. But I guess given the trends you are seeing, what\u2019s your approach to kind of the staffing levels and as we go into even beyond Q4 as we move into '17, how are you managing the structure right now?","Keith Waddell","So the biggest lever we have, as you know Tim, is our internal recruiter and sales professional headcounts. And the current thinking is to keep them flattish until we get a better sense of exactly where we are.","The last thing we want to do is make itself fulfilling by reducing headcounts in advance of further revenue deceleration. So I would say flattish on heads, they are down slightly in the third quarter. The fourth quarter our plan is for them to be flat to maybe down slightly again.","But, we are not intending to do anything precipitous as it relates to our headcounts because we don\u2019t see any precipitous decline in our revenues. And like I said, the last thing you want to do is reduce your capacity to sell ahead of actual client demand.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And just and by - kind of by the vertical area, the counting ones have been holding up better I guess than [indiscernible] and IT, that seems like you are saying as the quarter progresses kind of broad-based. Is there anything you saw differently in Accountemps and management resources?","Keith Waddell","Well, I'd say Accountemps we saw more softness in the accounting operations positions and those are the ones that are typically more client demand sensitive, more client volume sensitive. So it\u2019s consistent that if you were to see softness in accounting due to macro conditions you'd see it in accounting operations.","And management resources, its all about project ends and start and clients were slower to get new projects started than we had expected, which our go forward guidance anticipates, yet again, management resources is going to have more variability than Accountemps because it is more project oriented and that was the case in the third quarter and that is the case in our embedded guidance for the fourth order.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much, Keith your last answer is actually a segue to my question. If you can give us a little bit more color by vertical in terms of what's embedded in your guidance for the current quarter that would be helpful? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Okay. So, by vertical, I'd say generally speaking the trend lines you saw during the third quarter would remain in tact during the fourth such that from a staffing perspective we would see a decline of about 1% year-over-year same-day constant currency.","However, there is one fewer day this year than last, there will be a little bit of currency drag. So that on a reported basis your staffing growth rates would be about \u2013 would be down about 3%. And again, the embedded 1% same day constant currency is at above the rate we started the quarter.","Protiviti grows on a mid single digit rate versus their 15% tough year ago comps. Gross margin encouragingly, we believe temp gross margins will be up 30 to 50 basis points in the fourth quarter. We had much better than expected experience with our state unemployment cost. We've been conservative for the first part of the year, which will give us some benefit in the fourth quarter.","That 30 to 50 basis point improvement does not include potential even further improvement when we get our semiannual workmen's comp review, so maybe there is upside there.","Protiviti similar to the third quarter on a year-on-year basis their gross margin would be down a couple of points, because they\u2019ve got less mix of higher margin FSI, which we talked about in the past. But again, that\u2019s consistent with what we just saw on the SG&A side.","On staffing, the dollars year-on-year would be about flat. But as I talked about on a reported basis, you've got revenues down 3%, so that\u2019s going to create some negative leverage of around one point or 100 basis points.","Protiviti SG&A would also be up about 100 basis points. Their marketing costs are intended to be higher. They've got higher administrative costs to support their higher headcounts.","So if you look at our projected operating margins on the temp side would be down 50 to 70 basis points, as the higher gross margin gets offset with the negative leverage and SG&A, perm would be down about one percentage point, same reason Protiviti would be down three to four percentage points, still double-digit versus a very high 14% a year ago.","The tax rate is going to be higher this year than last. We're thinking in the 37.5% range for the fourth quarter. Last year it was low at 35.3 because we got some discrete credits that won't repeat. Shares before consideration or further buybacks would be in the 127.5 range.","Jeff Silber","I really appreciate the thorough answer to that question. And if I could just follow-up with a couple numbers related questions. First of all, in the current quarter guidance is there any more impact of the systems conversion and if it\u2019s possible to give us the average billing days by quarter in 2017, that would be great? Thank you so much.","Keith Waddell","Days by quarter, I have that, but I didn\u2019t bring it, maybe we'll try to get it and I'll come back before the end of the call with those numbers. As to the system conversion, we do not expect any significant impact during this quarter. Our activity levels are pretty much back at the levels they had been pre-conversion.","And like I say, hopefully I could come back to or maybe it\u2019s magically appeared sooner, say 2017 quarter one 63.4, quarter two 63.3, quarter three 63.1, quarter four 61.3 to give you a total of 251.1, which is one day shorter than 2016.","Jeff Silber","Great. I really appreciate the help. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Anj Singh","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back on some of the earlier questions and comments. I guess, first off on the environment your commentary there, I just wanted to make sure I understood you correctly.","Is the sale cycle lands about similar from Q2 to Q3 or do you see a continuing sort of length and moderately as you are getting into latter parts of the year?","Keith Waddell","So as we talked about, we are seeing it lengthen moderately and we're also seeing some slowing in order rates because of the uncertainty that I talked about, that we are seeing some lengthening, primarily because they are more selective with the candidates they'll accept. Those candidates are in turn the hardest ones to close because they are the ones with the most options.","Anj Singh","Okay. Okay, got it. And then touching on headcount editions again, I think last quarter you guys had called out growing headcount a little bit, this quarter you are talking about flattish. And I don't mean to split hairs, but wondering if that\u2019s generally consistent quarter-to-quarter or should we be reading into that as you are moderating your plans a little bit?","And then the second part to that question, you'd spoken to letting attrition play out in areas that aren\u2019t really seeing much growth. So would it be fair to say that you are seeing some attrition in systems like OfficeTeam. Perhaps you can just give us a sense of where you maybe seeing some attrition? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","The nature of our business for 30 years is particularly in the first 12 months, there is always attrition. We're a tough team to make. Many times people that come out of the profession going into a sales and recruiting role is more different than their functional role in their prior careers. So we've always had a fair amount of attrition during the first 12 months, but, it is somewhat variable.","So I would say our headcounts did not turn out that differently than we expected, nor do I expect our Q4 heads are going to be that different than Q3 heads. There is always going to be differences in attrition.","You can't peg it exactly, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into. Our overall thought is to keep our headcounts constant in level, while we get a better read on demand, because the last thing we want to do is essentially have a self fulfilling prophecy by reducing our capacity.","Anj Singh","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thanks. Keith, your comments on kind of the sequential trends in margins were helpful. But can you just help us frame how much the higher and expected tax rate set for Q4 EPS? Because if just the EPS doesn\u2019t really reconcile to the revenues even appreciating that you know, there may be some fixed cost around FX, it's kind of stacked a little bit more. But if I expand the model right, is $0.03 to $0.04 is that the way to think about what the higher tax rate in terms of Q4 impact?","Keith Waddell","Well, its twofold points on pretax, hold on, I mean I didn\u2019t figure it out all the way down to EPS. I mean, we could do the math, pretax, 120, so 3 million, so that's couple of pennies back of the envelope.","But as I walk down the P&L, I am basically walking down the midpoint of our guidance. You've got higher gross margin for reasons I've talked about. The SG& A, year-on-year is up about a percentage point, as I talked about. The number of shares is down, as I talked about, the tax rate is up. So I can assure you the math works at the midpoint of the range.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. And then just one other, we saw a pretty sizable up-tick in temp in December, was that kind of a data you have internally, was that lagging or we've kind of haven\u2019t seen that rate of growth since December of last year, is that - how do you reconcile that with what you're seeing internally, if you will?","Keith Waddell","And you're talking about an external ASA, BLS? I guess I would observe that over a long, long periods of time. We haven\u2019t track all that closely to either BLS or ASA. It was kind of interesting, this morning, PMI Services came out and if you look at the employment piece of PMI Services, and I don\u2019t call it out because it\u2019s reversing, but it just happened to come out this morning. But if you look at the employment portion of PMI Services, it continues to trend down as late as till today.","So, we never track that closely to the external index as you talked about. Traditionally they\u2019ve been very commercial staffing, light industrial production staffing centric. So sometimes we're better, sometimes we're worse, but rarely do we take that much stock in those external indexes.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee","Good afternoon. Just \u2013 I wonder if I get a little more color on Protiviti, it sounds you referenced earlier the weaker demand from financial compliance et cetera. I guess, it sounds like that continues. How would you know, any end of the \u2013 is there any light at the end of the tunnel there and is the pricing pressure you\u2019ve referenced in the past still a factor with that end market? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Well, Protiviti grew 8% on very tough comps; they grew 23% a year ago, very tough comps. The US was solid, non-US was very strong, Australia, Japan, solid in EU. So from a revenue standpoint, Protiviti\u2019s third quarter was pretty much spot on what we expected.","They had some gross margin compression and that compression was less than we expected, actually quite a bit less than we expected. They did a very good job controlling their costs. They used fewer contractors, which is a variable portion of their cost structure. They had fewer experienced hires come on board.","So Protiviti from a profitability standpoint in the third quarter, while not as much as a year ago which was a tough comp, it was actually pretty significantly better than the guidance we had given for the third quarter.","Fourth quarter, we're still embedded in our guidance as mid single digit growth. The comps a year ago were again very tough, 15% growth. Profitability remains double-digit, notwithstanding its an even shorter quarter for Protiviti, because many of their clients have a soft close between Christmas and New Year's which shortens the effective length of their quarter even more.","So, clearly as we've talked about on prior calls, their FSI clients have got more cost conscious. That\u2019s resulted in fewer hours for us, the hours that we do have at somewhat lower rates. But overall, all things considered, we were very pleased with the quarter Protiviti had and the one that we're projecting for the fourth.","Gary Bisbee","Understood. Then just a follow-up, one of the uncertainty factors that you referenced and I think a lot of others have referenced is just the upcoming election here. Is there any way to sense how big a factor that is or how many \u2013 is that something a lot of clients are mentioning or are you hearing it once in a while or is there any sense that as we get through that you might see some loosening in some of the trends?","Keith Waddell","It\u2019s hard to parse uncertainty between how much of its macro, how much of its \u2013 my own client financials aren\u2019t where I wanted them to be, and therefore I am more cost conscience versus the part that\u2019s election. The election uncertainty certainly didn\u2019t help. How much it impacted negatively, its hard to know. It\u2019s certainly part of the discussions that have taken place with our staff and our clients.","But precisely what its impact is, it\u2019s hard to know, and I guess only time will tell. We look back to some prior election years and there was a little bit of impact in the quarter prior to the election. But quite frankly, I don't think there has been any election like this election.","Harold Messmer","Yes. I'd just add that I spend a lot of time talking to executives of other companies and many of our clients and the elephant in the room probably is the election. Nobody really knows exactly what the impact is. They just know it is much different.","You couple that with anemic GDP growth this year, which has resulted in a tremendous cost consciousness on the part of many clients. It becomes very easy to drag your feet, drag out the hiring process, be very careful about expanding.","I would like to think we're going to see an improvement in the horizon here soon after the election. But only time will tell, we do not know for sure. We just know it's a very unusual circumstance. There has been an awful lot of negativity, none of which is great for the economy. So let's see what happens. We hope it\u2019s an improvement that occurs.","Keith Waddell","What's interesting for six to seven years, we've been complaining about 2% GDP growth. Now we're sitting here and hoping for a GDP growth that\u2019s 2% or better. And such an extent you believe we're going to get to 2017 2% or better GDP growth for the year, that\u2019s actually an improvement from where we've been and we would welcome that. We can do just fine with two 2 plus GDP growth. It\u2019s that one and sub one and around one, that's a little tough.","Gary Bisbee","Yes. Its amazing how to frame a reference, how important that is. So I appreciate all the color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Reece from Avondale Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Randy Reece","Good afternoon. To analyze your quarterly revenue guidance, I have broken it down to ways. First, looking at the sequential change in revenue per day. Second looking at your history where actual revenue fell within the guidance range. From this I have two observations.","First, your fourth-quarter guidance is 300 basis points weaker than we've seen in this expansion, and second, this was the seventh consecutive quarter where revenue came in at or below the mid-point of your guidance range.","And I have two questions. First of all, why is - I want to get a better understanding of why fourth quarter guidance is so much weaker than normal, even when you are coming off a third quarter that had some disruption effect that\u2019s going away.","And, the other question is what is preventing you from making your revenue guidance ranges more conservative than they\u2019ve been for almost two years?","Keith Waddell","Well, why is our fourth-quarter guidance so much weaker? We are simply looking at current trends all the way through last week and based on those trends, based on the discussions we've had with our field management teams, those are the calls we've made.","I\u2019d say as to missing the mid-point of revenue guidance, we've clearly done much better than you referenced at the bottom line. And I would also say that most of those misses, as you call them, has been 1% or 2% misses. So I think for context we need to talk about the extent of the misses.","But further I\u2019d say we call it like it is, and we\u2019re not sandbaggers, we're not backslappers. And so we try to call like it is, and we\u2019re close. We\u2019re usually within 1% or 2% of the revenues and we're usually at or above the EPS. But, where I grew up, coming 98% or 99% of $1 billion more revenue estimate for the quarter isn\u2019t bad.","Harold Messmer","Particularly when there is not exactly a big backlog to take a look at.","Randy Reece","Yes. I'm just trying to get a feel for whether there is something about the business that has become a little bit less predictable than you are used to?","Keith Waddell","Well, I'd say that\u2019s fair. I'd say management resource is more projects driven than Accountemps. To some degree Robert Half Technology is more project driven than Accountemps, Protiviti is certainly more project driven than traditionally Accountemps, to the extent we've added these additional non-Accountemps services, to some degree there's a little more volatility because they are more project driven.","But Accountemps itself, I don\u2019t think its gotten any more variable or volatile, and the classic split between how accounting operations performs within Accountemps versus how the more staff accountant or financial business performs within Accountemps, they are all pretty consistent.","And I might add that the third quarter just ended, we reported pretty decent growth in our finance and accounting divisions. It was the non-finance and accounting divisions that lowered those rate somewhat.","Randy Reece","Do you believe that permanent placement is acting the way you would have expected it to in past cycles. Do you think you are capturing the share of placements just total hiring that you would expect to get?","Keith Waddell","Well, given how anemic GDP growth has been, it doesn\u2019t surprise us the way perm has performed. Perm is always more economically sensitive than is temp. We are seeing that as we speak. It was more impacted in the third quarter, albeit it was on tougher comps than temp. But I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve lost any meaningful share of placements to whether you want to call it technology platforms, other new competitors.","If GDP had grown at the same extent that it had in prior cycles and we didn\u2019t perform similarly, I think there would be a credible case to be made that there is a missing delta that we need to talk about. But the fact that GDP hasn\u2019t performed and we're essentially back to prior peak in perm, I think is totally understandable.","Randy Reece","That makes sense. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kwan Kim","Hi. This is Kwan Kim for Tobey. I got a question on the technology segment, what is your outlook on the bill rate growth and how do you compare that to company average?","Keith Waddell","So bill rates were up 3.5% year-over-year, that was down a little bit from the 4.8% we saw last quarter. That was pretty much down versus last quarter in all of our verticals. It\u2019s consistent with all of the commentary we've given already about overall business conditions. And I am struggling for it - does that get at your question or was there some other question?","Kwan Kim","I asked about your outlook.","Keith Waddell","My outlook, well, if conditions continue along the current glide path, you would expect to see slightly less bill rate growth. If instead, GDP growth picks back up to where it had been, I would not expect the glide path to be downward, but instead to turn back upwards.","Kwan Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. You mentioned some slowing in order rates on top of a lengthening sales cycle. Can you elaborate on the trends we saw in order flow during the course of the quarter and what's currently incorporated into your fourth quarter guidance?","Keith Waddell","With client cautiousness, with client lessons of urgency, the order flow rate does slow somewhat. We saw it happen during the quarter. We saw that continue into the fourth quarter. We extrapolated that trend and considered it in the guidance we have given for the fourth quarter.","George Tong","Great. And now that your new CRM and project management systems have been implemented, can you help quantify what you expect to see in revenue and cost benefits associated with the investment?","Keith Waddell","In the short term, we expect very little short-term benefit from those investments. They are more long-term, infrastructure building platform, foundational type of investments that we expect long-term, but not short-term benefit from.","George Tong","And can you help frame up what those long-term benefits might be?","Keith Waddell","Well, the - they are cloud-based. We do not have the hosted infrastructure they have to maintain. They are instantly, globally accessible, which means our staff can sit down with our clients in their offices and have full access to all of our databases.","As we offer more and more of our services digitally to our clients and to our candidates, we are - this enables that to happen in a way that it couldn\u2019t happen with our 15 year old proprietary legacy systems.","So, exactly how you put a dollar value on that, I would argue, quite frankly, to remain competitive in the staffing business, you not only have to offer the traditional services you've always offered, you also have to have digital offerings that are complementary to the traditional offerings you've always had.","George Tong","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari","Good afternoon. I just had a question on permanent staffing. Any comments on the recovery you saw in October and any color on the temp to higher conversions you saw during the quarter? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","Well, clearly our start in perm was better than Q3 and the trends. But as we've said, many times it\u2019s only three weeks. If you recall, last quarter, we hobbled out of the starting gate, I think we were down 17% or something and we certainly didn\u2019t finish the quarter anything like that.","So quite frankly, perm is volatile, its more volatile than temp, the start over a three-week period of time doesn\u2019t mean much. That said, I'd rather start better than the prior quarter than worse, which we did. However, our guidance does assume that there would be slight negative year-over-year growth in perm.","Temp to hire traditionally follows perm. So just as perm was a little softer than temp this quarter, so was temp to hire as compared to temp hours billed. It\u2019s all about ultimately, full time hiring the environment, full time hiring, one follows the other. Clearly temp to higher in this cycle has been somewhat anemic, as has perm generally. But, that was also the case in the Q3 just ended.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And just a follow-up, last question from me, I know that the UK is a small part of your business 3% or so, anything you saw in that market post the Brexit, or is it too early to tell for you guys? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","I'd say that we had a very good quarter on the temporary side in the UK. The perm side was not as strong. The uncertainty there seems to impact perm more than temp. While we're talking about international, let's not forget that we had a very good quarter internationally both Protiviti and staffing. Germany continues to do very well, Belgium did well, Australia did well.","In Protiviti, Australia did extremely well. We're seeing improvement in Japan for the first time in years, which we're very encouraged by. Generally speaking international was a bright spot not only for staffing, but for Protiviti, UK temp very good, UK perm not as much.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Very helpful. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Leonard","Hi, good afternoon. This is Ryan Leonard filling in for Manav. The comments you make about the clients and just kind of the cautiousness and those forward sales, I guess what would have to change to the downside that would result in you flexing some of the cost leverage you mentioned before?","Keith Waddell","Well, the trends would have to turn more negative. We're talking about revenues being down 1% in our guidance. And you don't take drastic headcount actions based on a 1% swing, frankly in either direction.","So for us to get much more aggressive on the cost side, we would have to see much more negative trends than we're seeing. And here again, if the world believes we're going to get 2% plus GDP in 2017, we would see that as an improvement not a decline.","Ryan Leonard","Fair enough. And then just on some of the more digital offerings you\u2019ve been talking about, with the rollout of the new CRM and investment in technology. I mean, do you see more investment in technology going forward needed as more and more kind of staffing services go digital?","Keith Waddell","I would say yes, we do see more investment needed. They shouldn\u2019t be to the extent that we\u2019ve had the last two years where we\u2019ve essentially done new front office and project management systems in both staffing and Protiviti virtually all at the same time.","In addition to that, we do have what we call business transformation which our innovation initiatives, that will continue. But it\u2019s not the lion share of what our CapEx budgets have been the last couple of years.","But yes, we do need to continue to spend on technology. We do need to broaden our digital capabilities. I think we're well down that path. We're using artificial intelligence. We're using machine learning. We have client facing and candidate facing functionality we\u2019ve never had before.","I think that will only get better as we go forward in time. It will take some investments, but it won't be as much an outsized investment as we've had the last couple of years.","Ryan Leonard","Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We have time for just one more question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon [Robert W. Baird] Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon","Thanks for squeezing in my follow-up. I was wondering, IFRS rev rac [ph] is that going to be a benefit do you think on the Protiviti side as we look ahead? And if so what are you hearing from your folks?","Keith Waddell","So, we think rev rac ultimately will be a single, not a double or a triple. We right now have a lot of diagnostic projects which are smaller projects in Protiviti where you figure out what the gap is, no pun intended. Frankly, we're probably more excited, but not \u2013 but maybe a double, maybe between a single and a double on lease accounting.","Lease accounting is a year further out, lease accounting is 2019, rev rac is 2018. They are both helpful. We do not think either of them are going to be major movers of the needle, but we'll take all we can get.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then can you talk a little bit about anything that people should take into consideration for next year, outside of the economy. So for example, new overtime regulations, anything that people should try to factor in?","Keith Waddell","I would say, as to the overtime regs, we are dealing with that by changing the salary levels to the extent needed to, which isn\u2019t a huge impact. We're also restructuring some of our comp plans otherwise to more or less pay for that.","I'd say in 2017 there is a change in the tax accounting, as it relates to equity compensation that will put pressure on our tax rate. We'll have to figure out precisely what that will be. We'll talk to you about that next quarter.","But I think there's going to be a lot more volatility in our tax rate and company's generally because effectively the impact of your stock price at the day equity vest versus the stock price at the day equity was issued, that the tax effective of that differential you're going to run through P&L for the first time.","Mark Marcon","I look forward to the guidance.","Keith Waddell","Okay. That was our last question. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for joining us on today's call.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Just click on the Quarterly Conference Calls link from the home page of the Investor Center.","Now let\u2019s discuss the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.22 billion, up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Income per share was $0.62, up 27% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $83 million during the fourth quarter and capital expenditures were $27 million. We paid a cash dividend of $0.18 per share to stockholders of record on December 15, 2014 at a cost of $25 million. We also repurchased 800,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $46 million. Approximately 4.8 million shares remain available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan. ","Robert Half finished the year strongly with broad-based revenue expansion across our staffing and consulting businesses. Fourth quarter 2014 revenues from staffing operations increased by 14% compared to the prior year adjusted for currency making this the fifth consecutive quarter in which growth rates have accelerated.","Protiviti results also remained very strong with fourth quarter revenues increasing 22% on a constant currency basis over the same period in 2013. While revenue gains were strongest in the United States our non-U.S. operations once again reported healthy year-over-year growth. This was Robert Half's 19th straight quarter of double digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Unlevered return on equity remained robust at 34% in the fourth quarter. Earnings per share of $2.26 for 2014 is the highest ever reported by the company. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thank you Max. Companywide revenues were 1.22 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. This is up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2013 on a reported basis and up 15% on a same day constant currency basis. ","Fourth quarter global staffing revenues were up 14% on a same day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were 816 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% on a same day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $234 million, up 11% on a same day constant currency basis. We have 341 staffing locations worldwide, including 99 locations in 18 countries outside the U.S. There were 61.7 billing days in the fourth quarter compared to 61.9 days in the fourth quarter of 2013. This had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing growth rates by 0.2%. The current quarter has 62 billing days compared to 62.4 days in the year ago first quarter. ","Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing fourth quarter year-over-year staffing revenues by $18 million and depressing year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 1.9%. We provide a supplemental schedule with our earnings release that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for our various staffing lines of business on a reported basis as well as on a same day constant currency basis. The schedule further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.","You can find the schedule in today's press release and in the investor center of our website. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides information on certain revenue trends in our staffing operations. ","Global revenues for Protiviti were $171 million in the fourth quarter with $142 million in revenues in the United States and $29 million in revenues outside the U.S. Global revenues for Protiviti were up 22% year-over-year on a same day constant currency basis with U.S. revenues up 27% and non-U.S. revenues up 5% from the prior year. ","Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 74 locations in 25 countries. Gross margin in our temporary consulting staffing operations in the fourth quarter was 36.9% of applicable revenues. This is up 40 basis points from the same period one year ago. ","The fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013 include workers compensation and other payroll-related credits of $2.4 million and $2.7 million respectively. Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent replacement operations were 9.2% of overall staffing revenues compared to 9.1% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin overall staffing gross margin expanded by 40 basis points versus one year ago to 42.7%. Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 30.7% of Protiviti revenues compared to $45 million or 31.8% of Protiviti revenues one year ago.","Staffing SG&A costs were 32% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 33% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We ended 2014 with 11,200 full time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. SG&A cost for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 20.1% of Protiviti revenues reported this time last year. We ended 2014 with 3,300 full time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 5% from the prior year.","Operating income from our staffing division was $112 million in the fourth quarter, growing 28% over the prior year and resulting in an operating margin of 10.7%. Our temporary and consulting divisions reported $95 million in operating income, an increase of 26% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.9%.","Operating income for our permanent placement division was $17 million in the fourth quarter, up 36% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.8%. Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $21 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 12.4%.","Our fourth quarter 2014 income tax rate increased to 37.0%, up from 35.6% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This was primarily due to fewer available foreign tax benefits. Accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter were $658 million with implied day sales outstanding of 49 days.","Now turning to guidance. Before we move to first quarter guidance let\u2019s review the monthly trends we saw as we moved through the fourth quarter of 2014 and so far in January. In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions were flat in October and in November and then accelerated in December. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement divisions decelerated in October, accelerated in November and then decelerated in December. ","Outside the U.S., year-over-year temporary and consulting staffing growth rates were flat in October, accelerated in November and decelerated in December. Permanent placement growth rates outside the U.S. decelerated in October, accelerated in November and then decelerated in December.","For the first two weeks of January, revenues for our temporary and consulting operations were up 17% on a same day constant currency basis, compared to the same period last year, with U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 19% and non-U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 11%. For the first three weeks of January, permanent placement revenues were up 19% on a same day constant currency basis, compared to the same period last year with U.S. perm revenues up 26% and non-U.S. revenues up 2%.","We provide this information with a caveat that it\u2019s difficult to read a great deal under these trends given the short time periods they represent. The higher 2015 post quarter growth rates just noted include a benefit from the absence of harsh weather conditions experienced last year. We estimate this increased our year-over-year growth rates by approximately 2 percentage points. ","We offer the following first quarter guidance; revenues, $1.195 billion to $1.245 billion; income per share $0.53 to $0.58. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risk mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. ","Now I'll turn the call back over to Max. ","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Thank you Keith. As previously noted we saw healthy demand across the board for our staffing and consulting services in the fourth quarter. The revenue growth was broad-based and extended to both our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. ","The U.S. labor market has strengthened in recent months and skill shortages persist in professional disciplines such as accounting and information technology. We are seeing similar trends outside the United States although growth has been less robust. Employers in the United States added nearly three million jobs over the course of 2014 making it the best year for job growth since 1999. ","Secular trends continue to shape the demand for interim talent. More and more companies are using temporary and consulting professionals as a permanent part of their human resources mix. In the U.S. alone nearly 3 million people work on a temporary basis every day. The number of temporary workers as a percentage of the total U.S. workforce is also at an all-time high right now. We remain bullish about Protiviti as well as Keith noted global revenues for Protiviti were up 22% in the fourth quarter. Protiviti has a stellar reputation in the marketplace and we are very pleased with how this business is performing. Protiviti service lines information technology consulting risk and compliance and internal audit among others. ","Looking at our business operations as a whole we are optimistic. We believe Robert Half is well positioned to benefit in the current macro environment. We are making investments in people and infrastructure to support business expansion and we are extremely confident in the ability of our field and corporate leadership teams to grow the business. ","At this time we'll be happy to answer questions. We would request that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow up as needed. If time permits we will try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from RW Baird. Your line is open. ","Mark S. Marcon","Good afternoon and congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. I have a question and a follow-up. I am wondering if you can address a couple of areas where the macro environment has been weaker or might seem to be tipping over, specifically what are you seeing on the continent as well as within the U.S. within the oil patch, Texas et cetera? And then secondly how are you thinking about your expansion of your internal headcount relative to what we ended up seeing at the end of \u201914. You had 5% growth in Protiviti headcount with really strong revenue growth and obviously you over indexed also in the other divisions. So how are you thinking about that, how much capacity do you have? Thank you. ","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Sure on the first question about continent, we had a very solid quarter in the international zone generally. On the continent we actually accelerated in Germany and in France. The UK stayed very strong which it has for many quarters. It had tougher comparisons but generally speaking we were very pleased with our international operations, including the continent where not only did it not decelerate, the growth rates actually accelerated during the quarter and our outlook for the first quarter that we're in for international operations is solid as well.","As to the oil patch we did see some slowing during the fourth quarter, which is logical. That said that was more than offset by acceleration in other locations notably places like New York accelerated nicely. So that taken together we're not overly concerned about the impact of oil prices specifically as it relates to Oklahoma, Texas, Calgary et cetera. ","On the headcount front we -- during the second half of 2014 we pretty aggressively added to heads, that included the fourth quarter just ended. It is our plan to aggressively continue to add to heads, during at least the first quarter of 2015 and probably the first half of 2015 given the strong results we're seeing and given the outlook and the momentum that we're experiencing. ","The relative to revenue growth on the staffing side for 2014, for the full year headcount growth lagged revenue growth by little bit. Protiviti is a little more nuanced in the U.S., the headcount growth and revenue growth are more closely aligned. Outside the U.S. we have been more aggressive cutting heads than what we've experienced with revenues. So as to unused capacity while we do have unused capacity, given the growth we're experiencing we are planning to add aggressively to that capacity but not necessarily significantly faster than the revenue growth that we're seeing. ","Mark S. Marcon","Great. Thank you. Can you just say how much of that oil patch is -- what percentage of the U.S. that comprises, I imagine it's relatively less than 20%?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well it's clearly less than that. I mean we never broken things out by state. But I generally feel that you can look at relative population. ","Mark S. Marcon","Sure.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","And our relative revenues map pretty closely to that. ","Mark S. Marcon","Great. Thank you. ","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","It's not like that's the only thing going on in Texas either. So I wouldn't even take all of Texas and say well there is an oil patch issue there. Places like Dallas particularly, are much more diversified. There is a lot of small businesses there. Healthcare is quite strong. Our people are optimistic that there are opportunities in the healthcare industry which will help offset some of the softness that's expected in oil and gas. ","Mark S. Marcon","Fully appreciate that. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Andrew Steinerman ","Hi there. I just wanted to ask Keith to go through the comparison of the fourth quarter EPS guide the $0.53 to $0.58. The just reported fourth quarter $0.62 obviously I know there is a seasonal factor, there is an FX factor but if you could walk us through the $0.62 just reported to the range of $0.53 to $0.58, kind of how you came up with the range that would be helpful?","M. Keith Waddell","Well so if we're talking fourth quarter actual versus first quarter guidance I think that's what your question is. ","Andrew Steinerman","Yes. ","M. Keith Waddell","So let\u2019s kind of take a tour down the P&L. From a revenue standpoint, on a same day constant currency basis, at the midpoint we've dialed in a touch of additional acceleration. As you can see even adjusted for weather we started January very strongly, which we\u2019re encouraged by. We didn't dial that much acceleration in but we did dial in a little bit of acceleration. Protiviti, given its 22% growth in the fourth quarter we dialed that back just a bit, in part because they had a couple of really good projects that are winding down a bit and in part because it's 22%, and in part because they've got to have comps but when you put the package together, revenues at the midpoint are still accelerating a point, a percentage point versus what we just reported. ","On the gross margin side, the fourth quarter\u2019s always noisy, not only in the fourth quarter do you have the workers comp true-ups that we talk about very specifically but we're also truing up estimates for state and federal unemployment taxes, for estimates on FICO for estimates of the temporaries that qualify for holiday and vacation pay. So the fourth quarter standalone is always a bit noisy. ","That said year-over-year our temp gross margins did expand 40 basis points. We do expect further year-over-year expansion of gross margins into the first quarter which is dialed into the guidance and that expansion is the typical some pay bill expansion, some relief from state unemployment taxes, conversions are up about 20 basis points year-over-year and we hope that trend continues. So again on a year-over-year basis we do expect to see continuing gross margin expansion that we\u2019ve seen for several quarters. ","SG&A, because of the investments we\u2019re making in the headcount early in 2015 and remember early in 2014 we weren\u2019t investing very aggressively in heads. So year-over-year as a percent of revenue, 2015 ought to look a lot like 2014, if we\u2019re talking at the midpoint. Protiviti year-over-year we do expect margin expansion sequentially. Protiviti always is more challenged in the first quarter than the prior fourth that will be particularly so sequentially, this year because of the big projects they had in the fourth quarter. ","The other comments I would make that the tax rate for 2015 we expect to be higher, more in the 39% range. The foreign tax benefits that we benefited from the last couple of years have progressively gotten smaller and smaller and smaller and will do so again in 2015. Maybe that\u2019s more than you wanted to hear but that pretty much went from top to bottom. ","Andrew Steinerman ","I also asked about FX. ","M. Keith Waddell","FX, so during the quarter just ended it negatively impacted our growth rates by two percentage points. In the first quarter we expect our growth rates to be negatively impacted by three percentage points or about $30 million on a year-over-year basis. From an EPS standpoint that converts to about a $0.01 per share and that\u2019s been reflected in the guidance that we gave. So while there is some drag from currency it\u2019s certainly more at the revenue line than it is at the EPS line. ","Andrew Steinerman ","Perfect, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Jeffrey M. Silber","I am sorry, just to go back on some of the investing in people that you\u2019ve done, is it possible to get an understanding which specific verticals did you do that investment in, was there one more than others?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","I\u2019d say during 2014 Robert Half technology probably got more than its share. We got broader during the second half of 2014. For 2015 it will be more broad-based than 2014. That said, our management resources division and our perm placement division seem to be doing particularly well and if anything we\u2019ll investing more heads there, than we will the other. But overall it will be more broad based than it was in 2014. ","Jeffrey M. Silber","Okay, great that\u2019s helpful. And then just one -- just a few numbers questions, going back to your international exposure, can you just remind us which countries you have exposure to? And also what you\u2019re expecting for capital expenditures in 2015? Thanks. ","M. Keith Waddell","Sure, so overall international is about 24% of revenues. 12% of that\u2019s Europe; 4% of that\u2019s the UK, 4% is Canada and the balance of 4% is Asia Pacific. So Europe broadly defined is 16% of the total; Europe the continent is split pretty equally between Germany, Belgium and France. ","Jeffrey M. Silber","And I\u2019m sorry, CapEx for the year?","M. Keith Waddell","CapEx so we ended 2014 at $62 million. We do plan to dial that up some in 2015. The range we would give would be between $70 million and $80 million. We\u2019ve got more lease expirations falling in 2015 which will require more tenant improvement dollars. Plus we\u2019re continuing to spin money and make investments in internal IT initiatives, both from the standpoint of building tools for our recruiters and sales people and to improve the client and talent [ph] experience on our website and across devices including mobile. ","Jeffrey M. Silber","Okay, great. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thanks good afternoon. I was hoping to ask some questions about gross margins. Protiviti gross margins were down year-over-year. You talked last quarter about making some investments in hires, particularly at the Managing Director level. So that might have been impacting your operating margins. But can you just talk in general about what you are seeing in pricing in Protiviti, kind of the general cross trends both at the gross margin and then the operating margin level?","M. Keith Waddell","Well so first of all let me say that we were elated that we almost for our full year got to double-digit margin for Protiviti. We got to 9.7%. We have talked now for a couple of years that our objective was to get to double digit operating margins at Protiviti. We have certainly gotten there on a quarterly basis. For the fourth quarter we were above 12% in Protiviti, again for the full year just under 10%. It would be our hope in 2015 that we get over 10% on a full year basis. When we focus just on the gross margin, you are correct there was a little contraction in the gross margin given Protiviti\u2019s revenue growth rates, which have been essentially the highest in the company now for several quarters. They are making the most people investments and their people investments tend to be higher cost people investments with Managing Directors. ","We continue to make those type of investments and it\u2019s a trade-off we are happy to continue to make given the expanding operating margins and the expectation of that continued expansion.","Sara Gubins","Great, thanks. And then there are number of components that have been helping drive gross margin improvement in staffing, the pay spreads and some conversion et cetera. Could you talk about the pay spread and then also just where do you see the most potential from the various drivers going forward? Thanks.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Sure. So on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter our spreads were pretty much level with the prior year. Conversions were up roughly 20 basis points versus the prior year but still on the low end of the 3% to 5% of revenue range. So it is our hope that they are still a hundredish basis points of upside with conversions to get back to more normal cycle, 4% of revenue, much less 5% of revenue which we have seen in prior cycles. The payroll tax and fringe area year-over-year is also down about 20 basis points. That\u2019s primarily less state unemployment tax as we talked about, as the cycle improves there is lag as to when you see the benefit on the state unemployment taxes, which typically are a three year moving average calculation at the state. ","Our expectation that moving into \u201915 we will continue to see some further improvement in state unemployment taxes, that 20 basis points to 30 basis points would be our expectation over the next two to three years, how quickly we get there. In part it will be a function of how robust the recovery is. We are still bullish on gross margins as I said earlier. We expect and at our midpoint guidance have dialed in further year-over-year expansion of temp gross margins in frankly each of the three elements that you described.","Sara Gubins","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy McHugh","Hi, yes, thanks. When we talk about gross margin you didn\u2019t mention the healthcare cost of fully adopting healthcare reform. It is just not noticeable at this point or what type of, as we -- not even just first quarter but 2015 and I guess \u201816ish as to kind of have that fully rolled out?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","So we have gone through an open enrollment period where all of the temporaries that qualified based on their 2,000 performance that met the threshold were offered coverage and the sign-up rates we got, were if anything somewhat less than we had modeled. What you don\u2019t know is what the cost per person is going to be. So based on everything we know what we modeled is more than adequate and that additional cost was a single, a small single-digit percentage that we can pass through.","But no surprises there based on actually going through an open enrolment period using actual numbers based on 2014 experience.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, great. As we think about productivity for next year, is opportunity still on the international margins or if you cut enough there that, that profitability is where you at. I guess what\u2019s the natural like, I imagine U.S. margins are pretty strong?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I think the next lag is two-fold. We not think we peaked out with our U.S. margins and we think there is an opportunity to expand the gross margins at least a 100 basis points from where we are today to the extent, the relative impact of the investments get smaller as it is gets larger. Further there has been dilution from the international margins. That dilution has declined and we do expect it to continue to decline. We\u2019ve done much better in Europe Asia is more of our focused area. It has been for several quarters it will continue to be but we far from believe we\u2019ve gotten to peak margins in Protiviti U.S. and then to the extent there is less dilution outside the U.S. that\u2019s additive as well. ","Timothy McHugh","One follow up is for Protiviti, the large projects that are ending, what type of projects are they and just training to gauge the potential for other large that come on.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, it\u2019s a nuanced in that we have couple of existing accounts, long-term relationships where they had some special project requirements in the fourth quarter. We continue with those accounts, they continue to be sizable accounts. It\u2019s just that they had a couple of special projects that were concentrated in the quarter. So I don\u2019t want to make too big a deal about it and it\u2019s nothing like some of the other big projects that we\u2019ve talked about in years past as it relates to the staffing side but they did spike our growth rates in the fourth quarter beyond what we expected and we would expect the growth in the first quarter to moderate but let\u2019s be real, moderate at really high double digit rates, which we are very pleased about. ","So there is no theme there that\u2019s you need to worry, you have to extract or extrapolate across other pieces of that business.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Louis Ginocchio","Thank you. Just want to follow up on Tim\u2019s last question. Is that the small single digit increases, are your clients pushing back on that at all? Are they happy with that and then what do you think that is relative to what maybe some of your competitors are, the player or the other players in the market are doing, that seem about right? And then just quick follow up on temp to perm conversions, where are we in that 3% to 5% range, can you tell us, thanks?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, clients are never happy when you ask for more and clients always push back somewhat so I\u2019d say we have mixed results in passing through on new assignment, the impact of ACA, but again because the impact isn\u2019t that large and frankly its smaller than increases in state unemployment taxes we had to deal within year pass it\u2019s not just a huge, huge matter which is why we are cautiously optimistic we will be able to digest that and without much notice to the overall gross margin rate, temp to perm was still at the lower end of the 3% to 5% I think, we highlighted 3.1% for two to three quarters in a row. So there is not a lot of movement there. ","It\u2019s better than it was a year ago and it would be our expectation and history would say that it will get better from here and to be conservative we are saying let\u2019s take half of the upside that we might typically see and that\u2019s still 100 basis points. ","Paul Louis Ginocchio","Great and you were kind enough to mention office team benefiting a little bit from more admin around ACA. You are seeing any other demand drivers from companies around 100 employees? ","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Yeah, others than the open enrollment impact of ACA across clients generally we\u2019ve seen very little benefit from under 50 to around 100 and there just hasn\u2019t been much benefit from that. So the good news is that if there is anything it\u2019s ahead of us and we don\u2019t have any of that at risk. ","Paul Louis Ginocchio","Great, thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Anj Singh","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. My first one would you say that the pickup in growth rates in Tech have been mostly due to your headcount additions or are there any other drivers besides the strong end market that you care to call out?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, I would say because of strong demand we\u2019ve added recruiters and because we\u2019ve added recruiters we have more capacity to recruit to fill that demand. So clearly they are related but in the tech development area, app developers, web developers we called of that before and this quarter was a continuation of what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Except this quarter was even better and that\u2019s pretty much through across our lines of business. ","Anj Singh","Got it and if I got it correctly I think there was some slowdown in the perm growth internationally in the first three weeks. I realize it\u2019s a very small sample but is there anything that you attribute that slowdown in growth to, is there anything that you can call out in these early days?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","As I said before and having done this for a long, long time, the early quarter start in perm isn\u2019t very well correlated with how we do for the full quarter and that always been true. It\u2019s always been more volatile and it\u2019s particularly true in perm. We started disclosing that information, it\u2019s more meaningful in temp. So it was easier to continue it than to discontinue it. But that said -- it\u2019s we\u2019ve disclosed it forever and you can prove to yourself that\u2019s not very correlative [ph]. ","Anj Singh","Understood, one final one and I know you guys said that there is a positive impact from the comp due to the weather conditions last year, wondering if there\u2019s anything from the weather impact from the recent blizzard in the Northeast or was that really insignificant?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well there\u2019ll be an impact. So remember for the full quarter a year ago there was about 1% negative impact. So we have added as a cushion if you will for first quarter 2015 impacts, of which this latest Northeastern storm made a dip in. So did it have an impact, yes, did it have an impact to the extent of the prior year, no. But the full impact of even a prior year [ph] on a full quarter basis only impacted our growth rates by one percentage point. ","Anj Singh","Understood, thanks for your help. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys, good afternoon. Just looking back at the history, it seems like in the past few employment cycles, in the second half of the up cycle the perm business has frequently accelerated to maybe closer to twice the growth rate of the temp. I know it\u2019s growing faster and it\u2019s been really well but anything that you see that\u2019s different this cycle or that feels like that same pattern could happen. How are we thinking about it over the next year or whatever relatively you have seen in the past? Thanks. ","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, because perm falls more in a downturn it accelerates more than an up cycle. I would say the last several quarters perm is feeling pretty classic, relative to history. Candidates are getting tighter, candidates are getting multiple offers, candidates are getting counter offered by their existing employer, and clients are beginning to take their second choice when their first choice takes another position somewhere else, without starting to search over again, all of those things are very classic science, that the labor markets are heating up, that candidates are getting tighter, that a larger and larger premium is placed by our clients on recruiting of candidates, which is our strong suite and our sweet spot. ","So it feels very classic and we would expect acceleration, and as I said earlier we're going to invest disproportionally in headcount in perm and in management resources. ","Gary Bisbee","Okay and then just a follow-up, Protiviti\u2019s obviously been exceptionally strong, really for two years now. Looking back on that period what's been more important in terms of driving that, has it been expanding the areas of focus you work on or is it really just rising demand everywhere and how much -- is it the market versus your execution and hires? ","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, I'd say there are three principle demand drivers. There is internal audit, where the PCA will be insisting on more work, more documentation by the outside audit firms which is trickled down to internal audit, has been very helpful. With the restricting of the IPO market, there is a lot of pre-IPO companies that have to get their controls in order. That's benefited internal audio with Protiviti. In the financial services arena risk and compliance, anti-money laundering, the regulatory actions that typically follow with some kind of remediation and monitoring have benefited Protiviti. And then in the IT space, IT controls, IT security are pretty much top of line at most companies. ","So the combination of more internal audit demand, more financial services risk in regulatory demand and in the IT controls and security area, those three things have all been strong and they've all been strong for a couple of years. They were all strong in the quarter just ended and they're all expected to be strong in the first quarter that we're in. ","Gary Bisbee","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Tobey Sommer ","Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us the build rates in the quarter and maybe given the fact that you're hiring quite a bit, where did you think in this kind of context particularly U.S. build rate growth could go in 2015? Thanks. ","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","So build rates in the quarter adjusted for currency were up 3.5% which is pretty consistent with what it's been, maybe a touch better than the last couple of quarters. As to where it might go usually in the middle, the middle robust part of the cycle you see 5%, 6%, 7% build rate growth. We haven't seen those rates. If you look back to history to say what do you typically see, you typically see those and there been, as everyone knows, tons, tons and tons tons written about wage inflation, the absence of wage inflation, whether this cycle is different, whether the baby boom or retirement aging demographics, labor force participation, you can say it a 1000 ways, there are a lot of theories out there, about whether this one is going to be different. ","But it's feeling more classic than not and that would say, rather than mid threes you're headed to mid-fives or sixes and whether that's a 2015 thing or 2016 thing your guess is as good as ours. ","Tobey Sommer ","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Ryan filling in for Munaf [ph]. A lot of my questions have been answered but I've heard you say classic a few times and obviously the jobless claims today and just the temp penetration rate reaching new highs, I was wondering you could just kind a give some sense on the temp penetration rate and just kind of where you see upside to there and just kind of the relative to prior cycles. ","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","We've talked about for some time in the early part of the cycle we benefited primarily from a secular shift to using more temporaries. Those jobs that were created were about three times more temporary in it, than in prior cycles, I think it's 9% of the jobs created in this cycle have been jobs, that\u2019s typically 2% to 3%. So until a few quarters ago we pretty much benefited exclusively from secular growth because there hadn\u2019t been much cyclical growth. In the last two or three quarter we\u2019ve clearly seen the labor markets improve, our middle market clients have more processing level demand, which ties very directly to the health of their own businesses, such that now we see the more typical cyclical demand starting to kick in as well. ","So we believe given that the temp penetration rates are already at all-time highs that\u2019s pretty much happened in the absence of much cyclical improvement and therefore we would believe and expect that those penetration rates go higher. And the other thing as you grow jobless claims those also are coming down, not in a straight line but showing improvement which is also a classic sign that the labor markets are improving.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Reece with Avondale Partners. Your line is open.","Randy Reece","Good afternoon. Did you say that Protiviti grew its internal and contractor headcount 5% year-over-year?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","We did. We said that it\u2019s a tale of two cities and if you guys split U.S. and non-U.S. and U.S. the headcount grew more in line with revenue growth and the disparity is more on the non-U.S. where we reduced headcount yet the revenue still grew a bit. ","Randy Reece","So that 40% increase in operating profit you had in Protiviti would be a pretty tough comp for \u201915, is that correct?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","It would be but they have had tough comps now for a while. I mean they\u2019ve done well for two years. So they\u2019ve already had to anniversary some tough comps. Now clearly they get even tougher. But that said we continue to make headcount investments, the growth rates have stayed nicely in the mid-double digits and our expectation is that, that would continue and while you not might see 40% year-over-year growth you are going to see year-over-year growth that should exceed top line growth and therefore get their full year operating margins above 10%, which is what we\u2019ve been shooting for now for a couple of years. ","Randy Reece","So when I look at the fourth quarter growth number for Protiviti in the U.S. it\u2019s a bit of a weaker comp but it is still pretty strong. What is the strength concentrated in if you just were to normalize it?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","It\u2019s actually pretty balanced across the three areas that we\u2019ve talked about it; internal audit, financial services, risk and compliance, IT, controls and security. In the fourth quarter we had a couple of large projects from existing clients that spiked their growth rate somewhat but even in the absence of that it did great.","Randy Reece","Very good, thank you very much. ","Operator","The final question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. ","George Tong","Hi, I would like to dig in more on gross margins on the temp side. Where would U.S. wage growth need to accelerate to for bill paid spread to show the kind of gross margin improvement you are targeting in the near and intermediate term?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, if we are talking U.S. wage growth from a macro standpoint there is too many moving parts there that I can figure out. But as we\u2019ve just talked about we\u2019ve been seeing mid-3% wage growth for the last few quarters, typically as labor markets improve that, would go to mid-5%, mid-6% wage growth. We\u2019ve expanded our spreads to some degree already even in an environment where we are talking mid-3% growth. We would hope we can do even better than that as we move to 4% and 5% and 6% growth. ","Again we deal primarily with professional level college educated people. The unemployment rate for those people is about half what it is overall and so as those labor markets tighten we will have to pay those people more. We are already seeing that, which then gives us an opportunity to pass that on with a little more spread. ","George Tong","Right, and I would like to get your views on the sort of timing perspective for gross margins, how far do you think you are from peak? Just your view and how do you bridge there given the three buckets you have already outlined in terms of sources of gross margin expansion?","M. Keith Waddell","Well so we are about 30 basis points below peak, if you look at the most recent quarter, 30, 36.9. I think we peaked out at least on a full year at 37.2 So we are about 30 basis points below and between pay\/bill spread expansion, less state unemployment cost and taking temp to perm conversions more to the midpoint of the range, we would be very disappointed if we don\u2019t make new highs in gross margin in this expansion, in this cycle.","George Tong","And where you do think those new highs can possibly get to, based on the trends you are currently seeing?","M. Keith Waddell","We are not going to speculate but we are very pleased with where we have gotten gross margins to this point in this cycle and we are quite optimistic that we have the momentum that we can take those higher.","George Tong","Great, thank you.","Harold M.

Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We begin our call with a reminder that today's commentary contains predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statement. Our comments represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions.","We believe these remarks to be reasonable, but we do remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update statements made on today's call.","Now let's discuss the third quarter. Global revenues were $1.08 billion in the third quarter, a 4% increase year-over-year. Income per share was $0.48, up 17% from 1 year ago. Cash flow from operations was $80 million in the third quarter, and capital expenditures were $12 million. On September 16, we paid a $0.16 cash dividend to stockholders at a cost of $22 million. During the third quarter, we also repurchased 800,000 Robert Half shares at a cost of $28 million. Approximately 8.6 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. Demand for our professional staffing and consulting services remained solid in the third quarter, led by Protiviti and our technology and permanent placement staffing divisions, particularly in the United States. For the 14th consecutive quarter, we grew net income and earnings per share in excess of 15% on a year-over-year basis.

U.S. staffing revenues were $708 million in the third quarter, while international staffing revenues were $228 million. We have 346 staffing locations worldwide, including 100 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. We calculated 64 billing days in the third quarter compared to 63.2 days in last year's third quarter. The effect of which was a 1.3% increase in reported year-over-year staffing growth rates. The current quarter has 61.9 billing days as compared to 62.0 days in the fourth quarter of 2012. Currency exchange rates had no meaningful effect on reported third quarter 2013 staffing revenues. A supplemental schedule accompanying our earnings release today shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on a reported, as well as a same-day constant currency basis. The schedule further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You can find the schedule in today's press release and the Investor Center of our website. This is a non-GAAP financial measure meant to provide you with information on certain revenue trends in our staffing operations.","Third quarter revenues for Protiviti were $139 million, including $113 million in the United States and $26 million outside the U.S. Global revenues for Protiviti grew 16% year-over-year, with U.S. revenues up 22% and non-U.S. revenues down 4%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 74 locations in 25 countries.","Now turning to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 36.2% of applicable revenues. This was the same as the third quarter of 2012. Permanent placement revenues were 9.4% of overall staffing revenues for the quarter compared to 8.9% reported 1 year ago. Including the impact of temporary and consulting gross margins just discussed, overall staffing gross margin expanded 30 basis points versus 1 year ago to 42.2%. Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $42 million or 30.5% of Protiviti revenues, compared to $32 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues a year ago. This is an increase of $10 million or 32%, owing largely to higher staff utilization levels and billing rates in the United States.","Turning to selling, general and administrative costs in the third quarter, our staffing SG&A costs were 32.6% of staffing revenues, up 30 basis points from the 32.3% reported 1 year ago. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 20.6% of Protiviti revenues. This is a 140-basis-point improvement from the 22% level reported last year. Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $90 million or 9.6% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $76 million in operating income for the quarter or 9% of applicable revenues. Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $14 million or 15.5% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $14 million in the third quarter of 2013 or 9.8% of revenues. This compares to $6 million in the third quarter 1 year ago or 4.9% of revenues. Operating income more than doubled year-over-year to the highest level achieved since 2006. Accounts receivable were $566 million at the end of the third quarter, with implied day sales outstanding of 47.9 days compared to 49 days at the end of the third quarter 2012.","Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the third quarter and so far in October: In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions accelerated in July, decelerated in August and reaccelerated in September. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement divisions slowed in July, accelerated in August and decelerated in September. Outside the U.S., year-over-year temporary and consulting staffing growth rates remained consistently negative, while permanent placement growth rates improved modestly throughout the quarter. For the first 2 weeks of October, global revenues for our temporary and consulting operations were up 1% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 3% and non-U.S. temporary and consulting revenues down 5%. For the first 3 weeks of October, global permanent placement revenues were down 3% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. perm revenues up 5% and non-U.S. perm revenues down 17%. We would remind you, however, it's difficult to read a lot into these trends given the short time periods they represent. Taking this information into account and the 2 fewer sequential billing days, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion; income per share, $0.44 to $0.49. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release.","Now I'll turn the call back to Max.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We had a strong quarter overall. The one consistent trend, of course, is the uncertain macro environment in many of our non-U.S. markets, most notably in Europe. While our business exposure within the hardest-hit countries is minimal, the soft economy in Europe did continue to impact our financial results. In the United States, the technology sector is leading the way in hiring demand, and this also is reflected in our financial results. We believe that our investments in growing our information technology staffing business are paying off. Protiviti had its best quarter in 6 years, as Keith noted, with continued growth in all consulting solutions, particularly in technology, as well as risk and regulatory compliance in the financial services industry. We are pleased with the momentum we continue to see in Protiviti. We hope to see an improving economy in 2014 and beyond. We are focused on growing those areas of the business, where we see demand for highly-skilled talent, and we are investing in more internal resources accordingly. Skill shortages persist in many professional disciplines, including technology and accounting.","We believe Robert Half is well positioned to meet the global demand for specialized talent on a full-time and temporary basis. We are confident in the abilities of our leadership team and our staffing operations in Protiviti. We have a highly recognizable and respected brand name in Robert Half. Earlier this month, we introduced a new logo and other design updates that placed greater emphasis on the Robert Half name. It allows us to showcase our breadth of services, while also paying homage to Robert Half's rich history. The new logo works especially well when viewed on a mobile device or in other digital formats. Our corporate website is now located at roberthalf.com. Our stock ticker, of course, remains RHI.","At this time, we'll be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends that you were seeing internationally by country. We've been seeing some indications that maybe the U.K. was getting a little bit stronger. And I was wondering if you were seeing something similar, or are there any signs that you're seeing that maybe some of the international markets might get a little bit better?","M. Keith Waddell","Yes, Mark. So the U.K. has gotten stronger. We actually had slightly positive year-over-year revenue growth in the U.K. for the quarter, which is the first time in quite a while. Germany remains solid, not flashy, but it's been solid for several quarters. Belgium was less negative, and Belgium is particularly important because it's our most profitable non-U.S. country. And France and Australia pretty much stayed as they had in prior quarters. So generally speaking, when you put it all together, we were less negative in the non-U.S. operations, led by U.K., Germany and Belgium.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is there any tone from the operations over there that the less negative\/inflection to positive is continuing, or is it just too early to say?","M. Keith Waddell","I'd say, anecdotally, there's a positive sentiment that things are getting better. But frankly, I would probably respond that it's too early to say.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And I'm assuming your revenue guidance basically incorporates that in terms of the -- not assuming much of an inflection as it relates to the international side.","M. Keith Waddell","That's correct. Our guidance at the midpoint for non-U.S. would be roughly or maybe a touch better year-over-year than what was the case in Q3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just want to follow-up from some of the prior calls. You've talked about the mortgage sector and the drag that has been. I know we kind of saw the full impact of the stoppage of the mortgage foreclosure review work. But there's been some commentary about refinancing activity being lower. I know it's a lower margin area for you, but just to update us, I guess, on what you're seeing, and how much of an impact that had in this quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. So let's, first, talk about foreclosure look back, and that's the piece of business that abruptly ended the 1st week of January, what we call a cliff event internally. And so that cliff event had a 300-basis-point impact on the growth of both Accountemps and Management Resources, so a little bit more than prior quarters, but not much. And we would expect its impact on the fourth quarter to be similar to the impact it just had on the third quarter. So now, beyond the foreclosure look back, which was a very discrete set of projects with a few clients, there's the whole mortgage origination, mortgage refi. And while that's drifted down a little during the course of the year and adds a little bit to the impact of what we've -- that we've just talked about with the foreclosure look back, it's nothing in the order of magnitude that the look back is. So yes, it's drifted down a little, but it hasn't had a huge impact the way foreclosure look back has.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then on the technology side, can you talk about what's the growth rate to pick back up there? Do you think the market's gotten stronger? Is there something that you're doing that you think is driving the growth rate back up? I guess, what do you attribute to the little faster growth recently?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I think given the relative young age of the investment we've made, I think our people get more skilled, particularly at recruiting over time. We have a disproportionate number of relatively less tenured people in technology. And as they become more tenured and more skilled, I think it shows up in the top line, which is very candidate-recruiting driven.","We feel good about tech. We feel good about how tech performed. Tech is still a drag on the bottom line because of our outsized investment in headcount and SG&A there. But we're certainly getting the top line results that we hope for. And over time, some of the bottom line drag that we're currently experiencing on purpose will subside.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And are you still adding to that at this point, or are you letting it mature?","M. Keith Waddell","We are still adding. We're adding in technology. We're adding in permanent placement. In addition, we've been, modestly in the background, adding to our other divisions as well, as the tone begins to improve. We want to make sure we have the capacity to participate fully in that. So we have modestly added to our headcount across our divisions, but certainly led by technology and permanent placement.","Operator","Your third question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to ask about the trajectory of margins for Protiviti, which, obviously, it's been on the rise. What's assumed in the fourth quarter? And when do you think that Protiviti's margins will normalize?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as to the trajectory of margins, first, let me say, we were particularly pleased with Protiviti during the quarter both from a revenue growth standpoint, as well as the margin 9.8%, almost got to the magic double digits we've been talking about for some time. We're very happy there. Typically, the fourth quarter because it's a shorter quarter for Protiviti, even more so than staffing because many of Protiviti's clients shut down or at least have what's called a soft close that last week of the year. So generally, Protiviti's fourth quarter is shorter than staffing's equivalent quarter. And therefore, it puts a little bit of a drag on operating margins. I think we backed up about 30 or 40 basis points a year ago. So something in the same ballpark would be reasonable. We hope to do better. We'll try to do better. But the Protiviti margin story has been a strong one with which we're very happy.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And do you want to throw in the other side? When do you feel like Protiviti's margins will normalize, in other words, hit target utilization rates?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, normalize is an interesting word given Protiviti's history. We've had 20% operating margins, and it's way distant past. We went down to single digit and below. We've consistently said we expect double-digit operating margins on a consolidated global basis for Protiviti. We got really close this quarter. We hope to get there more consistently next year in the first half of the year, when margins are typically wider. So we're certainly not here to say that the current quarter margins can't be normal margins, but we're also not here to say that 20% is normal either. So we're getting into that double-digit range that we've long talked about. We can take utilization levels on an annual basis higher. We can take the leverage model, where you look at your managing directors versus staff. We do think we can further improve that. The bill rates, although they increased a modest single digit year-over-year in this quarter, we do think there's room to take bill rates up, particularly given the demand environment. So we're optimistic, Andrew, that we can continue to expand Protiviti operating margins and create a new normal, and that new normal is double digit.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And there's still room to move from here. I got it.","M. Keith Waddell","Right.","Operator","Your fourth question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America.","Brian T. Davis - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Bryan Davis in for Sara Gubins. So I just wanted to ask about total revenue on a same-day constant currency basis which was 1.3% in the quarter, slightly below the midpoint of guidance at 1.5%. I was wondering what are some of the areas that decelerated below the trend in the quarter, and if there were any noticeable areas of acceleration above the trend?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, we've shown you the growth rates by line of business for the quarter year-over-year. It was really close to our midpoint. We're almost splitting hairs to say how was it different. Maybe Accountemps was a touch light of what we had first expected. Technology was a touch better than we expected. But again, when we're talking $5 million on a $1 billion base, we're getting pretty picky.","Brian T. Davis - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then looking ahead to 4Q, could you give us a sense of what the implied same-day constant currency growth rate might be that's embedded in your revenue guidance?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, sure. So at the midpoint of our guidance, to save -- the global same-day rate would be 2.5%, and that 2.5% is up from the 1.3%, as you just noted, that we reported in the third quarter. And to me, importantly, if you look at the U.S. piece of that, so we've had 3 quarters in a row where our U.S. growth rates decelerated. And this past quarter, they flattened out and actually increased a touch. We're expecting a slight increase, yet again, in the fourth quarter. So it certainly looks like, at a minimum, our U.S. growth rates have flattened out versus declining sequentially for the last 3 quarters. And again, we're projecting a small bump year-over-year, in part because the comparisons, obviously, get easier as you look backwards.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I just want to get your perspective on how you feel the different Accountemps, OfficeTeam and Management Resources different kind of accounting-related segments are performing relative to their end markets. And I ask you that in the context of BLS temp job number that showed a pickup in a pretty nice rate of growth if you believe that data.","M. Keith Waddell","Well, the BLS data, for some time, hasn't tracked very well, either with the American Staffing Association data on a broad basis or certainly not with our data. So we, for years, have tended to discount BLS, in large part because it's heavily nonprofessional driven. And therefore, we've never considered a very good proxy for the professional market and even less so, the last 12 months or so. How we're performing relative to the end markets, we believe we're holding our own. It's -- there's been a lot of macro uncertainty, physical, fiscal uncertainty. There's been a lot of uncertainty in the markets for some time, which has clearly impacted our small- and middle-sized clients. But we feel like we've held our own, as I just spoke. Our U.S. growth rates decelerated 3 quarters in a row. They flattened out, ticked up a little this quarter. We're hoping to see a continuation of the ticking up into the current quarter. So hopefully, we're at an inflection point. It's certainly too soon to absolutely declare that's the case. But we feel like we're holding our own. We talked earlier about mortgage. Mortgage has been a headwind, particularly the foreclosure look back, but then anniversaries itself in the first quarter. And so you have 300 basis points of growth from anniversarying that alone.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then, could you comment on your bill rates relative to the technology business? Is there any distinction between what you're experiencing there versus your overall bill rate experience?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, technology, because it's more candidate short, the pay rates are a bit firmer, and the bill rates are a bit firmer, but not significantly so than the rest of our business. If you have consolidated, our bill rates were up 1.8%. Year-over-year, they were up 1% sequentially, and that's a little better than they had been the last few quarters. And tech certainly was a major contributor to that. But there's no question that the supply is tightest in tech. That puts pressure on pay rates, but that, in turn, gives us permission to charge more in bill rates, not only to pass through the pay rate increase, but more.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie Research.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Keith and Max, I wonder if you could give us a sense of where the utilization is at Protiviti now split between U.S. and non-U.S.? And where that -- we should look for that to go to?","M. Keith Waddell","We've never published utilization rates per se. Clearly, U.S. are much higher than non-U.S. That's no shock. But it's 3 levers that drive Protiviti revenues. It's not only utilization, it's bill rates and it's the shape of the pyramid or the leverage model between the people at the top end and the people at the base of the pyramid. So we believe we have upside in all 3 of those levers with Protiviti. Again, while utilization was high this quarter in Protiviti, it certainly wasn't near that high in the first half of the year. So we think, particularly on a full year basis, we've got upside with Protiviti utilization. We've got upside with bill rates, we talked earlier, and we have upside with the leverage model. So we do not think we've topped out with Protiviti operating margins by any stretch of imagination. The fourth quarter is a little shorter than the third. And for that reason, they usually back up just a little bit, a few basis points versus the third. But we think Protiviti's on a good path profitability-wise, and I think -- generally speaking, I think most people are more favorably inclined than negative about the progress they've made in the time period they've made it.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","It's been impressive. And Keith, counting 22% U.S. growth, if I heard you right, I mean, we haven't seen that in a long time. Is it -- is there any kind of new accounting out, or is it just more feet on the street? Like what's driving that type of revenue growth particularly in the U.S.?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, so the good news is it's pretty broad based. First of all, in the tech space, you've got security, business continuity, application controls, SharePoint, all of which played a role very consistent with prior quarters. On the financial services side, it's anti-money laundering, capital adequacy, model validation, regulatory enforcement, regulatory monitoring, internal audit support, IPO readiness. There are a lot of drivers. But clearly, Protiviti is very well positioned in the strongest part, particularly in the financial services market. So it's adding to its own resources at all levels of the pyramid. It's also tapping into the resources of our staffing division and using more contractors. But Protiviti is in a very good place from a demand standpoint as we speak and is working very hard to get the internal resources to keep up with the demand. But it's more resource constrained than it is demand constrained as we speak.","Operator","Next, we have Randle Reece with Avondale Partners.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I was just noting the behavior of temp staffing SG&A against gross profit, and I was wondering if you could talk a little more about what you're doing in spending on the temp and contract staffing side.","M. Keith Waddell","So as I talked about a bit earlier, Randy, we have been adding to staff in the background, not only in tech and perm placement, but also in Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Management Resources. So we felt like as things, as business conditions were beginning to improve, we were a little light on internal staff. So we have been adding to that pretty much across the board in the background. But for that, you'd see more improvement in SG&A. SG&A is pretty constant as a percent of revenue year-over-year, particularly if you look at temp versus temp, perm versus perm. If you look at overall because there's more perm in the mix, the overall percentage reads as higher because that's just mix related. But no question in the temp side of business, we've been adding to staff. That's put some pressure on SG&A. That was intentional on our part. If things improve in 2014 as many project, we'll be ready.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Does it make it hard in an erratic growth environment like this, the time spending initiatives?","M. Keith Waddell","It's -- absolutely. We understand that we're investing a bit ahead of any proven inflection point in the market. We've flattened out this quarter, where our midpoints as we tick off a bit next quarter. And based on that and based on -- many believe that 2014 will be stronger, we've modestly added to our headcount. We're not talking huge in order of magnitude. But clearly, we could have reported more in our earnings this quarter by not adding to the headcount, but we chose not to. And only time will tell whether we're right or wrong. But if we're wrong, we can make a midcourse correction.","Harold Max Messmer","Randy, we've been at this for quite a few years, as you know. And to some extent, you have to be a bit of a surgeon knowing when to cut and when to add, and there's no guarantee. But you use your best judgment, and we'll see how it plays out soon enough.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.","Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ato Garrett on for Paul Ginocchio. And I have one question relating to any incremental benefit that you have seen from healthcare reform in the third quarter, and whether or not you're assuming to see anything in the fourth quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","There's not much new on healthcare reform, a lot of discussion with our clients, not much real demand. Our fourth quarter guidance doesn't assume anything to speak of or, frankly, hardly anything for an uptick due to healthcare. And we're getting a little bit of business for some of the exchanges as they deal with their issues, but again, not such that it would move the needle.","Operator","Next, we have Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","We've seen nice acceleration in RHI Technology, and you obviously have multiple decades of experience in terms of growing areas outside of technology at a very rapid rate in a decent environment. I'm wondering if you can talk just a little bit about some of the differences that you're seeing on the tech side as it relates to the ability to grow that business at the rates that you've demonstrated in the past and in terms of some of the other areas?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I think the largest difference is that tech is more resource driven, more recruiting driven. And traditionally, it has been the case in accounting and finance. But we believe we can be equally as successful bringing in the Robert Half recruiters as we were in the past, bringing in a more balanced mix of recruiters and salespeople. So we're bullish about our tech growth rates. We've shown for some time now that we can get nice growth rates. The market's growing nicely in tech. We're participating. It's not like we're wildly outperforming the market, but we're certainly participating. And we believe we're positioned to continue to participate. But the playbook isn't hugely different than the playbook we've traditionally used with accounting and finance. It's just more candidate driven.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. But no difference in terms of being able to bring people on, train them in terms of recruiters, get them up to speed and eventually scale that?","M. Keith Waddell","It's different, but not such that we're concerned we can't generally use the same playbook. And we've gotten to where we are with generally using the same playbook, and there's no reason to believe we can't continue to go from here with generally the same playbook.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that's generated great returns on capital. On the Accountemps side, once we get past the hurdle in going to tail end of Q1, Q2, how would you describe -- if the macro environment stays the same, how would you think about Accountemps on a longer-term basis? We've all heard about a lot of companies basically being fairly tight in terms of how they're spending. How do you think about the potential growth in that, a more mature area where there -- maybe there's a little more automation on the margin, and how you could grow that?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, first of all, we continue to be bullish about Accountemps. I think, by far, the foreclosure look back impact, it wouldn't stick out as negatively as it does, which elicits all these questions about is there any growth left in Accountemps. We do not think it's mature. We still do business with just over 10% of our client base, which are small- to middle-sized firms. We do even less than that. That's all divisions combined. We do even less than that with Accountemps alone. The impact of automation -- if the major impacts of automation happened many years ago, when you went from manual to various spreadsheets and from spreadsheets to various payables, packages, quick books, act pack, so I don't think there's a lot of remaining risk of a huge nature for automation in accounting. Again, we've come through a pretty uncertain period with small- to middle-sized businesses. Accountemps had the foreclosure look back. It had some mortgage refi. The combination of which has made it appear to underperform. But add the 300 basis points back, and it's right in there with the rest of them, but for technology, which has done better for obvious reasons. But we feel good about Accountemps, and it's not mature. And we hadn't lost our touch in Accountemps. Again, as soon as we get through this foreclosure look back, it won't stick out like it does now.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Well, I mean, obviously, we get that question. So that's the reason why I'm asking it, and I'm sure you get it a bit yourself. So I just thought it would be good to ask on a public forum here. So as you're thinking about it when we add back in the 300 bps, do you think you'd see the same sort of multiplier effect assuming that the environment gets a little bit better as we go into -- if the environment gets better next year?","M. Keith Waddell","If the environment gets better, Accountemps will fully participate.","Harold Max Messmer","Mark, I'd just add, the last couple of years have been a particularly difficult period for most members of the NFIB, the small, the midsized businesses we do so much work with. It wouldn't take much in terms of an improvement in their attitude in terms of the macroeconomy to, I think, give them quite a boost, and I would expect us to get quite a boost right along with them. Accountemps is a very cost effective way for them to operate in their businesses. And so I don't think we should lose sight of that.","M. Keith Waddell","One thing I failed to mention, too, about guidance, so our tax rate was a touch lower this quarter as we utilized some of our foreign credits for the most part, which we predicted last quarter. This coming quarter, the quarter end, the tax rate's probably going to go up from 36% to 37%. So when you're building your models, the tax rate will be a touch heavier in Q4 than it was in Q3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Healy of Northcoast Research.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","I want to ask a question about the expansion into the tech market. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color just in terms of where you're really seeing the traction at. And I imagine the early innings with the new recruiters, it could be more in the basic level of technology. But as you see that business develop, I was hoping you could give us some thoughts on how you think it materializes in terms of high-end versus low-end presence in the market? And where do you feel like you're at today, and where you'll ultimately think the business can be in shakeout?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, we're actually getting traction at the tech support level, which is where we've been traditionally, as well as in the tech development area, which is principally applications development. And clearly, the last 12 months, we've actually gotten more relative improvement at the high end than at the basic level, as you call it. If you look at our client base, that's generally smaller than the size most tech firms serve. If anything, the application development demands have come down more to that size firm than traditionally has been the case. Without regard to size, every firm needs a website. Without regard to size, everybody wants web analytics, data analytics. Without regard to size, they need an Internet. And without regard to size, they use the cloud. So the point is, whereas traditionally, our client base, their needs were focused principally in tech support. Today, their needs are broader than that for the reasons I mentioned, and they have application development demands as well. So we're benefiting from the downsizing of technology from a client size standpoint, where there's demand that traditionally we didn't benefit from.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Okay, that's helpful. I wanted to ask I know there's been a lot of discussion about the potential benefit of healthcare reform to you guys in the future. I want to ask as you see the cost and readying for that and not necessarily providing benefits or anything like that, but is there a way to think about maybe some readiness cost as we go into 2014? Is there something material that maybe we should expect, or should we not really expect too much there?","Harold Max Messmer","Well, the short answer is I wouldn't expect very much there. We were geared up before the employer mandate was delayed a year. We were geared up to offer bronze level coverage to our temporaries alongside a low-cost noncompliant option. What we're going to do is we're going to continue and offer the not -- the low-cost noncompliant option, but we are not going to offer the bronze level coverage. Currently, I think, in this, we would offer that beginning in '15, when the employer mandate is currently scheduled to go into place. Our prior cost estimates were it added a small single-digit percentage to our cost structure because not many temporaries would qualify. Of those that did qualify, not a huge percentage would choose. And therefore, from a cost standpoint, it was not going to be a huge event. There's nothing that's changed our thinking there. Everything just got pushed back by a year. So 2014, there's not a lot of readiness cost to deal with that.","Operator","Next, we have Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","You answered one of my follow-ups. But I guess, just another one in terms of the gross margin as we look at Q4. I know sometimes in Q4 you get a benefit from a look at your accruals kind of for some of the workers comp and others' insurance. Are you expecting that this year? And if not, does that create a tough comp year-over-year that we should be aware of?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, so our assumption is that absent the workers comp credit -- and by the way, that workers comp credit last year Q4 was $2 million, which drove -- completely drove the sequential improvement a year ago. So our guidance didn't assume any new credit this year for workers comp because the actuaries haven't finished their work. So currently, we're planning for sequential flat temp gross margins, which would be down year-over-year due almost entirely to the absence of the workers comp credit that we got a year ago. No to the extent we get one this year, then it will benefit the quarter obviously. We just haven't dialed any in.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just more broadly on the bill rate and, I guess, bill pay spreads, I apologize if you missed it, but are they pretty consistent? I'm assuming given the gross margin, but is there any trend?","M. Keith Waddell","The bill pay spreads are consistent. The conversions were consistent. The French factors were consistent. The gross margins were pretty much exactly what we expected them to be, and we plan or expect that consistency to carry over into the fourth quarter, which is what's built into our guidance. And if we get some workers comp credit, that's gravy.","Operator","Next, we have Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Hi, Keith. Could you just go over bill rate trends U.S. versus international? Is there anything to call out there? I definitely caught the bill rate trends you said overall.","M. Keith Waddell","Well, clearly, the trends are stronger in the U.S. than non-U.S. So I think it's fair to look at the numbers I gave you and say U.S. only would be higher, but we haven't been breaking them out per se between U.S. and non-U.S. Non-U.S. is flat to slightly improved, but U.S. is even more so. So the trend is good. The trend is good, which is one more factor that would say things have flattened out. And potentially, you are at an inflection point. But again, the changes are miniscule to be making calls like that.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie Research.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Keith, is there a way to quantify what the investments were in terms of staff investments in Q3 and then, ultimately, if that leaps into Q4 as well?","M. Keith Waddell","We haven't broken out specifically what the hit to SG&A would be from additional headcounts, but it's not overwhelming. But then again, when we're measuring things by basis points, it has an impact. So we'll -- next quarter, we will talk about our headcounts as we do every year at the end of the year, and you'll see just what we're talking. But pretty much across-the-board, our year-to-date headcounts right now exceed our current year-to-date growth rates, and that's by design per our prior discussions.","Harold Max Messmer","That was our last question.

Our hosts for today\u2019s call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half, and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Max Messmer","Thank you, and hello, everyone. We appreciate your time today. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to point out that some of the comments we\u2019ll make on today\u2019s call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable; however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today\u2019s 8-K. We assume no obligation to update statements made on today\u2019s call.","For your convenience, our prepared remarks are available now on our website at www.roberthalf.com. Click on Investor Center, then the Quarterly Conference Calls link.","Now, let\u2019s review our first quarter results. First quarter 2015 revenues were $1.21 billion. This is an 11% increase from the year-ago first quarter. Income per share was $0.58, up 28% from last year. Cash flow from operations was $84 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were $13 million.","It has been our longstanding practice to return cash to stockholders through open market repurchases and cash dividend payments. In February, we increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share. This was the 10th consecutive year we have raised the dividend amount for our stockholders. We paid the dividend on March 13, at a cost of $27 million.","We also repurchased 500,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter, at a cost of $29 million. There are approximately 4.3 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","Led by Protiviti and Robert Half Technology, all of our divisions contributed to a solid first quarter. We saw broad-based revenue gains and higher service demand in every line of business.","First quarter revenues from our staffing operations were up 10% from the year- ago first quarter. Protiviti revenues for the quarter were up 22%. Growth rates remained the strongest in our US operations, but currency-adjusted revenues outside the United States grew nicely, also. This was Robert Half's 20th straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 32%.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our first quarter results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. Consolidated revenues were $1.21 billion in the first quarter. This is up 11% from the first quarter of 2014 on a reported basis, and up 16% on a same-day, currency-adjusted basis.","First quarter global staffing revenues were up 14% on a same-day, currency-adjusted basis. US staffing revenues were $827 million in the first quarter, up 16% on a same-day basis. Non-US staffing revenues were $215 million, up 10% on a same-day, currency-adjusted basis. We have 336 staffing locations worldwide, including 94 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The first quarter had 62 billing days, compared to 62.4 days in the first quarter a year ago. This negatively impacted year-over-year growth rates by 1%. The current quarter has 63.2 billing days, which is the same as the second quarter of last year.","Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year staffing revenues by $35 million in the first quarter. Exchange rates also decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 4%.","Each quarter, we include a supplemental schedule with our earnings release that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for our various staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as a same-day, currency-adjusted basis. The schedule further segments the data by US and non-US operations. You can find the schedule in today\u2019s press release and in the Investor Center of our website. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides information on certain revenue trends in our staffing operations.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $164 million in the first quarter, with $136 million in revenues from the United States and $28 million in revenues outside the US. Worldwide Protiviti revenues were up 27% on a same-day, currency-adjusted basis. US revenues were up 28% and non-US revenues were up 21% from the prior-year.","Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $4 million in the first quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rates by 3%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 73 locations in 24 countries.","Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the first quarter was 37% of applicable revenues. This is up 90 basis points from the same period a year ago. The improvement includes higher pay\/bill spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees.","First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.4% of consolidated staffing revenues, compared to 9.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2014. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 60 basis points versus a year ago to 42.9%.","First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $47 million, or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin one year ago for Protiviti was $37 million or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues.","Staffing SG&A costs were 32.2% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.3% in last year\u2019s first quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.8% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 21.9% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.","Operating income from our staffing divisions was $112 million in the first quarter, up 18% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.7%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $93 million in operating income, an increase of 20% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.8%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $19 million in the first quarter, up 10% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 19.3%.","First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $16 million, an increase of 121% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 9.9%. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $661 million. Implied days sales outstanding (DSO) was 49.9 days.","Before we move to second quarter guidance, let\u2019s review the monthly trends we saw during the first quarter, and so far in April. In the US, year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions accelerated in January, slowed somewhat in February and held steady in March. Also in the US, year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement divisions accelerated in January, decelerated in February and held steady in March.","Outside the US, year-over-year temporary and consulting staffing growth rates accelerated in January, decelerated in February and then decelerated again in March. Permanent placement growth rates outside of the US accelerated in January, lost a little momentum in February and held steady in March.","For the first two weeks of April, revenues for our temp and consulting operations were up 13% on a same-day, currency-adjusted basis compared to the same period last year, with US temporary and consulting revenues up 13% and non-US temporary and consulting revenues up 11%.","For the first three weeks of April, permanent placement revenues were up 9% on a same-day, currency-adjusted basis compared to the same period last year, with US perm revenues up 12% and non-US perm revenues up 2%.","This information is designed to give you additional insight into trends we saw during the first quarter and so far in April, but as you know, it is difficult to read a great deal into these numbers given the short time periods they represent.","With that said, we offer the following second-quarter guidance. Revenues, $1.245 billion to $1.295 billion. Income per share: $0.63 to $0.68. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. As noted earlier, all areas of the business contributed to a solid first quarter for the company. The labor market in the United States is stronger than it has been in more than a decade. Initial jobless claims, based on the four-week moving average, are at their lowest level in nearly 15 years, and skills shortages persist in many occupations. Technology staffing is the most supply-constrained area of staffing, but demand extends to other specialties as well.","US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports unemployment rates for specific occupations on a quarterly basis. Many of the specialized fields we serve have rates that are less than half the overall US rate of unemployment. This includes many technology and accounting positions as well as creative and marketing roles, particularly those that are web-related. We are seeing similar trends outside the United States. As labor markets tighten, clients place a premium on recruiting hard-to-find candidates, which is our strong suit.","Of particular significance for our business, the demand for temporary workers has also risen. Today, flexible staffing has become a key way for employers to manage workflow and control labor costs.","Protiviti again reported impressive growth rates during the first quarter. We are very pleased with how this business is performing right now. Demand is strong in all three of its principal service areas: internal audit, financial services risk and compliance, and IT controls and security.","The collaboration between our staffing divisions and Protiviti is also resulting in new business. We offer clients a full spectrum of services ranging from staff augmentation to full-service consulting and project-based deliverables.","At this time, we will be happy to answer questions. We would request that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Henry Chien","Hi, it\u2019s Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at Protiviti, it looks like you had a pretty strong year-over-year operating margin improvement and seeing some nice leverage in SG&A. Could you comment on what you expect that trend to continue going forward?","Keith Waddell","So you\u2019re correct, Protiviti did have a particularly strong quarter, not only in the United States, but outside the United States as well. Our expectation is in the second quarter, there would be some sequential improvement versus the first, but given the strength of the first quarter, the magnitude of the sequential improvement wouldn\u2019t be quite what it is in the past, but on a year-over-year basis, I think you would be very pleased with what\u2019s embedded in our guidance for Protiviti in the second quarter.","Henry Chien","Got it. Thank you. And just a follow-up on international revenue, it sounds like there could be I guess reacceleration for second quarter, could you comment on maybe what markets that you are seeing improving? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Well, I am not sure where the reacceleration comment comes from, but we had a very solid second quarter outside the US, not only in staffing, but in Protiviti as well. Our guidance for the second quarter outside the US is that it doesn\u2019t change dramatically from a currency-adjusted growth rate standpoint versus what we saw in the first quarter. And we certainly saw strength in France, we saw strength in Belgium, UK remains solid, Germany was solid, quite frankly we were pretty pleased across the board in our top six non-US markets in staffing, which make us the bulk of our international operations in staffing.","On the Protiviti side, we had a particularly good quarter in Asia, which is the first time in many, many quarters I can say that. Clearly that was a meaningful portion of the operating margin improvement, not to say that the US didn\u2019t improve nicely as well led by financial services, risk and compliance.","Henry Chien","Got it. Thanks so much for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon, R. W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good afternoon. You had a really strong acceleration with regards to RH technology and last call, you had mentioned you weren\u2019t really investing much above and beyond your normal method of investing. So I am wondering, what drove the strength there and how should we think about the forward outlook for RH technology?","Max Messmer","Well, Mark, in prior quarters, we had made outsized investments in Robert Half technology recruiters and that began to pay off further typically at a calendar year-end, there would be a fair number of project ends that you would take some time to replenish in the new year. That didn\u2019t happen as much this year: a couple of reasons; a) the nature of the things we are working on, mobility, cloud, security, app development, web development are stickier than some of the projects we had done in the past and further with the candidate shortage, many clients didn\u2019t want to give up their candidates because they felt like correctly, if they gave them up, they might not get them back.","So the sequential improvement we got in the first quarter was quite different than what we have seen in most years in the past where you saw some sequential decline. That candidate tightness, nature of what we are working on.","Mark Marcon","Okay. You did overinvest a year-ago and a number of quarters ago, but my recollection was the last six months, is there some element in terms of the productivity just across the board? In other words, did you pick up \u2013 have you increased the pace of hiring again in technology?","Max Messmer","So the first half of last year was very technology centric in our internal hiring. Second half of last year was much broader based where in addition to technology, we hired in the other divisions, management resources notably, to some extent perm placement and accountemps. Because of the outsized hiring in the first half of the year, it took those people some time to get up to speed and that began to pay off toward the latter part and into the first quarter.","So we did benefit from the hiring we had done previously. I would say, as we look forward into the second quarter and into the third, the hiring we will do will continue to be aggressive, but more in-line with our top line across the board than ahead of our top line.","Mark Marcon","Got it. And then with regards to the international staffing operations, in your prepared remarks, you actually noted that on a monthly basis, there was some deceleration, was that across the board? And you just said, you would expect things to basically stay steady in the second quarter relative to the first, so I was just wondering is that relative to the exit rate or just relative to the average or is there anything that was occurring that was driving that deceleration?","Max Messmer","It\u2019s a little bit country by country. I'd say that our comments as to guidance whereas that our second quarter average rate would be close to our first quarter average rate notwithstanding the trend lines that we talked about.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And is there anything that was operational about those trend lines or you would say, generally speaking we think things are actually getting a little bit better?","Max Messmer","No, I would say, one of the biggest issues with staffing outside the US is we have not made the headcount investments there, we have made in the US, because from a macro standpoint they have lagged. And so I think you\u2019re going to see over the next few quarters, we are going to begin to make more headcount investments outside of US, particularly in permanent placement.","And if you look at non-US permanent placement growth rates, you will see they are among the lowest we have had and that\u2019s also where we have made the fewest headcount investments in the last 12 to 18 months and that\u2019s where we are going to begin to change.","Mark Marcon","Got it. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Co. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","On the gross margin I guess, qualitatively you said bill pay spreads and conversion rates, I guess. Can you quantify how much was each? And I guess in particular is the conversion fees, feel like stepping up here, where I guess this is a sustainable improvement in gross margin, and perhaps even room for further improvement?","Keith Waddell","We were particularly pleased with our gross margin performance there in the quarter. Our bill rate increases were 4.1% as that\u2019s currency-adjusted compared to 3.5% a quarter ago. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, the environment that allows us to raise bill rates also allows us to expand our bill pay spreads. So of that 90 basis point improvement, it was not quite half and half, but it was close.","I think conversions improved 40 basis points year-over-year. They improved 20 basis points sequentially. You are still at 3.3% of revenues, so in that 3% to 5% range, we are still relatively low in that range. And quite optimistic that we can continue to move up that range that we\u2019ve talked about for quite some time. So from our standpoint, one of the highlights of the quarter was the progress we made with the gross margins, not only with our pay bill spreads, but also with our conversions.","Tim McHugh","Okay. On the perm side, you just talked about a little bit, but I guess can you talk a little bit more I guess if there is part of the business that at this point in the cycle I guess I might have thought there would be a little faster growth maybe. It\u2019s the perm side, is it the mix of the international business in there and as you described, the lack of investment or can you talk about more broadly what you are seeing and how that\u2019s trending relative to what you might have expected at this point?","Keith Waddell","Sure. Permanent placement has the largest non-US mix of any of our lines of business. So clearly the fact that we haven\u2019t invested in head count, because it\u2019s a lag from a macro standpoint impacts our global permanent placement growth rates as well. And even in the US you saw some deceleration there. Our recruiters had really good years in 2014. They took more time off in early 2015. That\u2019s part of it.","You are seeing candidate shortage, you are seeing more counter offers being made to candidate\u2019s existing employer, that slows down the placement process a little bit. But none of those things are a huge concern, but it\u2019s principally non-US mix that we are only beginning now to invest more in. And we are optimistic that perm will still participate nicely in the remainder of this cycle which we think is significant.","Tim McHugh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins","Thanks. Good afternoon. Have you heard any anecdotal impact from the decline in oil prices? Are there particular regions or clients that are in the oil and gas related industries?","Keith Waddell","Well, Sara, if you could see our faces you would see a smiling. We were just with a lot of our people last week and this was a topic. First of all, we don\u2019t have huge exposure to oil and gas whether it would be Texas, whether it be Calgary, whether it would be Oklahoma City. But if our Houston team who are sitting here, they will tell you that there is a petrochemical boom going on in Houston and in the East Houston particularly and that the ethylene market is on fire. So net, while we do have exposure to oil and gas, it isn\u2019t a significant exposure. Clearly the growth rates we are seeing from Texas generally are moderating that we are fairly diversified even in those markets and it\u2019s not a huge concern.","Sara Gubins","Okay, great. And then separately, you were mentioning candidate shortage on the perm side. I am wondering if you are starting to have more difficulty in recruiting on the temp side as well given how low the unemployment rate is for college educated workers.","Keith Waddell","I would say, yes, we are finding it more difficult. It depends on the functional role, it depends on the line of business. It\u2019s been tight for quite some time in technology, particularly for technology developers. There are certain roles in accounting finance that are also getting tighter financially and will stand above. But we believe that we can manage through the candidate tightness as we see it. With technology we are exposed to more candidates than we ever have been in our history. And so hopefully we will benefit from that as the market is tightening.","Sara Gubins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I think on productivity, you had originally anticipated it to slow a bit in Q1 on comps and some large projects that were winding down. Would you help us understand what drove the productivity performance above your expectations in the quarter?","Keith Waddell","I would say two things. I would say in the risk and compliance area, we got a couple of those projects extended that did better than we expected. We also started a few new projects in the FSI risk and compliance area. And further as I mentioned earlier, productivity Asia performed much better than we expected. The Japanese economy has clearly improved and further we diversified our revenue sources nicely, principally more financial services in Japan which is also helping.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay, thank you. And then we continue to have some severe weather in parts of the country in Q1. Wondering if you can size up what impacts weather may have had in your Q1 results.","Keith Waddell","So we believe it negatively impacted our growth rates by about a half of 1% and that compares to a year ago where it negatively impacted our growth rates by a full percentage point. So the differential year-over-year is about half a percentage point.","Anjaneya Singh","Got it. Okay.","Keith Waddell ","It came later this quarter than it did a year ago\u2019s first quarter. It\u2019s still I gave you the orders of magnitude of the impact.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luis Javier with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. I wanted to ask you Keith about IT flex. It seems like this must be an area where some vendors are struggling especially it sort of puzzles me since everyone say it\u2019s such a tight market, just give us a sense how are you doing on IT flex and is it sort of directionally the same as the lift that you\u2019ve seen overall in your flex gross margins?","Keith Waddell ","Well, I would say generally our flex gross margins did very well in the quarter. Conversions did very well in the quarter. Not only the number of conversions, but the fee we get for our conversion has firmed and that is also true in IT if not more so than it is in the other business. The more candidates are in demand, the more clients will pay to convert them full time. So the strength that we saw generally, we also saw in tech, we saw strength broadly both in conversions and in pay bill spreads.","Andrew Steinerman","Great. Can I just throw just one more in? After flex margins of 37% in the first quarter, what\u2019s assumed in the guide in the second quarter for flex gross margins?","Keith Waddell ","So I will answer that, but let me talk a little more generally about our guidance. On the top line, our guidance assumes that due to tougher comps the same day and reported growth rates will come down 2 or 3 percentage points. Currency will reduce revenues in the $50 million range year-over-year and the $13 million to $15 million range sequentially, which would be drag of 4.5 to 5 percentage points. Temp gross margins, where our midpoint assumes flat sequential temp gross margins, which still gives you 50 basis points to 60 basis points lift on a year-over-year basis.","From a SG&A standpoint, the hiring we\u2019ll do will be more normalized relative to the revenue growth we expect, which means we do expect to get some SG&A leverage as a percent of revenue.","Our incremental operating income will still be nicely double digit. Our tax rates going to raise a bit. Rather than being 39-ish percent, we think it\u2019s going to be around 40% and that raise is going to cost us a $0.01 and we dialed into the guidance the loss of a $0.01 from a higher tax rate.","Andrew Steinerman","So helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Ginocchio","Great, thank you. You came in at the top end of your guidance in the fourth quarter and this quarter, I think even adding back to weather, you\u2019d be a little bit below the midpoint. Is that because of perm or is there something else? Then second, if you could just -- the April growth rates you talked about, are those similar to what you saw in March or were they little bit better? And then finally just on the tax rate you just mentioned, is that 40% going forward, is it just for the quarter? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","So, clearly with Protiviti, having a much stronger quarter than expected, incrementally that helped dramatically to getting us pass the midpoint. I\u2019d say the single largest factor in why we were above midpoint was the strength in our temp gross margins for reasons that we talked about here already.","April growth rates versus March, I would say they\u2019re not significantly different. The first quarter is always back loaded to March, but that was also true the March a year ago. So, I\u2019m not sure there is a huge story in the April growth rates versus the March growth rates.","And the tax rate -- the tax rate is a little elusive kind of plus or minus one or two points, because it\u2019s the mix of your US, non-US and it\u2019s not only that but it\u2019s within the non-US, which countries, which tax rates, which credits. So, it moves around a bit on us, but our view is that it\u2019s going to be a bit higher next quarter and I think we gave guidance earlier that the full year rate would be in the 39% range, but whether it\u2019s 39% or 40%, that\u2019s probably about as close as we can pay it.","Paul Ginocchio","Keith, I\u2019m sorry, I think maybe I\u2019m calculating it wrong. I think on the revenue side, I should have made more clear, I think you can came in slightly below on the midpoint. I\u2019m just wondering why that was --.","Keith Waddell","Sure, sure, right, absolutely. So, we expected currency to be about $30 million year-over-year, about $10 million sequential and it came in $10 million more than that. So, the single biggest reason the revenues below the midpoint is currency impacts. At the bottom line, the currency only impacted us a $0.01 total. So, relative expectation, there isn\u2019t much difference at the EPS line due to currency but at the revenue line, the biggest single reason, we were below midpoint is currency.","Other than that, term was a little light that we talked about earlier, but overall, we were pleased that the single largest reconciling item is currency.","Paul Ginocchio","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer","Currency-adjusted bill rate growth continues to make a nice progress. Do you still think that the old barometers of where that bill rate growth has hit in the past are relevant as we look out over the next couple of years?","Keith Waddell","We do, we do. Clearly, we talked about mid-single digits is what you would typically see, mid-cycle for two, three years straight. We moved up from two to four over the last four quarters. So, we\u2019re certainly getting close to the sweet spot we would typically see in a fairly conducive macro environment and with those higher bill rates, inclusive in there is some margin expansion, which we\u2019re already beginning to see that we\u2019re very happy about.","Tobey Sommer","Would that temp to perm conversions drift towards the higher end of the historical range typically in those -- in that two to three year period with the bill rates are growing at mid-single digits?","Keith Waddell","So, we\u2019ve long said the range is 3% to 5%. We talked earlier that we\u2019re at 3.3%. So, we\u2019re still near the bottom. What we talk about for some time now is that if we can just get to the midpoint, which would be 4%, right, there is 70 basis points of margin improvement versus where we are today. So, in our minds, anything above 4% would be grabby, but even getting to that point, there is 70 basis points of margin improvement, which would put our temp margins at all-time highs.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you for your help.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes through the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. The technology vertical is performing particularly well on the temp side in a lot of the trends that you\u2019re seeing in March and April. Are there other verticals that are beginning to show a positive inflection in growth?","Keith Waddell","So, we have revenue acceleration for multiple quarters in a row now. I would say management the resources is also particularly strong. They partnered well with Protiviti on some larger projects that have been quite successful. We\u2019re optimistic about management resources. It is more project-driven, it is a little lumpier than our other temp divisions, but I\u2019m not sure talking inflection points captures where we are, given that our growth rates have accelerated for several quarters in a row that we feel good about and we feel good about the momentum that we have going into the second quarter.","George Tong","I guess other specific verticals where you see an outsized acceleration then in growth that might put those verticals on par with technology growth?","Keith Waddell","Well, Protiviti has outrun every division we\u2019ve had, including technology for several quarters and is expected to for the foreseeable future as well. Protiviti is doing very well across its line of business, be it internal audit, be it financial services risk and compliance, be it IT consulting, be it what we call enterprise solutions, where it teams with our staffing division and goes to market together.","So, I would say across our lines of business, it is true now and it has been true for the last couple of years quite frankly, Protiviti has been the strongest line of business that we\u2019ve had.","George Tong","Right. And how much of this growth would you say is coming from market share gains and how would you describe the competitive environment for Protiviti?","Keith Waddell","Well, it\u2019s hard to be precise about that answer. Cleary, the risk and compliance market overall is growing. There is no question with the regulation of the financial services industry. There are many opportunities for everybody that serves that market. Protiviti is largest competitors of the big four accounting firms. At a minimum, we\u2019re holding our own, the last time I checked, they weren't growing at the rates we're growing but whether you slice and dice their revenues for precisely the same services that we're offering, I'm not sure that's even available but what's clear is we're certainly not losing any market share.","George Tong","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, good afternoon, I'll ask one on Protiviti as well. Is there anymore color you can give on just the demand drivers, I know you've talked about all the major practice areas doing well, but what's driving just the massive acceleration you've had in the last two years, and is there any way to have a sense about like runway left in terms of these demand, are there any big pockets that you see that's potential for them to slow or do you feel like you're really into sweet spot and there is quite a bit more to go in terms of the strong growth? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Well, the good news is, that the demand drivers are diverse, it's internal audit, you got the PCAOB leaning on the outside accounting firms that companies aren't doing enough to document their control environment, test of control environment that's trickled down to internal audit departments, which is Protiviti sweet spot. Further in the risk and compliance area, you've got anti-money laundering which is a huge compliance issue for most banks and large financial institutions, you've got consent decrees. In the consumer lending area, we're doing a lot of portfolio, consumer lending portfolio analysis, as part of that practice. In IT, you've got security, you've got privacy, you've got ERP control reviews.","So all three of those areas have grown significantly in the last couple of years led by financial services, risk and compliance and quite frankly, we certainly don't see any near-term end to the regulation of financial institutions. And further, there is Tier 2 financial institutions beyond the Tier 1s that we're working with currently that would further give you some runway that you don't have with the Tier 1s.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, and then, how impactful has this concept of going to market Protiviti with staffing then and I guess, what's the sales pitch to a customer, is that the flexible labor component allows them to do this more cost efficiently or is it more about the skills that you're bringing to the table?","Keith Waddell","Well, its sum of each, every client has a different sense of how much they want to manage a project versus how much they want to outsource the management of that project. Some clients simply need supplemental staff, some clients need full outsourcing, and when Protiviti and staffing go to market together, that continuum, they can move the slider to any point in that continuum to match what the client needs and typically by blending in our staffing contractors as part of a team, sometime which is a significant component off of a team, the average labor cost of the package is typically lower than the average cost they would see from our competitors, which is usually the big four.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great and then one clean up one, do you happen to have the number of days you're expect in the back half of the year?","Keith Waddell","Sure, just a second. In quarter three, we\u2019re expecting 64.2 days, in quarter four, 62.3 days, which gives you 251.7 days for the year.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Randy Reece with Avondale Partners. Your line is open.","Randy Reece","Good afternoon. Have your views changed at all as to the timing of recovery of international business in any particular market just over the past three months?","Keith Waddell","Have our views changed generally or by any particular market? I would say, not (technical difficulty) I think grants has been stronger of late than we had expected or it had been performing and that's not a huge part of our business but it's clearly for the quarter just ended, it had the best year-over-year growth rate of any of our non-US operations in part because the comparisons were a little easier. But I would say, our views haven't changed dramatically, we certainly see broad-based improvement in Europe, our big operations there being Belgium, Germany, France, I just talked about. So we're optimistic, as we talked earlier, we're going to start investing more in perm placement that will be focused in the UK and in Germany but we feel good about non-US operations.","Randy Reece","And you're setting up some really difficult comparisons for Protiviti, I just, I was wondering if you could give my any help in trying to avoid making the mistake of growing that too fast, when we start comping over these numbers. They\u2019re huge numbers, and do you have any kind of conservatism take that I should be incorporating when forecasting beyond the next couple of quarters?","Keith Waddell","Well, clearly as you anniversary very tough numbers, it gets harder to maintain growth rates. Further, part of the margin lift they've gotten has been to get lower utilization or chargeability levels up to standard sustainable chargeability levels. Once you get at those sustainable levels, you're not going to have as much lift thereafter, because your utilization rates are about what they're going to continue at. So I would caution you to go crazy from a margin improvement standpoint, particularly as you look at progress we've had the last couple of years, you can't layer on similar progress as we move forward.","That said, we've always talked about double-digit full-year operating margins in Protiviti, the first quarter is usually our most challenged profitability quarter for Protiviti and we were at 9.9%, so we were almost there in the most challenged profitability quarter of the year. So we were extremely pleased with the quarter we had at Protiviti, they had their highest variable cost eliminate ever by using contractors from our staffing operations on their assignments. They had their most success ever with higher bill rates year-on-year, which were mid-single digit.","So the combination of the better rates, the combination of the more variable cost structure when seasonally, it's their slowest season of the year produced what were very good margins in what's typically their lowest margin quarter of the year. That said, the last thing we want you to do is dial up your expectations that everything rises in a straight line, but the facts are, Protiviti is doing very well; the demand drivers that have driven it the last four quarters are still very much intact.","Randy Reece","Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions; I now turn the call back to Mr. Messmer for closing remarks.","Max Messmer","Thanks to all of you, that was our last question; we appreciate your time and joining us on today's call, thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Max set a very high standard in leading Robert Half to where it is today and we\u2019re very grateful for everything he\u2019s done. Max and I worked together over this entire time period and I hope to continue his standard of excellence as we move forward. We are fortunate to have Max stay as Executive Chairman and remain involved in the growth and strategy of the company.","Joining me now in our quarterly calls is our newly appointed CFO, Michael Buckley. Mike is a 24-year veteran of Robert Half, originally from public accounting. Mike has served Robert Half in various roles including Controller, Vice President of Finance and most recently Chief Administrative Officer. He has led the finance and accounting function at Robert Half for many years.","Now let\u2019s review Robert Half fourth quarter 2019 financial results. Company-wide revenues were $1.537 billion up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2008 teamed on both a reported and as adjusted basis. Fourth quarter 2019 net income per share was $0.98 compared to $0.95 in the fourth quarter one year ago. This is a 4% increase year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $81 million in the fourth quarter and capital expenditures were $14 million. In December, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million.","We also repurchased approximately 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $59 million. We have 2.5 million shares available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan. We ended 2019 with continued strength in the US job market and solid demand for our professional staffing and consulting service. We were particularly pleased with how Protiviti performed during the quarter. A Robert Half technology and Robert Half management resources divisions also turned in solid results largely due to the ongoing talent shortages in the professional disciplines they serve. Return on invested capital for the company was 40% in the fourth quarter.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Buckley.","Mike Buckley","Thank you, Keith and hello, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to join you on the call today. Let\u2019s start with a closer look at revenues for the fourth quarter. As Keith had noted global revenues for $1.537 billion for the quarter this is up 4% in the fourth quarter one year ago on both reported and as adjusted basis. Also on an as adjusted basis, fourth quarter staffing revenues were up 2% year-over-year. US staffing revenues were $962 million up 3% on as adjusted basis. Non-US staffing revenues were $271 million down 1% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis.","We have 326 staffing locations worldwide including 87 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. In the fourth quarter, there were 61.7 billing days unchanged from the same quarter one year ago. The current first quarter had 63.1 billing days versus 62.2 days in the first quarter one year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the fourth quarter had the effective decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million [ph]. This decreased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by one half of one percentage point.","Now let\u2019s take a look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $304 million. $239 million off that is from business within the United States and $65 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as adjusted basis global fourth quarter Protiviti revenues were up 14% versus the year ago period. With US Protiviti revenues up 17% from the prior year. Non-US revenues were up 3% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effective decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.3 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve client through a network of 36 locations in 27 countries.","Now let\u2019s take a look at gross margins. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations gross margin was 38% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 38% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter one year ago. Our permanent placement revenues in the fourth quarter were 10.2% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the fourth quarter one year ago. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin overall staffing gross margin decreased 10 basis points compared to the year ago fourth quarter to 44.3%.","For Protiviti gross margin was $93 million in the fourth quarter or 30.4% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $80 million or 30.2% of Protiviti revenues. Company-wide SG&A cost were 31.6% of global revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 31.5% in the fourth quarter one year ago. Staffing SG&A costs were 35.2% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 34.5% in Q4, 2018.","The increase of staffing SG&A as percentage of revenue is a continuation of what we saw last quarter and is primarily the result of negative leverage from our non-US staffing operations. We ended 2019 with 11,500 full time internal staff in our staffing divisions up 3% from the prior year. Fourth quarter SG&A for Protiviti were 17.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.3% of revenues in the year ago period. We ended 2019 with 5,500 full time Protiviti employees and contractors up 17% from the prior year.","Company-wide operating income was $153 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin was 10%. Fourth quarter operating income for our staffing divisions was $113 million with an operating margin of 9.1%. Operating income for Protiviti in the fourth quarter $40 million with an operating margin of 13.3%. At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $833 million and implied day sales outstanding or DSO of 48.7 days.","Before we move on to first quarter guidance. Let\u2019s review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019 and thus far in January 2020 all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues up 2.1% versus the prior year compared to a 2.2% increase for the full quarter. Revenue for the first three weeks of January 2020 were up 3.2% compared to the same period one year ago.","Permanent placement revenues in December were down 3.7% compared to December 2018. This compares to a 0.9% increase for the fourth quarter. For the first four weeks in January permanent placement revenues were up 4% compared to the same period in 2019. As Keith has noted on prior calls, we provide this information so that you can insight into some of trends we saw during the fourth quarter and into January. But as you know these are very brief time periods, we caution against reading too much into that.","With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance. Revenues $1,515 billion to $1,580 billion. Income per share $0.90 to $0.96. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on an as adjusted basis including Protiviti. We limited our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Keith.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Mike. As Discussed at the start of the call Protiviti had a very strong fourth quarter. Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources also performed well largely because of intensifying labor shortages and technology disciplines and highly scaled accounting and finance specialties we serve.","On the last call, we talked about how the shortage of IT talent is negatively impacting companies trying to make technology enhancement particularly in digital space. This is also resulting in higher demand for our IT staffing solutions. In December, the US unemployment rate held at 3.5% until the last half of 2019 unemployment had not been that low in 50 years. [Indiscernible] skilled shortages remain a problem for employers. The US economy added 145,000 jobs in December. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index also improved in the fourth quarter moving from 85 in the prior quarter to 91.5. 63% of CEO\u2019s said they plan to expand their workforce in the year ahead up six points from the third quarter.","Our Protiviti teams are also reporting higher demand across all of their practice areas which run the gamut from internal audit to a wide range of business and technology consulting solutions. The collaboration between Protiviti and our staffing operations has become a key differentiator for us. Our unique ability to provide businesses with a full spectrum of staffing and consulting solutions under one roof makes us an attractive alternative to working with multiple service providers.","Customers demand more from companies today than ever before. Our investments in technology including enhancements to our website. Personalized job and candidate recommendation and our own mobile app allowed us to meet their changing expectations by offering more choice in how and when they work with us. These innovations paired with the expertise of our local staffing specialist are making it easier and faster to hire or be hired through Robert Half where the customers engage with us online or in person.","We feel very good about how the company has positioned right now. Our brand is the best recognized in the industry. Supported by over $1 billion in advertising over the last 25 years. Our business model continues to focus on professional level engagements at small and middle market companies\u2019 attractive areas of the market. Our people are among the most driven and tenured in the industry. Our senior field leaders average more than 20 years with Robert Half. Our technology tools are state-of-the-art and we continue to invest in digital transformation and finally Protiviti is performing well not only in its traditional consulting and solutions areas. But also as it goes to market together with our staffing professionals.","Now Mike and I\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up, if needed. If there\u2019s time we\u2019ll come back to you for additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon","Good afternoon, Keith, Mike and Max if you\u2019re listening. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the strong growth that you\u2019re seeing domestically in Protiviti and to what extent the momentum can be continued because it certainly seems like you went up against a pretty tough comp in the year ago period and still delivered the 16% total growth and clearly the blended workforce solutions is helpful. But it looks like you\u2019re expanding the number of areas of solutions that you\u2019re providing. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can give some context there and then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Keith Waddell","Sure. Protiviti is performing very well. It\u2019s at seven straight quarters of double-digit growth. It achieved an 11.3% operating margin for the year so we had double-digit growth and double-digit margins which we belong to talked about is the standard we\u2019ve set for Protiviti. Their growth and their strength is broad based, internal audit where IT audit is particularly strong. Technology consulting or cyber security and cloud, privacy or strong. FSI regulatory we\u2019ve long talked about anti-money laundering but they\u2019re also getting nice traction and consumer lending as well and then our joint solution which we call management business solutions and managed technology solutions. Where we combine such better expertise from Protiviti, scalable resources from staffing and that continues to do well. In fact the growth there has accelerated for several quarters at a row. The pipeline is strong they feel good going into 2020. The normal Q1 seasonality we expect to be pretty much like it\u2019s been in the past such that year-on-year when you look at our guidance, we pretty much see Protiviti staying at the same growth rates you saw in the fourth quarter, which is strong.","Mark Marcon","It\u2019s fantastic and can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in the international markets. If we look at firm and Protiviti, listening to some other professional services firms that are based in Europe it\u2019s not as surprised. But just wondering what you\u2019re seeing there and what we should think about with regards to some of the leveraging that you mentioned earlier in terms of how that\u2019s going to impact the near term.","Mike Buckley","So we have built into our guidance for the last few quarters and we continue for the coming quarter that would see some moderation of growth rates that has been the case. I say on the good news front Germany which is our largest non-US market their growth rates are still positive, low single-digit but positive. They held in the fourth quarter versus the third and the expectation is, they hold again in the first quarter so we\u2019re very pleased with how Germany is doing. The other strong spot outside the US would be Australia and that\u2019s on both the staffing and the Protiviti side. We do have negative growth in France, the UK, Belgium, Canada pretty much all of the other countries. But I would observe we\u2019re faring better than most of the industry is in that way, a large part because we\u2019re not near as exposed to manufacturing as is most to the industry.","Mark Marcon","Keith would you say that France in the UK were somewhat episodic either from the French pension strikes of the UK election?","Mike Buckley","It\u2019s hard to put causation precisely on what you describe \u2013 it clearly contributes to it. But hopefully those clear as the quarters progress particularly as Brexit hopefully the major disruption and uncertainty around that is behind us, but we\u2019ll see.","Mark Marcon","Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","So our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","My question is about the 3.2% growth rate in early January for temp and consulting reps. Just remind everybody I believe it\u2019s even though you say consulting that\u2019s without Protiviti. My question is really that\u2019s on a global basis, could you give us a sense of how the US did in January in temp revenues?","Keith Waddell","So you\u2019re correct the 3.2% is staffing only, it does not include anything for Protiviti. It is global. US is stronger. There is continuation of some negative growth outside the US. So if anything, if you look at the fourth quarter November was particularly strong. December was not as strong in part because there was a bigger holiday impact and we typically see. So we see January getting closer to what we have seen in November and I must say that the reentry points we saw, once we got past January 6, our field people are quite energetic and enthused about.","Andrew Steinerman","Right. Maybe just add to the question, why Keith? Why do you feel like US temp revenue growth picked up in January from December?","Keith Waddell","One factor is the comps get a little easier. That\u2019s not the total message. But there was clearly some holiday impact to December more so than we typically see. We talked about the Wednesday holidays on the last call. But we saw a broad based strong reentry point in January in US temp staffing which we\u2019re very pleased with.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Let me add my congratulations to Max. Keith [indiscernible] place of legend but if anybody is going to do, it\u2019s you. In terms of just really nice trends of Protiviti. I just wanted you to remind if we could be impact on management resources and just what percentage of that business is tied into Protiviti today and kind of and just how that\u2019s trended over I guess 2019, if you could.","Keith Waddell","Well first of all, the numbers you see externally for management resources include zero as it relates to Protiviti because all of the people management resources place on Protiviti engagements are reported as Protiviti, not management resources and in fact, if you look at Protiviti overall, 25%, 28% of their staff hours come from the staffing divisions collectively not just management resources and that\u2019s up versus with was a year ago, but that revenue gets reported as Protiviti. But in orders of magnitude about the quarter of the staff level resources in Protiviti come from staffing and we\u2019re delighted with that.","Kevin McVeigh","That brings a lot of flexibility and just real quick Keith. If you said it, I apologize. Just the tax rate in the first quarter and then what we should model for 2020.","Mike Buckley","So the tax rate that we expect in Q1 would be in the 26% to 27% range for the full year 2019, the tax rate was 27%. We expect the full year 2020 to be in a similar range say 27% to 28%.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013Jeff Silber","When you typically give your outlook for earnings per share, you typically give us a little bit of color on what kind of modules we should expect. So I just want to dig about through that right now. Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Sure, so let me provide context to that, a little bit from some commentary on the fourth quarter and then I\u2019ll segue into guidance from that. So in the fourth quarter on the temp side, it was pretty much as we expected with office team being a little lighter as opened enrollment didn\u2019t get to seasonal lift, we\u2019ve gotten in years past and we exited some low margin accounts. Our project divisions management resources and technology did very well and understand that\u2019s as much supply as it is demand because management resources and technology have access to career consultants, a broader talent ecosystem than do accounts temps and office team which pretty much deal with the traditional people between full time engagements. But once the holidays had a little more of an impact as I said earlier, Europe modestly continues encouraged that Germany appears to be bottoming.","Perm, demand remain strong. Holiday\u2019s even more impact to perm as both clients and candidates were not around to close deals. Biggest issue for perm, is we continue to lose candidates to counter offers from existing employers from multiple offers from outside, but demand there remains strong and that\u2019s continued into the first quarter and then getting to the first quarter 2020 guidance says, overall revenue is up 4%, consistent with Q4. Staffing would be 2% consistent with Q4. US strong. Europe continuing to decline modestly. Remain Germany strong as they offset. Protiviti growth rate stay pretty close to where they were in Q4 which was a strong double-digit, 14%.","Gross margin, year-over-year flat with last year plus or minus 10 to 20 basis points as we continue to pass through wage increases and our bill rate increased 5.2% in the fourth quarter versus a year ago and we would expect to see that trend into the first quarter. Protiviti still going back to guidance again Protiviti gross margins would be up 100 basis points plus or minus 20 as they get more leveraged from their outsized revenue growth. Staffing SG&A up 80 basis points, again relative to last year plus or minus 10 to 20 basis points.","We talked about \u2013 negative leverage, the tech spending that we ramped up starting a couple years ago. We\u2019re continuing at those levels. Protiviti SG&A versus the year ago up 50 basis points plus or minus 10 to 20 principally training and marketing as they add more people to support their growth which means that overall operating income, the percentage versus revenues would be down 80 basis points plus or minus so say in 10 to 20 range that we\u2019ve been talking about.","Tax rate is like [indiscernible] will be up [indiscernible] versus a year ago, we\u2019ll have fewer grandfathered non-deductible cost which drives up the rate and then the share counts in $114 million. All in all, we\u2019re pretty pleased with the US environment. How we\u2019re performing in the US environment and we\u2019re hopeful that things are going to bottom out in Europe and after that, now for the fourth time we\u2019re particularly encourage with Germany.","Q \u2013Jeff Silber","All right, well. It sounds like you were prepared for that question. I really appreciate that. I\u2019m sorry to ask this one. I just want to nitpick a little bit, but did you change the way that you calculate your full time internal staff. You finished 2019 with 11,500. I had my notes that you had something like 14,900 last year maybe I had the wrong number. But was there a different way of calculating at this year.","Keith Waddell","So yes, we did make a change and the change relates to the number of people that we have full time that are out on engagement and bill to clients. It\u2019s long been the case outside the United States and in some cases it\u2019s mandatory starting with Germany that the people you place on engagements are your full time employees. As you know in the technology staffing sector its long been the case that many of those consultants are full time to the staffing company and then they\u2019re put on their engagements from there. And so what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken from the full time number those that are actually billable on engagements and we\u2019ve reported an internal number, so whereas the prior distinction was full time versus temporary. The distinction we\u2019re now making is internal versus on engagement, which is a subtly different distinction. But the reason being that one of the strategies we have to deal with the candidate shortage as that we\u2019re beginning to put a single digit number of the people we have on billing on our full time payroll and then putting them on engagements because we believe our scale allows to do that and keep them highly utilized and further, we get to access the same pool of people for account temp, office team etc. that we are already getting to access for management resources in Robert Half Technology because that\u2019s a common way of doing business in those sectors.","So it\u2019s a long winded way of saying, yes we made a change and we made a change because it reflects that some of the people we have on billing are in fact our full time employees which has long been the case outside the United States, which has long been the case for a portion of our technology staffing and is more recently the case in accounting and finance.","Q \u2013Jeff Silber","Got it and the important thing is that on a like for like basis, it was up 3% year-over-year.","Keith Waddell","Correct the percentages are definitely more like for like basis.","Q \u2013Jeff Silber","All right, thank you so much for the clarity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","Just a question on, you kept the growth rate in temp. You\u2019re saying that it should be kind of similar to the fourth quarter. You\u2019re obviously getting pricing the comps are easing a little bit, is that an element of conservatism or are there, is the volume slipping a little bit more maybe you can help for exact gap?","Keith Waddell","Well we hope we\u2019re being conservative. We understand that our guidance is at the same growth rates at Q4 with easier compares, but understand the compares are easiest outside of the United States where there is more uncertainty as to how the quarter will play out, but we hope we have upside. We began the quarter strong than we exited the fourth quarter on top of that, we have easier comps, so hopefully we have some upside relative to what we forecast.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","Got it, thanks and then just on Protiviti. Like you mentioned in the last call, there were some kind of big contracts in the mix of the fourth quarter, maybe you can give some comment on how those progressed and I guess just generally the pipeline of Protiviti.","Keith Waddell","Well the pipeline is very strong and we feel great about that. As we talked last quarter, if you look at Protiviti international the growth went from 9% to 3% between quarters three and four and that\u2019s the deceleration, we talked about because they lost a couple big contracts that had [indiscernible] anniversary, so that was consistent with expectation. The good news is, we had more than enough acceleration in the US to more than cover that. But pipeline Protiviti very good and what\u2019s incredible about it, it\u2019s virtually every one of their solution areas and then the go to market with staffing is just gravy on top of that.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Gary Bisbee","So I guess, it\u2019s interesting when we look at your international. Obviously, you\u2019ve seen deceleration as one would expect, but the deceleration has been significantly after sort of the typical temp data in a lot of these countries outside the US turned down and I caught the comment last manufacturing and understand you have a very different mix. As part of the timing of the deceleration just that higher skilled professional tends to lag low skill and it gets to the extent that part of why things are weakening now, would it be reasonable to expect that reacceleration might lag sort of the reacceleration seen in some of those market at some point in the future. Thank you.","Keith Waddell","We\u2019ve been around over 30 years and at least the first half of that period there was clearly a theory out there that manufacturing led and that ultimately that made its way to the back office and then the back office is impacted later. I no longer buy into that theory. A; manufacturing is not near as larger percentage of the total as it once was and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any empirical data that would support in today\u2019s digital world and very intertwined supply chain. I think it happened much more quickly and pretty much coincidentally than it did 15 years ago and longer. So I believe that\u2019s more coincident. I don\u2019t think the principal reason why we were impacted later is because of the traditional manufacturing back office lag. I think it\u2019s impart which countries we\u2019re in, it\u2019s which markets, which disciplines within those countries, what investments have we made particularly in headcount, what\u2019s the quality of leadership which was quite good. I think it\u2019s way more company specific and specific in granular market exposures than it is the old general theme of back office lags manufacturing.","Q \u2013 Gary Bisbee","Okay thanks for that color and then, do you have on hand what you expect the number of work days and staffing to be for all for quarters of this year?","Keith Waddell","Yes, Mike will give you that.","Mike Buckley","Yes, so by quarter 63.1, quarter two, 63.4. Third quarter, 64.3. And in the fourth quarter, 6.17 for a total of 252.5 billing days for the year.","Q \u2013 Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Jasper Bibb","This is Jasper Bibb on for Toby. I was wondering what you\u2019re seeing with respect to pricing for Protiviti and also how you\u2019re thinking about high [indiscernible] in that segment?","Keith Waddell","So, the second part cut out, the high, what?","Q \u2013 Jasper Bibb","Hiring in Protiviti.","Keith Waddell","Okay, hiring. And so Protiviti clearly is having to pay its new staff more and it\u2019s impacted by wage inflation which it is successfully passing through as we talked earlier in the call. We\u2019re expecting 100 basis points improvement in gross margin year-over-year, so that\u2019s a good thing as to hiring two sources as I talked earlier about a quarter of their staff resources, they\u2019re sourcing from staffing on adjusting time basis and beyond that, they are very aggressive on campus. They have been forever that\u2019s how the big four grow their staff and Protiviti is right there with them and they\u2019ve got a very aggressive hiring program for 2020 in fact even more so than it was in 2019.","Q \u2013 Jasper Bibb","Thanks. Historically it seems there have been demand pauses due to election and tax uncertainty. So it\u2019s kind of \u2013 we\u2019re approaching new primary season, what extent do you think that might become a predominant factor in customer decision making again?","Keith Waddell","It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard to comment on political and tax uncertainty. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s risen to every day conversation yet at this point.","Q \u2013 Jasper Bibb","Appreciated. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","This is [indiscernible] for Seth tonight. I\u2019m sorry, if I missed it, but did you talk about Protiviti seems a little bit better than we expected in the fourth quarter, was staff utilization better or did something else drive that?","Keith Waddell","It\u2019s a combination of utilization inclusive of using contractors\u2019 source through staffing and I\u2019d say the biggest piece of upside is probably related to the number of people sourced through staffing which by definition have a 100% utilization which helps their margins.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","Okay, can you just talk about your CapEx expectations this year and any spend on technology and digital strategy?","Mike Buckley","So we finished 2019 with CapEx, $90 million for 2020 we\u2019re expecting a range of $100 million to $110 million with Q1 coming in the $20 million to $25 million. The increase in CapEx is largely the result of ongoing investments in technology and specifically new project to implement Workday financials globally. Our legacy financial system is 17 years old and off support and there\u2019s no [indiscernible] bring our financial systems up to date and out of the data center and into the cloud. In addition, we\u2019ve already transitioned to Workday HCM on global basis and this implementation will result in a full integration between these systems.","Keith Waddell","And then talking more generally digital transformation and technology strategy. We\u2019ve talked several quarters in a row, we\u2019re about providing a world class personalized digital experience for clients and candidates as focused on our websites that\u2019s focused on our mobile app, we continue to refine and improve our AI for our matching engines, we macro target recommendations to clients and candidates, we prioritize leads for our staff. The good news is, we\u2019re now starting to see quantifiable benefits. We\u2019ve seen a significant increase in traffic to our sites both in terms of candidate applications and client leads.","As importantly we\u2019ve also seen an improvement in the quality of those candidates because in many cases, they were pre-matched before we invited them to apply. Also I\u2019m very pleased with our field adoption of our technology tools and in fact, we\u2019re told by salesforce we\u2019re one of the top 10 users in the world of their software which is pretty impressive because we\u2019re certainly not one of the top 10 largest companies in the world. Our mobile app has gotten nice traction. It\u2019s currently 4.8 in the Apple app store. We\u2019ve gotten over 100,000 applications since we launched it in July and further we\u2019ve launched Robert Half Direct earlier last year it\u2019s our online hiring platform where our clients have direct access to a shortlist of candidates, it leverages our technology, it leverages our candidate database that\u2019s maintained by live recruiters around the world, we piloted that in a dozen offices, it extends traditionally our full service offerings to the sales service market. So we\u2019re upbeat about that as well. But the bottom-line is and the thing that\u2019s most encouraging to me, is that we\u2019re beginning to see quantifiable benefits of significance from the investments we\u2019ve made so far and we continue to make those investments.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","That\u2019s great. Thanks for all the detail.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] your next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 George Tong","You mentioned you\u2019re still seeing negative growth in France, UK, Belgium and Canada. Can you elaborate on client sentiment and sale cycles in those countries?","Keith Waddell","Sentiment and sales cycle. I\u2019d say sentiment hasn\u2019t changed much, it\u2019s guarded, it\u2019s cautious, it\u2019s measured and it\u2019s been that way for a while and we\u2019ve included that in the guidance that we\u2019ve given. On the flipside we\u2019ve talked about what appears to be a stabilization in Germany which is our largest non-US operation. But not a lot of change George from what we saw in the fourth quarter, if anything some stabilization in Germany.","Q \u2013 George Tong","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. This cycle has been previously characterized as on that\u2019s relatively supply constraint from a talent perspective. What evidence might you be seeing that suggest that there might be some give with demand as well?","Keith Waddell","Well as we\u2019ve talked about a couple of times on the call, demand is good. Unless if you ask me, what needs to happen for our growth rates to improve particularly in the United States. The first thing I would say is, we need more fee eligible candidates. If a client needs a person with 10 years\u2019 experience to the extent we have more people with 10 years\u2019 experience, our revenues are going to grow and in a nuanced way or our clients could have more urgency and that when we present a seven-year person to their 10-year requirement, they take the seven-year person. So, the combination of more fee eligible supply and or more client urgency would help us grow our revenues as I just talked about clearly our technology investments are helping less supply.","As we talked earlier, our approach to hire full time some of the people we put out on engagement should also help with supply. But to this point, we are not seeing particularly in the United States any moderation in demand, demand is strong. If we had more fee eligible candidates, we\u2019d report more revenue full stop.","Q \u2013 George Tong","Got it, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jeffries. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","This is Mario [indiscernible] filling in for Hamzah. This was actually one of the comments on the management team. Congratulations to both of you. But I also had a question about that as well. I just wanted to know, if you\u2019re thinking about any type of change in strategy or if you guys have discussed how you guys are approaching the business. And if you guys have done business almost the same way with slight changes to it over the past eight decade or so. That you just didn\u2019t know if there is a change in thought process or discussion that you guys have had about that?","Keith Waddell","The fact that I\u2019ve been here 33 years and Mike\u2019s been here 24 years and we\u2019ve both been very involved in the strategy and the execution of that for those periods of time. I don\u2019t think you can any expect any material changes because of the management\u2019s team.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","That\u2019s what I figured, I just wanted to ask. And then, on Protiviti. I just wanted to see if you can kind of frame for us, what the competitive environment looks like there and maybe share with us, whether or not you think you\u2019re gaining share?","Keith Waddell","Well Protiviti\u2019s principal competitors of the big four accounting firms and that\u2019s been true since day one in 2002. Gaining share, I don\u2019t think there is any question that our joint go-to-market with staffing is unique, differentiated and growing more quickly than the big four generally and the consulting market specifically because the big four doesn\u2019t break out their like for like solution similar to Protiviti\u2019s. It\u2019s hard to say, per se whether we\u2019re gaining share. But I can say overall the big four aren\u2019t growing at the same rates of Protiviti and I suspect that we\u2019re gaining share.","We\u2019ve always majored in internal audit and are known as such, more so than even the big four and we\u2019ve gotten tremendous traction in FSI regulatory consulting as I said earlier, we\u2019re extending the base of anti-money laundering into consumer lending where we\u2019ve gotten some very good engagements off late. Technology, security, privacy is a hot area where we are able to attract people into those practices\u2019 success. Breath success, we get all types of awards as an organization. We were just named for the 23rd straight year to Fortune\u2019s Most Admired list. We made Forbes Best Employers for Diversity. We made Bloomberg\u2019s Gender and Equality Index. We made the Human Rights Foundation for best places for LGBTQ equality that\u2019s just in the last couple of months. So, all of those help Protiviti attract and Robert Half generally to attract of the best and brightest which then propels their client satisfaction engagement growth.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Silver from CL King. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 David Silver","So, I\u2019m going to ask a question or two I think have been answered in part, but first thing I was going to ask was maybe about your staffing intent, your internal staffing needs for maybe the first quarter and the full year. But you talked about an aggressive plan to staff up the Protiviti. In the past, I guess your first quarter EPS has been affected by additional hiring and the time it takes to absorb that incremental overhead. How should we think about that maybe for your first quarter and the full year\u2019s the staffing as well as Protiviti? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","By and large, we try to match internal headcounts to top line growth and we just reported for the full year that was the case, 3% on the staffing side and double-digit on the Protiviti side and that would be our plan as we move forward. The principal issue sequentially for the first quarter is that Protiviti has a seasonality impact from your post Sarbanes Oxley compliance and post internal audit ramp up for year end which happens in the fourth quarter, so the following first quarter always is lower by 5% to 7% and I think our guidance has something similar to that for this year. so with that seasonal pattern, inclusive of all of their raises are effective Jan 1 which then take some time to absorb as well, the combination of those sequentially because of that seasonality we backup somewhat at the EPS line, but if you look year-on-year which effectively negates that, Protiviti is growing nicely and double-digit. But that seasonal impact we\u2019ve had for every year for 17 years we\u2019ve had Protiviti. It\u2019s very unexpected and very well managed and the fact that, 25% of their workforce hours come from staffing, makes their cost even more variable.","Q \u2013 David Silver","Okay, thanks. And then I have a question about the CapEx budget and there\u2019s a couple of parts to it, so I hope I get this out in an organized fashion. So, Mike highlighted and increase in budgeted CapEx for this year and if I understand his description correctly, it was focused on I guess improving the back-office reporting and administration side of your business. So, first question there would be, do you anticipate a year-over-year efficiency gain or cost reduction from updating what you said was a fairly outdated or older system. Second thing I would say, I wanted to know about CapEx, you mentioned a couple years ago the major IT investment you made, Keith about effusive as I\u2019ve ever heard you on this call today discussing the revenue generation potential of that two to three-year old investment.","So, what\u2019s the opportunity or what\u2019s the possibility Keith that you might be contemplating a step change in your digital capabilities and maybe kind of stage two development on the IT side to further enhance the efficiencies and opportunities that you first stage front office I\u2019ll call it, IT effort has generated. Thank you.","Keith Waddell","So, on the Workday financials front, I mean typically changing financial systems is efficiency\/cost reduction driven endeavour although I will say, we will be going from on premise to cloud and that should drive some cost reduction and some efficiency. But it\u2019s basically a new financial system, accounts payable, accounts receivable so it\u2019s accounting infrastructure if you will.","On the second point, as I look at our IT initiatives as we sit here today. Its more additional refinement of our AI, it\u2019s additional refinement of our recommendations, marketing, it\u2019s additional refinements of how we help the field generate and prioritize leads, thematically there\u2019s no one big thing that\u2019s going to be new to what we\u2019re already doing. But don\u2019t discount the benefit of the refinements we\u2019re talking because we\u2019re pretty much first generation of everything we\u2019ve already done. But again, the candidate sourcing benefits we\u2019re already seeing are very encouraging and, in the future, make us less dependent on third party sources for candidate for which we spend significant sums that would be plans in years following, we now continue to spend at those amounts.","Q \u2013 David Silver","All right, thanks for that appreciated.","Operator","And the last question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Mark Marcon","Just a quick question with regards to AB5. Are you seeing any sort of impact?","Keith Waddell","Well clearly Mark, AB5 for California which is independent contractors versus employee and other states have their own versions of it. Many clients throw their hands up and say, I don\u2019t understand it, I don\u2019t want to understand it. The easiest to way to deal with it, is to only use employees and not use independent contracts. It\u2019s early. There are a lot of exceptions already in that, there\u2019s a lot of flux about whether they\u2019re going to be valid initiative that change it. So, I would say, it\u2019s early. We haven\u2019t seen significant movement but we clearly have seen particularly with larger clients that rather than try to figure it out, they just say let\u2019s make this easy, we will not allow independent contractors which would be good for staffing firms generally enough specifically.","Q \u2013 Mark Marcon","Terrific, thank you.","Keith Waddell","Okay, so that was our last question.

Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half International; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We begin today's call with our customary reminder that comments made on this call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. They represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words, such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. While we believe those remarks to be reasonable, we do remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update statements made on today's call.","Now let's discuss the first quarter. Global revenues for the first quarter of 2013 were $1.02 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis.","Income per share was $0.40, up 18% from the first quarter 1 year ago.","Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $25 million, and capital expenditures were $8 million.","In February, we raised the company's cash dividend from $0.15 to $0.16 per share. The dividend was paid to shareholders on March 15 at a cost of $22 million. We also repurchased 800,000 RHI shares during the first quarter at a cost of $30 million. Approximately 10.6 million shares remain available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We were pleased with the company's overall performance in the first quarter. Demand for our professional services remains strongest in the United States, most notably in our permanent placement, information technology staffing and Protiviti operations. Despite softness in international markets, this is the 12th consecutive quarter in which net income and earnings per share have grown at least 15% or more on a year-over-year basis.","Now I'll turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our first quarter results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, a reported increase of 1% over last year and a 4% increase on a same-day constant currency basis. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 2% year-over-year, with the U.S. growing 6% and international staffing revenues declining 9% on this basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $677 million in the first quarter, while international staffing revenues were $230 million. We have 346 staffing locations worldwide, including 101 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S.","We calculated 62.2 billing days in the first quarter compared to 63.8 days in the last year's first quarter, the effect of which was a 2.5% decrease in reported year-over-year staffing growth rates. The current second quarter has 63.5 billing days. Currency exchange rates had no meaningful effect on reported first quarter 2013 staffing revenue.","A supplemental schedule accompanying our earnings release today shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as on a same-day constant currency basis. The schedule further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides additional information on certain revenue trends in our staffing operation. You will find this schedule in today's press release and in the Investor Center of our website.","First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $117 million, including $91 million in the United States and $26 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were up 14% globally, with U.S. revenues up 17% and non-U.S. revenues up 4%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 74 locations in 23 countries.","Now turning to gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 36.1% of applicable revenues. This was a 50 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2012. The improvement reflects continued strength in U.S. pay bill spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees.","Permanent placement revenues were 9.2% of overall staffing revenues for the quarter, slightly higher than the 9.1% of revenues reported 1 year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins previously discussed, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 40 basis points versus a year ago.","Protiviti's first quarter gross margin was $30 million or 25.7% of Protiviti revenues compared to $24 million or 23.1% of Protiviti revenues a year ago. This was an increase of $6 million or 26%.","Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. In the first quarter, our staffing SG&A costs were 32.5% of staffing revenues, up 10 basis points from the 32.4% reported a year ago. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 22.5% of Protiviti revenues. This is a 290 basis point improvement from the 25.4% reported last year.","Turning to operating income. First quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $86 million or 9.5% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $73 million in operating income for the quarter or 8.9% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $13 million or 15.1% of applicable revenues.","Protiviti's operating profit was $4 million in the first quarter or 3.2% of revenues compared to an operating loss of $2 million in the first quarter a year ago. This was Protiviti's best first quarter operating performance in 5 years.","Accounts receivable were $547 million at the end of the first quarter, with implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, of 48.7 days compared to 46.9 days at the end of the first quarter of 2012.","Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and, so far, in April. In the United States, the year-over-year growth rate for our temporary and consulting divisions accelerated in January, decelerated in February and remained constant in March. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rate for our permanent placement divisions accelerated in January, continued to accelerate in February then slowed modestly in March.","Outside the U.S., year-over-year staffing growth rates remained consistently negative throughout the quarter. For the first 2 weeks of April, revenues for our temporary and consulting operations were flat on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 4% and non-U.S. temporary and consulting revenues down 11%.","For the first 3 weeks of April, permanent placement revenues were also flat on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. perm revenues up 1% and non-U.S. perm revenues down 3%. We would remind you, however, that it's difficult to evaluate these trends over such short periods of time.","Taking this information into account, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion; income per share, $0.40 to $0.45. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. As previously noted, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, Robert Half Technology and Protiviti had particularly solid first quarters. We continue to see weaker staffing demand outside the United States, especially in Europe, where the economic climate remains uneven. Our U.S. permanent placement revenues grew 18% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis, but this growth was offset by revenue declines outside the United States.","Protiviti, our business and risk consulting subsidiary, had a particularly strong quarter, especially in the United States where first quarter revenues grew 17% year-over-year. In addition to internal audit and financial advisory services, strong consulting solutions for Protiviti included regulatory risk and compliance, as well as information technology application, controls and security.","When we look at the overall business climate right now and some of the trends we are seeing, we do remain confident. Even as general unemployment remains relatively high in the United States by historical standards, there is continued demand for professional-level talent. Our focus on higher skilled interim and full-time positions is benefiting us, particularly as skill shortages continue to surface in many areas of technology and accounting.","Businesses in many of our markets around the world continue to report a mismatch between the skills they're looking for and the qualifications job seekers possess. Our focus on small and mid-sized companies is serving us well right now. The latest ADP National Employment Report showed small and mid-sized companies continue to lead U.S. private sector job growth.","There is a continued need by companies for staffing flexibility. Since the end of the last recession, there has been a secular shift toward flexible staffing. Businesses learned the value of using temporary professionals as a way to keep labor costs variable and access skilled talent on demand. Percentage of temporary workers in the U.S. labor force is nearing an all-time high and is expected to rise.","Ongoing regulatory changes in the financial services industry and new healthcare legislation in the United States also may benefit our staffing divisions and Protiviti. Our businesses are performing well even as economic growth has remained muted in the United States and uneven globally. As noted earlier on this call, year-over-year growth rates and net income and earnings per share have exceeded 15% for 12 straight quarters now.","At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question, as usual, and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to ask -- in the U.S. about supply both on the accounting staffing side and the IT staffing side, I think, Max, you kind of phrased it as the economy remains muted. I wanted to know, do you fully expect your U.S. business to reaccelerate with the U.S. economy? Or are there any supply constraints that would make that less of a total correlation?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, Andrew, while there are some supply [ph] issues with certain positions in both accounting and with IT, we're confident that a re-acceleration with the U.S. economy we would participate in fully. We've had decades of experience recruiting in all types of economies and believe we would have access to the candidates that we need.","Harold Max Messmer","Yes. Andrew, the short answer to your question is, yes, we'd expect to participate. The surprising thing really is of how well the industry in general and we in particular have done given the high unemployment rates that exist today. I think if the economy were again to grow a little faster than it has been, we would expect to do very well indeed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I know you gave the numbers on the trends internationally. But can you just give us some color? I mean, are there any particular markets that worsened, and are there any that are showing some signs of stability? It sounded on the last call or 2 that you were getting gradually more confident that there are some signs of stability, but it sounds a little less so now.","M. Keith Waddell","I think that's fair. The Continental Europe generally was a little weaker than we expected. Germany, that had grown very nicely quarters prior, flattened out during the quarter. France and Belgium were a little more negative than we had expected. I think each of those economies, if you look at the macro, are in contraction, as we speak. So I'd say we're a little more bearish on Europe than we had been. With that said, it's certainly not in free fall. And same-day sequential, we were down 3% or so. And our guidance at the low end would contemplate we would take another step-down in those orders of magnitude.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, are there many signs of stability or any signs, I guess? Or is it kind of just broadly getting weaker?","M. Keith Waddell","Well -- and again, I'd say modestly weaker in Continental Europe. Australia, I would say, is flattish. So if anything, a little firmer than we talked about last quarter. On the Protiviti side, Japan is also showing signs of improvement, which is welcome, after many quarters of the opposite. But overall, the -- our non-U.S. operations were modestly weaker than we had expected.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And if I look at the guidance for the next quarter just from -- in that environment from a cost perspective, it -- just quickly trying to run the numbers, it seems like you might step back up some of the spending on SG&A. I mean, if I'm wrong, just tell me so. But I guess, just probably, what type of spending are you assuming in your guidance? Are you kind of holding expenses still tightly, or are you hiring out there in the field?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, it's not one-size-fits-all. And so, on the one hand, we're adding to staff in permanent placement in the U.S. and technology in the U.S., at Protiviti both with full-time staff and with contractors. On the other hand, outside the U.S., we'll continue to take our headcounts down pretty much with what we see the revenue's doing. So it's not a one-size-fits-all. We will add staff, as I said, in the United States in the areas which are continuing to grow nicely, which we were pleased with during the quarter. But other areas, we will not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Protiviti's gross margin was down 90 basis points last year, but it was up pretty impressively in the first quarter. I'm wondering is that better utilization given the strong revenue growth, or is there a bill rate increase in there as well?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, Protiviti performed better on multiple fronts. On the one hand, their revenues were stronger led by, as we spoke earlier, in the risk and compliance area, clearly with more enforcement actions, more consent decrees. There is work that results from that, particularly anti-money laundering, lending practices. They did well in the tech security and the tech applications controls areas. We had a little lift from the SharePoint acquisition that we did last quarter. Further, they managed their labor costs better both by using more contractors from our staffing organization, which made their costs more variable. As well, they did some things to contain -- better contain their internal costs as well. So all of those things put together, Protiviti certainly did better than our guidance would have anticipated.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And is that sustainable into the second quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Protiviti remains very optimistic about the second quarter. The pipeline is good. The types of projects that they were working on in the first quarter are continuing into the second. So Protiviti is quite optimistic about its prospects for the remainder of 2013.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, in the U.S., it looks like the temp staffing revenue grew a little bit more slowly than the BLS volume data for the U.S. overall. I'm wondering if there was any negative pressure on pricing or perhaps mix shift?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as to pricing, we can be more specific. Essentially, we're talking about up 1% year-over-year, up another 1% sequentially. So -- and that's global, by the way. U.S. is better, and those numbers were negatively impacted by the IZ [ph]. I think the other thing we would point out is in our accounting operations, particularly Accountemps and with Management Resources, there was a little bit of an impact from the foreclosure review projects that winded down to some extent during the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I would like to dig into Accountemps, if I could. Can you give us a sense for the geographic split there in terms of what percentage would be international versus domestic?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, generally speaking, our temp business is about 75-25. So typically, Management Resources is a little more non-U.S. than net average, and tech is a little less non-U.S. than net average. But generally speaking, it's 75-25. So that would be in the ballpark for Accountemps.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you talk about the areas that were softer and the areas that were -- that held up as it relates to Accountemps and what you're seeing there?","M. Keith Waddell","So the Accountemps was stronger in the accounting operations area, which are the staff accountant -- staff accounting roles, and it was a little softer in the kind of the mid-level positions within Accountemps. As I just mentioned, a little bit of the growth -- it's not a huge number, but a little bit of the growth was impacted by the foreclosure look-back [ph] projects that scaled back during the quarter.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Was that a material amount, or was that just a little bump? I guess, exclusive of that...","M. Keith Waddell","It's certainly not -- it's definitely not material overall. But when you're talking about impact on growth rates, I mean, it doesn't take huge numbers to impact growth rates.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sure. I guess, the question is with -- if we were to strip that out as we look at your U.S. growth rate in Accountemps, did that seem to hold steady, or was that showing -- or is that more consistent with the pattern of decline that we see in the overall?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, again, Accountemps is such a big piece of the overall. You can't divorce it from the overall pattern. And while foreclosure had a little bit of an impact on the growth rates, the overall pattern is still intact. The facts are our clients do remain cautious. While job order flow is steady, our clients are cautious. As we said last quarter, business is not great, but it's not bad.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And with regards to the commentary from U.S. client, any more chatter with regards to the Affordable Care Act or the impact that, that could end up having eventually?","M. Keith Waddell","Clearly, we've gotten even more inquiries from clients who seem to be more in a fact-finding and in analysis mode than in a take-action mode. As we stated last quarter, and we'll reiterate, we do plan to comply not only with the letter but the spirit of the law ourselves. That said, we will help our clients implement legitimate workforce strategies, ACA-related or not. We still think it's too early to estimate what actual new demand will be. But there's clearly ever-growing amounts of activity, particularly inquiries from clients. Since last quarter, we have again confirmed with third-party administrators and underwriters that we are going to be able to offer coverage probably on a self-insure basis. Many of our smaller competitors will probably struggle to offer coverage, either fully or self-insured. So we actually believe we could get some advantage just by being able to offer to our candidate base that some of our smaller competitors cannot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just as we look at the first couple of weeks of April, you talked about 4% growth in the U.S. in temp and consulting. I'm just wondering about Accountemps relative to that, if there's any major divergence. And then, was the slowdown in Management Resources related to the mortgage foreclosure that you talked about, or was there something else that drove that deceleration in the first quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, again, with Accountemps being such a big piece of the total, as to the post-quarter result, I mean, it is the biggest piece of that post-quarter result, so it's representative. As to Management Resources, it's the most non-U.S.-centric temp division we have. And in fact, the non-U.S. mix in Management Resources is very similar to non-U.S. perm, meaning it's around 40% of the total. And so, to the extent non-U.S. was more impacted than U.S., you see that more in MR than the other divisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to dig in a little more to the Protiviti margins. And I guess, this is obviously a great performance relative to the last few years, and it's always been the seasonally weakest quarter. What factors would lead this year to not play out on a seasonal basis with margins getting better from this starting point in a similar pattern to what they've done in the past? Is it just all about revenue growth, or are there other factors that maybe wouldn't allow it to increase as much as one might think it could?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, generally speaking, the seasonal pattern should play out. The only thing I would caution is that we are starting from a higher starting point in the first quarter than usual. So the incremental improvement might not be what it's been in the past. But that said, generally speaking, the seasonal pattern should continue. The first quarter is Protiviti's weakest quarter, and we're delighted to come out of the first quarter in Protiviti having made money, unlike the last 5 years.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And historically, you've commented that, in the right environment, you thought this business could get to double-digit, or I think, you even said essentially low-teens type margins at some point. Is that something that, if revenue continues on the trajectory of this quarter, that could happen fairly soon, or is that something that would likely take a couple of years to get to those type of levels?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as Protiviti U.S. revenues expand, so would their margins. And U.S.-only margins are -- have certainly been in the high-single digits even in the recent past. We -- our non-U.S. operations did improve this quarter as well modestly, but they are still a modest drag overall. And so, to get to the double-digit overall margins, not only do we have to see some continued improvement in the U.S., which we expect, but we've also got to continue to make progress outside the U.S. So I guess, I don't want to overhype how quickly they'll get to double-digit operating margins. And so, my general reaction would be to be conservative.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on any changes in the assignment link within the tech business, just get a sense for how people are planning their CapEx? And then, I'm wondering if you could comment about whether you're evaluating using a healthcare exchange as part of your self-insured offering relative to the Affordable Care Act?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. Assignment link in tech as it relates to CapEx. I would say this. We clearly made strides this quarter in tech at the higher end, the web developers, the application developers, which we focused on and invested in, in the past few quarters. So those do have longer duration. Those do have higher bill rates. Those do carry higher margins. So we were particularly pleased at the mix of our tech business this quarter. It's also one of the first times in years where we've had sequential growth in tech in the first quarter, so we were delighted by that, and it's largely due to the progress we made on the tech development side. As to whether we plan to use the exchanges for our self-insurance offering, the answer would be not initially. Clearly, the choices that will be made available to those that go to the public exchanges will be, to some degree, a blueprint for the choices you'd like to offer internationally through private exchanges. But early on, the thought is we will have a bronze-type plan that complies with ACA. We might have a plan that has lower benefits than bronze that's totally voluntary on the part of our temporary employees. That's still to be decided.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Condra with BMO Capital Markets.","Paul Condra","I just have one question about your international markets. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the competitive landscape there, just how you think about that as the markets are shrinking, how you think about maintaining your share there?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I'm not sure our market share has changed much. We've talked about in the U.K. how we've intentionally walked away from some business that's just been crazily priced as that market has contracted. But other than that, I'm not sure there's any competitive landscape change in the other countries, Germany, France, Belgium, that would be noteworthy.","Paul Condra","And what about when you think about acquisitions? Is that something that makes more sense internationally than domestically?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, we're always looking for situations that culturally are a fit. But those that culturally are a fit are typically the hardest to find. And whether they get easier to find in this kind of environment, typically, the ones that are most available during these kind of times are the ones you least want. So with that said, again, if it's a good cultural fit, similar to what we believed and what the early returns bear out, the 2 little deals we did in Protiviti in the last 6 months, we very much looked at cultural fit, and they met the bar, and we did the deals.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie Research.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Hey, Keith, it looks like some of the incremental step-up on the guidance from Q1 to Q2 revenue is about $10 million at the midpoint, but EPS is about $0.02. Is that just kind of -- what's driving that? Is it kind of bumping up against some of the taxes, pricing? Just any color on that.","M. Keith Waddell","Well, the -- we still have gross margin expansion year-over-year, quarter 2 versus a year ago. The tax rate we think will stay in the between $0.37, $0.38 as projected it would be for the quarter just ended, which we continued to believe would be the range for the quarter we're now in. No big change there. The first quarter was a short quarter, as we've talked about. So you didn't lever your SG&A on a percentage basis quite what you typically would. The second quarter is a little longer, 1.3 days or so. And therefore, you'll leverage your SG&A just a little lower because it's more of a typical link. So there's no major screaming changes or differences. If you look at the absolute level of our SG&A spending, frankly, it's been flat the last 3 quarters. Though we've been pretty vigilant at looking at our SG&A costs, and would continue to do so in this environment, with the exception of the areas that I talked about earlier. If it's growing, we're going to invest in it, and we're going to feed it. And that's our plan.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then, just as you think about kind of Management Resources as a feeder for Protiviti, can you kind of help us directionally what percentage of Protiviti is kind of non-venture-related now as opposed to where it's been in the past, and how much MR just directionally is sourced to Protiviti?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, without disclosing percentages, we are delighted at the percentage of Protiviti's workforce sourced through contractors, primarily through our Robert Half staffing operations. It is light years higher than it once was. So not only do they have a more variable cost structure for that reason, they've also done some creative things with their full-time staff that makes their cost more flexible quarter-to-quarter. So we've made major strides culturally, as well as financially, in integrating from a Protiviti point of view our staffing contractors.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And Keith, just to be clear, that's across Accountemps and MR, right?","M. Keith Waddell","It's across even more divisions than that. And clearly, Accountemps and MR are the largest, but let's not forget Robert Half Technology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Reece with Avondale Partners.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I was just trying to get a feel for how you were -- you manage in an environment like this where, for a protracted period of time, it's been pretty sideways, and that has to affect individual's abilities to hit their bonus targets and their motivation. And over time, do you shift how you manage people to your goals when things are just kind of tracking along sideways?","Harold Max Messmer","Well, Randy, we can both comment, but I'll make an observation. As you may recall, if you looked at our top roughly 200 field managers, we've calculated that they average over 17-years seniority. They've been through a lot of wars with us over the years and we're used to different economic circumstances, in which we have to operate. Many of the questions about Protiviti and its good results, Keith handled perfectly. All I would add is that Joe Tarantino and the other leaders at Protiviti are doing an outstanding job. So we have really good people, and they understand the situation with the economies. But I think we expect to take advantage. You have to remember, in tough economies, your smaller competitors always get hurt. Frankly, they're the first to go. The comments about Europe, it's not a lot different in Europe. I mean, a lot of the smaller firms struggle much more than the bigger ones. There may be acquisition opportunities that are more likely going to be opportunities to seize market share. If we get just a little bit of help from the economies in Europe, as well as the U.S., I would expect us to be in a perfect position to take advantage of that. So the short answer is, you manage carefully with a lot of attention to SG&A, but we're blessed to have a very seasoned team that understands what is necessary.","M. Keith Waddell","And the only thing I would add, Randy, is that, remember, they work in the labor markets every day. They understand the labor markets better than anybody on this call. And so, to the extent the markets are going sideways, they understand that, and their expectations are impacted accordingly.","Operator","We have one last question in the queue. Our last question is a follow-up from Gary Bisbee.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to ask you about the temp-to-perm conversions. I think you said they were up year-over-year again, and I'm pretty curious given some deceleration in the business and, certainly, deceleration in a lot of the overall economic data. What do you attribute that to? And how important has that been to the gross margin expansions over the last few quarters?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, year-over-year, it is up a little. Sequentially, it's about the same. But to just make a general comment about perm versus temp and conversions as a derivative of perm, so perm benefits from a lot of turnover-driven demand more so than temp would. Although if there is a part of temp that does benefit from turnover-derived demand, it would be in conversions. So generally speaking, perm is growing more quickly today than is temp. And if you look at the sources of that growth, on the perm side, it traces back more to -- or backfilling where there was turnover, be it forced turnover or voluntary turnover versus where our clients are investing in more heads [ph].","Operator","And it looks like we have another follow-up question. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Hey, Keith, while we're all together, could you just tell us what variables go into the difference between the low end of guidance, let's call it, the revenue guidance and the high end of revenue guidance? And where would April trends sort of track to within that guidance?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. So the low end of our guidance would assume some additional deceleration beyond what the early April trends are. So if you take your early April trends and you get more conservative, that gives you your low end. The high end assumes some acceleration from where we started the quarter. And we -- so we essentially bracket it, if you will, where we started in looking at the trend lines by line of business, by geography. But we did build in conservatism relative to how we started the quarter. Understand that, for the non-U.S. operations, the comps do start getting easier because it was second quarter a year ago, where they started decelerating with their own revenues, which now become the comps.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. And don't comps start getting easier for U.S. as well?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, they get -- they do get modestly easier, but the comps get easier for non-U.S. than they do for U.S.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I think you said expect SG&A dollars to be rather steady. But with a little more revenue, the percentage goes down in the second quarter guided versus the first quarter just actual, right?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, correct. And again, just having a normal length quarter gives you a little more leverage on the SG&A side.","Harold Max Messmer","Apparently, that was our last question. Keith and I would like to thank everyone again for joining us on today's call.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Our host for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half International; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Max Messmer","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that comments made on today's call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described some of these risks and uncertainties in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on this call.","Now let's discuss the second quarter. Global revenues for the second quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% from the second quarter of 2011. Income per share was $0.32, up 28% from the second quarter of last year. Net income and income per share this quarter were reduced by $8.1 million, or $0.06 per share, related to a nonrecurring litigation settlement and the resolution of certain tax matters disclosed in our July 5, 2012, 8-K filing.","Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $92 million. Capital expenditures were $14 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 per share at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1.5 million RHI shares for a total of $43 million. There are approximately 3.6 million shares still available under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","Demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services remains strong during the quarter, particularly in our U.S. staffing operations, which grew 17% versus the prior year. Gross margins continued to expand with an increasing mix of permanent placement and temp-to-hire conversion revenues.","Now I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell for a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thanks, Max. As you noted, second quarter revenues for the company were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% over last year, or an increase of 1% sequentially. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 13% year-over-year, with the U.S. growing 17% and international locations growing 3% on this basis.","U.S. staffing revenues were $672 million in the second quarter of this year, while international staffing revenues for the quarter were $246 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S.","We calculated 63.1 billing days in the second quarter compared to 63.3 days in last year's second quarter, and compared to 63.8 days in the first quarter of 2012. The lower number of billing days had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 0.4% in the second quarter. The current quarter has 63.2 billing days.","Currency exchange rates reduced second quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $5 million and second quarter year-over-year revenues by $22 million. This had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 2.4% in the second quarter.","Last quarter, we added a new supplemental schedule to the Investors' Center of our website at rhi.com. We have included a supplemental schedule again this quarter, both on our website and in our earnings press release. The schedule shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between the U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Their information is presented for each of the 5 previous quarters. We've provided this information because we believe it better reflects our actual growth rates and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This information is considered to be a non-GAAP financial matter -- measure. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates, also is available on our website.","Second quarter revenues for Protiviti were $110 million, including $83 million in the United States and $27 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 5% globally, with U.S. revenue up 10% and non-U.S. revenue down 8%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries.","Now let's look at gross margin. Second quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 35.8% of applicable revenues. This was an 80-basis-point increase over the second quarter of last year and a 20-basis-points increase from the first quarter of 2012. The quarter-to-quarter increase relates primarily to higher temp-to-hire conversions, while the year-over-year increase relates primarily to higher pay\/bill spreads. The most recent semiannual actuarial review of our workers' compensation reserves resulted in a second quarter credit of $400,000 compared to $1.3 million a year ago.","Perm placement revenue was 9.7% of staffing revenue for the quarter. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins previously discussed, this resulted in an 80-basis-point increase in overall staffing gross margin compared to last year's second quarter. Protiviti's second quarter gross margin was $29 million, 26.4% of Protiviti revenue compared to $28 million or 26.9% of revenue a year ago.","Turning to selling, general and administrative cost. In the second quarter, our SG&A, cost in staffing were 34.4% of staffing revenues, including the nonrecurring charge of 2.1% of revenues related to the previously mentioned litigation settlement. Absent this charge, SG&A would have improved by 170 basis points from the prior year.","Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 24.6% of revenue. This was a 140-basis-point improvement from the prior year. Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $70 million, or 7.6% of staffing revenues. This was reduced by 2.1% of revenues for the aforementioned litigation charge. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $52 million in operating income for the quarter, or 6.2% of applicable revenues.","Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million, or 20.6% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $2 million in the second quarter compared to $1 million in the second quarter a year ago. Accounts receivable were $532 million, with implied days outstanding of 47.1 days. This compares to 48.1 days at the end of the second quarter last year.","Now let's turn to third quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the second quarter and the first few weeks of July: on a same-day constant currency basis, for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, the year-over-year growth rates in April were about the same as March, then the growth rates gradually moderated in May and June; on a same-day constant currency basis for our permanent placement business, the year-over-year growth rates decelerated slightly in April, decelerated further in May and then were about the same in June as in May. During the first 2 weeks of July, revenues for our temporary and consulting businesses were up 8% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of July, permanent placement revenues were up 37% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution, however, it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short time periods.","Taking this information into account, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.36 to $0.41. It is our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance did not -- does not include any additional amounts for the settlement of outstanding legal claims.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. As noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad-based demand for our professional staffing and consulting services during the quarter. This is our eighth straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the company on a same-day constant currency basis. Our results were strongest domestically, both within our staffing operations and Protiviti. Our growth rates outside the United States were not as strong, owing in large measure to ongoing concerns over the European debt crisis. Our business has limited exposure to the hardest-hit countries in Europe, but we did feel some of the effects of a more cautious business environment and lower currency exchange rates in Europe and other parts of the world. We continue to aggressively manage non-U.S. operating costs.","We remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the temporary staffing industry in the United States. Since March 2010, when non-foreign payrolls reached their lowest point in the current cycle, 17% of U.S. jobs created have been temporary ones versus 8% in the comparable period in the prior cycle. We believe skilled temporary professionals are becoming a permanent part of the human resources mix for a growing number of businesses.","Our Protiviti business also had a solid quarter, particularly in the United States, as a result of higher demand for its consulting services. Among other areas, Protiviti is benefiting from growth in IT-related consulting services, as well as its consulting business that specializes in the financial services industry.","At this time, Keith and I are happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing in the U.S. I think in international markets, it's fairly obvious that the world is slowing down. But did you see any sort of deceleration in the U.S. over the course of the quarter in the temp areas? And then secondly, can you speak to how you're thinking about investing, given the choppy nature of the headlines in terms of SG&A throughout the world?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay, Mark. As to the U.S. trends, as we talked about in our formal remarks, there was a modest deceleration in our temp business in the U.S. as we went through the quarter. That deceleration continued post quarter, although we would caution that post quarter is heavily impacted by Fourth of July, which, as you know, this year, fell on a Wednesday. Many of our clients took the whole week off. And so we're a little suspicious that the post-quarter numbers were overly impacted by Fourth of July. But again, it's hard to know that for sure. As to investing, we will continue to invest in tech, both in the U.S. and in Germany. That continues to do quite well. And we'll also continue to invest in perm, consistent with the revenue gains that we see, but pretty much in line with the revenue gains that we see.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. And then just a clarification, the legal settlement, did that all fall into the temp SG&A?","M. Keith Waddell","The legal settlement is 100% in the temp SG&A. The pretax amount is $19 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes. I just want to ask about the perm margins, which were much better than I would have expected, given the slowdown. Just how aggressively did you pull back on that, I guess particularly internationally? And is the productivity levels there so high now that you'll have to start to invest in it to get future growth? Is there still productivity opportunity in that business?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, we did expand our perm margins nicely during the quarter, as you note. As we stated on the last call, we pulled back our headcounts in Europe, particularly in countries that were the most impacted. We're quite pleased with our ability to adjust our cost structure outside the U.S. during the quarter. We do not feel our perm margins are unsustainably high, and we'll continue to be vigilant with our headcount and our cost investments, particularly outside the U.S., with the exception of Germany as we go forward.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just a numbers question from me. The tax rate here, if I adjust out for that chart, it seems like it was maybe 41.5 on a more normalized basis, which is turning back up. Is that just the shift in earnings between the U.S. and international, so should we assume?","M. Keith Waddell","Right. That's precisely the case and go-forward assumption. Whereas before, we were 40 to down a bit, I would now say we're 40 to up a bit, let's call it 40 to 41.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Keith, did you say something about, when looking at flex gross margins sequentially, that was driven by temp-to-hire conversion year-over-year by spread? My question is, is there any pause in the company's pricing power? How is the kind of spread environment looking in the second quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","So the sequential improvement was conversions that, while improved by 20 basis points, are still at the low end of the traditional range. So we still feel like there's plenty of upside there. As to pricing power, we certainly don't see any pause in that. The actual bill rate changes for the quarter were 1.2% year-over-year, and that compares to 3.4% year-over-year last quarter. That decline is heavily impacted by non-U.S. operations. U.S. operations continue to get nice year-over-year bill rate increases.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And how will flex gross margin look going into the third quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Our modeling for our guidance, and we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a second, given the somewhat volatile nature of conversions or temp-to-hire conversions, our guidance has flattish flex gross margins, to use your term, embedded in it. Let's talk a little bit about guidance generally. While on a reported basis, the range which show growth rates of 3% to 8% between low and high, if you adjust that for currency and days, that would instead be 7% to 12%. The 12% being real close to the 13% we just reported for the second quarter, the 7% at the low end being just less than the post-quarter start we got, which we're hoping was July 4-impacted. The third quarter will be more impacted by currency and be more impacted by days than was the second quarter. As to currency, the biggest impact is in the euro. A year ago, the euro was $1.41. The current euro is at $1.21. We think the currency will probably have 3 growth-rate points impact in the third quarter. Further, on the days, we'll have 1 fewer day in the third quarter than the third quarter a year ago, which will impact the growth rate by 1.5 points. So whereas in the second quarter just ended, there was about a 3-point differential between reported growth and real growth, which is constant currency same-day. In the third quarter, we think there'll be a 4- or 5-point differential between the real growth and reported growth.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And just to make sure I got it, when you say flat flex gross margins, you meant sequential, right?","M. Keith Waddell","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn from Credit Suisse.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk in a bit more detail about the international trends. I heard you say the 3% growth, and I think you implied kind of how it progressed through the quarter. But can you give a little more color on how much it deteriorated as the quarter progressed? And are you assuming declines in the third quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","So first of all, let's talk a little bit about country composition. So our strongest country by leaps and bounds was Germany, which will be no surprise. And kind of in order, we still had positive growth in Australia, we still had positive growth in Canada. We were slightly negative in Belgium. We were a little more negative in France, and we were the most negative in the U.K, although I'll add that the U.K. had slightly more operating income than a year ago, notwithstanding the revenues for which we congratulate them. As to trends, if you look at our supplemental schedule and you look at the international trend lines, I think you can pretty easily see that it would not be unexpected to see the year-over-year growth rates in the international region to go negative during the quarter, and our guidance is assumed as such.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Can you took a bit more about the U.K. and, I guess, why that's so weak? Is it financial services-related? Or what's going on there?","Harold Max Messmer","Well, I'd say there's 2 things going on there. The industry has been more challenged there for a while. In addition to that, we've walked away from really low-margin business, which exacerbate the revenue change. But as I said, if you look at the operating income line, they're actually up year-over-year, and we're quite pleased with that.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Could I ask about SG&A? We can back into it from what you just said about gross margin. But just kind of higher level, should we expect that to actually start to decline, given some of the things you talked about or ratchet up over time over the next few quarters?","M. Keith Waddell","As a percent of revenue, given the range we gave for guidance, I wouldn't see it changing that much. If you look at the operating income line for staffing, the last few quarters have been 8%, 9%. We just did 9.7% adjusted for the charges. So we're quite pleased with the way our staffing operating income is progressing. And we would hope to stay on that trajectory, given particularly the top end of our guidance range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wanted to focus a little bit on the supply side of the market. I'm just wondering if any of your verticals or any of your geographies are starting to run up against any supply constraints?","M. Keith Waddell","I'd say, Jeff, clearly, technology would have the most supply issues. That said, I wouldn't put it in the chronic category. And if you'd look at the growth rates, I would not say it's overly growth-constraining. Generally speaking, the better candidates across our lines of business still get multiple offers. They still get counteroffers from their current employers, particularly on the perm side. So while there are pockets of supply issues by line of business, I don't think it rises overall that it's terribly growth-constraining. We see -- job order flow is remaining steady. We see demand remaining solid. We would say that clients are getting a little more methodical with their hiring processes. The hiring process is a little bit slower, the sales cycle is a little bit longer. We're seeing some deceleration in our growth rates, even in the U.S., but it's deceleration against very high growth rates. And the growth rates that remain, we're quite pleased with in this environment. And I'll make a further environmental issue. If you look at our revenues for this quarter when the unemployment rate was 8.2%, you have to go back to 2006 to find similar revenues. And at that time, the unemployment rate was 4.5%. So we're quite happy that we could return to revenue levels in the U.S. where unemployment rates were 4.5% versus today, where unemployment rates are 8.2%. The point being, if we can ever get those unemployment rates down to a more normal recovery level, we think we can do significantly better.","Harold Max Messmer","One other comment on the supply issue, the quality of candidates, as you might expect, is and has been for sometime extremely high. And that's a function, of course, of the overall unemployment rate. But subject to the exceptions Keith mentioned in certain areas, particularly technology, the quality of candidates is excellent.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, that's very helpful. If I can sneak in just a few numbers questions, what share count is embedded in your third quarter guidance? What should we be using for CapEx for the year? And then jumping ahead to the fourth quarter, I'm not asking you for guidance, but are there any billing days issues between 4Q 2012 and 4Q 2011?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay, share count won't change dramatically. Maybe it'll be down a touch as we continue to buy stock, which we've done consistently in the first couple of quarters. CapEx, we said 60 to 70 early in the year. I think, year-to-date, we're at 24, 25, say annualized, we're at 50. I think the 60-ish number is still probably very reasonable. So actually, I wouldn't change the range versus what we first gave you. As to billing days, Q4 '12, 62 days; Q4 '11, 61 days. So that day we lose in the third quarter, we get it back in the fourth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question about the health care reform. I know it's early and I know the elections could change everything, but I think there's something within the health care reform that if you have less than 50 employees, you're exempt from health reform or from the mandate. I just wondered what percentage of your clients have less than 50 clients? And do you think there could be a potential pickup in demand from those as they try to keep their headcount below 50 to stay below the mandate? And how much -- do you have -- maybe try to think about what the potential positive is for your business.","M. Keith Waddell","Well, while it's a theoretical potential positive, I mean, the sweet spot of our client size is more 75 to 100 employees rather than 50 or fewer. So while maybe some of that will happen in a good way, that's not something we've certainly dialed in. The 2 big issues on health care reform, Paul, would be how do you define full-time employees for purposes of who's eligible? And further, how do you define minimum essential coverage? And the Treasury Department's got some regulations out there that are out for comment. Those regulations aren't bad from the staffing industry's point of view. But how those regulations end up, nobody knows for sure at this time.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","As a follow-up on the gross margin attempt, it looks like the year-on-year growth wasn't as good in the second quarter as the first. I don't know if I missed it, but was there -- even adjusting for the workers' comp sort of differential this year versus last, the restatement or the add back, what was the driver there, if I missed it?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, clearly there's an international zone impact on gross margins overall. As I said, we progressed nicely in the U.S. versus the first quarter. But the international zone gross margins, not unexpectedly, took somewhat of a hit during the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on the perm growth that you saw in the first 2 weeks of July. 37% is pretty impressive, particularly given what you were seeing in the second quarter. I know that's highly variable, and 3 weeks is a short period of the quarter. But were you -- could you just talk about what you were seeing in the beginning of the quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as you know, perm is the most volatile week-to-week business we have. And to add to the irony of the post-quarter start, the international operations were stronger than U.S. and perm out of the gate. So while I don't want to totally discount the 37% growth, I wouldn't place a huge amount of weight in it.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then it looks like total office count was flat in the first half. Is there any possibility of office consolidation in Europe?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, we haven't changed our office count significantly in quite a number of years. Unlike other general staffing firms, we have many fewer, much larger locations. And for that reason, we tend not to open as many, nor do we tend to close as many. So I don't expect any significant office consolidations in Europe or anywhere else.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The question is on the Robert Half Technology business. It continues to be very strong growth, but it actually decelerated the growth rate, same-day constant currency growth rate versus last quarter, more than some of the other segments, given the strong demand and shortages and all of that. Is that just that it had been growing so quickly that it's a tougher comps issue? Or is there some softening within that business?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, it's primarily their tougher comps, because frankly, if you look sequentially, the first quarter versus the second quarter on a real basis, Technology actually had the highest growth rate, not the lowest. And so if you're looking a year ago, Technology was just knocking the cover off the ball with the growth rates, which made for much tougher comparisons. But actually, in the second quarter just ended, our Technology divisions had the highest sequential growth rates.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair point. And then I just wanted to probe. Given that you continue to put up such strong results and the stock really doesn\u2019t do a lot, do you ever consider being more aggressive with share repurchases given how strong the balance sheet is? Or you're very comfortable with the sort of consistent pace with which you've been pursuing that strategy over the last year or so?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I think history would say that we're comfortable with our consistent pace, the dollar cost average. So for the first 6 months of the year, our free cash flow was $86 million. Of that, we paid $42 million in dividends, and our repurchases were $73 million. So we're actually a little ahead of our cash flow, which is kind of our stated goal over time to spend our cash flow on dividends and repurchases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just give us an update on the regulatory front? There's obviously been a number of changes with government in Europe. Anything that we should be keeping our eyes out for?","M. Keith Waddell","Nothing comes to mind in the U.S. There's been further discussion of IFRS. I think most pundits believe it's going to be a standard-by-standard adoption\/endorsement, such that there's not going to be the big bang, one date, everybody has to convert, but instead it's going to be a standard-by-standard conversion over time when -- I actually think that'd be preferable. There's talk about mandatory audit rotation. There's talk about separation in Europe between external\/internal audit. I mean, there are a lot of things in the year. I don't see anything that's going to have a huge short-term impact. We are starting to get a little more traction in Protiviti on Dodd-Frank. We actually have a couple of pretty significant Dodd-Frank readiness engagements with some of Protiviti's larger financial institutions. So that's nice to see. But that's about it on the regulatory front. We talked about health care earlier, obviously.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. And then just following up on Protiviti, obviously, results are improving there. How should we think about kind of the operating income and trajectory there?","M. Keith Waddell","So the results are improving. They improved both in the U.S., and they actually improved a little bit non-U.S. year-over-year. Quarter 3, particularly in the U.S., is usually Protiviti's strongest quarter, but quarter 3 outside the U.S. is impacted by August vacation holiday periods. But generally, quarter 3 is when Protiviti has its strongest operating margins of the year. We've talked before, our long-term objective, which we remain optimistic about is that Protiviti can have consolidated double-digit margins. We're not there yet, but we're pleased with the U.S. margins, which are expanding, and we think will expand further. And we're starting to see a little light at the end of the tunnel outside the U.S. That said, the market conditions in Europe aren't exactly the best they've ever been.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Samford from Citigroup.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to touch on -- I think you mentioned that the bill rates spread in the U.S. were strong. Any color on what's going on, on the European side?","M. Keith Waddell","Clearly, there are more market challenges in Europe, other than Germany, than are the case in the United States. And you see some compression of pay\/bill spreads. That was to be expected. We modeled it in. We expect a little more in the quarter that we're in. So I don't think there's anything there out of what you would expect, given the market conditions.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And any other sort of competitive dynamics that are taking place in any of the particular countries?","M. Keith Waddell","Competitive dynamics? There's no real changes in competitive dynamics of note. Again, we're doing extremely well in Germany, not only in accounting finance, but in technology as well. We're very bullish on Germany. We continue to invest in headcount in Germany. Germany is very profitable. The margins in Germany approach the margins in the United States, which we're very pleased with. So we couldn't say more good things about Germany. But competitively, I'm not sure the landscape's changed enough to comment on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Within the Technology business, I was wondering if you had domestic rates of growth for the staffing business? And if you could comment about whether the perm trends had a variance from the overall perm growth rates that you've described?","M. Keith Waddell","So far as domestic growth rates for staffing technology, so we don't break out line of business between U.S. and non-U.S. The biggest non-U.S. tech operation we have is in Germany. So it's doing well and ramping up as we speak. As to perm versus temp in tech, perm actually is doing a little better than temp, but they're both doing well. And we talked last time that perm tech is 18% to 20% of perm overall. So it's a little larger portion of the perm business than temp tech is of the temp business.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Even though you don't describe the segment growth rates between global and domestic, is it fair, based on the rates of sequential growth and year-over-year growth that you've described for the tech business, that the domestic piece must have been somehow above average?","M. Keith Waddell","Above average. So on a sequential basis, tech grew the fastest of any of our lines of business. On a year-over-year basis, it was within 10 basis points of being the fastest there as well. So I don't think -- I mean, I can state -- as supported by the schedules that we put out there, the tech is the strongest part of our business, which is not surprising given the investments we've made.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Could you describe what your plans are for increasing recruiter staff? And any color you could give us across the different segments will be great.","M. Keith Waddell","So as to additions to staff, the general answer that applies to virtually all lines of business is that we expect to invest proportionate to what we expect the revenues to grow by. Where we don't expect the revenues to grow, which is some of the European countries, we would be in a headcount reduction mode. Where we do expect growth, we would expect to add heads at no greater rate than what we expect revenues to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Keith, can you just remind us, in terms of international, what percentage is kind of Germany versus Australia versus Canada versus Belgium today in terms of overall contribution?","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. And so actually, I'll read these off to you, but you can also go to our website, under our investor slides, and we have a couple of slides that has this data. So of the total 28% that's international, 13% of that's Europe, 6% is Canada, 5% is Asia-Pacific and 4% is the U.K. And that further, if you look at Europe, that 13% breaks down to: 5% is Belgium, 4% is Germany, 3% is France and 1% is all other. But again, go to our website, go to the investor slides, and we have slides there that break out what I just told you.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","That's helpful. And then just -- can you remind us, I know there's been a lot of investment on the IT side. In terms of perm overall, how much of the perm is IT placement now versus traditional FNA? [ph]","M. Keith Waddell","So perm tech is 18% to 20% of perm overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Janesky from Avondale Partners.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Can you let us know what your clients in Europe, particularly, are kind of signaling down the road? So for example, should we assume that the growth rate, even past the third quarter, is going to be impacted for some time to come? Or do you have any sense when that could snap back?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as you know, perm is the most volatile and hardest to read trends. The fact that perm is still positive, and in fact, even outside the U.S., as our supplemental schedule shows, grew twice as fast as temp for the quarter ended, I would say we're pleased by -- do we expect that to moderate more? Yes we do. Is it in free fall? Absolutely not. Are our people more bullish than our overall guidance? They are indeed. So again, there's no steep cliff on the horizon that our people see or we see, but further deceleration just seems to be a prudent assumption on our part. And if you look at the trend line, the last several quarters on the supplemental sheet we've given you, you see that the rates of growth have decelerated. But they're still positive, and they're actually greater than they are on the temp side.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And Keith, did you say that if we take the litigation settlement or add it back pretax to operating profit, that the temp operating profit was 9.7% of revenues?","M. Keith Waddell","I believe it's the overall staffing operating profit is 9.7%. The temp, unadjusted, is 6.2%; adjusted, is 8.5%, which is an improvement over the last many quarters on the temp side and overall.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And then final numbers question. Stock compensation in the quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Stock comp, just a second here, is $12 million. Yes, $12 million.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Jennifer Huang from UBS.","Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think, last quarter, you mentioned you were in the process of passing through SUTA increases. I was just wondering how those have been going, whether or not now they're from [indiscernible] pass through?","M. Keith Waddell","Yes. And the SUTA increases that we talked about last quarter were expected to be 30 basis points over 2011. When all was said and done and when all the states reported, they actually ended up a little bit less than that. But at this point, we're very pleased that we've passed through the SUTA increases, and we don't have that headwind the rest of the year.","Harold Max Messmer","That's all the time we have today.

Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Messmer","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. As is our custom, I would like to remind you there are comments on the call today that contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.","For your information, our prepared remarks also are available on our website at roberthalf.com. From the About Us tab, go to our Investor Center, where you will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link.","Let's review our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly revenues were $1.287 billion, down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis and down 1% on a reported basis from the first quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.62. Cash flow from operations was $124 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were $10 million.","We returned $31 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We raised the cash dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share in February. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $54 million during the quarter. We have 5.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We were pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, particularly our international staffing operations and Protiviti. While the U.S. economic environment is largely stable and the job market is strong, the hiring cycle remains uncharacteristically long as employers take more time to make hiring decisions. Recent reports show a noticeable improvement in optimism about economic prospects which should shorten the hiring cycle and benefit our business. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the first quarter. ","I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As just noted, global revenues were $1.287 billion in the first quarter. This is down 1% from the first quarter of 2016 on a reported basis and down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.","Revenues for our staffing businesses were down 3% in the first quarter on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $858 million in the first quarter, down 6% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $233 million, up 9% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The first quarter had 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter of 2016. The second quarter has 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of last year. ","Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. ","Currency exchange rates have the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the first quarter which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.5%. ","First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $196 million, with $165 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. ","U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 4% from the prior year on a same-day basis and non-U.S. revenues were up 7%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.6%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. ","Gross margin. Now let's talk about gross margin in the first quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay\/bill spreads. ","Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of a consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2017 which is flat on a percentage basis compared to last year's first quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.3%.","First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 27.0% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $51 million or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. ","Staffing selling, general and administrative costs were 33.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.4% in the previous year's first quarter. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.4% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.","Operating income for our staffing divisions was $109 million in the first quarter, down 9% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.0%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 8% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.2%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the first quarter, down 15% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.7%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million, an increase of 16% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 8.6%.","At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $700 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.5 days.","Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency. ","First quarter revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, while negative, gradually improved during the quarter, led by our international operations. We exited the quarter with March down 2.2% versus the prior year compared to a 2.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first week of April was negative 2.5% compared to the prior year. ","First quarter global permanent placement revenue growth rates which were also negative, also improved during the quarter both in the U.S. and internationally. March revenues were up 3.3% versus last year compared to a 3.1% decline reported for the full quarter. For the first 2 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were down 5.2% compared to the same period last year. ","This information is designed to provide you with insight into the trends we saw during the first quarter in April. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.","With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance, revenues, $1,275,000,000 to $1,335,000,000; income per share, $0.61 to $0.67. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 3% on a reported basis and 1% adjusted for days and currency and an EPS decline of just under 10%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. ","Now I'll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold Messmer","Thank you, Keith. Moderate U.S. economic growth in the range of 1.9% to 2.3% is forecast for 2017. Notwithstanding the slower first quarter start, 1.4% GDP growth according to The Wall Street Journal's monthly economic forecasting survey; recent data from several sources, including the NFIB, PMI Services Activity Index and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, all point to a more upbeat business outlook. We believe the wait-and-see approach to hiring that has affected our results to date should fade as economic optimism grows. ","As labor markets continue to tighten, particularly for our professional occupations, we will benefit from our decades of experience helping clients find the right candidates even amid talent shortages. Outside the U.S., we're encouraged by the opportunities afforded by improving economic conditions, particularly in Continental Europe. ","A final note about Protiviti which had another strong quarter. Protiviti has been broadening its practice areas and now serves clients in a wide range of consulting areas. These include business performance improvement, data management and advanced analytics, digital transformation, forensics, technology consulting, internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance and transaction services. We could not be more pleased with the evolution of this business and its strong performance. ","At this time, Keith and I will be happy to try to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank.","Kevin McVeigh","Keith and Max, it feels like we're kind of starting to find the bottom here, particularly given the implied revenue. But wanted to understand kind of if you look at the revenue guidance relative to the earnings, it seems like there's a little more deceleration on the EPS line. Keith, is that a higher tax rate? Or are there anything else to maybe factor in that dampened the EPS relative to what the revenue would imply?","Keith Waddell","Well, the tax rate is higher. We did benefit in the first quarter from about $0.01 a share with the new accounting for stock compensation and the tax effects thereof. So whereas the rate was 37.5% for the first quarter, we're projecting that to go up to about 38.5% in the second quarter. So that's some of it. But if you look at the profitability of the revenue guidance for the second quarter versus the profitability of the revenue guidance for the first quarter, I think you would conclude it's actually a little more profitable because you've got revenue mix favoring per placement which seasonally has its best quarter in the second quarter. You also have revenue mix favoring Protiviti which typically does better, margin-wise, in the second quarter than the first.","Seasonally, accounting and finance generally in the second quarter is flattish because you've got traditional accounting busy season, ending, companies file their Ks, their proxy statements. The private companies file their financial statements with their bankers. So accounting and finance generally in the second quarter treads water, but you get some mixed benefit from perm and from Protiviti. I also need to add we lose a day in the second quarter. So you'll get some negative leverage from that. The Easter a year ago fell in the first quarter. Easter this year falls in the second quarter. So whereas typically, you get an extra day in the second quarter sequentially, this year, we actually lose a piece of a day.","And then year-on-year, we lose almost a full day. So in the guidance we told you, there was a -- there's a 2-point swing between reported and same-day, constant-currency implied revenues where you lose a percentage point for billing days and you lose another percentage point for currency which is principally U.K. Brexit driven.","Kevin McVeigh","Is there any way to think about what the EPS impact to that is, Keith, to those 2 points?","Keith Waddell","That kind of gets into levering SG&A, but currency typically doesn't have that much EPS impact when all is said and done, but billing days certainly do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark Marcon","I was wondering with regards to your prepared remarks on the guidance, it sounds like both in the U.S. and internationally, perm got gradually improved during the quarter. On the temp side, you mentioned the international operations gradually improving during the quarter. Wondering if you could give some color in terms of what you saw in the U.S. on the temp side. Was there any sign of gradual improvement? So I'll start there.","Keith Waddell","So let me try to be precise. So if you simply look at revenues per day, in the U.S., temp, they got gradually better even in the U.S., February versus January, March versus February. When you look at year-over-year growth rates for temp U.S., they were pretty constant. So on an absolute basis, we did see improvement in March in temp in the U.S. and we certainly saw improvement non-U.S. both in terms of year-over-year rates as well as absolutely. So I want to be clear that temp U.S., March, on an absolute basis per day, was better than January and February. Just when you compare it to a year ago, the growth rate for us was about the same. For perm, March was better not only on an absolute basis, but it was better year-on-year as well. We had a very good perm March month. January was a little weak. ","So March, to some degree, offset January weakness. But we were very pleased with March, particularly in perm, U.S. and non-U.S. When we did our guidance, we took the full quarter average. As it worked out, we do a buildup from the bottom when we do our guidance. But when you look at the result, they're slightly better than first quarter average, about 1% on a per day basis. We did not dial in March improvement into our second quarter guidance. We hope that's being conservative. So our guidance is a little stronger than the first quarter average, but it is not as strong as March was, temp or perm.","Mark Marcon","Got it. And I mean, typically seasonally, you would see a little bit of improvement in March relative to February, would you not? And then obviously, as the year builds, you continue to typically see some improvement, wouldn't you?","Keith Waddell","You would, but typical hasn't been our friend for a while. So I'm not sure what typical even means particularly when you're talking sequentially.","Mark Marcon","Got it. And then with regard -- I mean, are -- you do cite some economic optimism creeping in. Are you seeing any signs of a shortening with regards to how long employers are evaluating your candidates? Is there any sort of speeding up with regards to pulling the trigger at all?","Keith Waddell","Well, we would conclude that March, some of the March improvement would reflect just that. But again, generally, our guidance for the second quarter is more of the same but a little better and hopefully with some upside if March continue -- March levels of activity continue into the second quarter. Now the post-March results we had, we only had 1 week of temp and we had 1.5 weeks of perm. So they don't mean much.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then this Management Resources, that was really strong. Is that related to the strength that you saw in Protiviti? Or are there any special projects?","Keith Waddell","A couple of points. I'd say, a, generally speaking, the higher the skill level, the better the performance across accounting and finance. So that favors Management Resources. And also, remember Management Resources is about 30% non-U.S. versus temp overall that's more like 20% non-U.S. And so Management Resources benefit from a stronger European macro more so than the other temp divisions. So it's a combination.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Keith, could you talk about bill rate increases? And you mentioned kind of opening up the spread in the quarter and talk a little bit more about that dynamic here in the quarter.","Keith Waddell","So bill rates were up 3.7% year-on-year. That compares to 3.6% last quarter. Conversions as well were up. I think it was 20 basis points sequentially from 2.9% to 3.1%. But year-on-year, I think they're down 10 basis points. So conversion sequentially were a little better which is consistent with perm being a little better. But when you put the gross margin package together, net, it's better. Part of that is bill rate growth exceeded wage rate growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Silber","Just wanted to focus on Robert Half Technology. If you look on a same billing day and constant-currency basis, trends continue to worsen a bit in the quarter. Is there something specific going on in that unit that's different than the other units you manage?","Keith Waddell","Well, clearly, Robert Half Technology, as we've gotten more into the development space is more project-driven. Our middle-market companies are very agile. While they start projects more quickly, they also end projects more quickly. And so this wait-and-see attitude that we've talked about generally would apply to technology as well. So we've just seen reluctance to get new tech projects started and that has impacted our growth rates disproportionately in tech more so than in accounting and finance that, across the board, is isn't as project-driven as is tech.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, fair enough. And just a few numbers questions specifically on the guidance. What gross margin and share count are embedded in your second quarter guidance? And what should we be modeling for capital spending for the rest of the year?","Keith Waddell","Okay. So gross margin, we think our guidance says flat to down 10 basis points, but because in the second quarter, we always get the workers' comp evaluation by third parties, a year ago, I think the number was about $1.5 million credit we had. We never build that into guidance. So when you're comparing this year to last year, last year had the workers' comp credit. This year's guidance does not. Adjusted for that, the gross margins stay at the high levels they were at the first quarter. Share count is a continuation or gets the benefit of the repurchases we did during the quarter.","So I think it's in the 1 25 5 neighborhood that we use for share count. CapEx in the quarter were $10 million. I think we're expecting $11 million to $12 million in the second quarter. For the full year, our estimate is around $60 million which is a little less than we thought it would be last quarter. And that $60 million is down from $80 million a year ago as we don't have the Salesforce CRM. We don't have the Protiviti project management business -- project management software upgrade that we spent heavily on in 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anj Singh with Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","First off, I was hoping you could touch on your growth at Q1 versus what the BLS temp headcount growth shows. It seems like your business still is decelerating and the BLS is showing an acceleration versus the Q4 trends. I realize there is mix differences, but would appreciate your thoughts on why overall temp headcount may be accelerating but it's not really manifesting in your results. Is it something due to the verticals? Is it the client profile? Just any thoughts there.","Keith Waddell","Well, first of all, the BLS data is very blue collar, manufacturing, light industrial driven which we have virtually zero exposure to. I'd say second of all, there's never been a large correlation between what happens with BLS data then what happens with our data. Third, I would say on a constant-currency basis, for the second quarter of the midpoint of our guidance, the deceleration -- let me say this. Between first quarter and second quarter, it's less negative and it's only 1% negative. So if we do the midpoint of our second quarter guidance, it would seem the bottom, the inflection point occurred in the first quarter of '17 so that we're hopeful that that's as bad as it's going to get and the growth rates are slightly less negative in the second quarter. And we're hopeful that they turn in the other direction. But correlating us and BLS has always been perilous and that hasn't changed.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay. And at the risk of making another comparison with BLS, if we had to talk about sort of the tightness of the labor market, it seems like per the BLS data, unemployment continues to tick lower although participation rates have also crept up. So I was hoping for your current sense of the supply of the labor market. Is the tightness the same level? Has it moderated at all? Just would appreciate you running us through the puts and takes there.","Keith Waddell","Well, I'd say there's not a lot of change in tightness. Generally, it is tight. The unemployment rate that gets all the headlines is the U3 unemployment rate. If you look at broader rates, U5 would include those not looking for work. U6 would include those that would -- that are working part-time that want full-time. Those broader measures of unemployment are much higher and not as sanguine as is the case with the U3 rate. So while supply has tightened a bit, it hasn't changed that much. And if you look at more broadly, the other broader measures of unemployment, I think it paints a little different picture than just looking at U3 which is the rate that makes all the headlines.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Timothy McHugh","I guess just maybe a different tone to the last question, but worrying less about the BLS. I guess as you look at the results, do you attribute it to the -- just the market trends? We've talked a lot about that. Are there any parts of the business you look and say they're not performing up to what you think or there's operational things you would change or could be executing better with as we think about each piece of the business?","Keith Waddell","Well, so you always look internally, Tim, as to what can we do better than we can always do better. But as we look around particularly with companies focused on middle-market companies, not those focused on the Fortune 100 or the Fortune 1000, but when we look at companies focused on our-sized clients, we don't think we're losing market share. And therefore, we would -- we do not believe it's an internal operational issue. If anything, we bore down even more with our internal activity levels that traditionally generate leads, ultimately [ph] generate starts and placements. So I can assure you we're as introspective and self-critical as you can get. And we do it often, but we honestly don't believe it's an internal execution issue as much as it is a market issue. And there's nothing like the proof is in the pudding. And as the market improves, we better improve with it.","Harold Messmer","Tim, I would second what Keith said. We've always been somewhat paranoid. As you probably know, you always worry, \"Are there things you could be doing better,\" but my own view is that it's basically macroeconomics. You had a fairly anemic GDP growth rate this first quarter. The projections are for great improvement coming up and we hope that's the case. And if it does occur, we certainly expect to do a lot better. So we'll see.","Timothy McHugh","Just one follow-up, I think the language you had about Protiviti earlier in your script was a little different. You touted kind of the broader set of services they have. Are you seeing the work shift in that way? I mean, I guess, is there any shift away from some of the regulatory compliance stuff that we would have seen in the past and towards this kind of broader array? Or I guess was there any message about how, I guess, the workload that's coming in from clients and what type of opportunities they're seeing?","Keith Waddell","Well, the general point was Protiviti's revenue sources are more diversified. There is no major shift one way or the other. We've talked about the last couple of years. There's been less higher-margin regulatory compliance work. That has stabilized. It actually grew somewhat this quarter. We were pleased with that. That said, the financial services industry is still very cost-focused. And even where we're doing internal audit for financial services firms, there's some margin compression. The good news is Protiviti more than offset that by managing its own internal cost, such that we had margin expansion, operating margin expansion year-over-year which we were pleased with.","So the major service offerings of Protiviti, internal audit, risk and compliance and technology consulting, those are still the 3 major service offerings. But in addition to that, we talked about data analytics. We talked about the other in the script there. Protiviti definitely has broadened and continues to broaden its service offerings. Cyber is certainly something that's hot. And to the extent regulatory reform is going to help us in the future, there's more regulatory reform in the cyber area that plays into controls, that plays into security, both of which are in our wheelhouse.","Harold Messmer","Tim, my own thought was that I'm very pleased with the management group at Protiviti. They've done an outstanding job. I think their market acceptance is really superior. They've done a great job. So the point I guess I was hoping to convey was that we're optimistic about their continued growth in different areas in addition to the ones that we're already in. We certainly aren't planning to lose sight of the other areas, but they're getting a good reception in the market. Their reputation continues to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust.","Kwan Kim Hong","This is Kwan Kim Hong for Tobey. As the wait-and-see approach to hiring fades among SMBs, how are you thinking about potentially jump-starting the recruitment force with additional hires before that optimism finally generates higher levels of activity?","Keith Waddell","So we would observe that we have held the line with our recruiters and our salespeople, notwithstanding the fact that our revenue base has declined somewhat year-over-year. So by holding the line, we have capacity, we have dry powder, however you want to articulate such that we believe we will participate quickly and meaningfully as things do improve. With a few quarters of that, we can then begin to add to headcount and that's U.S. Non-U.S. which is clearly doing better, led by Europe, particularly Germany, particularly Belgium which are doing great, we're already adding to headcount there. So some of the year-on-year operating margin compression you see is G&A deleverage because we've held the line in the U.S. notwithstanding less revenue. We've added to headcounts outside the U.S. to feed their hot hand and the combination is we've got some negative SG&A leverage. We're fine with that. But that means we should participate well and profitably on the upside, particularly in the early parts of upside, because we have unused capacity.","Kwan Kim Hong","And on President Trump's recent executive order on the H-1B visa program to prevent abuse, how do you assess the potential impacts and benefits you may experience from this order? And how may that affect the technology growth for your customers?","Keith Waddell","Well, so first of all, our middle-market clients, there's virtually no demand for H-1B-type candidates to work on their projects. So there's no direct impact. But to the extent in the marketplace, clients have relied on providers that source their people in that way. Those providers won't be able to source in that way and frankly don't have the recruiting infrastructure in the short term to do that. So we think that would be a net positive to us. There is some discussion about, well, to the extent H-1Bs aren't part of the U.S. available workforce, the remaining workforce becomes more scarce for the remaining providers. There is some truth to that, but net, we still see a positive, too. If anything, there is new demand that heretofore has been satisfied by H-1Bs that thereafter would now have to be satisfied domestically. We have a recruiting infrastructure in place to do that as well as other recruiting. So we think it's a net positive. But as we understand the regs, I mean the H-1Bs for this year have been granted. So this is 12 months hence. So this isn't going to play out overnight.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Would you term the sort of conservativeness of the assumptions in this guidance as similar to how you normally do it in talking about not assuming the March lift that you saw? I guess that sounded like that left room for some conservatism. But is that -- would you say that's similar to how you've done it in the past? Or is there some reason that maybe it would be more so this time?","Keith Waddell","Well, we go through a process where our key geography leads do their forecasting, our key line of business leads, they do their forecasting and we roll that up. We take a look at it. It's a bottom-up, not a top-down, approach. We're saying the outcome of that process was that you've got a little more than the average but not March. So the process was absolutely the same that it always is. Do we, topside, sometimes adjust it a little one way or the other? Yes, we do. We're hoping we're conservative. I mean, clearly, the past few quarters, we've tended to be a little light which didn't happen this quarter, we're happy to report. So we hope to be a little conservative. And if March trends continue, we will end up have been.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great. And then just the sluggishness in hiring cycles, is it fair to say that from your perspective, the biggest factor here has just been fairly low or weak U.S. GDP growth? Or do you think -- do you have any sense from your clients that policy uncertainty around, when will the new administration and Congress deliver some of the stuff that they've promised, like tax reform, infrastructure spend, et cetera, that, that is a factor impacting them? I guess I'm just trying to see if that stuff takes a while to go through, is that part of it?","Keith Waddell","Well, clearly, today, GDP growth has been anemic and that's expected to continue this quarter where we talked earlier about -- we're talking sub-2%, 1.5% type GDP growth rates. And I think the policy uncertainty issue is, does it continue this gap between the soft data and the hard data, the optimism, the sentiment data versus real economic activity? And I think the longer the policy uncertainty exists, be it tax reform, be it regulatory reform, be it infrastructure, I think that uncertainty certainly defers the period of time that you see actual improvements in business activity. That said, we had a nice March. We've said it several times now. And it's only 1 month which is why we didn't roll it all in to our guidance, but we had a nice March. We had more activity in March. We had it in perm which is typically the most sensitive to macro trends. So we're happy about that. But yes, policy uncertainty matters, but factually up through this quarter, there's been less GDP growth, full stop.","Gary Bisbee","Yes, right, yes. I know they're clearly related. I appreciate that. I appreciate that color.","Harold Messmer","Gary, the only thing I'd add to what Keith said is that historically, our bias on guidance is such that we would rather be on the conservative side than the overly optimistic side. And as to your second question, I definitely think it's a GDP issue. And while people remain optimistic, they're still waiting to get a little bit more comfort on the policy front and so forth before they pick up their activity levels. So we remain cautiously optimistic in that regard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Ryan Leonard","This is Ryan Leonard filling in for Manav. A lot of my questions have been asked, but I guess I just want to know on this particular part of the cycle, is there anything that you guys are doing differently that makes you feel like you can benefit additionally to the macro side? And I guess I asked that question from the CRM landscape. Is that implementation going to provide some extra benefit that you typically haven't had at this point of the cycle?","Keith Waddell","Well, I guess I would broaden the CRM to the impact of our digital initiatives generally. I think as an optimist, I think as we improve our digital initiatives, as we share with our clients more and more of our internal technology that lets them participate in the selection and discovery of candidates, it ultimately results in more leads to the extent we use our artificial intelligence, our matching algorithms to make better matches. You have a better satisfied client that ultimately snowballs as well.","So clearly, relative to prior cycles, we're much more advanced with how we've developed our internal systems, particularly from the point of view and how they're connected and how they interact with our website which in turn is available to all candidates and clients. Traditionally, our website functionality has been almost exclusively candidate-facing. That's changing rapidly. You can go to our website this second and search our candidate database. You can filter on geography. You can filter on skills. You can filter on education level. You can further benefit from our algorithms, where we show -- we map skills that you're searching for to skills that are -- may or not -- that would be relevant as well to what you're searching for. ","So I think we're light years better in our digital capabilities. We believe long term, the firm that wins has both digital and traditional capabilities. The digital can do a nice job of correlating skills and work experiences. But for things like attitude and professionalism and cultural fit, we still think our human being staff do a better job of that. So I think this hybrid combination of digital and traditional are off-line [ph]. I think we've never had that combination of capabilities today that we've had in the past. The other thing I would observe is that we're working together staffing in Protiviti better than we ever have before. We're going to market together. I think the marketplace understands there are certain type of projects that need some kind of project management but that the staff level can be provided by our traditional staffing organization. So it's a combination together. You get a better price point. ","You get Big 4 Protiviti level project management. You get staffing, specialized staffing feet on the street and the combination is effective and the price point is better. So relative to where we've been in prior cycles, we've clearly got a better digital offering. That digital offering is well integrated into our traditional offering. And a combination of Protiviti staffing, the blending, the integration, the go-to-market coordination is the best it's ever been.","Ryan Leonard","That was great. That was very in-depth. So I guess just one quick follow-up point. Are you hiring more people on the tech side? Or is this done through third party?","Keith Waddell","We're talking internal tech or we're talking our tech staffing division?","Ryan Leonard","Internal focused on developing these applications in AI and algorithms.","Keith Waddell","Right. We use a combination of third parties, internal staff, contractors, freelancers and temporaries. We're sitting out here in the middle of the Silicon Valley. So we -- there is all kind of flavors of the way we engage with resources. But we actually think we benefit by sitting right here in Silicon Valley in that regard.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffrey.","George Tong","You've indicated you're seeing noticeable improvement in customer optimism around hiring prospects. Can you discuss how the optimism is translating into order flows?","Keith Waddell","Well, I guess most recently, if you looked at our March versus January and February and clearly, we saw an uptick in activities not only placements made but starts on the temp side, but interviews, send outs, all of the downstream activity that results as well as things get better. So as we've said earlier, we're encouraged that March was better. It's 1 month. We didn't totally roll it into our guidance. We hope it's the beginning of many good months to come, but I don't think we're unique when you read almost every day and you see in the press virtually every day, the company is talking about the gap between hard data and soft data, sentiment optimism on the one hand and actual levels of activity on the other. But the good news for us and I guess relative to where we sat 90 days ago, I would tell you our people are moderately more optimistic. And so they've actually seen some signs of improvement at least for 1 month and it happened to be the last month in the quarter. So relative to 90 days ago, we're moderately more optimistic, but it was 1 month.","George Tong","Yes, makes sense. And I think you indicated that employers are taking at the increment a bit more time to make these hiring decisions. Can you talk about how the length of the sales cycle performed during the quarter as you move through the quarter and exiting the quarter?","Keith Waddell","I'd say over that short a period of time, the length of the sales cycle didn't change much. All that we're saying is as we exited the quarter, clients pulled the trigger and actually hired people. Clients pulled the trigger and actually took our temporaries for assignments. So the trend is good but it -- over that short a period of time, it didn't change much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] filling in for Hamzah. I think you guys mentioned that gross margins were up 30 basis points from bill\/pay spreads. I was wondering, can you maybe give some more color around the bill\/pay spreads in the quarter and the conversions and how that trended relative to your internal expectations?","Keith Waddell","I would say gross margins were better than our expectations. And if you look at our first quarter versus our guidance, so the $0.62 versus the $0.58, a very simple way to think about it is perm outperformed our expectations which was a couple of pennies. Temp gross margins, relative to your question, outperformed our expectation which was about $0.01. And the tax rate was lower which was about $0.01. So there's your 4 pennies. So 1 of those 4 was better temp gross margins than we had dialed in. A piece of that were sequentially better conversions, but the bigger piece of that was better spreads. Part of that is a mix issue. As your accounting operations positions and Accountemps are more impacted due to macro, that means your remaining Accountemps business is more staff level versus accounting operations staff level has slightly higher gross margins than accounting operations. So you've got a higher mix of those. So that also helps to explain the increase in gross margins.","Operator","Your last question comes from Dan Dolev with Instinet.","Dan Dolev","So clearly, things are inflecting your guidance looks conservative. If you reflect back on your prior cycle, have you seen sort of an inflection point like this once it starts happening and actually not materialize or I guess once it start -- once the inflection happens, it sort of starts going upward? I mean, just historically speaking.","Keith Waddell","Well, we've had a month of improved results. So hopefully, that's a start in earnest and then once started, continues. Part of the better year-over-year growth rates is because the comparisons are starting to get easier as well. So you also benefit from that. So we hope we're being conservative. We hope the March improvement is confirmed throughout the rest of the quarter and the year, but it's a little early to draw definitive conclusions based on March. But we're optimistic. We feel better than we felt 90 days ago. We've said that.","Dan Dolev","Yes, I meant more -- it's helpful, but I meant more historically if you reflect back on prior 30 years.","Keith Waddell","It's the same [indiscernible] what you're asking, right. It's what we're saying.","Dan Dolev","Yes, exactly. That is the question.","Keith Waddell","We have had mix in the past. And I'm saying we don't have enough to -- the sample size isn't large enough to know whether it's a head fake or not.","Harold Messmer","And thank you. That was our last question. We would like to thank everyone again for joining us on today's call.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Revenues for the company were $1.552 billion, up 6% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter net income per share was $1.01 versus $0.95 in the same period one year ago. This is a 7% increase year-over-year.","Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the third quarter and capital expenditures were $17 million. In September, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $80 million. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchases under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","Persistent talent shortages resulted in continued strong demand for our staffing services in the third quarter, particularly in the United States. Robert Half Management Resources was the standout among our staffing lines of business and our Protiviti subsidiary also had a very strong quarter.","We are pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing in our U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations. Return on invested capital for the company was 42% in the third quarter.","I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed look at our third quarter results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.552 billion. This is up 6% from the prior year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period. Accompanying our earnings release today as a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations, and certain intercompany adjustments and our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. On an as adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 3% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $973 million, up 5% on an as adjusted basis.","Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $280 million, down 0.3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.","There were 64.1 billing days in the third quarter versus 63.3 days in the same quarter one year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter one year ago.","Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.9 percentage points. Now let's take a look at the results for Protiviti, global revenues in the third quarter were $299 million, $235 million of that is from the United States and $64 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti global revenues were up 15% versus the year ago period.","On an as adjusted basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were up 16% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.","Now let's turn to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.9% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago. In our permanent placement business, revenues were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter of 2019, which is flat compared to the last year's third quarter.","When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 10 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter of 44.6%. Protiviti gross margin was $88 million in the third quarter or 29.5% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues. Staffing SG&A costs were 34.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 34.1% in last year's third quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 16.2% of Protiviti revenues versus 18.0% of revenues in the year ago period.","Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $123 million. Operating margin was 9.8% of this amount. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $101 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.1% while our permanent placement division reported operating income of $22 million and produced an operating margin of 16.2%. Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $40 million resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%. Accounts receivable were $853 million at the end of the third quarter and implied days sales outstanding were 49.3 days.","Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.8% versus the prior year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 4% compared to the same period in October 1 a year ago when revenues were up 9%. Permanent placement revenues in September were up 0.5% compared to September of 2018. This compares to 3.4% increase for the full quarter.","For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were essentially flat compared to the same period last year, when revenues were up 20%. We provide this information so that you have insight in some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October but as you know, these are very brief time periods, we caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance, $1.5 billion to $1.565 billion, income per share $0.94 to $1.","The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis including Protiviti and EPS growth of 2%. The projected tax rate is 28% compared to 27% a year ago. Compared sequentially to the third quarter just ended, the of our guidance implies negative revenue and EPS growth of 1% and 4% respectively. This differs from typical seasonal trends due to the loss of an extra billing day between the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. In 2019, we lose 2.4 days sequentially, whereas in 2018, we lost only 1.6 days between quarters. Limiting our guidance to one quarter, all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We were pleased with the company's third quarter results and encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and consulting operation. As we noted earlier, Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. Demand for Protiviti services was broad-based across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions including its managed solutions offering to provide a jointly with our staffing operations. Our staffing operations are benefiting from the strong labor market, particularly in the United States. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5%.","The last time the rate was this low was in December 1969. Staffing challenges are particularly acute for companies that are making technology investments. The skills required for digital transformation projects are in short supply, which is fueling higher demand for specialized staffing services like ours.","We believe global labor shortages are going to have a durable impact on hiring demand. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index showed a decline in overall confidence among CEOs, the small and mid-sized businesses in September. Yet nearly 60% of these CEOs plan to hire in the year ahead, a 4-point increase from the prior month.","While many of the various business confidence indices are off their historic highs, they remain at strong absolute. We are focused on technology investments within Robert Half as we've talked about on this call in the past. Whether customers engage with us online or in person, we can provide a seamless experience supported by technology and the expertise of our local staffing experts.","That's a unique combination, which we believe is a key differentiator for Robert Half. We also see the blended solutions offered by our staffing and Protiviti operations as an important differentiator. Protiviti's 2019 global finance trends survey found that managed solutions models where major projects are handled by a blend of full-time staff, contract professionals and third party experts are gaining in popularity as an alternative to traditional outsourcing arrangements. We believe we are uniquely qualified to provide these diverse staffing and consulting solutions all under one roof.","Now Keith and I'd be happy to answer questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon","Good afternoon, Max and Keith. I thought the quarter was really good, particularly as it relates to both Protiviti as well as management resources. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the growth that you're seeing in your blended solutions, your managed solutions combination and where is that in terms of its development? What sort of potential do you see out of that?","That's one question. And then the follow-up has to do with the guidance, and I'm just wondering Keith, sometimes you provide some detail with regards to what you're explicitly expecting by segment both in terms of trends as well as from a margin perspective? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","So, our blended solutions did quite well yet again. As Max said earlier, Protiviti growth was broad-based across all of its solutions areas. Blended solutions -- we can manage -- business Solutions managed, Technology solutions did particularly well. Clients certainly appreciate the deep subject matter expertise they get from Protiviti and the scalable variable resources they get from staffing. They get that all under one roof. Whether they're building something new, whether they're fixing a problem, whether they're cleaning up a backlog, all three are perfect use cases for that blended solution.","As far as development, we think it's early days. Potential, we think is tremendous. It's clearly for 3 or 4 quarters in a row, been one of our fastest growing operations and we believe there is a lot of upside from where we are. On guidance, maybe we\u2019ll just go down the P&L a bit. For revenues with staffing, we're basically seeing year-over-year growth rate staying essentially flat with the third quarter. The U.S. stayed strong. Europe continues to slow but the comps do get 4 points easier.","We're particularly pleased with how we're doing in the U.S. The macro and trade policy uncertainty that's in the news every day seems mostly limited to manufacturing and its supply chain and we don't have a lot of exposure to that.","So, we're holding up very well in our judgment in the U.S. Because it's the fourth quarter, there is always calendar anxiety, this year maybe moreso than most because the holidays fall on Wednesday. The concern is that more people decide to take the 4-week off both candidates and clients which could have more impact than it typically does, but again revenue, staffing, year-over-year growth rate is essentially flat with Q3.","Revenues Protiviti. They will slow modestly in part because the comps are the toughest, yet they were up 19% a year ago. In the international zone, they have a couple of large projects that ended -- that will take them a little time to replace.","Further with Protiviti because they've been so busy this year, their staff have deferred a lot of their time off. That time off is scheduled heavier in December than is typically the case, partly because of the Wednesday date that I talked about and partly because they just have more differed time off. That effectively shortens the quarter even more for Protiviti, so modest slowing in the year-over-year growth rates for Protiviti.","Temp [Ph] gross margin flat-to-up 20 basis points. Protiviti gross margin down 30 to 50 basis points because of the time off and holiday impacts that I just talked about. Effectively, they utilize their staff less because of that downtime. SG&A, staffing up 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year primarily due to negative leverage from the international zone. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, operating leverage due to higher revenues. That means operating income for staffing down 40 to 60 basis points year-on-year. Protiviti up 10 to 30 basis points year-on-year, tax rate 27.5% to 28% more non-deductible cost pursuant to the last tax law change, shares about 115 million.","Mark Marcon","That's great. So it sounds like you're actually seeing good trends. You're just basically, when we take a look at the guidance for the fourth quarter, you're basically accounting for that calendar anxiety to a certain extent. And also on the Protiviti side we've got some vacation that we have to give our folks that's been deferred. Is that a correct summary? I mean it doesn't sound like you're seeing any sort of change from a macro perspective, Q4 relative to Q3.","Keith Waddell","Not at all, particularly in the U.S. As I said earlier, where we think we take the trends pretty much intact into Q4, we are particularly happy about our start for this quarter. The early part of September coming back from the holidays was a little soft, but we picked up the second part of September, which continued to October that we're happy about. Protiviti's pipeline is very strong. One of their market leaders on the call yesterday actually described it as all switches are in their on position. So I thought that was a perfect way to describe kind of the tone of business for Protiviti particularly in the U.S.","Mark Marcon","That's great to hear. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, Keith. I hope you are going to allow me a cyclical question here. And I definitely heard you already about the calendar anxiety. But my question is looking past just fourth quarter guide of 4% revenue growth; is it everything sort of in place for higher growth, it you know the tight labor market, conducive real GDP, still high small business confidence, even though it is off higher levels, and so like as we think maybe even past fourth quarter, shouldn't we have a backdrop that could give us, let's say, higher than 4% growth as we move further out?","Max Messmer","Well, we would agree with all the observations that you just made. We would also note that if you look at our compares for the next few quarters, they get easier not harder, that's also better. So, we're bullish and we're particularly bullish in the U.S., we have seen some slowing outside the U.S., Europe, the UK for reasons that are well chronicled, but it's certainly not abruptly declining. But the trend line does show a declining, maybe not to the extent they did in the third quarter, but declining nonetheless.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to the fact that Robert Half Management Resources was really the stand out among staffing, was that because of the work that you're doing with Protiviti or is there something else going on in that unit?","Max Messmer","So, it is not because of the work we're doing with Protiviti, which is actually classified as Protiviti, this is their work. Other than that, I'd say a few observations, one, their clients have leaner middle management, which means anytime they have a project or anything out of the ordinary, they're more in need for specialized skills, particularly higher level, which is where management resources focuses.","Further, the candidate supply for Robert Half Management Resources is very different than for account temps as an example, Management Resources has access to a lot of people that have chosen to be contractors or consultants as a career, and that essentially is not the case at all with account temps. Further, the management resources candidates will travel and clients will pay for that travel, which further helps from a supply point of view. So, a very different candidate supply story for management resources then is the case for account temps.","Jeff Silber","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. I know you're not giving guidance beyond the current quarter, but we've got a model out beyond that. From a tax rate perspective, is there anything we should know about in 2020 in the same thing, in terms of capital expenditures for next year? Thanks.","Max Messmer","I'd say the tax rates are going to be generally between 27% and 28%, it grew somewhat between quarters you can smooth to the extent you used to could [Ph]. On the capex, they were somewhat elevated this year and we would expect they would continue to be elevated next year as well.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great, thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. Hey, Keith, could you give us a sense of, and I don't think you mentioned, what the bill pay spreads were in the quarter and then, just along those lines, how are your hiring plans ","shaping up?","Keith Waddell","So, for bill rate increases this quarter, they were up 4.8% year-on-year, that's a little less than it was last quarter and that's after dilution from non-U.S. operations. The U.S. rate is higher, if you look back in the '04 to '08, '09 period, it's not unusual to see swings as much as a full percentage point in our bill rate increases. So 4.8 versus 5.4 last quarter, we don't read any particular significance in two. Hiring rate, we did continue to hire particularly late in the third quarter, which follows in to the fourth quarter, so that we can support our U.S. growth rate. We've clearly moderated our hiring outside of the U.S. given macro conditions there.","Kevin McVeigh","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tobey Sommer","Thanks. This is Jasper Bebon [Ph] for Tobey today. Based on the NFIB data, it seems finding available talent has been the biggest issue for clients recently, but with small business confidence pulling back a bit, has caution in hiring elongated the time it takes for you to find hires as well?","Max Messmer","So, the shorter answer is, there isn't elongation, but it isn't because of macro uncertainty. It's more about, it's so intense, the competition for candidates. One of the biggest issues we have particularly on the perm side, we spend all this time getting a candidate, all the way to the point where the client makes the offer, that candidate goes back to their existing employer, the existing employer counters that and they don't leave their existing employer. We've done all of the work we would otherwise do to make the placement, yet it doesn't happen. So, the stress point is not that there is a lack of demand or lack of job orders, the stress point is the candidates tightness.","Tobey Sommer","Great, thanks.","Max Messmer","As I said earlier, we're not particularly exposed to manufacturing or manufacturing supply chain and our end markets have held up, we think, reasonably well in the United States.","Tobey Sommer","That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee","Thanks. Yes, any more color you can provide on the international performance, obviously slowing there, but again it's quite tough comps, but relative to the data in major markets in Europe and other places that your growth continues to look quite strong. So, how is that trending? How are you thinking about that and was there any defined change in pattern during the quarter? Thank you.","Max Messmer","So, as we talked about on the last call and is in fact played out, we did see slowing, Germany is our biggest market. It slowed, but it still has a positive year-over-year growth rate. Australia was strong, Canada still stayed strong. But if you look at Belgium, when you look at the UK, we did see slowing trends which are expected to continue, be it macro slowing, be it trade uncertainty slowing, be it Brexit, all of those are at play, but we are barely negative year-on-year and we would expect to get a little more negative year-on-year in the fourth quarter. But as I said earlier, it is helpful that our comps get four points easier in the fourth quarter versus the third.","Gary Bisbee","Great, thanks. And then, the follow-up just on the perm business, when I look back over time in years where there was more uncertainty in that business, sometimes has cooled more aggressively into year-end, as companies just defer hires to the next year, relative to stronger either business sentiment or macro conditions, how are you thinking about the perm business both in the U.S. and overall as we trend through October, November, December?","Max Messmer","Because of the overall environment is one where there's plenty of demand, plenty of orders and the issue is candidates, we don't have the traditional concern that the demand pauses or slows in the fourth quarter. That said, December as a month for the perm business, there is always uncertainty attached to, and we're not discounting that. We've talked a little bit about that earlier, but it's more about getting candidates identified, agreed to, and they actually make the job change and they make the job change to our client. They don't stay put, they don't take yet another offer that they've gotten somewhere else. So, for us it's about candidate control more so than it is job orders.","Gary Bisbee","That's helpful, thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","This is Ryan on for Manav. I'm just curious, it's interesting, your comments about not really feeling any of the uncertainty in the U.S. If you look back over the past couple of years, I mean there have been some pauses related to elections or tax reform. I guess from your conversations, what's different, even just from a pure headline standpoint of people maybe thinking about holding back on hiring, just because of all the different things we've seen going on that's obviously impacting Europe?","Max Messmer","I would reference a study that was published, an economic study that was published based on Bureau of Economic Analysis in late October. The headline is 'Job growth slowdown', it seems likely to be contained, there's evidence of spillovers from manufacturing into other industries, other than supply chain. So, I think the point is, because we're not that exposed to manufacturing and because of the slowdown seems focused on manufacturing, the other pauses, as you described, are more broader than just manufacturing and that's how I would distinguish the two.","Manav Patnaik","Fair enough. And then, a lot of technology investments we've talked about on the call here. Can you maybe talk about uptick in the use of the app throughout the quarter and how you think about that going into next year?","Max Messmer","Well, we're very pleased with how the app has launched. The engagement we've gotten from those that come is principally candidate-focused. We continue to add additional functionality, improve the user experience, personalize that user experience on both our app and online. We are also continuing to expand the used cases where we leverage our data using AI and ML, that's on the app, as well as online. We use it in how we market, how we sell, how we recruit, how we match and fill jobs.","We're pleased with where we are with our digital strategy, with the implementation of what we've done, a large part of that initial investment was in digital marketing, which is personalized, micro-targeted as to who gets it, when they get it, what the message is. We talked on the last call about we're inviting candidates that match to all our new job orders for doing that at scale. We've never done that before. So, we feel good about our digital strategy and we've got more to come.","Manav Patnaik","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Tong","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. You indicated that temp staffing exited the third quarter with September revenue up 2.8% year-over-year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Can you discuss what factors contributed to the slowdown?","Max Messmer","As I said earlier, early September was a little soft coming out of the holidays, but we picked up later September and in October, because we also put in the script there that our October growth rate year-on-year was 4%. So, we did better, latter part of September and in October, and it's actually an acceleration, not a deceleration.","George Tong","Got it, that's helpful. So, you're maintaining your hiring rate in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter in the U.S., based on what you said earlier, moderating a little bit in the EU. Can you help unpack that specifically, how quickly you're scaling up your recruiters in the U.S. and what degree of moderation in hiring you're seeing in the EU?","Max Messmer","We tried to roughly acquaint our hiring rate to our top-line growth rate. So, the EU is flat to down slightly. That's what our hiring plan looks like in EU, the U.S. is growing 4% to 5% and that's what the hiring plan looks like.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Max Messmer","That was our last question. We'd like to thank everyone again for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half International; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold M. Messmer","Thank you, and hello, everyone. Before we begin, we would like to remind you, as usual, that comments made on today's call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions.","We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described some of these risks and uncertainties in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on this call.","Now let's discuss the first quarter. ","Global revenues for the first quarter were $1,020,000,000, an increase of 15% from the first quarter of 2011. Income per share was $0.34, up 88% from the $0.18 per share reported in the first quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $23 million, capital expenditures were $10 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares for a total of $29 million. There are approximately 5.1 million shares still available under our board approved stock repurchase plan. ","We were pleased with the financial results for the quarter which were the result of continued strong demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services. This is the seventh straight quarter of the company has reported double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. In each of these quarter\u2019s growth and net income and earnings per share has greatly outpaced revenue growth. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell for more detailed review of our first quarter financial results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As you noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, and a 4% increase sequentially. We calculated 63.7 billing days in the first quarter compared to 63.1 days in the first quarter of 2011, and compared to 61.0 days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The higher number of billing days had the effect of increasing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 5%, and year-over-year growth rates by 1.1%. The current quarter, has 63.1 billing days. ","Currency exchange rates reduced first quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million and first quarter year-over-year revenues by $6 million. This had the effect of reducing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 0.1% and year-over-year growth rates by 0.8%. Beginning this quarter, we've added a new supplemental schedule to the investor center of our website at rhi.com. It shows the year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported basis and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This information is presented for each of the quarters, beginning with the first quarter of 2011. We provided this data because we believe it better reflects our actual growth rate and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This data is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. ","Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates also is available on our website. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues grew 16% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2011, with the U.S. growing 20% and international locations growing 9% on this basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $652 million in the first quarter of this year, while international staffing revenues for the quarter were $260 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, including 104 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. ","First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were at $103 million, including $78 million in United States and $25 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 4% globally, with U.S. revenue up 9% and non-U.S. revenue down 7%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries. ","Now, let's look at gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 35.6% of applicable revenues. This was 125 basis point increase over the first quarter of last year, and only a 16 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of 2011. We were very pleased with our ability during the quarter to adjust our pay bill spreads to absorb the anticipated state unemployment tax increases, and also the absence of prior quarter workers' compensation credits. Temp-to-hire conversions also rose modestly during the quarter. Our mix of permanent placement revenues increased to 9.1% of staffing revenues for the quarter versus 8.6% a year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins previously discussed, this resulted in a 150 basis point increase in overall staffing gross margins compared to the first quarter of 2011. Protiviti's gross margin was $24 million or 23% of Protiviti were revenues, compared to 25% of revenues a year ago. ","Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses cost. In the first quarter, our staffing SG&A cost were 32.4% of staffing revenues. This was an improvement of 180 basis points from the prior year. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 25.4% of revenues. This was a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year. First quarter operating income from our Staffing divisions was $82 million or 9% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $69 million of this amount or 8.3% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $13 million or 16% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating loss was $2 million in the first quarter. This was anticipated as the first quarter is typically Protiviti's seasonally weakest quarter. Accounts receivable were $523 million at the end of the first quarter, was implied days outstanding, or DSO, of 46.9 days compared to 48.2 days at the end of the first quarter of 2011. ","Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year temporary and consulting growth rates were up in January and down in February and March. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year permanent placement growth rates were down in January, February and March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues for our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues for our Permanent Placement division were up 35% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution however, that it's difficult to evaluate these trends over such short time periods. ","Taking this information into account, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.32 to $0.37. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. ","Now I'll turn it over back to Max.","Harold M. Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We had another strong quarter with continued growth across our lines of business. Year-over-year growth rates in our domestic operations accelerated during the first quarter. Economic signals were more mixed outside the United States, particularly in Europe, which affected the revenues of our non-U.S. operations; however, we were quite pleased with our ability to control costs outside United States. We have said before, on this call and repeat now, that we believe a supply and demand imbalance is emerging in United States within many professional occupations. ","Unemployment rates for a number of positions in accounting and information technology, for example, are less than half the overall U.S rate. In many instances, we have benefited from a better pricing environment as a result of the tighter labor market for specialized plantilla [ph]. We also have witnessed the return to hiring by small and midsized businesses in many of our markets. Although we serve companies of all sizes, the core of our client base is made up of small and midsized firms which often are less price sensitive and tend to place a higher premium on service quality. ","Protiviti will mark its 10th anniversary next month and it continues to diversify its business solutions. In addition to its foundation practice and internal audit and internal controls-related services, Protiviti offers consulting services in areas such as finance, technology, compliance, operations, litigation and restructuring. Protiviti's most significant growth areas recently have been in IT-related consulting as well as services geared toward the financial services industry. ","Another reason we are optimistic about the growth prospects for Robert Half is the change we believe is taking place in the way companies staff their operations. We are seeing wider adoption of flexible staffing models by businesses, including the use of temporary and project professionals. Flexibility of variable cost labor can give companies greater control over their human resources budgets and provide access to skilled talent when, and for as long as, they need that talent. ","At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your perspective on investing behind perm at this point, and how we should think about the potential margins in the perm business over the balance of the year? Recognize it's going to be different in terms of international versus U.S., but if you can give some color there, I'd appreciate it.","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. So we were pleased with our perm quarter and particularly the profitability of our perm quarter, during the first quarter. We will continue to invest in perm principally in the United States, principally in the technology sector. And outside of the U.S., we reduced our headcount during the quarter as we had said we would on the prior call. For the second quarter, we'll probably hold that headcount constant, it might drift down a little bit. But most of the investing in perm, U.S. technology. As  to margins, the margins did increase nicely during the quarter. The cost control outside the U.S. had a meaningful impact, that was the headcount reduction we had talked about. Our hope is that we can maintain those margins as we go into the second quarter in perm.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. Just a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about how much of your perm business is now technology-related? And what the future prospects are on that?","M. Keith Waddell","The perm tech, I think, is around 18% of total perm. And Mark, that compares to tech, temporary and consulting, which I think is 14% to 15% of total temporary and consulting. So that's a little larger percentage in perm, but it's not hugely larger. But we're quite optimistic about it. And clearly, tech perm was one of the strongest parts of the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Keith, you're going to think I'm a total geek, but I think you might have confused me a little bit. When you gave your trends for January, February and March, did you switch to using year-over-year trends? Historically, you used sequential trends, I believe. I think you switched to year-over-year. My first question is why? And then, could you give me some interpretation because it sounded like up to, this is for temp, up January, down Feb, down March. I assume, does that mean deceleration? And then, all of a sudden, when I look at April, we're still at a very solid 15%. So is my context correct? And could you give us some color?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. So it is correct that we switched to year-over-year, and it is correct that the rates of growth decelerated during the course of the quarter, and it is correct that in first part of April, we reaccelerated in perm and temp stayed about the same. We went to year-over-year so that everything is consistently year-over-year. Traditionally, when we talked about the progress during a quarter, we talked sequentially, and then we converted to year-over-year for the post-quarter start. That actually created quite a few calls and confused some people. So in combination with this new schedule, that I would encourage everybody to go look at on our website, it's year-over-year, constant currency, constant billing days, so that, that schedule reports on that basis. What we report during the course of the quarter just ended is on that basis. And what we report on our start, post-quarter, is on that basis. So everything is same-day, constant currency, year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just give us some color on how your major international segments did by country?","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. I guess, clearly, the strongest is in Germany, where we had very strong year-over-year growth. We've accounted in the following order, we also continued to have positive year-over-year growth: Belgium, France, Australia, Canada. The major country where we had negative year-over-year growth was the U.K.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Thanks. And then you also got a great SG&A leverage in your temporary business, was that just higher revenue with kind of a flattish employee base? Or are you seeing greater productivity gains or can you give some color there?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, clearly, the higher revenues, when we were particularly attentive to our cost, especially outside the U.S., where we held the -- even the temp headcount in check, resulted in an operating leverage in both temp and perm and expanded margins. But there's no -- there's nothing sexy there. That's blocking and tackling. It's more revenue from essentially same workforce.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Condra from BMO Capital Markets.","Paul Condra","It looked like last quarter, you give us a little more detail about gross margin and SG&A expectations for the following quarter. I'm wondering if you could do that this time with regard to the second quarter.","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. So if you look at our guidance, at the high-end of our guidance, first of all, at the revenue level, it essentially says, on the temp side, the year-over-year growth rates remain intact. On the perm side, the growth rates slow in part because of the monster quarter we had a year ago, where we were up 44% and in part because we still have this environment where clients and candidates are simultaneously more selective, which slows down the placement cycle. So we're -- our forecast even at the high end does project deceleration for perm. Protiviti, seasonally, Q1 is soft, Q2 generally gets better. We're projecting mid-single-digit and  low-to-mid single-digit year-over-year growth for Protiviti at the high end. On the gross margins, we were particularly pleased during the quarter, that we absorbed the unemployment increase, the lack of workers' comp credits. We would expect to make a little more progress in the high end of our guidance for Q2. Turning to SG&A, we got a lot of leverage as a couple of you have observed here. We expect less leverage in the second quarter than we had in the first. By holding the international headcount around the same, that means the U.S. headcount increases, which would be single, single digit would come through overall, and result in not seeing as much operating leverage in the second quarter as the first, although we might still see a little bit. That would mean at the operating margin line, again at the high end of our guidance, the margins would be same to a little bit expanded. Across the board, Protiviti would clearly go from negative to positive.  So frankly, pretty straightforward. You take current quarter margins, apply to same kind of growth rates into Q2 and you've got your high end. There's nothing particularly complicated about it.","Paul Condra","That's great. I don't know if I could squeeze in one follow-up, but just -- did you pass through all of the SUTA increases or are you still making ground there?","M. Keith Waddell","We didn't quite get all of it. The SUTA increases were about 30 basis points relative to all of 2011. We didn't get all of it. We hope to get some more of it. And particularly in the quarter we're in, we dialed a little bit of that in to the high-end forecast, but not a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just want to first ask about the management resources segment, which seemed pick up a little bit there. Is there any additional color on what you're seeing out of that practice?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, Tim, I'd say the first quarter management resources, probably more than any other division, participates more fully in year-end close, year-end regulatory filings. It's right in the sweet spot of that activity. So if you look back to first quarter is particularly good for management resources. It was again this quarter. At least sequentially, the second quarter, the quarter we're now in is not as good for management resources because you're following those kind of trends. But they participated nicely, as they often have in the past, in the ongoing and recurring accounting activities that take place in the first quarter.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And my one follow-up would be if you can update us, I apologize if I missed this, but the pricing and bill rate trend and maybe, are there differences kind of by the segment or practice area?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay, so for bill rate increases, so the global increases year-over-year were 3.4% for the year, for the quarter versus the prior year, and sequentially they're up 2.1%. I would hasten to add those are global numbers. The U.S. numbers are a fair amount larger than that, offset by some year-over-year declines outside the U.S. As to differences by segment, there aren't huge stories there. To some extent, office teams have risen because we've become more selective in the type of business that we're writing in OfficeTeam. But generally for the most part, because everybody has middle-market client base, for the most part, the bill rate pay rate trends are the same and they're quite good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that last question. Could you talk about pricing trends for Protiviti?","M. Keith Waddell","Pricing trends for Protiviti are also good. The Protiviti does their annual promotion cycle, annual compensation evaluation cycle effective January 1. So they anticipate that, as they renew their contract, and the environment, generally, has been favorable with respect to what they've been able to bill, inclusive of considering the impact of promotions to their leverage model.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And separately, the NFIB hiring plans index and the bailiff [ph] temp payroll data, both took something of a step back in March. Based on your commentary about what you saw in March and April, it doesn't really sound like you've seen any of this. But I'm just wondering if the feedback from your branch managers has changed at all in the last 6 weeks or so?","M. Keith Waddell","And we met with all our key geography and line of business heads last week. And virtually to a person, they were more favorable than they were 90 days ago. So as we said in our trends, our growth did decelerate a bit in March, temp and perm, but that's either flattened back out, in the case of temp, or reaccelerated, in the case of perm, first part of April. Having said that, I think we all understand that perm's more volatile and that early start is less predictive of the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ato Garrett from Deutsche Bank.","Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the growth rates between the U.S. perm and European perm operations. Does it seem there's any significant differences to there?","M. Keith Waddell","So that's a nice straight man question for -- if you look at this new schedule we posted on our website, we actually show you the difference in those rates. And for example, for U.S. perm, it grew 28% year-over-year for the quarter, and non-U.S. perm grew 16.5% year-over-year in the quarter. So clearly, U.S. outgrow -- outgrew it but relative to expectation, the 16.5% growth outside the U.S. was better than we had expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Giri Krishnan from Credit Suisse.","Giridhar Krishnan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Keith, as you look towards the rest of the year, what are some areas other than maybe tech, which you mentioned in the past, and perm, which I think you alluded to earlier, where you plan to concentrate or invest in given the potential opportunity ahead?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, we're still bullish on tech. And tech perm has been particularly solid lately, which we'll continue to invest in. But as we've talked before, to some extent, we underinvested in our other lines of business last year, and this year, we're certainly going to invest commensurate with their growth rates. So the quarter we're in, we are going to add heads pretty much across all lines of business, particularly in the U.S., in part because we underinvested a bit during '11 while we overinvested in tech. There's a little bit of catching up that's going to happen in 2012. But not disproportionate to their 2012 growth. It's just going to be more broad based.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on the rate of change of bill rates in maybe -- specifically contrast IT with the F&A pieces of your business.","M. Keith Waddell","Right. So the bill rates were up 3.4% year-over-year, and there isn't that much difference between IT and non-IT. Clearly, there is a candidate supply challenge, more so on the IT side than on the accounting side. But as we said in the prepared remarks, the unemployment rate for IT and accounting professionals is half of the overall unemployment rate. And with that backdrop, we're having to pay more, clients understand that, and we're able to bill more as well.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then in Europe, the move to separate accounting and auditing, I was wondering if you could describe how you might see that unfolding and how you could take advantage of the opportunity?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, to some extent, it mirrors what happened here 10 years ago, where you couldn't do external outside auditing and internal auditing. So there's no question that, that would be a plus. I think there's a lot of question of whether that will actually get enacted, as proposed. But clearly independence between external audit and internal audit has always been a core-value proposition that Protiviti's sowed its independence, its objectivity. And to the extent that's even more acknowledged outside the U.S., that's a good thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Janesky from Avondale Partners.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","First question is, we, like you, have heard that small to midsize businesses are starting to rehire again. And do you think that's because -- our thoughts were that small to midsize businesses are probably the most affected by talk of a double-dip recession in, at least in the United States, that have kind of gone away. Is that what you're hearing? Are they more comfortable with the growth rate or are they just starting to invest again?","M. Keith Waddell","I think, clearly, the numbers show, they're starting to invest again. I think, if you look at ADP, 89% of the jobs added last month, we're in the small-to middle-size category so the job's growth engine is disproportionately in our sweet spot. There -- over the course of the years, they've been more \"show me\" than other categories, and I think with the recovery, as long as it's occurred notwithstanding the European uncertainties, I think they're beginning to be more believers and our growth rates show that.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then switching to Protiviti. Do you have the constant currency same-day rates for both U.S. and international for those -- for that segment? For the quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","So Jim, the reason we didn't do is because the number of days is much more an art form for Protiviti because it gets into the holiday and time-off patterns of your internal staff. And whereas, we have decades of data on the staffing side that says for a given holiday, it's effectively x percent of a full day. The data at Protiviti is not as consistent, and we don't have decades of data. And given its relative size, relative to staffing overall, we didn't go there. It's more volatile, it's more art than science. And again, as I said, given its relative size, we didn't go there.","James J. Janesky - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. But with respect to Protiviti, could you just talk a little bit about your longer-term plans there. And you did reduce headcount, you said you're going to keep that steady in the...","M. Keith Waddell","Long term Protiviti, in its own right, has a very solid internal audit practice. The U.S. has been quite good. I believe the U.S. alone has been profitable for each of the last 7 quarters. Our challenges have been more outside the U.S. which we've talked about many times on this call. So it's got a very solid internal audit practice. What's come on in a big way are IT consulting and financial services, particularly, risk and compliance as it relates to financial services. We're very pleased with how they've progressed. In addition, there is a very real go-to-market opportunity, which we increasingly are more successful with, where staffing and Protiviti go-to-market together. Typically, it's where Protiviti provides supervision, there's consulting, there's deliverables and, many times, from our staffing organization, you get the arms and the legs of the staff on the engagement. So we're bullish on Protiviti, in its own right, in the consulting space, particularly in IT and FSI. And as I said, we're increasingly more successful going to market, Protiviti together with staffing, we had nice winds this quarter. It's definitely gotten traction in the last 12 months, and we're very excited that Protiviti fits very naturally with staffing. At the end of the day, clients like choices. Clients like choices between: do I, client, want to manage a project? Do I, client, want you, the consulting firm, to manage the project? Or is there some blend of, I manage part of it, you manage part of it? You provide the arms and legs in part of it, you provide the consulting for part of it? Clients like choices. We see that within staffing, we see that within Protiviti, we see that combined between staffing and Protiviti. Protiviti gives us more choices.","Harold M. Messmer","It gives us more choices, Jim. And it also enables us to be very cost competitive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The first question, I guess, looking at the Technology business, it did decelerate a bit more than some of the other segments, and I realize it's been growing incredibly fast. Maybe it's just tough for comps, but anything else you'd point out there?","M. Keith Waddell","That's true. It did decelerate more than the others. And more than half of that deceleration, happened outside the U.S. and specifically in the U.K., where not only does it have the economic -- macroeconomic headwinds, but we also selectively exited some low-margin tech business that as that market's gotten more competitive, we just weren't willing to stay at the kind of margin structure that some of our competitors were willing to stay at. So disproportionately, non-U.S. And I think if you look this the schedule, you'll see that the temp and consulting staffing overall decelerated non-U.S., but in the U.S., temp and consulting actually accelerated.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And then just a follow-up to that, maybe I'm digging too much in the disclosure, but it looks like there's been quite a bit less of the currency impact on the Technology business. And I assume that, that's just that you haven't built it out overseas as much. But what -- if that's right, do you see the demand potential over time as  broadly similar to what you've seen for technology in the U.S.? And what are sort of the factor -- the gating factors to that growth, is it really just your investment?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay, so first of all, the currency differences by line of business get more to geographic distribution. So tech is stronger, or is more prevalent in some countries than others, relative to the rest of our business. So the currency changes, so let's take Germany as an example, so to the extent we're stronger in tech in Germany, it's going to be more impacted by euro exchange rates than sterling exchange rates, as an example. As far as demand drivers, outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S., the example I chose was Germany, because Germany we're bullish on tech where the drivers seem to be very similar to what they are in the U.S. So we do expect to make outsized tech investments in Germany, outside the U.S., for the same reasons we've made outsized tech investments in the U.S.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one on Protiviti. It certainly sounds like your commentary there has been getting more positive over the last year, so how do we think about the long-term profitability of the business? A few years ago, you thought that there was no reason it shouldn't be able to get the temp staffing profitability or I think you've even said low teens. Is this still a long time off or if we see sort of moderate to solid revenue growth, can we start moving there in the next couple of years?","M. Keith Waddell","We certainly think we can start moving there in the next couple of years. The challenge we've had is outside the U.S. Again, we've talked about that. We've made some progress. Japan has been particularly hard hit in the last 12 months. It anniversaries, the earthquake, tsunami in the second quarter, so the comparisons will get easier from that standpoint. But Protiviti U.S. has been nicely profitable for 7 straight quarters. That's been masked in some of those quarters by losses outside the U.S. We believe those losses will moderate, hopefully, more than even modestly over the course of what's left of 2012, which will drive overall Protiviti profitability. But short answer to your question, we still believe we can get consolidated global double-digit operating margins from Protiviti.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Huang from UBS.","Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on your temp-to-perm conversion. I know you mentioned that it was up this quarter, maybe if you can just provide a little bit more color on where it is now, and where do you think -- whether or not do you that can continue to increase over the course of the year?","Harold M. Messmer","So temp-to-perm conversions, while they were up modestly, which means just a few basis points, are still at the low end of the traditional range. And we still think have a lot of upside. The traditional range is 3% to 5%. We're still hovering at the low end of that range. We're just a little better in the first quarter than we were on the prior fourth quarter. And the trend line is good. It's a derivative of perm placement. There's full-time job demand, often behind temp-to-hire conversions just like there is perm, and we're bullish on conversions.","Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up on -- maybe just a little bit of nitpicking on the CapEx. It was a little bit lower this quarter, and I think you have mentioned $60 million to $70 million for the full year. Is that still your expectation? Maybe some reasons why it's been slightly lower.","M. Keith Waddell","So our expectations still is in the $60 million, $70 million range. CapEx is a little bit based on the timing of when expenditures get made, purchases get made. So I won't over read that it seems a little light. My guess is you'll see us catching up the balance of the year.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Healy from Northcoast Research.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","I was hoping you guys can give a little bit of color on the Protiviti business. I appreciate all the disclosures this quarter. But when I think about the business, the audit side of it, the technology side, and then the compliant side, can you provide some color on maybe how the business kind of breaks out today in those 3 buckets and maybe how that compares to maybe a few years ago?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, in a very broad sense, 7 or 8 years ago, almost 70% of Protiviti revenues were Sarbanes-Oxley related. And today, that's less than 20%. So they've effectively had to replace half of their revenue base in that time period. That gap has principally been filled with consulting services, which are now over half of Protiviti's revenues. And the 2 hottest areas of those consulting services are: IT consulting, be it security, be it IT-asset management; and FSI, risk and compliance. In the regulatory area, in the model-validation area, clearly with financial services firms, that otherwise have their issues, there's clearly remains a lot of demand and we think will continue to have a lot of demand in the compliance area.","Harold M. Messmer","That's all we have time for today. We appreciate your interest. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

For your convenience, we have published our prepared remarks for this conference call on the Robert Half website at www.roberthalf.com. Simply click on the Quarterly Conference Calls link from the home page of the Investor Center.","Now, let\u2019s discuss the second quarter. Second-quarter revenues were $1.16 billion, up 10% from the second quarter of 2013. Income per share was $0.55, up 21% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $105 million during the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $11 million. We paid an $0.18 quarterly cash dividend to shareholders on June 16, 2014, at a cost of $24 million. We also repurchased 500,000 Robert Half shares during the second quarter, at a cost of $21 million","Approximately 6.8 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan. We were pleased with Robert Half\u2019s performance in the second quarter. The company\u2019s growth was broad-based and reflective of improving labor markets and higher global demand for our professional staffing services.","Year-over-year revenue growth rates accelerated nicely during the quarter, both in the United States and in our international operations. Protiviti also continued to post very strong operating results. The highest sequential and year-over-year revenue growth rates were reported by our permanent placement operations and Protiviti. This was Robert Half\u2019s 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit net income and earnings-per-share growth on a year-over-year basis. Return on equity, on an unlevered basis, was 31% for the quarter.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed review of our second-quarter financial results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. Global revenues were $1.16 billion in the second quarter. This is up 10% year-over-year on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. Global staffing revenues were up 9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $772 million in the second quarter, up 10% on a same-day basis.","International staffing revenues were $242 million in the second quarter, up 4% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. We have 342 staffing locations worldwide, including 99 locations in 18 countries outside the United States. We had 63.2 billing days in the second quarter, compared to 63.5 days in the second quarter of 2013. This had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing growth rates by 0.6%.","The current quarter has 64.2 billing days, compared to 64.0 days in the third quarter a year-ago. Currency exchange rates increased second quarter year-over-year staffing revenues by $4 million and reported staffing growth rates by 0.4%. The strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling were partially offset by weaknesses in the Canadian and Aussie dollars. We provide a supplemental schedule of our earnings release that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for our various staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as on a same-day, constant-currency basis.","The schedule further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You can find the schedule in today\u2019s press release and in the investor center of our website. This is a non-GAAP financial measure. We provide it to give you information on certain revenue trends in our staffing operations.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $151 million in the second quarter, with $122 million in revenues in the United States and $29 million in revenues outside the United States. Global revenues for Protiviti were up 14% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis, with U.S. revenues up18% and non-U.S. revenues flat from the prior year. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.","Now turning now to gross margin: In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 36.5% of applicable revenues. This is up 40 basis points from the second quarter a year ago. Higher conversion revenues added 16 basis points to gross margin with the balance due to lower payroll tax and fringe benefits costs. The second quarters of 2014 and 2013 include workers\u2019 compensation credits of $900,000 and $300,000, respectively, pursuant to third-party reviews of our workers\u2019 compensation accruals. Second-quarter revenue were for our permanent placement operations were 10.1% of staffing revenues, compared to 9.7% of staffing revenues in the second quarter of 2013.","Together with the temporary and consulting gross margin previously discussed, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 70 basis points versus one year ago, to 43.0%. Second-quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $43 million, or 28.4% of Protiviti revenues, compared to $37 million, or 28.6% of Protiviti revenues, one year ago.","Staffing, Selling, General and Administrative Costs were 32.0% of staffing revenues in the second quarter versus 32.5% in last year\u2019s second quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 20.2% of Protiviti revenues in the second quarter versus 21.9% of Protiviti revenues reported this time last year.","Operating income from our staffing divisions was $111 million in the second quarter, or 11.0% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $89 million in operating income, or 9.7% of applicable revenues. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $22 million in the second quarter, or 21.8% of applicable revenues. Second-quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $13 million, or 8.2% of Protiviti revenues, compared to $9 million, or 6.7 % of its revenues, in the second quarter of 2013.","Protiviti operating profit increased 43% over the prior year. Our second quarter 2014 income tax rate increased to 39.2%, up from 37.3% in last year\u2019s second quarter. This was primarily due to fewer available unused foreign tax benefits. At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $617 million. Implied days sales outstanding was 48.2 days, compared to 47.7 days at the end of the second quarter a year ago.","Before we move to third-quarter guidance, let\u2019s review the trends we saw as we moved through the second quarter and so far into July. Our intra-quarter trends for the second quarter measured on a year-over-year and same-day, constant-currency basis were as follows: Global temporary and consulting division growth rates accelerated each month during the quarter, with the U.S. showing acceleration in April and June, and non-U.S. locations showing acceleration in April and May.","Global permanent placement division growth rates accelerated in April and May, then decelerated a bit in June. The U.S. reported accelerating growth rates in April, and non-U.S. locations reported accelerating growth rates in May.","For the first two weeks of July, revenues for our temporary and consulting operations were up 11% on a same-day, constant-currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 12% and non-U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 8%.","For the first three weeks of July, permanent placement revenues were up 6% on a same-day, constant-currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. perm revenues up 9% and non-U.S. perm revenues flat. We provide this information with the caveat that it is difficult to read a great deal into these trends given the short time periods they represent. We now offer the following third-quarter guidance:-Revenues $1,175,000,000 to $1,225,000,000 Income per share: $0.55 to $0.60. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Thank you, Keith. As noted earlier, we were pleased with the company\u2019s performance during the quarter. Revenue growth was broad-based as a result of improving labor markets in many of the countries where we do business. We\u2019ve seen notable improvement in Europe, for example. In the United States, the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since September 2008. The number of temporary workers as a percentage of total employment reached an all-time high in June, which means that companies are using temporary professionals as part of their staffing mix to a larger extent than ever before. The demand for skilled talent continues to outpace the supply in many of our specialty areas. Our strength is in helping companies locate and hire this hard-to-find talent. As a result, we saw greater demand for our professional staffing and recruitment services in the second quarter. This was the case among our small and midsize clients, in particular. These firms often lack an internal human resources function and turn to us for help filling their open temporary and full-time positions.","As noted earlier on the call, Protiviti also had another excellent quarter. We were pleased to see continued growth in IT consulting, risk and compliance, and internal audit, in addition to Protiviti\u2019s other service areas.","Protiviti has an excellent reputation in the marketplace and has developed a loyal client base. Better market conditions and a stricter regulatory environment also are contributing to the higher demand for Protiviti\u2019s consulting solutions ","At this time, Keith and I\u2019ll be happy to answer questions. We would request that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions).Your first question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Market. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Market","Good afternoon and congratulations on this strong quarter and outlook. If we just take -- I know you gave one quarter guidance but if we were to think about the next couple of years, you have revenue that\u2019s approaching the prior peak levels. Your temp margins still are at a reasonable amount below those peak margins, but how do we think about the ability for margins to trend, if we were to continue to see healthy revenues growth for a while? Are there any puts and takes versus the last cycle costs that have changed anything about the environment that would make it unlikely to exceed the prior margins or any commentary that will be helpful?","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. So, on the temp side our current margins are about 50 basis points below peak. That\u2019s notwithstanding, that conversions are at the lower end of 3% to 5% range, notwithstanding a little strength this quarter. So even to the midpoints you got 100 basis points of upside there. The fringe costs we have on our temporary payroll are high, now by 30 to 40 basis points primarily because of unemployment tax rates that are high post in the downturn that typically trail off as things improve.","Further, as the labor markets improved, there\u2019s typically wage pressure, that wage pressure so far and prior recoveries has allowed us to pass through not only that additional costs, but to expand our pay bill spreads as well. So, in our mind we have three sources of additional temp gross margin as we go forward. At the SG&A line, the traditional fixed cost, rent depreciation, administrative compensation, you typically lever as you move forward into recovery.","On the perm side, we had nice 20% plus operating margins this quarter. If you look back in history, we\u2019ve had periods of sustained operating margins of greater than 20% like at 2005, 2006, 2007. So we do think operating margins in the 20 plus percent range for permanent placement are sustainable and might even expand a bit as you lever the fixed cost of our recruiters, as you grow revenues. And then finally on Protiviti, while Protiviti\u2019s operating margins expanded this quarter to 8.2%. Our objective is to get them into at least double-digits. We saw that double-digits last quarter -- excuse me, in the fourth quarter of last year, we\u2019ve seen a nice progression so far this year, and our hope is that we get to a double-digit annualized operating margin in Protiviti.","So quite frankly we\u2019re pretty optimistic in all of the major segments of our business and as things improved not only will we benefit from the operating leverage of the additional revenues relative to our fixed costs, but we have other very discrete sources of additional operating margin improvement as well.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Market","Thanks for all that color.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Good evening, gentlemen. I wanted to ask about internal investment, your own staff. I remember in the first quarter you made some headcount additions. In the first quarter, it was more kind of holding steady on headcount additions, and I wondering where you stand on that now. Are we adding to our internal resources and if so what would be the SG&A effect when we get to the third quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","So, Andrew you\u2019re correct that in the first quarter we held headcounts fairly steady, although towards the backend of the first quarter, we did start adding more aggressively to staff. Given the revenue performance the demand we\u2019re now seeing, we do intent to ratchet up our headcounts in the second quarter. From a SG&A and margin impact that will have a modest negative impact on our incremental operating margins and that\u2019s measured on a year-over-year basis in Q3, but it won\u2019t be dramatic. So we still think we can report very nice incremental operating margins in Q3 not withstanding that we\u2019re going to ratchet to headcounts so given the strong demand environment that for quite frankly we are seeing on a global basis. Right.","Andrew Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan","And I just think you just mentioned any skill set and is it more temp versus perm?","M. Keith Waddell","","Well the skill sets that are the tightest from a supply standpoint are in the technology segment, the application developers, the data base, it\u2019s the higher level development side of technology and Management Resources, it\u2019s the higher level financial analysts, business systems analysts anything to do with regulatory compliance. So we are clearly beginning to see more chronic skill shortages that the past would say it\u2019s in those environments where we do best because we get our permanent placement fees and its harder for our clients to find candidates either full time or on a temporary basis, that\u2019s good for our temporary division while they feel there was orders temporarily while clients look for full time.","Andrew Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Perfect, thank you Keith.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","","Good afternoon and congratulations on the great results. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about two things. One, the trends that you are seeing internationally you mentioned Europe was stronger if there\u2019s any additional color that you can provide in terms of the countries that you are seeing that in. And then secondly, how we should think about RH Technology in terms of the potential growth rates that you could achieve there, that\u2019s the only area that didn\u2019t accelerate and I was wondering if there is anything specific that\u2019s occurring there, the results have been fantastic.","M. Keith Waddell","Okay on the international front we saw particular strength in the U.K. and on Australia we saw accelerating topline growth in Belgium, in Germany in France the only of our major six international countries that did not see acceleration was Canada that decelerated somewhat the labor markets up there aren\u2019t quite as robust as they are in the U.S. But five of our big six non-U.S. countries all had nice accelerating growth and that accelerating growth is baked into our guidance to continue accelerating even more.","As to Robert Half Technology, the growth rates while they did decelerate slightly from 9.5% to 8.5% they weren\u2019t bad clearly technology is in the area that is in most supply constraints. We felt like we got a little bit behind with the headcount and our recruiters and so part of what we did late first quarter and into excuse me, late second quarter and into this quarter is hiring more recruiters in technology as well as adding to headcount in their other divisions. But we felt like we got a little bit behind adding to recruit their internal staff which impacted our growth rates attached.","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thank you, good afternoon. The midpoint of your guidance suggest about 11% same day revenue growth which looks like it\u2019s pretty close to where temp was in July but over above where perm was. Does the guidance expect perm to improve versus what you saw in July, or is it you are keeping it where it is, and maybe strong growth and Protiviti will make up the difference?","M. Keith Waddell","","Well so I wont\u2019 get too carried away with a couple of three weeks of post quarter performance. I think if you go back and look in time and compare what hindsight, how did we start a quarter versus how did the whole quarter pan out while temp is -- the early start is more predictive than is perm, neither one of them is terribly predictive. When we did the midpoint of the guidance it shows some acceleration from what we reported and Q2 temp and perm, but not as much acceleration as is implied by our July start in temp and not the deceleration that would be implied if you look at our July start in perm. But again, if you go back and look with the benefit of hindsight, you would see that our post quarter perm results are the least predictive.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That makes sense, thanks. And then, turning to Protiviti 18% growth in the U.S. on a 10-day basis is very impressive. Can you talk a little bit more about where that\u2019s coming from. And maybe what percent of Protiviti work is now being done in conjunction with one of the temp groups? Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell","","Well Protiviti was very strong in the quarter and the nice part of that is the strength was very broad-based, internal audit did very well. IT consulting including security business continuity, application controls did very well and in financial services risk and compliance regulatory anti-money laundering, model validation they all performed quite well and it was very broad-based, and they were very encouraged by. As far as the work done in conjunction with our staffing divisions while we don\u2019t publish that exact percentage, we can tell you that the picture there is quite positive.","We have an ever-growing relationship between staffing and Protiviti that go to market together. Protiviti relies on staffing to provide staff when it doesn\u2019t and otherwise fill the positions internally. If you\u2019ll note Management Resources was particularly strong this quarter more so than any other division. Taking a page from Protiviti\u2019s playbook they had a lot of success in the financial services risk and regulatory area primarily anti-money laundering, so the strong demand that we see in Protiviti spills over to the strong demand we see in Management Resources as well. So we are very pleased not only with how Protiviti is doing in its own right, but also how it\u2019s partnering with our staffing divisions in going to market.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks so much. Sorry to focus on a small negative, but it looks like your Protiviti gross margins declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. Can you just give us a little bit of color why that happened, and is that something we expect to continue for the rest of the year?","M. Keith Waddell","","So Jeff that happened because Protiviti has added some higher level Managing Director to their cost structure in these high areas of their practice and in the short term that depresses gross margin we think in the long term will do just the opposite. So for Protiviti to get the double digit operating margins that it aspires to, that\u2019s got to come primarily from expanding gross margins. And we are very committed to seeing that happen but in the short term sometimes you make investment hires and particularly at the Managing Director levels that depress your reported gross margins a little bit.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. That makes sense. Just the quick numbers questions. What are you budgeting for capital spending for the year and what should we expect for tax rates?","M. Keith Waddell","The tax rates would be in the 39% range maybe a little higher and maybe a little lower, call it plus or minus half a point. And on the CapEx side we typically back load our CapEx, so we spend $23 million so far I think the range we gave was $50 million to $60 million earlier maybe would be towards the low end of that range, but that\u2019s in a range.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","Okay. Great, thanks so much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Thank you very much. I am interested to know what you feel like the bill rate environment may materialize, and how it may evolve over the next couple quarters, given that the demand environment is improving. And how you feel about your ability to harness those rising bill rates, and retain them in your gross margins versus prior cycles? Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. So the good news on Bill rates is that whereas last quarter bill rates were up 2.6% year-over-year, this quarter bill rates are up 3.5% year-over-year. So we are beginning to see some wage inflation. Typically that\u2019s a good thing for our business and our expansion of gross margins as we talked about earlier. We\u2019re optimistic that higher wage rates mean higher bill rates, which means, higher pay bill spreads. If you look back in the last cycle, we had four or five years of uninterrupted mid single-digit inflation that allowed us to expand our pay bill spreads and we haven\u2019t even gotten into that sweet spot yet. We\u2019re certainly moving into right direction.","If you look at the last three quarters, year-over-year we were up 1.7% then we were up 2.6% and now we\u2019re up 3.5%, so its clearly going into right direction, but it still below the sweet spot that we\u2019ve experienced in the past and when we\u2019ve gotten to that sweet spot in the past, we stayed there four, five years. So we\u2019re quite -- we feel quite good about that and we feel quite good about our ability to manage and hopefully expand gross margins as we move forward in time.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Appreciate that. In terms of your efforts on the technology side, are you satisfied the Company is keeping up with the market rate of growth, and do you have any intentions to substantially increase the number of recruiters you have there, or do you feel like you've been kind of feeding the fire there, with fuel over the last several quarters and years, so that you're in position to grow as you would like?","M. Keith Waddell","You\u2019d always like more growth whatever it is and clearly technology, the demand is not a problem as we speak. The issue is recruiting the candidates. And as we said a few minutes ago, we got a little bit behind in adding to recruiters internally, and we\u2019re ramping that up somewhat. It\u2019s a long race rather than higher huge numbers and then digest them over time, our style is to do it more steadily as you go along. We are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in technology.","We feel like the demand that in prior years was primarily focused on larger companies particularly in application development has now drifted down to our middle market sweet spot, which gives us a unique opportunity. At the moment, demand isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is getting the candidates. And as I said earlier, we\u2019re in the process of adding to our recruiter base. But more growth is always better and what the market is for technology staffing services, for companies that service middle market companies who knows what that market is.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randle Reece with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.","Randle Reece - Avondale Partners","Good afternoon. I wanted to talk about the level of conservatism of your guidance, over time. Just looking at the past few quarters, how have the moving parts changed in how you roll up your guidance? How many pieces are out-performing now? Is there some core that's driving the out-performance or have you seen a broadening of success?","M. Keith Waddell","Well I think for this quarter particularly its pretty broad based, if you look in the U.S., you like at temp, you look perm, you look at non-U.S., you look at temp, you look at perm, you look at Protiviti, quite frankly it just broad-based, as I can remember the out performance. But it changes quarter-by-quarter and every quarter we do our best to give a range of where we think we\u2019ll perform and within that range we\u2019ve done reasonable well.","Randle Reece - Avondale Partners","There's a piece that I've a hard time understanding, and we all do, I guess. Within the brands, between U.S. and other markets, if there is a hot spot, or something that really blew out your expectations, and I would think Accountemps was it this quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I\u2019d say it was two-fold. Accountemps was a very broad-based three yards and cloud of dust, every little small business, every market there was better demand. In Management Resources where the growth rate accelerate at the most, it was most related to risk and regulatory related assignments at some larger financial institutions that were more discrete and more limited to a smaller number of clients. But Accountemps was very broad-based led by Texas and California, but frankly virtually every market improved.","Randle Reece - Avondale Partners","In Management Resources, do you have much participation outside U.S. in terms of regulatory demand?","M. Keith Waddell","We participate. We certainly don\u2019t participate to the extent we do in the United States and we also have the greater possibility of collaboration with Protiviti with financial service firms in the US where we have more Protiviti exposure to financial services.","Randle Reece - Avondale Partners","Within your guidance range for this quarter, is there more play in your assumptions for temp or perm?","M. Keith Waddell","More play, it\u2019s hard to react to. perm seasonally is typically flat relative to the second quarter. Perm outside the U.S. typically is impacted by August in Europe which is a heavy vacation month. So perm overall is usually flattish. On the temp side, again the summary months are pretty much flat with the prior quarter. It starts to get better seasonally toward the end of the third quarter. So I\u2019m not sure how to react to where there is more play perm is always a bit more volatile and harder to forecast than as temp, but that\u2019s not unique now, that\u2019s always been the case.","Randle Reece - Avondale Partners","Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how the heck I\u2019m going to get into your guidance range. Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell","Be gentle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair Inc. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh - William Blair Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I guess, just somewhat following up on some of the prior questions there, the Accountemps and strength in Management Resources, I guess, on the Management Resources side, how much of -- what's the length or the sustainability of some of the upside there, some of those large regulatory projects can flash and burn kind of quickly. Does it feel more sustained, or are there any large projects that we have to be aware of, that drove some of the acceleration there?","M. Keith Waddell","There are some large projects in Management Resources and the duration of those projects is unknown. So there is some risk that they fall off more discretely than our other projects typically would. I mean, as we sit today we don\u2019t see that on the horizon, but the nature of the business is such that could be the case. But from an overall consolidated standpoint Management Resources isn\u2019t going to move -- if one of those projects falls off its not going to moved overall needle in a huge way.","Tim McHugh - William Blair Inc.","Okay. Is it fair to say it\u2019s not on the order of magnitude of the mortgage related projects that you kind of just finish comping against or are they -- is it that big of an impact?","M. Keith Waddell","It\u2019s not on that order of magnitude, but from Management Resources only standpoint, it definitely move the needle relative to that line of business.","Tim McHugh - William Blair Inc.","Okay. And then as Europe is getting better here, how should we think about the profitability of Europe relative to the U.S. And I guess, in the context of how much room is there for leverage as that comes back as we think about that as a driver of margins in the next couple of years here. I mean, is there a fair amount of I guess, underutilized capacity that you can leverage as that bounces back?","M. Keith Waddell","Well I think the biggest upside is the fact that Europe we have more exposure to perm placement that we do in the United States. And Europe has more operating leverage inherently than is the case in temp. So as Europe improve, perm will improve and if perm improves you\u2019ll enjoy the higher operating margins we get from the perm business. Further as Europe improves you\u2019ll see more temp expansion in Belgium and in Germany where we get better temp margins than we do in our non-U.S. locations overall. So I do think there\u2019s some margin expansion that we could get from Europe for the reasons I just mentioned. I wouldn\u2019t however place a lot of weight on that we have a lot of excess capacity with our existing staff in Europe, because quite frankly we managed those headcounts fairly, aggressively in the downturn, so there\u2019s not a huge amount of capacity utilization benefit to get as Europe improves. We would instead have to add heads, but probably not disproportionate to the revenues.","Tim McHugh - William Blair Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Hi. This is Anj Singh dialing in for Hamzah. I was just wondering on a broader level. If you can comment on the temp penetration rates, you spoke to earlier. We know they\u2019ve reached or surpassed prior peaks without really a strong cyclical driver. I was wondering if you have view as to what sort of rates might be reasonable to expect in this cycle or what your general view might be as to what we might seen the cycle?","M. Keith Waddell","Without giving a specific percentage, we\u2019ve long held that temp penetration rate recovery has been principally secular to this point. The percentage of new jobs represented by temp jobs is much higher; in fact, double what it was in the prior recovery. And we therefore think what is ahead of us is the penetration benefit you typically get from a cyclical recovery of which we\u2019re seeing very little so far. So we\u2019re quite bullish that temp penetration rates for the entire industry and for us more specifically have the potential to go much higher than where they are.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you. And one quick follow-up on perm if I may. I was wondering where you are seeing most of your strength internationally. It seems like in Europe the environment there still hasn\u2019t quite recovered enough to have perm growth there and earnest. Wondering what you\u2019re seeing as far as perm growth or perm strength in Europe?","M. Keith Waddell","Actually it\u2019s a very easy question to answer, because the U.K. is actually in a league of its own. As far as perm growth rates for Europe broadly defined. We\u2019ve made decision some time ago to focus and provide resources to grow our permanent placement in the U.K. and it\u2019s paid off quite nicely and we had very significant growth in this quarter and project in the next quarter for perm in the U.K.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin D. McVeigh with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Great, thanks. Hey, Keith, I think one of the big differences this cycle is Protiviti seems like it set up to peak in conjunction with the rest of the segments as oppose to two years earlier last cycle. As you think about that from an EPS contribution, how are we thinking about that number one, as we get later into this cycle. And then, if you can, how exposure does MRI, Management Resources, have Protiviti today versus the last cycle kind of 2005, 2006?","M. Keith Waddell","Okay. So, we\u2019ve told you that we wand to get Protiviti\u2019s operating margins to double-digit. So, given that you can model the EPS benefit to the total you get versus in the last peak for the company it was a post SOX, it was during a SOX fatigue period where Protiviti didn\u2019t contribute much to the bottom line. So, I think you can do your own math if you start with the model that has low double-digit Protiviti operating margins.","As far as the exposure or the cost selling between Management Resources and Protiviti now versus last cycle, clearly one Protiviti users Management Resources are contractors and staff on a much larger percentage of their engagements today than is the case back in the last cycle. And in those situations by the way, the revenues are reported by Protiviti. So Protiviti has a client and lets say they have five staff on their engagement and one of those five is from Management Resources. In the numbers you see all of that revenue was reported as Protiviti and none of that revenue was reported as Management Resources. So Protiviti is clearly using more Management Resources staff on their engagements generally today than they were in the last cycle. You see that in Protiviti Management Resources is exclusive of any inter company activity with Protiviti.","In addition the situations where Protiviti and Management Resources go to market together they literally join together and make a client visit and sell the four enterprises all the way from staff augmentation before outsourcing. There it\u2019s a matter of who has the client relationship following from that meeting, following from those approaches and that the division that has a relationship is the division that reports the revenue.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then if you gave this, I missed it but how were conversions trending in the quarter and it sounds like these lag a little bit relative to the rest of perm, any reason for that?","M. Keith Waddell","Conversions are improving. We reported that I think it was they are up, they accounted for 16 basis points of the gross margin improvement. But they are still at the low end of the 3% to 5% of revenue, maybe not the absolute low but they have come off, they are off the bottom but still low traditionally. You know perm and conversions march through their own drummers, they don\u2019t necessarily go hand-in-hand but generally as one improves the other improves. So we don\u2019t feel differently about the future for conversions than we do for the future of perm itself. We think it was upside there.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Super, thanks.","Operator","","Our final question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","","Hi, just one quick follow up. Despite the return of cash that you are doing in the dividend, the buyback, the cash balance keeps growing. I guess you know as we think out looking forward is the mix that you\u2019ve had the last two years between the way you\u2019ve grown the dividend and use excess cash for buybacks. Is that a level you are comfortable with? Would you think about maybe you know raising the dividend a bit more, any commentary on how you are thinking about that? Thank you.","M. Keith Waddell","Also the cash balance has grown a little bit if you look for the first six months, I think we spend about 80% of our free cash flow on some combination of dividends and repurchases. So we\u2019re a little wide of 100% but not you know significantly in light of that. As for the mix of dividends and buybacks I think if you look at the last few years, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve grown the mix related to dividends a bit and while this is a decision our board makes every year, I think it would be reasonable to expect that overtime we tend to favor dividends or little more, but you know 50:50, 40:60, 55:45 it\u2019s not grossly out of balance.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Harold M.

From the AboutUs tab, go to our Investor Center where you will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link.","Now, let\u2019s review our third quarter results. Revenues in the third quarter were $1.31 billion, up 7% from the same period one-year ago on a reported basis, or up 11% adjusted for currency. Income per share was $0.73, up 16% from this time last year. Cash flow from operations was $94 million. Capital expenditures were $19 million.","During the quarter, we returned $25 million in cash to our shareholders through a dividend of $0.20 per share. And we also repurchased 1.6 million Robert Half shares, for $82 million. There are approximately 1.8 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","Improving labor markets, particularly in the United States, contributed to higher demand for Robert Half\u2019s professional staffing and consulting services during the third quarter. Consolidated quarterly revenues reached record levels, fueled by strong results from Protiviti, Robert Half Technology and our permanent placement operations. Protiviti had an outstanding quarter, with revenues up 23% from one-year ago when adjusted for currency.","This was Robert Half's 22nd straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share growth on a year-over-year percentage basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 38%.","I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our third quarter results.","Keith Waddell","As Max noted, global revenues were $1.31 billion in the third quarter. This is up 7% from the third quarter of 2014 on a reported basis, and up 11% on a currency-adjusted basis. Third quarter staffing revenues were up 9% percent on a currency-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $891 million in the third quarter, up 10%","Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $220 million, up 4% when adjusted for currency. We have 332 staffing locations world-wide, including 92 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S. third quarter had 64.2 billing days, the same number of days as the third quarter a year ago.","The current fourth quarter has 62.3 billing days, compared to 61.7 billing days in the fourth quarter of last year. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates for our staffing lines of business on both a reported and same-day, currency-adjusted basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our staffing operations.","Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year staffing revenues by $40 million in the third quarter, and reducing year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 4%. Global revenues for Protiviti were $202 million in the third quarter, with $172 million in revenues in the United States and $30 million in revenues outside the U.S.","Protiviti revenues were up 23% year-over-year on a currency-adjusted basis. U.S. revenues were up 25% and non-U.S. revenues were up 16% from the prior year when adjusted for currency. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $5 million in the third quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rates by 3%.","Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the third quarter was 37.3% of applicable revenues. This is a 40 basis point improvement from the same period a year ago. The improvement includes higher pay\/bill spreads, higher temp-to-hire conversion fees, and lower insurance and payroll tax costs.","Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.0% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is slightly higher than last year\u2019s 9.7%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 50 basis points versus year ago, to 43.5%. Third quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $66 million, or 32.9% of Protiviti revenues.","Gross margin a year ago was $51 million, or 30.5% of Protiviti revenues. Staffing SG&A costs were 32.1% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 31.7% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase relates largely to a higher number of internal field staff and the related compensation costs. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.2% of Protiviti revenues in the third quarter compared to 19% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.","Operating income from our staffing divisions was $127 million in the third quarter, up 7% from the prior year. Operating margin was 11.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $103 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 10.3%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $24 million in the third quarter, up 14% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 22%.","Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $32million, an increase of 65% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 15.7%. Accounts receivable at the end of the third quarter were $731 million. Implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 50.7 days.","Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let\u2019s review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter, and so far in October, all adjusted for currency. Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions decelerated slightly over the course of the third quarter. We exited the quarter with September growing at 7%, as compared to 8% for the full quarter.","Revenue growth for the first two weeks of October picked up slightly to 9% compared to the prior year. Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated throughout the quarter, with September revenues growing at 10%, as compared to 14% for the full quarter. For the first three weeks of October, permanent placement revenues increased 3% compared to the same period last year.","Overall, U.S. versus non-U.S. trends were not materially different, except for permanent placement revenues during the first three weeks of October. Non-U.S. perm started slowly, with a negative 14% growth rate during this short, three-week period. We provide this snapshot to give you additional insight into trends we saw during the third quarter and so far in October, but, as you know, it is difficult to read a great deal into these numbers given the short time periods they represent.","With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance, revenues $1.285 billion to $1.335 billion, income per share, $0.67 to $0.72. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 7% on a reported basis, or 10% adjusted for currency, and EPS growth of 12%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold Messmer","Thank you, Keith. As we noted at the start of the call, we continue to see healthy demand for our services across the board. And we believe we have a number of reasons to be optimistic about our prospects for further growth: Economic trends are in our favor. In the United States, the unemployment rate hit its lowest level in seven years in August and remained there in September.","The four-week moving average for initial jobless claims is near a 42-year low. Non-U.S. markets also are improving, particularly in Europe. The unemployment rate in the United Kingdom recently hit a seven-year low. Technology remains the hottest segment of staffing both here and abroad. We are investing in Robert Half Technology to take advantage of this demand. It\u2019s not just technology however there is a widening skills gap in a number of our other professional specialty areas that has many employers struggling to find the talent they need.","This presents us with the opportunity to partner with them to locate these workers. And that is precisely what our field teams are doing right now. We are extremely pleased with how well our Protiviti business is doing. Protiviti has successfully diversified its service offerings and is being rewarded with broad-based growth in three of its major consulting segments, internal audit and financial advisory services; risk and compliance; and information technology consulting.","This is a business with a loyal and growing client base. At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. We would request that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call, if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, gent. A lot of people are thinking about wage inflation in the United States. Do you think it\u2019s picked up recently I know you said you were able to improve your spreads on bill rate, pay rate. Could you talk about what the bill rate, pay rate increased and if there is a conducive environment for Robert Half as it comes to kind of spreads moving forward?","Keith Waddell","So Andrew on a global basis our bill rates were up 4.6% year-over-year, on a global basis that's down slightly from last quarter's 4.7%.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay.","Keith Waddell","Pay rates were up less and therefore the spreads widened. However, if you look just at the U.S., U.S. bill rates were actually up a tick versus the third quarter and that was offset by non-U.S. bill rates being down a tick. As to is this a conducive environment the answer is absolutely we\u2019ve spoken many times about as candidates gets tighter, clients place a larger premium on recruiting, that allows us to pass through not only the higher pay rate but to get a little more spread as well.","Andrew Steinerman","Great. And those comments you just made include Protiviti or don\u2019t include Protiviti and maybe could you make a Protiviti comment, when it comes to a similar attribute?","Keith Waddell","So the rates I gave were staffing only I would say if anything the market conditions for Protiviti are even stronger than is the case for staffing as the results indicate and those conditions are also conducive to margin expansion, which has occurred very nicely over the course of this year and our hope is continues to proceed next year although have not quite the same pace given the much tougher comps.","Andrew Steinerman","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird.","Mark Marcon","Good afternoon. I\u2019ve got two questions, one is just related to Accountemps and RH Technology with regards to you know we saw a slight level of deceleration in terms of the year-over-year growth rates. But the sequential trends compared to most years was inline. And so I'm wondering if you would characterize the slowdown is basically being primarily a function of going up against tougher comps? Or if you think that it\u2019s you know if there are some areas that do seem to be slowing within the U.S. from your perspective?","Harold Messmer","So I would make a couple of comments. First of all the month of August was weaker for us than usual not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S. as well, as everyone knows in Continental Europe August is a holiday month.","We certainly saw more holiday impact in Europe particularly France this year than we typically do. But also in the U.S. August was little softer than we thought whether that's because of the market decline in the sentiment that resulted from that whether that's because it's holiday vacation season to some extent in the U.S. as well, it's hard to say, but we did see a softer August. The good news is we bounce back from that nicely in September and that bounce back has been confirmed and actually gotten a little better so far in October. So we feel good about that.","In addition the comps had gotten tougher and our deceleration was less than the amount by which the comps got tougher. On the comps front the good news is for the fourth quarter we\u2019re now in for the temp business, the comps are only one point tougher versus a year ago, whereas in the last few quarters, the comps had accelerated by much more than that.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then with regards to Protiviti, can you just talk a little bit about the profitability level there, it\u2019s fantastic obviously. And just wondering how sustainable the current level is obviously your seasonality, but could you give us some comments in terms of how to think about it going forward both for the fourth quarter and the foreseeable future?","Harold Messmer","All I guess I first have to observe, it's quite the difference versus the past or the questions where will you ever get to double-digits in operating margins. And now the questions are once you\u2019ve gotten there can you sustain it and Andrew much rather have the latter question in the former.","Mark Marcon","Glad to provide it.","Harold Messmer","The truth is we do believe the Protiviti operating margins are sustainable. Clearly, the third quarter seasonally is Protiviti strongest quarter so third quarter alone operating margins at mid-teens aren\u2019t total year operating margins. But as we\u2019ve said for a long time low-to-mid double-digit operating margins, we do think are sustainable.","If anything this year has proven that out, we do think there is room if you look at year-to-date for improvement in 2016, but the rate of improvement can't be the same rate of improvement you've seen this year. Said simply we\u2019re delighted with the operating margin improvement we've seen at Protiviti, we\u2019re delighted with Protiviti period. And the operating margins have come into the range that we've long expected and we think they can stay there.","Mark Marcon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Timothy McHugh","Thanks. Just want to ask about the staffing SG&A and I guess if I missed it I apologize, but what was kind of the field staff headcount growth this quarter and I guess just a little more color on how you are thinking about the investment in that and whether this is more of a medium-term trend where we should see SG&A growing faster than revenue as you\u2019re just investing faster in expansion or if it\u2019s just kind of a short-term ramp up type of trend.","Harold Messmer","The simple answer is that it\u2019s mostly a short-term ramp-up. We've added the headcount in the second half much more aggressively than we did in the first half. The same is true a year ago as well. The hiring we\u2019ve done to second half of this year has been very broad-based temp line of businesses as well as perm principal U.S. a little bit of non-U.S. primarily Germany.","The first quarter expectation would be that our headcount additions would moderate as was the case a year-ago. And the headcount additions be more targeted to technology and permanent placement or we have greater growth and we think we have a greater prospects for growth.","So SG&A, there is currently been a bulge as a percent of revenue in the third and has expected to carry into the fourth quarter, but we expect that to moderate in the first quarter and if you look a year ago to some extent the same happened.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in management resources if it is simple as a tough comparison or are there other factors that drove the slower growth there?","Harold Messmer","Well, it\u2019s principally tougher comparisons again from our staffing line of business standpoint. Our management resources had very tough comparison so a year ago as an example, our management resources grew 18% on a same-day constant currency basis. The fourth quarter comp is 17% and those are leaps and bounds tougher comparisons than any other line of business.","Sequentially, we were quite encouraged what our management resources did in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter the comparison start to get a little easier for management resources, because they had a few larger projects fall off in the fourth quarter a year ago. So we feel pretty solid about management resources.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Henry Chien","Hi, good afternoon. It\u2019s Henry Chien calling for Jeff. I just had a question on your share repurchases, it looks like that picked up a bit in the quarter just wondering how you are thinking about share repurchases for the next quarter and any change in how you are looking at capital allocation going forward? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","There is no real change and how we are looking at capital allocation. So we are still looking to return our free cash flow to shareholders and we've done that for many, many years. We got a little more aggressive this quarter as the price was more conducive to do so.","Over the last 10 years I think we\u2019ve shrunk our share count almost 25% and that's been a steady as you go every quarter returning excess cash flow to shareholders first through dividends and the residual through repurchases, but there is no new direction and there is no new news as it relates to capital allocation. We continue to be very proud of our return on equity and return on invested capital which was high 30% which is pretty incredible.","Henry Chien","Got it. Okay and I was curious to know if you have any thoughts on what\u2019s driving some of the acceleration in the temp and consulting from September to October that you mentioned in your guidance just wonder if any thoughts there. Thanks.","Harold Messmer","Well, so maybe I take the opportunity to expand a little more broadly on our guidance and then I'll come back more specifically to temp acceleration. If you look at our guidance for the full fourth quarter, our guidance assumes at midpoint a little bit of temp deceleration. This is all on our constant currency basis. It assumes a little bit of deceleration less than a point on comps that get tougher by a point.","As you just mentioned our October start is better than that and we would love to that for that to hold so we\u2019ve been a little more conservative than our start. If you look at perm midpoint guidance, we look for those growth rates to be stable to a small acceleration and there the comps are neutral.","The October start as we said many times the perm start that shorter period of time is particularly not predictive outside the U.S. even within perm is less predictive, so we are not at all swayed in our thoughts about the full quarter based on the slow start we had primarily outside the U.S. in perm so far this quarter.","Protiviti, we see some deceleration in the growth rate to a high-teen percentage which is still great because of there the comps are monster comps. If you go back a year ago you'll find that Protiviti had a couple of very large jobs that continued right to the end of year. Typically Protiviti is more impacted on a sequential basis by the holidays where their clients take time off that encourages our staff to take time off and the staff takes time off anyway. So decelerating, but decelerating to high-teens that's a high-class problem to have where we are.","Temp gross margin we think we will continue to expand on a year-over-year basis, better markups, lower fringe cost. We think there is 30 to 50 basis points of improvement there year-over-year. SG&A as we mentioned earlier the more aggressive hiring we\u2019ve done in the second or first of all in the third quarter will continue into the fourth quarter you\u2019ve got the carryover of the third quarter plus you\u2019ve got some new fourth quarter hiring.","We think those moderate in the first quarter as we talk. So we see SG&A being up 50 to 80 basis points effectively funded by the funding pool for that are the higher gross margins. If you look at operating margins again we\u2019re talking midpoint, staffing flat to up slightly as the headcount investments offset the expanding gross margins.","Protiviti we think the operating margins will be up nicely year-over-year given the content the momentum into the quarter. But on a sequential basis because of the short quarter as we talked about sequentially the operating margins for Protiviti was down.","Tax rate, our tax rate assumption for our fourth quarter midpoint is mid-38 let\u2019s call it 38.5% that compares negatively to a year ago or our fourth quarter tax rate was 37%. And again the issue was the timing of foreign and other tax credits. The tax rate differential alone, cost is about $0.002 a share in our guidance.","EPS midpoint $0.70, up 12% as we talked about earlier. If you equalize the tax rates, it would be up 15%. Sequentially, EPS would be down $0.003 that are midpoint that compares to sequentially being down $0.001 a year ago. Keep in mind a year ago we had a $0.001 worker's comp credit. We haven't dialed anything in for this year. The typical semiannual review was still pending a year ago. Sequentially, Protiviti had a monster quarter versus the past.","And additionally from a tax rate standpoint looking sequentially, a year ago, there was more tax rate relief third quarter to fourth than we expect this year third quarter to fourth. So that's long-winded but that tries to give you some color on how we come up with guidance. We feel good about where the business is, we feel good about where the momentum is. August was the low watermark, we've improved from that, we feel good as late as last week about the bounce we've gotten from those August lows.","So when you talk about our start acceleration in temp, we feel good about that. But it's only a week and a half, we called it two weeks, but it's really a week and half. So you can't get too carried away on a week and a half, but you would rather be better than be worse. And it certainly better than what we forecast for the full quarter.","Henry Chien","Got it. Okay thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. First question, were there areas in the third-quarter revenue where you were either negatively or positively surprised?","Harold Messmer","I would say generally as I just said August was softer than we expected, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Nothing else sticks out as being dramatically different than we expected. Management resources probably a little better than what we expected. Continental Europe a little worse, we expected Canada to be weak because of energy, we expected Australia to be weak because of energy. We didn't expect the France holiday impact to be more severe than normal. So but by line of business there were no big stories there other than what I just said.","Sara Gubins","Okay, great. And separately, could you talk a bit about the type of work in technology where you are seeing stronger demand in your ability to find people with those skills?","Harold Messmer","Well, we've talked about before how the tech development, the engineers, the programmers, the analysts, the web developers, that those type of positions have become relevant to middle market companies, which is our sweet spot with mobile, with the web, with the cloud. And therefore, we see much more growth at those higher level positions with higher bill rates than we do at the tech-support level, not that the tech-support level is doing poorly.","So we\u2019re quite pleased that we\u2019ve been able to recruit people into those kinds of positions with our middle market client base and it is recruiting difficult, absolutely it is. And it\u2019s been difficult for some time, but our candidate short market is our market we prefer because we can better distinguish our capabilities versus the other firms.","Sara Gubins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you. Was there an appreciable difference in the growth rate between the Creative business in the overall reported segments, or did they both kind of decelerate in the quarter?","Harold Messmer","Well, we don't break out the results of our creative business. It's doing very well particularly at the intersection of digital marketing and technology I think everybody in the business would confirm that\u2019s the hottest part of that business. So we have very substantial growth rates in our creative group and we\u2019re very pleased with its results, but those aren\u2019t results that we breakout.","Tobey Sommer","Okay. Could you give us any color or numbers, however you prefer, on the rate of internal hiring in the change here in the back half of the year versus maybe how you had been running in the first half of the year? Thank you.","Harold Messmer","There is a pretty dramatic difference. The growth in the first half of the year is pretty modest and that's in part because of the prior back half of the year we\u2019ve added to have the capacity to grow for the following full-year. So once again we back loaded our hiring this year to have capacity for growth into next calendar year and the prospects as we see them today for 2016 which is the next calendar year are still solid and therefore we continue to add to internal capacity in the third quarter, which will continue into the fourth.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you very much.","Harold Messmer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Reece from Avondale Partners.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is Ben on for Randy. First thing, you touched on the UK staffing market slowing down a bit. I'm just curious if there's a meaningful drag on results and guidance or if it's negligible?","Keith Waddell","The UK is not a drag, the two highlights of our non-U.S. results would be Germany and to a lesser extent the UK, but the UK has been solid for a while and remain solid and it is expected to remain solid. And if we go around the globe we've already talked about Canada and Australia being weaker due to energy.","We\u2019ve talked about France having a very tough August holiday, Germany great again, prospects for Germany great again, UK is solid.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then one more question on Protiviti. You had mentioned some comp issues potentially I\u2019m just \u2013 well first and foremost I\u2019m curious about what kind of engagements are out right now within the different sorts of things you are doing there. And then also looking out to 2016 and beyond how should we think about modeling this in terms of looking at these comps?","Keith Waddell","The good news about Protiviti\u2019s growth is it\u2019s actually quite balanced between internal audit and financial controls, technology controls and financial services, risk and compliance. All three of them continued to do very well. The PCAOB continues to issue its inspection reports and say to the big four accounting firms you need to do more, there's been communications from the PCAOB as late as last week that confirms yet again.","One of the problem areas is how companies document their internal controls or guess what, that's right in our sweets pot. You look at technology, technology infrastructure, technology security, you don't wake up a day anymore whether in the technology security article breach something all of which drive demand for technology security consulting.","And similarly financial services, regulatory compliance we've talked many times about our two subspecialties there that are the largest our anti-money laundering and consumer lending and both of those areas continue very strong. And the good news even there is financial institution the projects are somewhat different, it's not single threaded, it\u2019s not the same thing everywhere. So there is even some diversity for the same types of engagements client to client.","So we feel very good about the balance that we have in Protiviti with the three large solution areas that I talked about. There were other smaller solution areas data analytics that\u2019s coming on, but it\u2019s small. So we feel very good about the prospects for Protiviti in 2016, but if you look at the comps there and they have anniversary 20% on 20% on 20% on 20%. So for that to slowdown to the mid-teens as we talked earlier we think is a high-class problem to have particularly as you see those operating margins expanding into the zone that we expect and currently enjoy.","Unidentified Analyst","Gotcha. Just a quick follow-up on that have you seen anything yet in terms of the changes that are coming in revenue recognition? Have you seen any work coming online from that or is that still bitterly?","Harold Messmer","We don\u2019t see anything significant yet. The whole thing I believe is push-off to 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Correct yes.","Harold Messmer","So some companies are beginning to do diagnostics, but certainly there isn't any reported revenue that moves the needle, but it certainly is nice to have that potential new revenue stream to whatever extent it exist in addition to the revenue streams that we just talked about.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I realize you referenced higher temp to perm conversion fees in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you could share what that figure was how that trended year-over-year and sequentially and then if you could maybe elaborate on your thoughts with regards to perm growth rates that are sustainable based on what you're seeing in the business?","Keith Waddell","Sure, so year-over-year conversions I believe were up 10 basis points, excuse me here while I\u2019ll look at my notes they were 3.2% this year third quarter a year ago there were 3.1. Note that sequentially they were down 20 basis points. That's not unusual and it also coincides with if you look at perm placement mix as a percentage of revenue it often declines in the third quarter sequentially versus the second.","So full time hiring during the summer isn\u2019t the most robust and so the first derivative being temp to hire full time hiring is similarly impacted. So year-over-year were up 10 basis points sequentially were down 20, but not particularly concerning.","Anjaneya Singh","Got it. And a little bit on your recruiters could you discuss how recruiter tenure and turnover are currently trending especially in light of the ramp-up and hires. Just trying to get a sense of what the average recruiter productivity looks like and perhaps how that's being managed internally?","Harold Messmer","There is a lot there. I would say there haven\u2019t been dramatic swings in either tenure or turnover clearly as you ramp-up hiring and as we've long talked about we are a pretty demanding team to make most of our turnover as early and say if you have more people early you're going to have more turnover attached to that, but adjusted for the higher mix of newer people, there's not a lot to say in changes in turnover or tenure. And again as we\u2019ve said many times after that first couple of three years our tenure is outstanding and that continues to this moment that we speak.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys good afternoon. I just wanted to - I realize tougher comps is a lot of the deceleration you're seeing, but we've also clearly seen deceleration in total U.S. employment and temp data throughout the summer. I guess is there anything you can talk about what you're hearing from your clients around demand, how they are thinking about project demand? Any signs of getting into later innings of the cycle that you have seen in past cycles that are popping up, or just any color on the macro would be helpful.","Harold Messmer","Well, I guess we would observe it\u2019s still a candidate short market. The wage rate inflation is accelerating not decelerating in the U.S. and we think that speaks volumes about the health of the labor markets as it relates to the white-collar professions where we specialize. Much of the overall data you quote, and particularly the temp staffing overall data, is very light industrial and lower-end clerical centric, so not terribly transferable to how we are doing. But from where we stand the labor markets are still solid they are very solid and it\u2019s still primarily about recruiting candidates and that per se says the demand environment is strong.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great. And then on Protiviti, obviously it's just been a terrific performer for a number of years now. How do you think about the market opportunity for this as we think over the next few years? Are you already doing business with the vast majority of the Fortune 1000 type customers you target here, or is the still very much a penetration story? Where are you in that evolution of the business? Thank you.","Harold Messmer","Protiviti competes primarily with the Big Four. And relative to the size and penetration of the Big Four, Protiviti barely registers not only with respect to the number of the Fortune 1000 they do business with, which is impressive, but certainly not the majority, but further the types of projects they have at those clients, the depth of penetration that they have at those clients. We\u2019re very proud of the Protiviti brand recognition. We've attained at the C-suite particularly the Chief Audit Executive, which they target primarily and the progress they've made there.","So we feel good about the market opportunity with Protiviti, particularly relative to the Big Four, with the trends toward independence, with the trends toward financial services regulatory compliance, where Protiviti has developed quite a brand identity. So we couldn\u2019t feel better about where Protiviti is, and we couldn't feel better about its market opportunity not that isn\u2019t developing other solution areas in the lab while small also provide for future opportunity.","Gary Bisbee","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Thanks, good afternoon. You're seeing very strong growth in your perm business. Can you look back at prior cycles and tell us when perm begins to pick up in growth similar to what you're seeing? How does that correspond to where in the temp cycle you are?","Harold Messmer","Well, so I\u2019m trying to process a little bit exactly what your question is. So Perm in a down cycle always gets impacted more than temp does. In a recovery cycle, perm bounces back off a lower start and the growth rates are typically more than temp. Full time hiring takes a bigger hit than does temp hiring and as the economy improves as it gets tougher and tougher to find people. Clients will look to lock in more and more internal staff by hiring them full time.","So, I'm still trying to precisely answer the temp cycle relative to the perm cycle. The relation of one to the other we wouldn\u2019t find unusual relative to recoveries of the past. But the overall recovery has been more anemic than years past whether you look at accumulative GDP growth, you look at accumulative additions the U.S. workforce. There are a lot of factors you can look at it says for the elapsed time of this recovery it's been more anemic from a macro standpoint than prior recoveries, but with that backdrop, the temp versus perm relationship isn\u2019t unusual. We would expect perm to be stronger than temp, growth rate wise, which is where we are.","George Tong","I guess the question is, with perm accelerating, is there a risk that we are nearing a peak in the temp cycle?","Harold Messmer","We certainly, our experience would not indicate that to be the case. This is a very different cycle as we\u2019ve just talked about. So predicting precisely what inning we are in when the whole cycle looks different than prior cycles is a difficult thing to do. All of that said, we feel good, we\u2019ve remain in a candidate short market. We feel good that wage rates continue to accelerate in the U.S. We feel good about the demand backdrop and we don't see the extreme candidate shortages that typically signal you\u2019re getting a later cycle. We don\u2019t see those broad-based extreme shortages as we sit here today.","George Tong","That\u2019s helpful. And turning to Robert Half Technology can you discuss what risks you would see to growth coming from the financial services in government sectors in addition to corporate ERP spend?","Harold Messmer","Well, frankly our middle market focus we don't have a lot of exposure to financial services or government in our tech business, we do a little financial services business in tech and we do very little government business in tech so unlike many of the other firms where they are more Fortune 1000 centric in their client base. That's not us, so we are not a good place to get a read through to how they might be doing in those sectors.","George Tong","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Yes. Thank you, good evening gentlemen. Most of my questions you get covered, but I just wanted to ask you that can you address if there are or what the trends you seen in terms of the competitive dynamics in the industry. I asked from the context, but obviously we\u2019ve seen a lot of the smaller guys keep consolidating and that\u2019s been going on for some time, but some of your bigger competitors has been making noise trying to come into sort of the U.S. and space as well. So just curious if you guys have seen any visible changes in particular areas of broadly speaking?","Harold Messmer","The simple answer is no. In Perm placement in a healthy part of a recovery you always find smaller Perm placement firms pop up while there nuisances the word that comes to mind I wish I could come up with a better word. Why you'd rather they not be there, they don\u2019t move the needle in fact that they are there and as far as the bigger firms there's nothing there to note.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, all right. Thank you, guys.","End of Q&A","Harold Messmer","That was our last question.

You\u2019ll find these remarks on the Robert Half website at roberthalf.com. Simply click on the Quarterly Conference Calls link from the home page of the Investor Center.","Now, let\u2019s discuss the third quarter. Third quarter revenues were $1.22 billion, up 14% from the third quarter of 2013. Income per share was $0.63, up 30% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $94 million during the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $13 million. We paid an $0.18 per share cash dividend to stockholders on September 15, 2014, at a cost of $24 million.","We also repurchased 1.2 million Robert Half shares during the quarter, at a cost of $61 million. Approximately 5.5 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","Demand for our staffing and consulting services accelerated during the third quarter, with all lines of business reporting double digit year-over-year revenue gains. The strength in our operations was broad based and included both U.S. and international locations. This was Robert Half\u2019s 18th consecutive quarter of double digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Return on equity on an unlevered basis was 35% for the quarter.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed review of our third quarter results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. Global staffing revenues were $1.22 billion in the third quarter. This is up 14% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 13% on a same day constant-currency basis. Global staffing revenues were up 13% on a same day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $807 million in the third quarter, up 14% on a same day basis.","International staffing revenues were $250 million in the third quarter, up 9% on a same day constant currency basis. We have 341 staffing locations worldwide, including 99 locations in 18 countries outside the United States. There were 64.2 billing days in the third quarter, compared to 64.0 days in the third quarter of 2013. This had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing growth rates by 0.2%. The current quarter has 61.7 billing days, compared to 61.9 days in the year ago fourth quarter.","Currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing third quarter of year-over-year staffing revenues by $1 million and improving year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.1%. We provide a supplemental schedule with our earnings release that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for our various staffing lines of business on a reported as well as on a same day constant currency basis. The schedule further divides the data between the U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You could find the schedule in today\u2019s press release and in the Investor Center of our website. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides information on certain revenue trends in our operations.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $168 million in the third quarter with $138 million in revenues in the United States and $30 million in revenues outside the U.S. Global revenues for Protiviti were up 18% year-over-year on a same day constant currency basis, with U.S. revenue up 20% and non-U.S. revenue up 11% from the prior year. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 76 locations in 25 countries.","Now turning now to gross margin, in our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 36.9% of applicable revenues. This is up 70 basis points from the third quarter a year ago. The improvement includes higher pay\/bill spreads, tipped to higher conversion fees and lower payroll taxes and other fringe benefit costs.","Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.7% of overall staffing revenues, compared to 9.4% of staffing revenues in the third quarter a year ago. Together with the temporary and consulting gross margin previously discussed, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 80 basis points versus a year ago, to 43.0%.","Third quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $51 million, or 30.5% of Protiviti revenues, compared to $42 million, or 30.5% of Protiviti revenues, one year ago.","Staffing, SG&A costs were 31.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 32.6% in last year\u2019s third quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 19.0% of Protiviti revenues in the third quarter versus 20.6% of Protiviti revenues reported this time last year.","Operating income from our staffing divisions was $119 million in the third quarter, growing 32% over the prior year and resulting in an operating margin of 11.3%. Temporary and consulting divisions reported $98 million in operating income, an increase of 28% over the prior year and resulting in an operating margin of 10.2%.","Operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million in the third quarter, up 56% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 20.9%. Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $19 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year and an operating margin of 11.5%.","Our third quarter 2014 income tax rate increased to 38.4%, up from 36% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This was primarily due to fewer available unused foreign tax benefits. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $657 million. Implied days sales outstanding were 48.8 days, compared to 47.9 days at the end of the third quarter a year ago.","Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let\u2019s review the trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October. In U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions accelerated in July, flattened in August then accelerated in September. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement divisions accelerated in July, slowed in August then accelerated in September. Outside the U.S., year-over-year temporary and consulting staffing growth rates accelerated in July and August, and decelerated a little in September. Permanent placement growth rates outside the U.S. slowed in July, but accelerated in both August and September.","For the first two weeks of October, revenues for our temporary and consulting operations were up 13% on a same day constant currency basis, compared to the same period last year with U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 15% and non-U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 8%. For the first three weeks of October, permanent placement revenues were up 10% on a same day constant currency basis, compared to the same period last year with U.S. perm revenues up 10% and non-U.S. perm revenues up 10%.","We provide this information with the caveat that\u2019s difficult to read a great deal into these trends given the short periods of time they represent. We now offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues $1.175 billion to $1.225 billion, earnings per share $0.57 to $0.62. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Thank you, Keith. We were genuinely pleased with the company\u2019s performance in the third quarter. Labor markets are stronger now than they have been in several years, particularly in the United States and most notably in the professional segments in which we specialized. We also saw our growth rates accelerate in our non-U.S. operations as a result of higher demand for our staffing and consulting services. In September, the unemployment rate in the United States drop below 6% for the first time since 2008 and the jobless rate for college-degreed workers 25 years and older was less than half that rate. The temp penetration rate which represents the number of temporary workers as a percentage of total U.S. employment reached an all time high of 2.1%.","As noted earlier on the call, growth in our staffing operations was broad based during the third quarter with all staffing and consulting divisions reporting solid year-over-year revenue grains. Competition for our experienced talent is intense right now in many cities and in some occupations the demand is growing faster than the supply of skilled workers. We are very good at locating our defined talent for our clients and I believe this is reflected in the higher demand for our services that we are seeing. Protiviti reported another strong quarter with double digit sequential and year-over-year revenue gains on a percentage basis. Like our staffing operations, Protiviti\u2019s growth was broad based within its various service lines including information technology, consulting, risk and compliance, and internal audit among others.","At this time, we will be happy to answer questions. We would request that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up as need. If time permits, we will try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","All right, good afternoon. First of all, congratulations on truly a terrific quarter and great year so far. I was wondering if you could talk about \u2013 there are two questions I have. One would basically be around Protiviti. It\u2019s the second year in a row where we\u2019ve seen this really terrific growth out of them. And I\u2019m wondering if you can frame for us how you think about the longer-term opportunity for Protiviti as we go out a few years and how we should think about what the potential is there both in terms of the top-line as well as the margin expansion?","And then secondly, with regards to the temp gross margins, it sounds like there is lots of positives that are going in your direction and not anything that was truly one-time. I\u2019m wondering if you think there is still lots of room for \u2013 not lots but significant room for more pay bill expansion and can you go into on what the temp to perm fill rate was or what that ratio relative to the normal ratios that you normally see?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Sure Mark. As to the long-term opportunity at Protiviti both revenues and margins were quite optimistic, they are very well positioned in financial services risk and regulatory and IT consulting around controls, internal audit is also very strong, particularly with the PCAOB and COSO opportunities that they currently have and we think those have legs long into the future. From a margin standpoint, we were very happy they got the double digit operating margins, this year one quarter sooner than they did last year. We\u2019ve long stated that we believe on an annual basis, they can get to double digit margins on a consolidated global basis and we\u2019re still optimistic that they can get there sooner rather than later.","So we\u2019ve remained very positive about Protiviti and further Protiviti is going to market together with staffing. Particularly in management resources, we believe we have a very unique competitive advantage by having the ability to offer the continual services all the way from staff augmentation on one end to full outsourcing with deliverables on the other end in a way that no other staffing or consulting firm can do quite frankly.","On the temp gross margin point as to what opportunity for expansion do we think we have beyond here, we would say, we would make a couple of observations that while our conversions have improved a little bit year-over-year. We\u2019re still at the low end of the 3% to 5% traditional range. I think we were 3.1%, 3.2% something in that category this quarter. So there is even at the mid-point of a typical range. You\u2019ve got almost a 100 basis points of virtually pure margin there. And further, the payroll tax more specifically the unemployment, payroll tax low that we\u2019re carrying is still 30 basis points to 40 basis points higher than what we would see in the sweet spot of a recovery scenario.","And therefore, we believe as this recovery continues that naturally our State unemployment rates will come down. Offsetting that to some degree, we do have ACA to deal with next year. We think that\u2019s a very small single digit percentage headwind that we hope we can deal with for bill rates, but that might provide a little bit offset to the upside we otherwise have from State unemployment rates. So net notwithstanding, we reported very strong temp gross margins this year, this quarter. We\u2019re still optimistic that they can expand further.","Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. The revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 8.4% \u2013 that 13% growth represents very strong growth, but not as strong as the third quarter. And I wanted to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about the currency impact in guidance and whether you\u2019re expecting international to slow in the fourth quarter if there are any other reasons for the slow down? I\u2019m really trying to get a sense of the conservatism that\u2019s in the top line.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Right and so we do believe that the midpoint of our guidance still show strong growth for the fourth quarter. Essentially, we\u2019ve taken the U.S. and we at the midpoint assume that we continue the third quarter growth rates intact with one exception. We had a large project just in which would negatively impact those growth rates just under one percentage point, but generally speaking a continuation of Q3 growth. Non-U.S., we\u2019ve conservatively assumed some constant currency deceleration still have growth but not quite as much growth as we had in Q3 not for anything we\u2019ve already seen out of the gate, we\u2019ve done pretty well, non-U.S., but instead for things that you worry about given all the mixed sentiment signals that are out there now about Europe.","As to currency, our reported year-over-year growth rates will decline by about 2 points, if currency exchange rates stay at their current level. So when you put everything back together again, the reported deceleration in growth that you referenced is principally due to currency and further due to some conservatism for the constant currency growth rates outside the U.S. Just to give you a few other comments on guidance why we\u2019re taking of our guidance, for temp gross margin at the midpoint, they\u2019re still 30 basis points to 40 basis points of year-over-year improvement that\u2019s not as much improvement as we just reported because remember a year ago we had a $2.7 million workers comp credit that gave us a 30 basis point lift in fourth quarter a year-ago gross margins. This year we\u2019ve assumed no credits or debits in workers\u2019 comp, the actuaries are in doing their working and we don\u2019t know what the outcome of that is.","Further as to SG&A, across the fourth quarter is a shorter quarter, there\u2019s some negative leverage on operating cost that happens every year in the fourth quarter. Further, we turn to speaking up hiring wise in the latter part of the third quarter, which continued into the fourth quarter. So we\u2019ll have a higher load for staff cost in the fourth quarter than we would otherwise have, such that again at the mid-point, on a sequential basis, you\u2019re going to see SG&A up 60 to 70 basis points. But on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s going to be down 40 to 50 basis points, consistent with what you\u2019ve seen lately.","Protiviti, the growth rates seem to slightly lower due to tougher comps. Gross margin seem to slightly lower as they have aggressively added campus hires during the third quarter, plus they\u2019ve added some MDs, we still believe we can maintain double-digit margins in the fourth quarter, as we have in the past.","And finally, as to the tax rate, we would expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be down 75 to 100 basis points to the mid 37 percentages plus or minus 50 basis points, principally due to foreign \u2013 excuse me \u2013 foreign tax benefits. And again when I was saying down 75 to 100 basis points, I was comparing to the third quarter of 2014 not to a year-ago.","So that\u2019s some color on the mid-point embedded into the guidance we\u2019ve given.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you. Just one quick follow-up question on the incremental hires that you started towards the end of the third quarter. Could just give us some more detail about where those were?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well it was sprinkled across all our divisions, we talked last quarter about we felt like we got little behind hiring recruiters in technology. So throughout the third quarter we added recruiters in technology, in fact we felt like we got some payback from that pretty quickly and our technology growth rates actually accelerated during the quarter. But we also did perm hiring and Accountemps hiring and part because we haven\u2019t added to headcount there in the last few quarter that we otherwise could have.","So pretty broad-based with a little focus on technology.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. I want to ask a little bit about Accountemps. This is really a division \u2013 largest, division that really kicked into place in the third quarter. Why do you think the timing is now for Accountemps looking at the third quarter? And then, seasonally speaking Accountemps is usually strongest into the fourth quarter on same-day basis. Could you just give us a sense of how Accountemps is actually in the fourth quarter?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","","Well, Accountemps enters the fourth quarter with nice momentum. We across the board, across our same divisions saw acceleration in the third quarter as the macro for our small to middle sized business clearly improved. It was broad-based. It wasn\u2019t just California, it wasn\u2019t just Texas. It was much more broad-based than it had been in prior quarters. So it\u2019s one thing, which is a good thing, but it\u2019s net broad-based and we do take momentum into the fourth quarter, which is why the midpoint of our guidance assumes we take the same growth rates that we experienced in the third quarter into the fourth quarter as well.","Andrew Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan","And that was an Accountemps comment or that was an overall comment?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, that was an Accountemps comment, but we make virtually the same comment for all the divisions. As I alluded to earlier, our Management Resources division grew much faster than the other divisions because it benefitted from a large project and that large project is now ended. It impacted the Management Resources division by about 6.5 growth points, but overall that\u2019s less than one growth point and we think that\u2019s easily absorbed just in the ordinary course with what\u2019s going on in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan","Right. And within Accountemps you expect a normal seasonal uplift in the fourth quarter?","","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Again on a same-day basis, yes, but understand it\u2019s a short quarter, so the two tend to negate each other on a reported basis.","Andrew Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan","I got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee \u2013 RBC Capital Market","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I guess I\u2019d love to dig a little bit into the international business, very strong acceleration sequentially. And hence that\u2019s bit surprising relative to what a bunch of the other global staffing companies have mentioned in terms of softening in last six weeks. I know your mix is better on a bunch of levels, but anything you\u2019d point to for driving that strength or is it really continuation of (indiscernible) in the past few quarters? Thanks.","","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, we typically talk about our largest six countries outside the U.S. and every single country accelerated in growth versus the second quarter. Further, Germany and France showed the most acceleration, but the UK had the strongest absolute growth rate, which has been strong for many quarters in a row. And if you\u2019d further look at their outlooks for the fourth quarter to a country they are strong that said, particularly continental Europe, their confidence in their forecast was shaken a bit by all the German export declines, German manufacturing declines. So the headlines tempered their enthusiasm for their forecast a bit, but both their post quarter results and their own forecast would remain strong, everybody just being more cautious.","Gary Bisbee \u2013 RBC Capital Market","Okay, great. And then the follow-up question, back to the Protiviti margins that you\u2019re obviously driving terrific top-line growth then getting SG&A leverage. I think for the last six months, the gross margin is not going up a lot. Is that indicative of you getting utilization back to the level, that\u2019s a reasonable level for growth and investment? Or is there still room over time to increase gross margins in that business as well? Thank you.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, as we\u2019ve talked before there are really three levers in gross margin, it\u2019s your bill rates, it\u2019s your leverage ratios, how many managing directors that you have versus lower level of staff people and it\u2019s your utilization. Our utilization rates are good. We have hired, on an investment basis, a lot of managing directors at the top of the pyramid in the hot solution areas. We also added more campus hires this past fall than we typically would because of our very strong growth rates. So in the short terms, those have impacted our gross margins, but notwithstanding that we still got into the double digit operating margins that we\u2019ve been shooting for some time. So we\u2019re pleased with the operating margin level that we\u2019ve achieved with Protiviti notwithstanding the people investments that we\u2019ve made for future growth, which we\u2019re very optimistic about.","Gary Bisbee \u2013 RBC Capital Market","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Louis Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Thanks. As I look through to all those constant currency, same day billing growth rates. You\u2019re looking to slowdown into the third quarter from where second was international perm placement. What markets slowed and it sounds like that kind of corrected itself towards the end of the quarter is that the right way to think about it? And do you often see divergences international between perm growth and temp growth? I was surprised that perm was sort of strengthening a little bit, as you read about it, but then it seems like temp was decelerating. Thanks.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","I would say it\u2019s not uncommon to see divergence between temp and perm growth rates particularly quarter-to-quarter. If our country leaders are around the call, they would say that perm they would like to have more headcount than they\u2019ve been given and that\u2019s had the effect of constraining their growth. But they were also probably saying that every quarter, since the beginning of time. But the point is perm versus temp, is going ebb and flow quarter-on-quarter. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any message there, any signaling message as to the future by looking at temp versus perm. And we\u2019re looking hard at the headcount we\u2019re allotting to perm outside the U.S., particularly in the UK where they\u2019ve been very strong.","Paul Louis Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Great. And then just, what perm markets slowdown in the third quarter relative to the second.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Paul, we typically don\u2019t get into country by country perm versus temp, we\u2019ve given you lot of data country by country as it is.","Paul Louis Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay, great, thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company","","Yes, thanks.","M. Keith Waddell","","Hi, Tim.","Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company","Hi, guys. Just want to ask, on the gross margin I guess you said conversion fees was still at the low end of the range. So I guess kind of what changed is the question I still had I heard your explanation earlier, but is it just the bill rate increase, is it really the bill pace spread is widened even further as you\u2019ve executed that or, I guess.","M. Keith Waddell","","Well. If you look at the 70 basis points our improvement year-over-year, well not exact but it\u2019s pretty evenly split between the three components I talked about, pay bill spreads, conversions and the payroll tax\/fringe load. So on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s pretty evenly split, it\u2019s not exact, but it\u2019s pretty evenly split between those three.","Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay. And then I guess on the technology side you talked about you saw quick back and I know you\u2019re adding people. Do you still feel understaffed in that area relative to being able to find people, or I guess are you back to a good start in that market?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","We remain bullish on the technology staffing market, it\u2019s still a candidate driven market for which you need more recruiters, to continue to grow that business at the rate that we\u2019re growing it. We will need to continue to add recruiters which we plan to do so. But clearly, it\u2019s easier to get orders than it is to find candidates and that\u2019s particularly true at the development side, app development, web development, software engineers, the higher-level tech skills.","Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is opened.","Henry Chien \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi good afternoon. It\u2019s Henry Chien calling for Jeff. I\u2019d love to dig in a little bit about your comment around health care costs. Do you have a sense when you might pass along some bill increases, or when you might do some increases in cost as a result of health care? Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell","Well we\u2019ll have to comply effective January 1, 2015. And that will be based on a one year look back of who met the thresholds during 2014.","Henry Chien \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Got it.","M. Keith Waddell","We estimated many months ago what that cost would likely be and it\u2019s scary how close we still believe the cost of the virtually the same as what we early estimated and it\u2019s still a very low single digit percentage increase to our cost which were cautiously optimistic that we can pass thorough to our clients. And frankly, we\u2019d say lesser cost increase than we\u2019ve dealt with in years past as unemployment rates increased, which gives us even more confidence that we can manage through the additional cost for ACA.","Henry Chien \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Got it, okay.

And are we seeing the long awaited small business hiring recovery in your business?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well I\u2019d say you put your hands on it Randy that we do believe the macro for our small business, middle-sized business client is improving and the demand is broad based. And further, if you look at accounting operations versus financial positions, we\u2019re seeing strength in accounting operations, which is more volume driven on the part of our clients, as our clients have more transactions to process, they need more accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll and it\u2019s those positions that we\u2019re seeing near term strengthen in which is further indicative of our clients are seeing increasing demand on their side.","Randle Glenn Reece \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Anj Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on the ACA question earlier again. You said that the single digit headwind is in line with your estimates and you think you can offset it with bill rates. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve already had any discussions around that with your clients and if you do think that you can pass it off. How many quarters do you think it might be till that headwind can be offset by the bill rate increases?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","As the discussion with clients, we typically would not start those discussions at this time although we\u2019re certainly will be beginning to and frankly given the turnover and the duration of assignments. It\u2019s with the next new assignment that you pass through the new mark-up percentage rather than necessarily re-pricing the assignments and process and for that reason, it might take two or three quarters to get there fully, which is not unusual if you look back and how we dealt with unemployment cost increases, which we\u2019ve had to pass through in the past.","Anj Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. And then on Protiviti internationally, I was wondering if you can call out what drove the big step up in growth at Q3 if there is any particular practices that are driving the growth. And I realized you\u2019re seeing tough comps at Q4, but I just wondering if you can give us a sense of how sustainable that is for your international business?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","I would like to tell you that we\u2019ve got double digit growth rates in Protiviti non-U.S. and those are here to stay, but the truth is if you analysis the numbers, they had particularly weak comparisons at year ago and the third quarter and those weak comparisons get stronger in a hurry such that for the fourth quarter, I wouldn\u2019t expect anywhere near those kind of growth rates Protiviti non-U.S. That said Protiviti overall those growth rates are wonderful.","Anj Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, all right. That\u2019s it from my end.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research","Great. Well, Keith, it sounds like the numbers you laid out between conversions and payroll tax kind of relief, there is about 150 basis points of incremental margin on the temp side. Is that kind of a way to think about it over the course of the rest of the up cycle? And then I wanted to make sure when you talk about the workers comp in the call, if there is a benefit we would you see that in Q4 and then I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s not in the guidance right?","M. Keith Waddell","","Okay, on the temp gross margin upside 100 basis points to 130 basis points, we can round up to 150 basis points if you would like would be a reasonable expectation over the remainder of this up cycle and whether that\u2019s a couple of three years will precisely how long that is we could all conjecture, but it\u2019s in that order of magnitude and then the math is very simple, it\u2019s about a 100 basis points from conversions and the balance is from a smaller load for payroll taxes, primarily unemployment.","As to workers comp, we will record in the fourth quarter once the actuaries do their accrual evaluation, whatever they say, we need to mark that to market. We do that twice a year. We\u2019ve done it twice a year for many years. A year-ago, we had a very nice credit. This year, we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to get a credit or a debit, but whatever we get, we will book it in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s not in our guidance, and we\u2019ll tell you what it is or what it was.","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research","Super, and then I don\u2019t know if you will give this or not, but how many basis points of investment were kind of staffed within Protiviti for the years to these hires and incremental \u2013 campus hires and things like that. If he didn\u2019t make those hires, what type of margins would we be settling in on the Protiviti side?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, quite frankly the best thing that could happen is that for the foreseeable future, we remain so optimistic about our future that we continue to make those investment hires and you see that kind of margins into the future you see today, and again for the last two quarters. Now, we\u2019ve had double digit operating margins notwithstanding those investments and to be growing between 15% and 20%, which they\u2019re growing and to have operating margins in the low double-digit rates we\u2019re quite happy to have for quite a while.","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research","","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. I was wondering if you could update me on the bill rate growth in the quarter and maybe the sequence of how it\u2019s progressed so far year-to-date.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","","And so for the quarter, on a global basis, bill rates are up 3.4% and at first blush that looks like it\u2019s less than last quarter\u2019s 3.5%. There is a currency impact there and adjusted for currency the bill rate increase would be 30 basis points higher, not 10 basis points lower. So, said differently if you just focus on the U.S. We\u2019re continuing to see pay and bill rate increases, those are most noticeable in Robert Half Technology and in Robert Half Management Resources, but we\u2019re seeing that to some degree across the board, which is yet another indication to us that this recovery is beginning and continuing in earnest, which we\u2019re pleased about and is reflected in all our growth rates.","Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. You decided internal hiring and kind of picking up the pace in Protiviti in other areas. Does the market opportunity cause you to think about any inorganic means to spur growth? I\u2019m curious particularly on the perm side where you\u2019ve done a real good job I think of growing that business.","","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","Well, we often look at small acquisition opportunities and it typically boils down to our evaluation of the quality of their people and to the extent to which they would assimilate well into our cultures. We\u2019ve long focused on organic growth and internal growth, but over the years we have done many small acquisitions. Protiviti did a couple last year in the share point area, which continues to do well. But we\u2019re not anti-acquisition, but we\u2019re very selective and given our 35% return on equity, which we\u2019re also very proud of we believe over time our focus on primarily organic growth has paid off.","That been said we\u2019re always looking for good deals.","Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","George K. F. Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","","Hi, good afternoon. Digging deeper on margins could you comment on how you think about the structural ceiling to margins if that\u2019s changed versus prior cycles? And what potential factors could drive gross and operating margins above prior peaks?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, if you walk up and down the P&L, as we\u2019ve talked about we think there\u2019s a 100 to a 150 basis point of expansion, margin expansion for tipped higher conversions for smaller payroll tax loads. We further believe just from an operating leverage standpoint as we grow our top line our fixed cost will be better levered, not only in the staffing side, and on the Protiviti side.","So as we\u2019re approaching all-time high margin percentages, we would be very disappointed, if we don\u2019t go well beyond those, although we\u2019re hesitant to give any forecast as to how much beyond prior peaks will take them. We\u2019ll take them to where we think they make sense and will balance, reporting quarter-by-quarter operating margins against making investments for future growth that we do every quarter.","George K. F. Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","","That\u2019s very helpful. And then could you talk about your performance in Europe, specifically as it relates to the UK, Germany and France, whether the strength there was due to market share gains or generally improved market conditions?","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the precise answer to your question, that said, it\u2019s our belief, that it\u2019s some above. If you look at our growth rates and if you look at the growth rates in those markets overall, we\u2019re growing faster. So I think you could easily then deduce that we\u2019re gaining market share. That said, those markets have been recovering in the last few quarters and to the extent to which that continues is obviously the debate of the last several weeks.","George K. F. Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question is a follow-up from Paul Ginocchio. Please go ahead sir.","Paul Louis Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Thanks for taking my question, my follow-up. You know well back I thought about may be ACA driving some demand we\u2019re certainly seeing that in PEOs. I\u2019m just wondering if you had any updated thoughts as we\u2019re going to move into 1-1-2015.","Harold M. Messmer, Jr.","We\u2019re not seeing any hard demand from clients where they are explicitly trying to avoid the thresholds to comply with ACA. That said, we are seeing a fair amount of demand for company\u2019s open enrollment where they are tweaking, changing their internal benefit plans in part because of ACA. And as an example, many companies are going to these private exchanges to offer health coverage to their own employees and there is a lot of change and management attached to that.","And if you look at office team, which has been growing very nicely and faster than many of our other divisions. If you had to look at one thing, it was the demand related to open enrollment, which at least indirectly relates to ACA. But it\u2019s not the very direct we, the client, want to avoid the number of employee threshold, and therefore, that\u2019s driving the ordering from us.","Paul Louis Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Thank you very much.","Harold M.

Click on Investor Center under the About Us tab, then the quarterly Conference Calls link.","Now, let\u2019s review our second quarter results. Second quarter 2015 results were $1.27 billion, up 9% from the second quarter one year ago, or up 13% adjusted for currency. Income per share was $0.67, up 21% from last year. Cash flow from operations was $142 million in the second quarter and capital expenditures were $16 million.","In June, we paid our shareholders a cash dividend of $0.20 per share, at a cost of $27 million. We also repurchased 900,000 Robert Half shares during the second quarter, at a cost of $50 million. There are approximately 3.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We reached the half-year mark with all-time high quarterly results, led by Protiviti and Robert Half Technology. Continued strong demand for our staffing and consulting services contributed to a record quarter. Overall, revenues grew by 9% over the prior year on a reported basis, or 13% adjusted for currency.","Protiviti again reported excellent results, with currency-adjusted revenues up 23% from the previous year. Our staffing divisions also performed well, with revenues up 12% year-over-year adjusted for currency. As with the first quarter, growth rates were best in our U.S. operations, but we also saw nice growth internationally.","This was Robert Half's 21st straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 36%.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our second quarter results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. Global revenues were $1.27 billion in the second quarter. This is up 9% from the second quarter of 2014 on a reported basis, and up 13% on a currency-adjusted basis.","Second quarter staffing revenues were up 12% on a currency adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $871 million in the second quarter, up 13%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $219 million, up 7% when adjusted for currency. We have 335 staffing locations worldwide, including 93 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The second quarter had 63.2 billing days, the same number of days as the second quarter one year ago. The current quarter has 64.2 billing days, which is also the same as the third quarter of last year.","Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year staffing revenues by $40 million in the second quarter. Exchange rates decreased our year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 4%.","Each quarter, we include a supplemental schedule with our earnings release that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for our various staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as on a same-day, currency-adjusted basis. The schedule further segments the data by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You can find the schedule in today\u2019s press release and in the Investor Center of our website. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides information on certain revenue trends in our staffing operations.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $182 million in the second quarter, with $152 million in revenues in the United States and $30 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 23% year over year on a currency-adjusted basis. U.S. revenues were up 24% and non-U.S. revenues were up 20% from the prior year.","Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $5 million in the second quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rates by 3%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.","Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.3% of applicable revenues. This is an 80 basis-point improvement from the same period one year ago. The improvement includes higher pay\/bill spreads, higher temp-to-hire conversion fees, and lower insurance and payroll tax costs.","The second quarters of 2015 and 2014 include workers\u2019 compensation credits of $2.1 million and $900,000, respectively, pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers\u2019 compensation accruals.","Second quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.1% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is unchanged from last year\u2019s second quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 70 basis points versus one year ago, to 43.7%.","Second-quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $54 million, or 29.9% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin one year ago for Protiviti was $43 million, or 28.4% of Protiviti revenues.","Staffing SG&A costs were 31.9% of staffing revenues in the second quarter versus 32.0% in last year\u2019s second quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.6% of Protiviti revenues in the second quarter compared to 20.2% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.","Operating income from our staffing operations was $129 million in the second quarter, up 16% from the prior year. Operating margin was 11.8% of revenues. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $105 million in operating income, an increase of 18% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 10.7%.","Operating income for our permanent placement division was $24 million in the second quarter, up 7% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 21.8%.","Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $20 million, an increase of 65% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 11.3%.","At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $687 million. Implied days sales outstanding DSO was 49.1 days.","Before we move to third quarter guidance, let\u2019s review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter, and so far in July, all adjusted for currency.","Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions decelerated slightly over the course of the quarter. We exited the quarter with June growing at 10.7% as compared to 11.3% for the full quarter.","Revenue growth for the first two weeks of July picked up to 12% as compared to the prior year. Global permanent placement revenue growth rates accelerated throughout the quarter, with June revenues growing at 15.1% as compared to 13% for the full quarter.","For the first three weeks of July, permanent placement revenues also increased 15% compared to the same period last year. U.S. versus non-U.S. trends were not materially different. This information is designed to give you additional insight into trends we saw during the second quarter and so far in July, but, as you know, it is difficult to read a great deal into these numbers given the short time periods they represent.","With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: Revenues: $1 billion, 295 million to $1 billion, 345 million. Income per share: $0.70 to $0.75","The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 8% on a reported basis, or 12% adjusted for currency using current rates, and EPS growth of 15%.","We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We were pleased with our results for the quarter. As noted at the start of the call, we saw higher service demand and solid revenue growth for our professional staffing services and Protiviti\u2019s consulting solutions.","Year-over-year revenue growth rates were the strongest in the United States, where skilled professional talent is currently at a premium as a result of the tightening labor market. This is particularly true in the technology staffing area, where we have invested heavily over the past few years.","We also are encouraged by the revenue growth in our non-U.S. staffing operations, notwithstanding the headwinds from currency exchange rates.","Protiviti had another outstanding quarter, with a revenue growth rate of 20.4% versus the prior year. Adjusted for currency that growth rate is 23.4%. These are strong numbers and speak to the strength of the Protiviti brand in the marketplace. Protiviti is seeing strong and balanced demand in all of its principal service areas: internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and information technology consulting.","At this time, we will be happy to answer questions. We would request as usual that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird.","Mark Marcon","Congratulations on the excellent results. I was wondering how you're thinking about future investments behind RH Technology and Protiviti, given that they're -- while your business continues to be very strong, there are some other signs from other companies out there that, maybe on a global basis and a US basis, there might be some deceleration that's occurring in various pockets. So, just wondering how you're going to -- how the investment outlook is being viewed internally.","Max Messmer","Mark, our view is - particularly at Robert Half technology and Protiviti, that we will continue to invest aggressively in headcount in both of those divisions. We're quite pleased with the results we've seen there. With Robert Half technology, unlike most of the other at least public providers that have technology staffing, we're focused primarily on middle market accounts.","Middle market accounts, we're seeing more complex IT staffing needs that have been the case in the recent past and with that there is demand for mobility, cloud, security, app and web development, data analytics, the type of demand you typically have seen only at larger companies. So, given that demand that's drifted into our sweet spot, we're doing quite well with that and we continue to invest and that's our expectation for the second half of the year.","Mark Marcon","Great. If I can just follow up on that, with regards to some of the assignments that you're getting, can you characterize them in terms of, like, number of placements per account, in terms of how that's changed relative to the recent past?","Max Messmer","Well, the biggest change is that there are higher level skills versus what we've traditionally placed. It's still focused on middle market accounts, so it's still a relatively few people per account. So, there's not a huge change there, rather than or other than as I spoke about with the skill level. So, we're clearly advancing in what we call, check development in a way we never have, for reasons we just described.","Mark Marcon","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hey, Keith. Could you talk about wage rate increases and bill rate increases? I surely caught that you said the gap has opened up. My question really is, are you seeing greater rates of wage and bill rate increases than you had in the recent past?","Keith Waddell","Sure. For the quarter, our bill rates were up 4.7% year-over-year, that compares to 4.1% last quarter. Our pay rates lag that by a little. We did expand our gross margins that we talked about earlier, that gross margin expansion is a combination fairly balanced between higher spreads, pay bill, conversions expanded both year-over-year and sequentially, we got to 3.4% this quarter, I believe it was 3.3% last quarter, and a year ago it was 3.1% or 3.2%.","So, we're continuing to move up with conversions as well as lower state unemployment, lower workers comp, and as with currency, U.S. has a larger portion of the mix and the U.S. has a lower fringe factor burden to payroll than is the case with non-U.S.","Andrew Steinerman","And did wage rate accelerate? Wage rate increases accelerated like bill rate?","Keith Waddell","They did, but not quite to the same degree. We saw more of it in IT than in the other area. But frankly it was pretty broad based.","Andrew Steinerman","Great. And then generally you consider wage inflation actually a pretty good thing for Robert Half because of your ability to pass that thorough, right?","Keith Waddell","We do indeed, and not only traditionally have we passed it through, it's given us an opportunity to expand our margins a bit as well. And in fact that's just what we've done so far in this cycle and our pay bill spreads are approaching all time high pay bill spreads.","Andrew Steinerman","Well said, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Following up on that, could you talk about what your guidance assumes for gross margin progression and SG&A spend in the third quarter, and plans for adding to temp and perm recruiter hiring in international markets?","Max Messmer","Sure, so at the midpoint of our guidance, we're talking sequentially flattish maybe up 10 basis points, which year-over-year is still going to give you 30 basis points which is a continuation of the trend that we've seen for some number of quarters. At the SG&A line, we're expecting as a percent of revenue to remain pretty constant sequentially, maybe up a tick or two year-over-year or gone up pretty aggressively higher the second half of the year that'll be focused heavily in Robert Half technology for reasons I think are obvious.","But we're also going to do it on a pretty broad basis and therefore the operating leverage you might otherwise see we're going to reinvest in headcount because we're bullish as we speak, and therefore on a year-over-year basis you're not going to see a lot of operating leverage at the SG&A line. That said, you're still going to see operating margins that are quite healthy and we're very pleased that not only did our absolute revenues and earnings reach all time highs this quarter but our margins are as well.","Sara Gubins","Great. And then, separately, Protiviti is seeing very strong revenue growth. Are there further catalysts that could help keep the momentum going -- regulatory change, for example, or capital markets activity?","Max Messmer","Well first, we don't see any slowdown in sight with where we already are, which is pretty balanced between internal audit, financial services, regulation, and IT's, security, and controls. We think there is a nice runway where we already are, you've got things like new rev coming on board. Although that has been pushed back a year to 2018, although some companies are already doing diagnostics related work.","So, data analytics is something else that we're doing some investing in there, small currently, but we're optimistic at what that might become. But the point is we think where we are has legs but that said, we do continue to plant seeds, building our further solutions and technology as an example, building out the breadth of our client base and financial services. So, we're far from running out of leg room in Protiviti.","Sara Gubins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Co.","Tim McHugh","Just want to ask, management resources, I guess -- can you elaborate a little bit more there? I guess -- don't want to look at the one area that didn't grow as much; but, any color, I guess, on what you saw?","Keith Waddell","Well said, first of all we had our toughest comparisons and management resources as any other division. A year ago, the growth rate accelerated by seven percentage points, which was the most acceleration and the toughest compare we had. That said, management resources is our most project oriented division, it's lumpier than the others, we've said that for many quarters.","We have some projects and we have some projects that were not as large as we had hoped for, and therefore we saw more deceleration there than we did in the other division. While we expect further deceleration in the third quarter, we certainly don't expect it to the same extent that we saw in the second quarter and we exited the quarter in management resources stronger than the tough compares would otherwise indicate, and by the way those compares get six points tougher yet again in the third quarter.","So, management resources lumpier, more project oriented. We've been on the good side of those lumps for two or three quarters, this quarter we were on the other side of the lump, but we certainly don't think it's going to be here forever.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Great. And then the US perm growth rate accelerating a bit -- is there anything different in the market that you're seeing, or I guess would you attribute to investments in head count, or is it just lumpiness that we're over-analyzing, maybe if we look at the growth rates versus prior quarters?","Max Messmer","The market continues strong and firm. We have made headcount investments, clearly that's a factor in our growth but as we've talked about a few quarters now in a row, full time demand for staff the labor markets in the US are clearly improving and you see that first and foremost, which typical in our cycle in Perm placement fulltime hiring.","So we\u2019re optimistic about Perm we\u2019re pleased where we\u2019re revenue wise, with where we\u2019re margin wise and we plan to continue to pretty aggressively add ahead to second half of the year.","Tim McHugh","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Reece from Avondale. ","Randy Reece","Good afternoon I was trying to get a little bit more of an understanding of, when you're looking at guidance for the third quarter, what you feel stronger about among the brands -- how growth rates could compare on a sequential basis. I just noted that your guidance -- if you look at it in terms of sequential growth, your guidance is actually a little bit better than the guidance you gave for the third quarter of last year.","Keith Waddell ","Well we looked at trends this quarter we not only gave you the first few weeks of the current quarter we also broke out the last month of the prior quarter. We exited the quarter pretty strongly that got confirmed they were actually got better so far as short as it is in July.","So now the guidance is certainly not a sand bag I think for several quarters for several years we pretty much call it like we see it we landed at the revenue line pretty much at the midpoint of our guidance for this past quarter.","From a brand standpoint it\u2019s hard not to feel best about Protiviti and Robert Half Technology, but that said there were certainly no big surprises with the other brands for the quarter just ended. And we don\u2019t expect big surprises for the other brands for the quarter that we\u2019re in. ","Randy Reece","Was there anything in particular, other than management resources, that stuck out as a variance versus your guidance this quarter? It seems like that was the main thing.","Keith Waddell ","Yeah, I\u2019d say the other thing to a lesser degree is that we had of a bit of a mixed picture outside the United States. So we always talk about our big six countries. And for the quarter just ended we had deceleration in Canada, Australia, and France a little more so than what we had expected.","That Canada and Australia related to minerals\/mining\/energy. France had some Canada tightness that got ahead of little bit. On the other hand Germany where we\u2019ve invested the most heads also accelerated during the quarter that we were pleased by.","But relative to our guidance for the second quarter we came up a little bit short outside the US for the three markets I talked about and for the record Belgium and the UK stayed solid their growth rate is pretty much remained intact versus what had been.","Randy Reece","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio","A key for all my questions were answered so maybe just ask about the creative group. Can you just give us real size that since you got a new owner of one of your competitors and how you\u2019re seeing creative trends so where is that located within your divisions. Thanks.","Max Messmer","Well Paul, creative group is doing and has done very well. We reported in our accountemps numbers I can say that the creative group has certainly grown faster than accountemps overall for many years in a row it has very good gross and operating margins we do some Perm business and creative group as well that\u2019s group with Perm overall.","That said we do not break it out we have not intention of breaking it out we grown that business organically yet very much consistent with the collateral of other practices. And we certainly weren\u2019t surprised with the economics the margin structure the numbers that were reported by a competitor as you mentioned. But it\u2019s not our intention to break it out. ","Paul Ginocchio","Great. Thank you for that. And then, I've looked at some of the older staffing industry analysts' kind of revenue run rates of The Creative Group, or of the whole creative industry and the various players in it. Are their numbers roughly right, or -- ?","Keith Waddell ","Well again we\u2019re not going to break it out it\u2019s doing very well we\u2019re very happy with our organic growth approach and where we are and that\u2019s about all we\u2019re going to say.","Paul Ginocchio","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I hate to nitpick, but I wanted to focus on your permanent placements margins. They were flat on a year-over-year basis, and you actually pointed out you saw accelerating growth during the quarter. Was it because of the hiring that you mentioned, or is there anything else going on there?","Keith Waddell ","Well what\u2019s less first put in context the operating margins were over 20% and so I think what you see is there were 21.8% a year ago and there were 21.8% this year. So the growth you saw was the same as the revenue growth, which was impacted by currency pretty dramatically.","So quite frankly we\u2019ll take 21% operating margins for ever and Perm placement. So but more directly to your question we have added aggressively to heads in Perm placement we\u2019ll continue to do so and to see operating income grow at roughly the same pace as revenue should not be a surprise. But let\u2019s keep in mind in context that those margins were already very high margins.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Fair enough. If I can move on to Protiviti, I'm not sure if I have the numbers right, but it looked like you might have added a couple of locations in the quarter. Is that correct, and are there further expansion possibilities? You meant adding to headcount and you discussed that, and I'm kind of just curious if you\u2019re going to be opening up new offices as well. Thanks. ","Max Messmer","The location strategy for Protiviti is primarily for the new locations to be member firm or franchises as some call them. So to the extent we go to a new countries it\u2019s more than likely going to be through that vehicle rather than as owned operations.","We feel pretty good about our owned footprint as we speak so we don\u2019t expect an expansion of our owned footprint, but we are in discussions with others that have sort us out frankly that would like to be Protiviti member firms and parts of the world that we don\u2019t have a presence.","While we\u2019re talking about international Protiviti I\u2019ll point out that once again we had a very nice international Protiviti result for the quarter as we spoke about last quarter we\u2019ve seen major improvement in Asia and specifically Japan some of the economy has got better in Japan.","We diversified revenue sources nicely financial services regulatory compliance continues to come on which we\u2019ve invested in and we will continue to invest in Japan and Asia generally.","So nice result for Protiviti non-US Protiviti Europe was also very good it\u2019s been very good for a while Protiviti Australia very good result but from an improvement standpoint the most improvement came in Protiviti Asia where Japan did particularly well.","Jeff Silber","That\u2019s helpful I just think it quick numbers quite sure what share count are you using for your EPS guidance and what should be the modeling for capital expenditures for the year. Thanks.","Keith Waddell ","So CapEx we\u2019re thinking $20 million, $22 million something in that range the share count will continue to tick down a little bit I\u2019m not sure I have got that I\u2019m just look in front of me 134.2, 133.2, it will continue to tick down as we bought shares and we would continue to buy shares. ","The other point I would make is the tax rate we think will come down 50 to a 100 basis points for foreign tax planning so rather that been the high 39s or hoping it will be in the low 39s for the third quarter.","Jeff Silber","Right that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much Keith.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","Thanks for taking my questions. Just building on some of the questions that have been asked prior, I'm hoping you can touch on perm internationally. It's one of the few segments that's slowed despite very similar comps. Can you just walk us through what may be causing those dynamics? Is it just some of the slowdown you mentioned in Canada and France? Perhaps you could also remind us quickly on how soon we can expect head count additions in perm or other areas, to show up in your growth rates?","Max Messmer","Well, I would say the, the comments are made earlier about international generally would apply to international perm where perm is a bigger portion of our international business then it is of our U.S business so we\u2019ve made most aggressive perm headcounts in Germany and Germany\u2019s growth accelerated during the quarter impart due to those investments we didn\u2019t have the quarter we wanted to have in Canada, Australia into a lesser degree France for reasons I\u2019ve talked about and those would also address perm as well temp. So those countries are the place we saw the most weakness and that weakness was perm as well temp.","Anjaneya Singh","Got it. And I'm hoping you can also talk a little more about Protiviti. I know that it's been a topic on several quarters of calls now -- the sort of opportunity on operating margins, and getting to the double-digit range. And I know you've made a considerable amount of progress there, but it seems, if prior year operating margin trends hold, you should hit double-digit operating margins for the full year. So, wondering if you can share any updated thoughts as to where those margins could go, and how long it take to get there beyond this sort of 11% range.","Max Messmer","Well, the good news on a year to-date basis we already have double digit operating margins and we\u2019re going into the second half were traditionally the second half margins are better than the first half margins so, we\u2019d be quite disappointed if for the full year our Protiviti operating margins on higher than they are at the half year so we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on operating margins we would planned to see additional expansion we\u2019ve talked about the gross margin levers of utilization leverage or the ratio of managing director to staff and bill rates, utilization is a nice high solid and we believe sustainable levels.","Bill rates are improving, mid single digit similar to staffing may be a touch higher and we think we\u2019ve got further leverage opportunities for the ratio of managing directors to staff. Overall the impact of which is it reduces your average payroll cost as you add more staff relative to managing directors so we\u2019ll think, think we\u2019ve got gross margin upside for the reasons I just described Protiviti is leverage their SG&A quite well and we would expect to see that to continue may be not to the same to extend that it has but we forever have said, we saw Protiviti as a low double digit margin business we\u2019re now into that range and we stick by low double digit operating margins as its, as where it should be steady state which is where it is plus some.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay. Great. That's helpful. and one final quick one from me, touching back on perm. US perm is growing really impressively. And it seems -- I was wondering if you can just basically talk about -- or, is the demand -- is that -- can you discern any particular industries or clients that are driving that demand? Is it pretty broad-based, or is there anything discernible in the areas that demand is coming from? Thank you.","Max Messmer","Let\u2019s say its broad based, we\u2019ve talked a for we see candidate counter offers happening more often we see more fall offs which means they start with clients and they actually get a better offer go somewhere else which is also indicative of high demand for three, four quarters at least we\u2019ve talked about that trend which continues as far as areas California would be our strongest state. I don\u2019t think there is a secrete in Silicon Valley, they were quite well.","Texas although impacted in Houston primarily by energy, Texas is still solid and is not what it was but it\u2019s not what it was but its solid, Dallas much more diversify than as Huston but Huston doing okay, holding their own.","New York solid, Chicago solid, so I would say perm generally speaking across the board is playing out pretty classically as you would expected to as the labor markets improved.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay. Got it. Appreciate the thoughts there. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Hi, thanks good afternoon. Can you provide an update on the level of recruiter turnover, and whether you foresee any changes to incentive comp structure to drive retention, and what the implications could be for SG&A margins?","Max Messmer","Well, recruiter turnover I would say there isn't a lot of change there. We've talked about for years that at Robert Half we're a pretty demanding lot and for that reason there's a fair amount of turnover the first couple of years with Robert Half but frankly after the first or three years the turnover is almost nonexistent. And that's been the case for most of the 25 plus years we've been around and it's the case as we speak. ","As to our incentive comp plans like most companies we're always testing, changing trying to make them as incenting as possible to try to give our people as much line of sight as we can with their productivity and the compensation they get from that so, in the ordinary course we're always looking at our comp plans and now as no different than that so I don't there's no big story on either turnover or changes to comp plans but they\u2019re both issues we have to deal with all the time. ","George Tong","Got it. As you think about the three sources of gross margin expansion, which are rising bill\/pay spreads, temp to perm conversions, and lower insurance and payroll tax costs, this quarter they contributed equally to gross margin expansion. Do you expect the impact to be relatively equal on the go-forward basis, or will certain factors contribute more than others?","Max Messmer","Well I would say given the progress we\u2019ve made on bill\/pay spreads. I think it\u2019s probably on a realistic to think we're going to continue to make progress at the same pace where add all-time highs for our margins on spreads alone. The conversions were at 3.4% of revenue of historical range is 3% to 5% has been our hope sometime but that will least get to the midpoint of that which is 4%, there is 60 basis points there. ","On the fringes we still think we have upside on the state unemployment cost, which lag market conditions such that as the labor markets continued to improve so will our unemployment claims which will then in turn produce lower state unemployment taxes. ","We've gotten a little lift of late because non-US payroll tax fringe factors are higher than U.S. and particularly currency adjusted there is a less mix attributable to non-U.S. which helps the, the fringe factor overall so I think we still got upside in conversions which is pretty easy to quantify, harder to quantify but probably 20 to be aggressive 40 basis points of upside in taxes insurance with more for international mix depending on what happens with exchange rates. ","We're happy with margins are we're effectively at all-time-high staffing margins but we don't think we've run out of gas and we\u2019ve said for sometime would be apoplectic if we didn't get new margins, new highs in this cycle and I think we're knocking at the door. ","George Tong","Thanks for the color. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Ryan Leonard","This is Ryan, filling in for Manav. Just a quick question on kind of the M&A front. There have been some other staffers out there who've been talking about looking to expand into some other areas, and maybe proceeding with some M&A. I know you guys like to focus on organic growth, but are there any new areas or any -- or, particularly in technology, anything you'd like to add onto your existing offerings?","Max Messmer","Well, I'd say the last - first of all you're correct and that we have focused on organic growth for a long time that's contributed significantly into our very large returns on equity which all by the way was 36% for the quarter which we're very proud of. ","The last five years more of our deals have been Protiviti oriented where we\u2019ve built out their solutions based so I think it would be reasonable to expect in the near-term that we would be more acquisitive to do small to mid-size deals with Protiviti.","As it does try to add to the breadth and depth of the solutions that they offer and staying pretty close to financial services, technology security control, project management, and to a lesser degree you can turn lot it.","Ryan Leonard","Great. And just -- you mentioned, kind of, the temp to perm conversion that -- 3.4%. We've been seeing a lot more of that kind of model being used by employers more and more. Is there a chance, if you look out a few years, that that 3% to 5% range shifts slightly, and you see it become more of an impact on the overall revenue for you guys?","Keith Waddell","Well I typically in a cycle it is a demand that limits the percentage it\u2019s supply so I think there is not question many clients would love to try people out before they have to commit to them fulltime.","But as the labor is improved and Canada it\u2019s yet tighter clients don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to do that they have to commit to fulltime from the beginning or they can\u2019t get them at all.","So I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s some big shift going on which is why we\u2019ve said if we can get to the midpoint of our traditional range there\u2019s quite a bit of upside. Now if you want to take your high processes there and say we got to 5 then there is even more upside than what we\u2019ve talked about.","But again the limiting factor as the cycle improves it isn\u2019t client demand it\u2019s became the supply.","Ryan Leonard","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Just a couple of quick ones. The -- it sounds like demand in Protiviti remains very strong, but you do face considerably more difficult comparison, you know, the next quarter, and even more so in the fourth quarter. Any thoughts on how we should think about that? Is a moderation in the growth of several points a quarter a reasonable baseline to think about how the next couple of quarters might go? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Well it's certainly reasonable to think a moderation of the growth rates would happen. That said, they've had really tough comparisons for several quarters in a row if you look at starting with Q1 even of 2014 it was 14, 18, 22, 26 so I mean they've had tough comparisons for some time and they've anniversaried them quite well.","That said I\u2019m going to assure our guidance assumes some moderation in those growth rates and they can\u2019t defy gravity forever, but they've done a hell of a job anniversaring tough comps so far.","Gary Bisbee","Great. And then just a followup -- obviously, last year, your revenue growth in aggregate, and I think really for all of the businesses, or at least temp and Protiviti, accelerated throughout the year. Your guidance, I guess, implies a bit further deceleration, but less than the amount by which the comp gets tougher from a year ago. I guess, stepping back from all of that, just how do you feel about the demand outlook today relative to 6 months ago? We had a couple of quarters where you sounded massively bullish, and you sound a little more reserved tonight. Maybe that's just my reading of it. But how are you feeling about how the world is today? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Well we feel good and the fact that the comps get tougher is something to be dealt with as you observed the comps get tougher by another 4 percentage points this quarter yet our guidance is only a 1 percentage point deceleration so that's less deceleration relative to the comps than we experienced this past quarter.","We've had non-US recovery that's been more mixed and uneven and that's certainly impacted the growth rates as this has proceeded, but we feel good we've just talked about how from a headcount perspective, which is the investment most impacted by our outlook we plan to be aggressive adding to heads the second half of the year; and effectively the operating leverage that we would otherwise enjoy, we're going to reinvest in headcount. And I don't know what -- whether that means we're massively bullish or cautiously optimistic. I can't parse my own words. But we feel good about things","Gary Bisbee","Very good appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev from Jefferies.","Dan Dolev","Thanks for taking my question. Somewhat related to the question before, if you look at -- I know you don't guide more than one quarter ahead, but if you look at next year?s guidance, 2016, you're looking at about 10% revenue growth. You often talk about where gross margin expansion can come from. But can you maybe elaborate on, if there is upside to debt, where you see that upside coming from in your business?","A \u2013 Max Messmer","Well, we see gross margin expansion up is as we just discussed more conversions, less payroll tax and insurance burden we would expect over the medium term operating, classical operating leverage our margins that already have all-time-high margins in staffing and we would expect that we will expand those further over the medium term. For the reasons we've talked so we do believe we can continued to grow our bottom line more quickly than the top line. ","Dan Dolev","And is there upside -- sorry to interrupt you. I meant more about the top line, in terms of where consensus is today, about 10.1%. Is there -- is that a number that misrepresents some of the strength in your business? And if yes, where could it come from?","A \u2013 Max Messmer","Well, as you started we limit our guidance to a quarter one quarter so it would be somewhat self-defeating the comment on 2016 at the moment but we're bullish we feel good about the future. We\u2019ve told to put the trends on this quarter we\u2019ve showed you how we exited the quarter? How we began the quarter that we're now in. That's pretty much all we can say. ","Dan Dolev","Okay. Great. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, as you'd imagine. But if you could comment, within IT, the extent to which the tech bill rates are maybe exceeding the average numbers that you characterize. And as you've invested for growth in that business, has the complexion of customers, either by size or geography, changed as you kind of moved upstream to larger employers?","A \u2013 Max Messmer","As to tech bill rates versus the average they may be slightly higher than the average but then they're not massively higher than the average as to the complexion as to client size and geographic concentration the size of our typical tech client has always been modestly larger than accounting and finance but not significantly larger it's certainly not fortune 1000. ","And as to geography, relative to how we're doing in accounting and finance, I don't think there's any large tech differential if we're doing well in California; we're doing well in California accounting and finance. And one's not necessarily outsize relative to the other may be the one exception to that would be in Texas we're still doing really well in tech and we've seen some slowing in Texas for obvious reasons otherwise.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you very much. ","A \u2013 Max Messmer","Okay.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time I turn the call back over to Mr. Messmer for closing remarks.","Max Messmer","All right thank you very much. I guess that was our last question. As always keep that a very good job answering questions. I would just say that in conclusion we are optimistic about the labor markets for all the reasons, keep articulated is the strong environment we have a very good seasoned team. We have a excellent market conditions and we are optimistic going forward. So thank you for your time and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

Our hosts for today\u2019s call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Max Messmer","Thank you and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As a reminder, the comments made on today\u2019s call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions.","We consider these remarks to be reasonable; however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today\u2019s 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today\u2019s call.","For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website at roberthalf.com. From the home page, click on the Investor Center link at the bottom left of the page.","Now let's review Robert Half's financial results for the second quarter. Global revenues for the company were $1.516 billion, an increase of 4% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and an increase of 6% on a same-day constant currency basis. Second quarter net income per share was $0.98 versus $0.89 in the same period one year ago. This is an increase of 10% year-over-year.","Cash flow from operations was $121 million in the second quarter and capital expenditures were $16 million. In June, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $60 million. We have 4.9 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We saw solid demand for our staffing and Protiviti services during the second quarter. Global talent shortages persist across our professional disciplines, particularly in the United States, where unemployment remains near a 50-year low. This enhances the value of our services. During the second quarter return on invested capital for the company was 42%.","I'll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed discussion.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As noted, global revenues in the second quarter were $1.516 billion. This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year-ago period. Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule, showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations.","The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure, designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","On an as adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $965 million, up 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $278 million, up 3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","There were 63.4 billing days and the second quarter versus 63.5 in the same quarter one year ago. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 63.3 days in the third quarter one year ago.","Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $16 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.3 percentage points.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $273 million, $211 million of that is from business within the United States and $62 million is from operations outside of the United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti revenues were up 14% versus the year ago period. On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the second quarter were up 15% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis.","Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.2 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.","Now, let's take a look at gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.2% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the second quarter one year ago. Expanding bill\/pay spreads and lower payroll tax rates were the largest contributors to the increase.","Permanent placement revenues were 11.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 11.0% during the same period one year ago. When combined with the temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 70 basis points compared to the year ago period to 45.1%. Protiviti gross margin was $76 million in the second quarter or 27.9% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 27.3% of Protiviti revenues.","Staffing SG&A costs were 34.6% of staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 33.7% in last year's second quarter. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues to this quarter versus one year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. SG&A costs for Protiviti in the second quarter were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues versus 19.4% of revenues in the year ago period.","Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $130 million. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $105 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.5%.","Operating income for our permanent placement division was $25 million in the second quarter and produced an operating margin of 18.0%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $29 million resulting in an operating margin of 10.6%.","At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $842 million and implied days sales outstanding DSO was 49.8 days.","Before we move to the third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the second quarter of 2019 and thus far in July, all adjusted for currency and billing days.","Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues up 5.3% versus the prior year, compared to a 3.7% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first two weeks of July were up 4.3%, compared to the same period in July one year ago.","Permanent placement revenues in June were up 7.6% versus June one year ago. This compares to a 6.2% increase for the full quarter. For the first three weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were down 4.6%, compared to the same period last year.","We provided this information so that you have insight in some of the trends we saw during the second quarter and into July. But, as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them.","With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance; revenues $1.525 billion to $1.590 billion; income per share $0.98 to $1.04. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5% on a same-day as adjusted basis, which includes Protiviti and EPS growth of 6%. The projected tax rate for the third quarter is 28.5% compared to 24.1% a year ago. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.","Now I'll turn it over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We were pleased with our results in the second quarter both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. The demand for skilled talent is something we don't see diminishing anytime soon. Skill shortages are most pronounced in the professional occupations, in which we specialize. Likewise demand remained strong for the consulting expertise of our Protiviti professionals as they work with companies on risk and compliance, data and analytics, performance improvement, and technology-related efforts.","Increasingly Protiviti is collaborating with Robert Half's staffing divisions to work on major client initiatives. Our blended staffing and Protiviti solutions allow us to meet the company's needs at every point in the staffing and consulting continuum. We believe this is a key differentiator for us.","Access to talent on a full-time, project and consulting basis is at a premium right now and with our full spectrum of staffing and Protiviti solutions, we are a reliable resource for this hard-to-find talent and expertise.","As we've talked about many times on this call, small and midsized businesses make up the lion's share of our client base while small business optimism is still at historically high levels, a few of the surveys we follow have reported slightly lower business confidence in recent months. This has had little impact in hiring activity however.","As of June the NFIB, small business optimism index, reported 19 months of consecutive employment growth among small companies. In the June survey, finding qualified workers remain the single most important business problem for these firms.","Looking at the U.S. workforce as a whole, the June employment outlook was positive, with job growth exceeding analyst estimates. The labor participation rate also rose slightly, which is a positive sign that workers feel confident in their job prospects. For these and other reasons, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in technologies that enable us to deliver a world-class digital experience that complements the personalized service we have perfected over 70 years in the staffing and recruitment industry.","Earlier this month, we introduced a new mobile app that allows candidates to search for a full-time and temporary jobs, apply instantly and track the status of their applications. The app also recommends on a real-time basis new jobs that match a candidate's preferences.","Now, Keith and I would be happy to respond to your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, as usual, and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon","Good afternoon, Max and Keith. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of additional color with regards to the acceleration that you ended up seeing in June and potentially continuing into July. I know, we're not trying to make too much on a month-to-month trends, but just wondering if you could give a little bit of color in terms of where -- which specific segments within staffing you ended up seeing it in relative to, also from a geographic perspective, what are you seeing in the U.S. relative to Europe, which seems to be slowing?","And then, how would you comment with regards to how much of the benefit is basically coming from the collaboration that you're seeing between staffing and the Protiviti division, which continues to perform extremely well?","Max Messmer","So on the acceleration, we did see improvement in U.S. temp across our lines of business every month during the quarter. May was better than April. June was better than May. In the U.S., our July start is actually a little better than June, so the U. S. trends across our lines of businesses and -- progressively got better year-on-year each month.","International results were different. We are seeing macros slowing in the Europe and in the U.K. and they offset those trends somewhat. Our guidance assumes that the growth for the quarter will be close to, essentially on a year-over-year basis, globally what it was in Q2, which is some firming in the U.S., according to trends we just talked about, offset by some additional softening in the Europe, U.K.","As to the collaboration, it continues to go very well. As we've talked about before, those results get reported in Protiviti, not in staffing. So the staffing trends, I just talked about, do not consider the additional benefits from, what we call, managed business services, managed technology services, which were significant and we're the fastest growing segment in Protiviti.","Mark Marcon","That's terrific. And can you talk just a little bit about just on the staffing EBITDA margin and the staffing SG&A? Is that partially just due to mix as it relates to just the mix between the U.S. and Europe in terms of the SG& A going up a little bit? And just the deleveraging you may have seen over there?","Max Messmer","Frankly, the SG&A deleveraging, to use your word, is more about our continued investment in tech initiatives. We've talked about on prior calls that we continue and we continue pretty much unabated from what we had in the last few quarters. We've talked about AI, machine learning, matching engine, micro-targeting and marketing, prioritizing leads for our staff. We talked earlier on the call about we released a new mobile app a couple of weeks ago that's principally candidate-focused.","So, the tech spending continues kind of irrespective of revenues. It's spending we're happy to make. We believe we're already getting payback particularly in the candidate area. We're excited about the additional initiatives we have on the runway and that's the principal reason why SG&A is up as a percent of revenue. And going to guidance, we expect that to continue in the guidance as well.","Mark Marcon","Terrific. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Michael Cho","Hi, good evening, this is Michael Cho for Andrew. I just had a question on -- Keith on the comment you made about acceleration in the U.S. staffing business across all lines in every month of the quarter. What do you think is driving that acceleration at least in the quarter and into July?","Keith Waddell","I would say that generally speaking our clients think you've got a friendlier Fed today than they did six months ago that trade tensions while still around don't seem to be as intense as they were six months ago. But if you look at the sentiment measures we referenced NFIB, you can look at the PMI services, the sentiment measures have stayed high and my personal belief is it's primarily about a more friendly Fed.","Michael Cho","Got it. Thanks. Understood. And then just a quick follow-up. What was the bill rate growth in the quarter?","Keith Waddell","So, the bill rate growth was 5.4% year-on-year. That's down slightly from 5.7% last quarter. But it's not unusual to see fluctuations in that neighborhood.","Michael Cho","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Nomura. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Dan Dolev","Hey, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Following up on the bill rates versus billable hours, I guess, gas 5.4% would imply about 1.6% negative billable hours if my math is right, getting to 3.7% same-day constant currency. That's probably the weakest it's been since the third quarter of 2017. And what needs to happen to get that number to trend back into positive territory? And what are you implicitly modeling in your head for the third quarter for that -- for those two components? Thanks.","Max Messmer","Well, our third quarter modeling is very similar to the second quarter actual. So that ones an easy one to answer.","As to what needs to happen to turn it around? I'd say the U.S. macro sentiment needs to continue to at least get no worse and improve would be nice and then to the extent we get better and better with attracting and retaining candidates that we place on assignment and\/or provide for permanent placement, the more pressure will take off of the sales cycle, which will help ours.","As we've talked about on prior calls, it's not unusable in this part of a cycle for hours to be pressured because; A, it's harder to recruit candidates; B, more candidates leave in an assignment and you have to replace them, all of which is additional work for our staff. All of which ultimately will lead to pressure on hours.","As we've also said on calls because of the pressure on ours, we also feel like we need to get paid when we have the eligible candidate, which is why you see the bill rates increasing in the 5% range and has over a few quarters now.","Dan Dolev","Got it. And just to clarify, Keith you said the third quarter guidance, you're basically implying about 3.7% staffing organic growth rescinding with this roughly similar components is that what you were saying?","Keith Waddell","Staffing overall is roughly expected to grow the same rate, by which it did in the second quarter. We leave ourselves some wiggle room between perm and temp. But staffing overall, the guidance is Q3 growth looks the same as Q2 growth, which notably isn't any slowing versus the growth what we just showed in part because of the trend line, the improving trend line we talked about.","Dan Dolev","Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Nice results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I wanted to shift gears and talk about Protiviti a little bit. You had some nice margin expansion both in the gross margin line and operating margin line. Could you talk about what drove that? And if you could also give us a little bit more color of what's embedded in your 3Q guidance for Protiviti both revenues and margins? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","So Protiviti had a very strong quarter. The good news is it was very broad-based. Every one of their major segments had double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. Internal audit was strong; IT audit was the strongest part within that; tech consulting was strong; cloud, cyber, digital, FSI, regulatory was strong; and then the strongest of all managed business services, managed technology services where the pipeline continues to be strong.","We have various types of projects we're staffing in Protiviti work together. Examples include remediating material weaknesses, resolving processing backlogs, back office modernization, standing up shared service centers, user experience, user interface improvements. Again, our model where we have scalable staff from the staffing side keeps subject matter expertise for Protiviti continues to go very well. But as I just said, it's in addition to their traditional segments also already doing well.","We did see margin expansion on SG&A. You got better leveraging of cost at the gross margin line. They had slightly better pricing, slightly better utilization. We are very happy, their margin -- operating margin for the quarter was double-digit. Year-to-date, they're at 9%, which is just below double-digit, still better than 7.6% a year ago.","Our expectation is that they'll have double-digit margins the last two quarters of the year and will end the year with double-digit margins, which we've talked about of being our goal for some time. So very strong revenue performance, U.S. and non-U.S, although non-U.S. had very high comps from a year ago, they also saw some slowing in Europe, U.K. But still, all things considered, Protiviti non-U.S. wasn't bad, Protiviti U.S. was outstanding.","Jeff Silber","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a couple quick numbers questions. What share count is embedded in your 3Q EPS guidance? And I know you're not giving 4Q guidance, but at least from a tax rate perspective, should we use that 28.5% for the fourth quarter as well? ","Keith Waddell","So we're using $116.5 for share count. Tax rate should normalize in the fourth quarter 27% to 27.5%. We pointed out this call with our Q3 guidance is 28.5%, which is four points higher than a year ago. A year ago, we had some non-recurring credits for foreign taxes when we reconciled our return to our tax accounts. We don't expect those credits to repeat, although Q3 is always a noisy quarter for tax rate, given that it's the core that you reconcile your tax return to your accounts.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Thanks so much for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thanks. Hey, Keith and Max, any sense of how conversion fees came in, in the quarter? And then, just what's been the tenor of clients? Do they become kind of less picky? Or just pushing out the hiring decision at all? Just any thoughts, at the margin, particularly on the perm side?","Keith Waddell","So conversions were 3.5% of revenue on the temp side, which is consistent with last quarter. As to tone of business in perm, particularly from a client point of view, clients are just as picky as they were, which slows us down. We're further slowed down by, candidates are getting counteroffers from their existing employers when they go tell them they're going to leave. They further get multiple outside offers when it's known that they're looking. So, many times we go through an entire process with a candidate and in the 12th hour, they decide to stay with their existing company or they take another offer and we have to start over or we have to go to Plan B to the extent we've got a Plan B in the works.","But the point is clients are still demanding, they're still picky, they're still selective. Candidates are still tight. They're in demand. They have many opportunities which makes them more selective and more picky, so you got both sides counterintuitively being more selective.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. And then just any the step up in the tax rate was that just mix? Or any particular reason for that?","Keith Waddell","The tax rate -- there are certain costs that are non-deductible under the new Tax Act. We had more of those this year than last and we had the absence of credits we got a year ago as I just talked about. But a normal rate should be more in the 27%, 27.5% and that's what we hope to see in the fourth quarter.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys, good afternoon. I guess I just wanted to ask given the success you're having going to market with Protiviti and using some of the staffing business, I realize in the grand scheme of the company that's still fairly small numbers. But is that of any sort of exacerbating any ability to find candidates for temp engagements? Or -- and then thus having an impact on the growth? Or presumably you prioritize those for your own Protiviti engagement? Or is that not at the scale that that's an issue at all?","Max Messmer","Well, we like to think that we provide each of our candidates -- our clients the very best candidate available and we don't cherry-pick for the benefit of Protiviti. But clearly Protiviti is staffing some largest clients, so they impact the candidate pool. But frankly it's a high-class problem to have and we like to have more of it.","So, I would say that the success with Protiviti is to the detriment of success with third-party clients, but there's no question that the candidate pool is tight. But particularly the tech initiatives we have in place I believe is having a meaningful impact on our ability to recruit candidates and to deliver them to clients whether that client is Protiviti or whether that client is a third-party client.","Frankly, our people on the staffing side internally they get paid the same either way. So, they're ambivalent. They're agnostic. They're neutral on whether the clients of Protiviti or whether they're clients of a third-party.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Thanks. And then the follow-up you've mentioned a couple of times the concept of the technology investments are helping with candidates. How do you measure that? And is there -- and I guess how do you get that out to the candidates? Are you having to do an advertising campaign or marketing campaign? Are you just introduce it to people who are currently working with you?","Max Messmer","We do a lot of things. But as an example, the new mobile app we released two weeks ago, every time we get a new order, we will match that against our candidate inventory. And you will in real-time get pushed to you that opportunity if you're on our mobile app. If you're not and our mobile approximately, we'll communicate with you by e-mail or however you've told us you want to be communicated with.","But the point is for the first time in the history of Robert Half when we get a new order, we immediately match it to our inventory and then we reach out to everybody that matches that order and ask them to apply for that position. So, that's much more proactive than we were five years ago, much less 10 years ago. It's just one example.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Timothy McHugh","Thanks. Just maybe one question but two parts I guess. Internationally, can you -- is the softening broad-based? Is there anything specific to certain countries?","And then secondly, the trends in June, is it -- rate was that broad-based? In the U.S. was that broad-based as well or any of the practice lines more pronounced than the other ones in terms of improving trends? Thanks.","Max Messmer","In the International Zone, the softening was principally Europe and U.K. Although we will say while Germany slowed a lot, it slowed a lot on a high base and it still had a solid single digit growth number year-on-year, which given the environment we thought was pretty good. But generally speaking, it was Belgium -- slowing Belgium, Germany, France and U.K.","As to June trends, while there are some differences by line of business, it was broad. It was broad throughout the quarter and it was broad by line of business. It wasn't isolated in any one line of business.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Leonard","Hi, this is Ryan on for Manav. Just curious on the perm declines in July. Is there anything specific call out there, 4th of July timing, anything like that?","Max Messmer","Perm is always; A, more volatile; B, the post-quarter is less predictive of the full quarter. I think the most volatile period of time we have over the course of the entire year is around the 4th of July holiday. And so we've studied the post-quarter start relative to the full month. With hindsight we looked at the post-quarter start with respect to the full quarter with hindsight. And the least predictive period all year long is the July 4th post-quarter period. So, would we like for it to have been stronger? Absolutely, but while I wouldn't say grain of salt, we certainly aren't particularly concerned about it. And we continue to be very bullish on perm, in fact continue to add per heads disproportionately in perm, which also somewhat impacts our SG&A.","Ryan Leonard","Got it. Thanks. And then on the mobile app, I mean, I guess, if you're looking out the next couple of years, what are some milestones that we should think of, either in terms of your number of roles placed, or candidates on the app itself, as we kind of track of the progress of this kind of new initiative?","Max Messmer","Well, I think, the idea is, we want to communicate with candidates on their terms, not just ours. So if they prefer to come to our website, fine, they can do that. If they'd prefer we e-mail them, fine. We can do that. If instead, they like to be pushed, if they can set up their own agents and pull jobs themselves, we can push jobs to them based on what they match to.","The point is, we want to be everywhere they are. So I'm not sure the metrics of any one channel over any other channel are critical. But the point is, there's no question, we live in a more mobile-centric world than we ever have. And we've just, in a major way, upgraded the user-friendliness and the functionality of what we provide on our website. And by the way, if you report your time to us on that website or on the new mobile app, you get paid within 24 hours. And not a lot of companies can say that.","Ryan Leonard","Interesting. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tobey Sommer","Thanks. I was wondering if you could comment about bill\/pay spreads and expectations for pricing and bill rates, in the context of the slightly improved demand you're seeing in historical trends.","Max Messmer","We would say, if you look at 2004-2009 period, while unemployment wasn't quite as low then as it is now, it was slow, and we consistently got around 5% bill rate increases that, in virtually every case, slightly exceeded our pay rate increases such that we expanded our gross margins.","So we've been in that 5% range now for a few quarters. It would be our expectation that we stay in that range. We not go significantly higher nor significantly lower. It seems, based on history, to kind of be the sweet spot, giving what wage inflation is as we see it.","Tobey Sommer","And could you frame that for us in terms of gross margin? What kind of expansion did you have in that five-year period in the last expansion? If you don't mind also incorporating in the -- kind of refreshing us on whatever social costs there still may be that could be alleviated from the gross margin this cycle? Thanks.","Max Messmer","So the social cost, I presume, you're referring to, the most significant we have is the state unemployment. And with unemployment rates at 50-year lows, one of the positives of that are, each state has fewer claims. We have fewer claims charged to our account at each state and in turn the rate were charged against current payroll declines. So, I think it was 10 or 15 basis points of the decline -- of the improvement this quarter year-on-year relates to an improvement or a lowering of the state unemployment tax rate. And as unemployment rates continue to come down, our expectation would be we'll continue to see benefits from that.","As to the gross margin expansion, I guess, I don't have five years of history in front of me. We have to constantly weigh against our spreads versus the market versus our competitors that are largely local and regional.","I don't think anybody would dispute that we have industry-leading margins. And we're aware of that and we therefore certainly don't want to price ourselves out of the market. So, while we believe we can modestly expand our gross margins from here objective one is to pass through wage inflation which we're doing; and objective two is to modestly expand gross margins understanding we are already at the highest margin supplier in most local markets relative to our local competition. ","Tobey Sommer","Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Seth Weber","Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the Europe commentary and the kind of relative strength in Germany. Can you just remind us what's unique to your position there that's enabling you to put up positive growth numbers in a pretty soft market? Thank you.","Max Messmer","I'd start with we have a really good experienced team in Germany. We've made significant headcount investments consistently for many years much less many quarters in a row. Our project-based businesses Management Resources and Robert Half Technology generally speaking in Europe are more resilient than is Accountemps and OfficeTeam that are more transactional. They seem to be more macro impacted than the Management Resources or Robert Half Technology.","So, I think it's a combination of consistent past investment, the quality and experience of our team, and the positioning of our revenue mix toward the higher level project-oriented lines of businesses.","Seth Weber","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just -- I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you give a third quarter -- a 3Q staffing operating margin guidance target or -- I know you gave Protiviti double-digits, but anything that we should\u2026","Max Messmer","So, with our guidance let's just do a brief little tour down the P&L. Staffing gross margins up 30 to 50 basis points. Higher spreads lower suite taxes as we just talked about. Protiviti gross margins up 75 to 100 basis points higher rates and utilization. SG&A staffing up 60 to 80 basis points. More tech investments, more perm heads. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 80 basis points leveraged from their outsized growth.","Operating income staffing down 20 to 40 basis points as the SG&A is more than the increase in gross margin. Protiviti up 100 to 200 basis points. You've got the double benefit of higher gross margin and less SG&A. However, the bad news is when you get down to the tax rate, it's up four points over last year and takes away some of the benefit we just described.","Seth Weber","Perfect. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much guys. Have a good night.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Blake Johnson","Hi, this is Blake on for George. Thanks for taking my question. Given that bill rates expanded 5.4% this quarter, how much of the 70 basis points of gross margin expansion in temp staffing was driven by increasing bill\/pay spreads versus the change in payroll tax rates?","Keith Waddell","Okay. So as we talked about a second ago, our state unemployment rates came down and they added somewhere between 10 and 15 basis points to the increase in spreads and the balances is principally the difference between pay rates and bill rates.","Blake Johnson","Got it. Thank you. And then regarding hiring, are you continuing to grow headcount? Or have you pared back your hiring this quarter?","Max Messmer","Our objective with hiring is to stay as consistent as we can with our expectations on top line growth. We've gotten a little ahead in perm. We're still bullish on perm. We're still hiring in perm. So we'll still stay a little bit ahead. You'll see the perm margins -- operating margins running in the 20% or 18%, but we'll take 18% all day long. Generally speaking, we continue to hire commensurate with -- consistent with what we expect top line growth to be.","Blake Johnson","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Just a quick follow-up Keith. The margin guidance that you gave was that compared to the prior quarter, the one that just ended or the prior year?","Keith Waddell","Prior year.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Just wanted to clarify that. Thanks so much.","Keith Waddell","Prior year. 2Q -- 3Q of 2018.","Jeff Silber","3Q, 2018? Great. Thanks so much.","Max Messmer","That was our last question.

Our hosts for today\u2019s call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Max Messmer","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate you joining us. I would like to preface today\u2019s remarks with a reminder that some of our comments today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment as to what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar or such expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today\u2019s 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today\u2019s call.","For your convenience, our prepared remarks also are available on our website at roberthalf.com, from the homepage click on Investor Center at the top of the page. You will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link in the Investor Center.","Now, let\u2019s review our results for the first quarter of 2018. Companywide revenues were $1.395 billion, up 8% on a reported basis and up 7% on a same-day, constant-currency basis from the year ago period. Net income per share was $0.78. You may recall that in December 2017, we recorded provisional amounts and a reasonable estimate for the one-time transition tax on our foreign earnings and profits, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. At that time, we anticipated additional guidance would be released by the IRS throughout 2018 that would require us to adjust our estimate. The result of additional guidance issued during the first quarter led to our recording a $3 million charge to our income tax provision, or $0.02 per share. Excluding this tax charge, net income per share was $0.80 for the quarter.","Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $116 million and capital expenditures were $8 million. During the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a $0.04 increase to our quarterly cash dividend, bringing it to $0.28. We paid the dividend in March at a total cost of $35 million. The board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10 million shares of the company\u2019s common stock. We repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares in the first quarter, at a cost of $60 million. We have 11.3 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We were pleased with the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter, including across-the-board revenue growth in our U.S. and non-U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations, and particularly strong growth in our permanent placement division. These gains were fueled by continued small business optimism, a growing global economy and low unemployment rates in professional occupations. We continue to invest in digital innovation initiatives that will seamlessly integrate our customers\u2019 digital experience with our industry-leading traditional professional staffing services. Robert Half\u2019s return on invested capital was 35% during the first quarter.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As just noted, global revenues were $1.395 billion in the first quarter. This is up 8% from the first quarter of 2017 on a reported basis, and up 7% on a same-day, constant-currency basis from the year-ago period. First quarter staffing revenues were up 7% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $895 million, up 5% on a same-day basis, while non-U.S. staffing revenues were $293 million, up 16% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The first quarter had 63 billing days compared to 63.4 days in the first quarter one year ago. The current second quarter has 63.5 billing days, compared to 63.3 days in the second quarter of 2017. Accompanying our earnings release is the supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. Also included in the supplemental schedule is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP net income per share calculation to the most comparable GAAP measure regarding the previously noted tax charge.","Currency exchange rate movements were favorable and had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $29 million in the first quarter, which boosted year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rates by 2.6%. Global revenues for Protiviti were $207 million in the first quarter, with $167 million coming from the United States and $40 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 5% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 1% from the prior year on a same-day basis, while non-U.S. revenues were up 22%. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $4 million in the first quarter and increasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.9%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 76 locations in 26 countries.","Now, let\u2019s turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.2% of applicable revenues in the first quarter compared to 37.4% of applicable revenues in the same period one year ago. Higher temp-to-hire conversion fees partially offset higher fringe benefit costs. First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.2% of consolidated staffing revenues compared to 9.5% of consolidated staffing revenues in last year\u2019s first quarter. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 30 basis points versus 1 year ago, to 43.6%. First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $55 million, or 26.4% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million, or 27.0% of Protiviti revenues.","Staffing SG&A costs were 33.5% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 33.4% in the previous year\u2019s first quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 18.4% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period. First quarter operating income for our staffing divisions was $119 million, up 10% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.0%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $97 million in operating income, an increase of 7% from the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.1%. For our permanent placement division, operating income was $22 million in the first quarter. This was up 22% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 18.4%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $15 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 10% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 7.4%. Accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter were $785 million and implied days sales outstanding, DSO were 50.5 days.","Before we move to second quarter guidance, let\u2019s review the monthly trends we saw in the first quarter of 2018 and so far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues up 6.3% versus the prior year, compared to 6.2% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first two weeks of April were up 7.6% compared to that same period in 2017. For our permanent placement division, March revenues were up 16.7% versus last year, compared to a 15% increase for the full quarter. For the first three weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were up 24.5% compared to the same period last year. This information is designed to highlight some of the trends we saw during the first quarter and so far in April. But as you know, they represent brief periods of time and we caution against reading too much into them.","With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.4 billion to $1.46 billion; income per share, $0.81 to $0.87. The midpoint of our second quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 7% on a same-day, constant-currency basis, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 31%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We were pleased to see broad-based, year-over-year revenue growth in all lines of business in the first quarter. International staffing and Protiviti results were solid, and our U.S. based operations continued to do well. Despite fewer-than-expected new jobs being added to the U.S. economy in March, the job market is strong, with unemployment holding steady at 4.1% for several months now. The unemployment rate is even lower in the professional occupations in which we specialize. Small and midsize businesses remain optimistic about their growth prospects, according to the latest Vistage CEO Confidence Index and the NFIB\u2019s small business optimism index. This favorable business sentiment is fueling job growth in this segment, which is our key customer base.","At Robert Half, we are also optimistic. Our brands are among the industry\u2019s most recognized and respected, our financial position is strong, and our field management teams are experienced and highly capable of growing the business. Our industry is at an inflection point and digital transformation is at the heart of it. We are developing proprietary digital solutions that give our customers multiple ways to interact with us online from submitting job orders to browsing for job candidates. And we continue to test new online services that we believe will appeal to even more customers. Protiviti is also expanding its offerings by complementing its core internal audit and internal controls solutions with a widening suite of consulting services in risk and compliance, technology, data and analytics, and business performance improvement. We believe we are just scratching the surface when it comes to the opportunities for us in the space where Protiviti leverages our staffing resources. Blending the capabilities of both businesses enables Protiviti to provide Big Four-quality consulting services at competitive prices. Global and regional consulting firms that compete with Protiviti generally lacks the flexible resource capabilities of Robert Half\u2019s staffing operations.","Now, Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. We ask that as usual you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we\u2019ll try to return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon","Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter. I thought the performance in Accountemps was particularly noteworthy and I was wondering if you could give some commentary as to the extent, that perhaps lease accounting or rev\/rec or any \u2013 or the changes in taxes are contributing to the growth? And then as a follow-up, could you also talk a little bit about what the bill rate expansion was relative to ours and are you seeing a pickup in terms of orders as it relates to ours? Thank you.","Max Messmer","Sure, Mark. While each of the items you referenced rev\/rec, changes in taxes, lease accounting, they were all helpful for Accountemps. I don\u2019t think any of them dominated the acceleration in growth. The growth was broad-based. It was across geographies. It was across skill levels or functional roles as we would call it. Generally, the backdrop remained high, sentiment, optimism more high, regulatory relief, tax cuts, positive GDP growth, you have got more projects being started by clients, more sense of urgency. As to bill rate increases as an indication that clients are beginning to pay more, they are beginning to acknowledge the supply demand dynamics in the marketplace. Our bill rates were up 2.5% year-on-year for the quarter, so that\u2019s up from the fourth quarter. Frankly, that\u2019s expected and welcomed. It\u2019s been a long time coming. We do see that continuing to rise as we move forward and that\u2019s typically a good thing from a margin standpoint.","Mark Marcon","That\u2019s great. Just one word, can you talk a little bit about the conversions, because it sounds like that was also a positive?","Max Messmer","So, conversions were up 20 basis points which was a nice positive. Coincident with the demand for more full-time hiring, there was demand to convert temporaries that were performing well on engagements. As you know, conversions have lagged in this recovery. It\u2019s certainly another puzzle piece that falls into place and makes sense as the labor market tightens as there is more urgent demand that not only would there be more hiring of people that began as a full-time hire, but also more hiring of those that began as a temporary that performed well and didn\u2019t get converted. So, we were encouraged frankly across the board from an hours billed standpoint, from a conversion standpoint point, from a number of permanent placement standpoint.","Mark Marcon","That\u2019s great. I will jump back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Dolev from Nomura. Your line is open.","Dan Dolev","Hey, thanks guys. Great results. Congrats. Two questions. One on the U.S. perm versus temp, I mean, I look at temp growth in the U.S., it definitely accelerated, it looks great and so is perm, but how should we think about kind of temp growing about 4%ish and then perm growing 15%, how does that compare to previous cycles and how should we think about it going forward? Thanks.","Max Messmer","If you look back over time what you will see is that directionally temp and perm moved together that they tend to peak and trough at the same time within the peaks and troughs, there is volatility, there is certainly more volatility on the perm side than on the temp side, but frankly it\u2019s usually a earlier cycle sign that perm outperforms temp. So, we are encouraged that with the pent-up demand for full-time hiring that that\u2019s beginning to happen and that typically bodes well for further temp acceleration down the road.","Dan Dolev","That\u2019s very interesting. I didn\u2019t know that. And then a follow-up question is in your temp guidance, can you maybe give some color as to U.S. versus international cadence and thank you very much.","Keith Waddell","So, our guidance overall is pretty straightforward we have pretty much superimposed our revenue growth rates from Q1 on to Q2. We have pretty much taken our gross margin and SG&A structure and superimposed them on Q2 although maybe there is a touch of upside sequentially in our guidance versus what we just reported. U.S. versus non-U.S. I would say that if anything we show a little acceleration in U.S. and a little deceleration in non-U.S. more because of comps than anything else, but frankly both are strong. As you saw, we started out of the gate in April very strong and that was both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. So, good across the board frankly and our Q2 guidance model looks a whole lot like Q1 actual.","Dan Dolev","Excellent. Great job. Thanks, again.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. I wanted to ask a little bit about the 7% revenue growth at the middle of the second quarter guide obviously the April start on both temp and perm were faster than that 7% and just wanted to know kind of how you set the 7% at the middle?","Max Messmer","Well, I\u2019d say first we look at how did we exit the first quarter and we exited the first quarter growing about what we grew for the entire first quarter. So, that\u2019s one input. Clearly, we had a stronger start the first couple of weeks of April than our exit to the first quarter and the first full quarter and so to the extent the April start plays out over the course of the quarter that would certainly be upside relative to our guidance. We hope it\u2019s conservative, but it essentially flows through into the second quarter, the year-on-year growth we had in the first quarter, the comps get a little bit tougher in the second quarter than the first, but not significantly.","Andrew Steinerman","And then just a second question on bill rates, you are very clear to say that you welcomed the acceleration of 2.5% growth in the quarter, could you just give a comment on domestic versus international? Are you seeing this acceleration in both markets? Is it a mix thing? Just give some color on domestic versus international on the same question of what\u2019s happening with bill rates?","Max Messmer","I would say that most of the acceleration that you see this quarter is in the United States. They are stable outside of the United States, but the acceleration that you saw is principally a U.S. phenomenon.","Andrew Steinerman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. In the temp staffing business, gross margins compressed about 20 basis points due to higher fringe benefit costs, can you discuss how you expect these costs to evolve and what your views are broadly as it relates to gross margins on just wage growth and bill pay spreads over the next 2 to 4 quarters?","Keith Waddell","So they did compress 20 basis points and if you take out the 20 basis point improvement in conversions they compressed 40 basis points due to fringes and we are talking about holiday pay, we are talking about mandated sick pay. To some extent, we are talking about medical benefits that we pay to certain of our temporaries. Our plan is to raise our pay bill spreads as we move forward to recover those additional costs. The fact that pay rates are rising and clients acknowledge they are having to pay more gives us cover not only to pass through the additional pay rate, but also to recover those additional fringes as well. We made sequential progress in the first quarter versus the fourth in our pay bill spreads. We had credits in the fourth quarter that didn\u2019t repeat that camouflage of that progress. So we are cautiously optimistic that as we move forward throughout 2018 that we will see some relief on the gross margin side. Hopefully, conversions will continue to remain strong. Also, the comparisons get easier as we move forward into 2018. So for all of those reasons, we are cautiously optimistic that come the second half of 2018 we won\u2019t have temp gross margin dilution compared to the year ago period.","George Tong","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. In your prepared remarks, you talked about that the bullishness of your clients in terms of their hiring I am just curious how you are feeling about that. Have you accelerated your own internal hiring since the beginning of the year and if so when?","Keith Waddell","So, we are bullish about our clients\u2019 bullishness. That said, we had front-ended internal hiring of recruiters and salespeople a few quarters in advance of the acceleration we have seen in the past couple. We have begun to add to our internal staff again. Our plan is to keep those additions in line with the revenue growth rates that we are seeing. So to some extent, we hope to get some leverage of the front ending of the adds we made the last couple of years. On the other hand, we want to continue to feed the hot hand and we want to continue to have adequate recruiters and salespeople as things continue to accelerate. So, we will add the staff, we have added to staff, but not disproportionately to the revenue growth rates that we are seeing.","Jeff Silber","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Max, in your remarks towards the other markets, you talked about some of the proprietary digital solutions that you are developing for your customers. I am not expecting you to give away the secret sauce. But can you give us some high level examples of the kind of things that you are working on? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Max Messmer","Well, I am watching Keith here give me the signal that I have got to be careful of what I say, because it is proprietary. As you know, we have done a lot to date that\u2019s obvious in terms of enabling clients to search our databases in different markets and so forth. We have done a lot to make it easier for applicants to apply. All of those were probably expected. I am a little reluctant to say much beyond that, but I will see if my partner here has anything he wants to add.","Keith Waddell","Well, we have talked now for several quarters about we intend to be as world class in the digital experience our clients have. As the offline traditional experience that they have had with us, we continue to build out ways that we digitally interact with our clients. And importantly we think it important that, that be integrated with our traditional service, so that there is transparency whether you are a client, whether you are a candidate or whether you are an internal staff person that they get \u2013 they see it all no matter how they interacted, because frankly the same client for the same candidate might sometimes interact traditionally and sometimes interact digitally and it all needs to be understood, analyzed and optimized without regards to how the interaction occurred. So, it\u2019s not just about building digital interactions, it\u2019s about doing in a way that\u2019s integrated with what you already do. As Max talked about, we have had what we call candid browsing for some time, we are the first major staffing firm to allow anybody to go online and see our candidate database anybody can go this second to roberthalf.com and do that, but anyway, we are on a multi-quarter journey here to further optimize, to further make available to clients and candidates and to make it easier to interact with us digitally as well as traditionally.","Jeff Silber","Alright. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Just Keith, you usually walk through the margin, I know you said at a high level it looks similar to, I guess what you saw in the first quarter, is there any distinctions does that play out through all the kind of pieces?","Keith Waddell","All the pieces will be a little bit different, but generally, the margins won\u2019t look that different and certainly in our guidance aren\u2019t that different from first quarter actual. Protiviti tends to do a little better sequentially in the second quarter than the first from a margin standpoint. So, we would expect there to have higher margins in the first quarter, particularly since they had a couple of one-off items that reduced their margins in the first quarter, but generally speaking, margins for Q2 guidance are about the same. They are a little bit higher. The little bit higher is principally because of Protiviti seasonal and absence of one-offs that they had in the first quarter.","Tim McHugh","Okay. You mentioned someone asked earlier about kind of hiring plans internally and you talked about growing inline with I guess or at least not disproportional to revenue. I guess connected to that, can you talk about SG&A leverage for the staffing business as we go forward from here? Are you looking to lever that line in the next 6 to 12 months or I guess are you thinking about you are bullish enough that you are more focused on adding headcount than trying to find leverage out of that line in the near to medium term?","Keith Waddell","Well, we are very bullish. We do intend to add, but not disproportionately so. We still think we can get a little leverage on the front-ending of the heads that we did the last couple of years. Also keep in mind that the digital innovation spend is directly charged against SG&A and we do not see that subsiding over the next 6 to 12 months. So, while we might get a little overall SG&A leverage, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be huge in the next 6 to 12 months.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And then lastly the April trends, can you dissect how would this Easter impact that as we look at those numbers I guess the timing versus I guess 2017, did you try and cut it that way at all?","Keith Waddell","Well, we looked at it. Everybody as a theory both as to Easter as to how weather hit and impacted, frankly it\u2019s all noise. I wouldn\u2019t get too carried away about Easter impact or weather impacts. The facts are we had a very solid start notwithstanding both of those matters and we feel great about it, but as far as the guidance we gave at midpoint, we didn\u2019t dial that further acceleration up, we hope it continues.","Tim McHugh","Alright, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.","Ryan Leonard","Hi, this is Ryan Leonard on for Manav. I guess just on that last point, you had called out of snowstorms when you gave the 1Q guidance, I guess was there an impact to the first quarter numbers?","Keith Waddell","Right. But one of the reasons we called out the storms because relative to a couple of weeks it has a bigger impact than it does relative to a full quarter. We typically don\u2019t talk a lot about weather, because every year you have got some kind of weather impacts, but when you are talking about a very short post quarter period, weathers can have disproportionate impacts. It\u2019s the only reason we called it out.","Ryan Leonard","Got it. And then so I guess excluding that tax \u2013 the one-time portion of the tax charge, the rate obviously came in towards the lower end of the range. I guess from your understanding do you think we are kind of behind any of the one-time tax charges and is the 26% to 28% range still a right way to think about it?","Keith Waddell","Absent further clarifications from an IRS on the transition to the tax code we do think we are behind them. The 26% to 28% estimate that we gave a couple of quarters ago was still intact. The midpoint of our guidance uses a rate of 27% which is right in the middle of that range. So absent further guidance, the one-times are behind us and the rate we see going forward is consistent with the rate we expected it to be.","Ryan Leonard","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tobey Sommer","Thank you. Wanted to ask you a question about market share, do you expect increased market share in core domestic S&A staffing and if so how important in integral are your online initiatives as well as something you referenced in your prepared remarks the cross-selling to consulting customers? Thanks.","Max Messmer","Well, we are always looking to increase market share domestic and international. Online is a piece of it, something we haven\u2019t talked a lot about, which we are getting a lot of traction with frankly is our staffing operations particularly in the accounting and finance area, Accountemps management resources going to market together with Protiviti. We have had some very significant joint wins where they go to market together. Protiviti manages the project much of the staff that work on those projects come from our staffing operations. So, we have clearly taken those joint activities to a new level. It\u2019s starting to be meaningful. It\u2019s starting to move the needle. We are delighted by that. We believe we have competitive advantage by having under one roof both a world-class consulting operation, Big Four consulting operation in Protiviti as well as the undisputed leader in accounting finance staffing with our finance and accounting brands. So, it\u2019s a wonderful thing and it\u2019s been a long time coming, but we are getting more and more traction, we are getting more and more wins. We are having meaningful wins as we go to market together between staffing in Protiviti and I think that ultimately helps our market share not only on the staffing side, but on the consulting side as well.","Tobey Sommer","How much of the growth in Accountemps, in Management Resources, the two units you cited is a result of cross-selling in going to market together with the consulting of the Protiviti business?","Max Messmer","Well, we clearly don\u2019t break it out. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more dramatic in Management Resources than it is in Accountemps, but it\u2019s not insignificant with Accountemps either.","Tobey Sommer","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Mario Cortellacci","Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Want to get a sense of whether you see Robert Half been versus buying further whether it be organically or through acquisition out of accounting and office in admin. As you have in the past in say areas like tech and maybe you can give us a quick update on your M&A pipeline?","Max Messmer","Well, I\u2019d say we are already in tech. Tech is beginning to show signs of life for us. We finally had positive year-over-year growth. If you look at the late quarter and early April trends, tech participated quite nicely in the acceleration. We are very pleased with that. As far as M&A pipeline based in Silicon Valley, we see a lot of online centric start-ups related to human capital staffing to gig economy. We have looked at many of those opportunities as we have said before given the opportunity to buy computing capacity in the cloud given the number of applications in the cloud that are available we think there is a stronger opportunity to build versus buy than ever. And as we talked about earlier in the call, we are hard at work building and we have had early success with what we built and we continued to leverage that as well.","Mario Cortellacci","Thank you. And just a quick follow-up and then I will turn it over just kind of relating to what you just said regarding new entrants. I know there has been a divergence obviously minus this quarter and your bill pay and then also wage inflation in, wanted to see I guess what your thoughts were on its new entrants maybe it could be affecting those trends or what you see or what you have been seeing going forward?","Max Messmer","Well, I don\u2019t think new entrants have had much impact on pay bill trends or pay bill spread trends frankly. There has been a very spirited debate for many quarters about how much slack has there been in the labor force throughout much less the professional segments. We have long said that we thought there was more slack than the overall numbers would indicate, that slack is beginning to tighten and we are seeing wage inflation again beginning to see it anyway. And typically that\u2019s a good thing for us. We can \u2013 typically that\u2019s a margin expansion opportunity for us and new entrants that frankly in the temporary help business aren\u2019t that prevalent \u2013 aren\u2019t really moving the needle in that way.","Mario Cortellacci","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Silver from Morningstar. Your line is open.","David Silver","Yes, hi, thank you. So, a lot of the questions on this call has been posed maybe to the managers of this company, but I would like maybe to change the perspective to the largest owners of the company. So, you have always been a cash-rich company and I am starting with this quarter I see a pretty big permanent maybe 10 percentage point decline in your effective tax rate. Last year, your pre-tax income was over $500 million, this year it\u2019s probably going to be closer to $600 million. So that 10 percentage point drop is basically increasing your already sufficient financial flexibility. So, was the major owners of this company, what is the highest and best use of that incremental cash flow in other words, will we see a significant increase in cash return to shareholders or might we see increased investments going forward. So just if you could comment on what you see as the optimal way to deploy what\u2019s going to be a significant step change upward in your free cash flow and financial flexibility? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","Well, I guess the first comment I would make that individually we are very large owners of the company as well and in fact by far and away the largest asset we own is the stock of Robert Half. So, we would like to think that not only can we think like managers we can also think like owners. Further, we have a long history of returning our free cash back to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends. We started it in 2004. We have raised it every year since I think the compound growth thereafter is around 12%. Dollar cost average on the buyback we don\u2019t try to market time, I think if we reduced our outstanding around 25% in the last 10 years if you look at the average price we have paid over that period of time, it\u2019s around 31%. So, we have done okay. But when we think of capital allocation generally, we first look to what does the business need to thrive and to grow given the cash flow characteristics of our business, we can not only do that, but we also have free cash flow and our capital allocation is what I just described, we are very proud of our return on invested capital, which I believe was 35% for the quarter. That\u2019s high not only for staffing firms, but any service company frankly. So, we are proud of our capital stewardship of our capital allocation over long periods of time and we think it served the owners quite well.","Max Messmer","Yes, I completely agree with everything Keith just said. So, well, I\u2019d just add that much of our capital expenditure and other investments are designed as we tried to note I think the many conference calls and certainly in our annual report, we are trying to develop proprietary solutions that we think will give our customers multiple ways to interact with us. We also think that by being very careful as it were concerning M&A activity that we have an expectation that, that path will carry less risk and better opportunities for return, because we think the opportunities are significant and we can develop many of our own proprietary solutions. So, there is a rationale to what we do. We do like that high return on invested capital. It feels like a nice hot shower in the morning. Some people have urged us to lever up and so forth, but that has seen prudent to us given our goals as Keith articulated it in terms of returning your excess cash flow to stockholders through buybacks and of course through increasing dividends.","David Silver","Thank you very much for that. And just to clarify I know Keith\u2019s point was the one I was trying to make was that you are both leading from \u2013 leaders from an operational point of view, but you are also the largest shareholder. So, I was kind of asking you to wear both hats for a moment and share a slightly different \u2013 potentially a slightly different perspective? So thank you for that. Appreciate it.","Max Messmer","Thank you for the question. Right. We are very grateful to be able to wear both hats.","Operator","And your last question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much for letting me sneak back in. I am not sure if you talked about this, but if you look at the operating profit for Protiviti, operating margin was down a bit year-over-year, it looks like it was all SG&A related. Can you just give us a little bit more color what happened there is that something you expect to continue? Thanks so much.","Keith Waddell","Right. So, as we talked about on last quarter\u2019s calls, they have been doping some investing as their pipeline heats up further for the quarter. They had a couple of one-off items that won\u2019t repeat such that we believe for the second quarter you will see better profitability from Protiviti than you saw in the first quarter. Their pipeline is very strong across their solutions, FSI, tech security going to market was staffing. They have now fully absorbed some prior project ins which are now anniversaried and the investment hiring that they have done is getting traction. We are very bullish on Protiviti for the second quarter and the second half of the year, but they did have some one-offs in the first quarter that impacted their profitability.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Max Messmer","Thank you very much. That was our last question. We appreciate your interest.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half International; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer.","Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We begin today's call with our customary reminder that comments made on this call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. They represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions.","While we believe these remarks to be reasonable, we do remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update statements made on today's call.","Now let's discuss the second quarter. Global revenues for the quarter were $1.06 billion, a 3% increase year-over-year. Income per share was $0.46, up 42% from a year ago.","In the second quarter of last year, net income was reduced by $8.1 million, or $0.06 per share, as a result of nonrecurring costs associated with a litigation settlement, and the resolution of certain tax matters during the quarter.","After adjusting prior year results for these items, net income was up 18%, and income per share was up 20% on a year-over-year basis.","Cash flow from operations during this year's second quarter was $102 million, and capital expenditures were $11 million. We paid a $0.16 cash dividend to shareholders on June 14, at a cost of $22 million. We also repurchased 1.2 million RHI shares during the second quarter at a cost of $39 million. Approximately 9.4 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","Robert Half saw continued demand for our professional services during the quarter, and we were pleased with the company's overall performance.","Our revenue growth was concentrated in the United States, which has been the case for the past several quarters. Within our staffing lines of business, our Robert Half Technology division reported the most sizable revenue gains. Protiviti also had another strong quarter, with revenues reaching their highest level since the fourth quarter of 2007.","Despite ongoing softness in international markets, this is the 13th consecutive quarter in which net income and earnings per share have grown 15% or more on a year-over-year basis.","Now I'll turn the call over to Keith, for a closer look at our second quarter financial results.","M. Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As noted, overall revenues in the second quarter were $1.06 billion, up 3% from last year on a reported, as well as same-day constant currency basis.","On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 1% year-over-year, with the U.S. growing 4%, and international staffing revenues declining by 7%.","U.S. staffing revenues were $703 million in the second quarter, while international staffing revenues were $229 million. We have 348 staffing locations worldwide, including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the United States.","We calculated 63.5 billing days in the second quarter compared to 63.1 billing days in last year's second quarter, the effect of which was a less than 1% increase in reported year-over-year staffing growth rates. The current quarter has 64 billing days.","Currency exchange rates had no meaningful effect on reported second quarter 2013 staffing revenues.","A supplemental schedule accompanying our earnings release today shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on a reported, as well as a same-day constant currency basis. The schedule further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides additional information on certain revenue trends in our staffing operations. You can find the schedule in today's press release and in the Investor Center of our website.","Second quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $131 million, including $103 million in the United States, and $28 million outside the U.S.","Global revenues for Protiviti grew 19% year-over-year, with U.S. revenues up 23%, and non-U.S. revenues up 4%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 24 countries.","Now turning to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 36.1% of applicable revenues. This was a 30 basis point increase over the second quarter of 2012. The improvement reflects continued strength in the U.S. pay bill spreads, as well as lower U.S. payroll taxes and other fringe benefit costs.","Permanent placement revenues were 9.7% of overall staffing revenues for the quarter, the same as reported 1 year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins just discussed, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 20 basis points versus a year ago.","Protiviti's second quarter gross margin was $37 million or 28.6% of revenues compared to $29 million or 26.4% of revenues a year ago. This is an increase of $8 million or 28%, owing largely to higher staff utilization rates.","Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. In the second quarter, our staffing SG&A costs were 32.5% of staffing revenues, down 190 basis points from the 34.4% reported a year ago. Last year's SG&A costs included the nonrecurring charge of 2.1% of revenues related to a litigation settlement. Absent that change, SG&A would have increased by 20 basis points compared to last year.","Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 21.9% of revenues. This is a 270 basis point improvement from the 24.6% level reported last year.","Turning to operating income. Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $92 million or 9.9% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $77 million in operating income or 9.1% of applicable revenues. Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $15 million or 17.1% of applicable revenues.","Protiviti's operating profit was $9 million in the second quarter or 6.7% of revenues compared to $2 million in the second quarter 1 year ago or 1.8% of revenues. This was Protiviti's best second quarter operating profit in 6 years. Accounts receivable were $557 million at the end of the second quarter, with implied days sales outstanding or DSO of 47.7 days compared to 47.1 days at the end of the second quarter of 2012.","Now let's turn to third quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the second quarter and, so far, in July. In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions slowed in April, but accelerated modestly in May, and again in June. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement divisions slowed in April, and also accelerated modestly in May, and again in June. Outside the U.S., year-over-year staffing growth rates remained consistently negative throughout the quarter. For the first 2 weeks of July, revenues for our temporary and consulting operations were up 1% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 4% and non-U.S. temporary and consulting revenues down 10%.","For the first 3 weeks of July, global permanent placement revenues were up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. perm revenues up 23% and non-U.S. perm revenues down 13%. We would remind you, however, it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short periods of time. Taking this information into account, we offer the following third quarter guidance: Revenues, $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion; income per share, $0.44 to $0.49. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release.","Now I'll turn the call back to Max.","Harold Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We were pleased with the quarter overall, notwithstanding softness in many of our non-U.S. markets, particularly in Europe. We saw the strongest growth rates in our technology staffing and Protiviti operations. As Keith mentioned, Protiviti had its best quarter in 6 years with growth in all consulting solutions, especially in areas such as regulatory risk and compliance, information technology, application controls and security. Protiviti also saw continued growth in internal audit and financial advisory services.","We've talked before on this call about some of the reasons we believe Robert Half is well-positioned. Economic growth has been uneven in many markets, but we do see a broader picture. Skill shortages persist in many of our professional disciplines, including technology and accounting. Robert Half is a resource for companies with hard-to-fill jobs. Businesses are using more temporaries as part of their human resources mix. We believe this trend can lead to further increases in the number of temporaries as a percentage of the total workforce. The temp penetration rate in the United States is near an all-time high. We're focused on small and midsized companies, a segment that is leading private sector job growth in the United States. Global regulatory mandates are creating demand for compliance professionals and other staff. We can help businesses locate these professionals quickly. We offer companies, particularly small and midsized ones, an attractive option for finding and hiring great people. Not every employer has the resources or the desire to spend the time it takes to ensure they are making a good match. We make it convenient for them to find specialized talent when, and for as long as, they need it. We argue that our fees are not expensive compared to the cost of hiring the wrong person.","At this time, we'll be happy to answer questions. We would ask that you please limit yourself, as usual, to one question and a single follow-up, if needed. If time permits, we will try to return to you later in the call if you do have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of R. W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was particularly impressed by Protiviti and very nice margin improvement there. Assuming that the -- can you tell us what your expectations are for Protiviti that are embedded in your third quarter guidance? And how we should think about Protiviti longer-term, particularly on the margin front?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, if you look at the last few years, you'll see that Protiviti gets some lift in margins in the third quarter versus the second quarter, sometimes upwards of 200 or 300 basis points. That said, it's starting from a higher level this year, so we would be a little more conservative than that. But longer term, as we've spoken many times, we've always believed Protiviti can be a double-digit operating margin business. It showed nice progress toward that end, and we're ever more confident that we can get Protiviti overall to double-digit margins. During this past quarter, we had significant improvement in U.S. margins with higher utilization. And I'll also say that the operations of our non-U.S. showed improvement as well, relative to the second quarter.","Harold Max Messmer","Mark, I would just add that, as I've said on prior calls, we're very happy with the management group running Protiviti day in and day out. Joe Tarantino and the team do an outstanding job, and we do have a lot of confidence in them going forward.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And would you expect to see the normal -- if we take a look at the last 2 years, in terms of the type of sequential growth that you typically end up having there in the third quarter, and then longer term, is it your sense that you're gaining share? When we take a look at your performance relative to some of the other players that overlap with you, it seems like you're going faster.","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as to normal sequential trends, again, we're optimistic about the third quarter. But as I said, we're starting at a higher base sequentially than typical. As to the gaining share comment, I would certainly say that the market is growing, particularly for financial services, risk and regulatory consulting demand. So I believe we're more than participating in that uptick in demand. Now whether we're net gaining share, particularly relative to the Big 4, which is who we compete with most often, it's frankly, hard to measure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Keith, could you just go over maybe the low end of guidance on the revenue side, which is a touch lower than what you achieved in the second quarter? And sort of what would have to happen for us to end up at that low end? Or is there just sort of conservatism of an uncertain economy baked into that?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, the short answer is it's the latter. Typically, Andrew, what we do is we look at our growth rates for the quarter just ended. We look at our start to the current quarter for the first few weeks of July, and based on that, look at the midpoint of our range. And if you look at those data points, I would say that our -- the midpoint of our guidance, we're a little more conservative relative to where we were out of the gate in the U.S. We're a little less conservative relative to where we are out of the gate non-U.S. But that overall, our midpoint shows some acceleration in year-over-year growth rates versus the year ago. We then look at low-end and high-end as plus or minus relative to that. But frankly, where we start is what should the midpoint be, not only from a trend perspective, but from pretty extensive discussions with our field people that run these areas.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Good. And what would be the implied constant currency same-day growth in the range of revenues that you gave for third quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Implied same-day constant currency, overall, global revenues at the midpoint would be 1.5%. At the high point, it would be 4%. And at the low point, it would be negative 1%.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So at the midpoint, you're sort of saying we're leaning forward from the growth rates that we saw in the second quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Yes. Right. Informed by the little nicer start, informed by the trends during the quarter, where we saw modest acceleration in both of the last 2 months of the quarter. All of which point to some modest acceleration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","When I look at the growth trends on a same-day constant currency basis outside the U.S., the declines got a little bit better in the second quarter in both temp and perm. Could you give us some more color on a market-by-market basis, that's showing at least some improvement in the declines in growth rates?","M. Keith Waddell","Sure. So clearly, the strongest market were Germany, where it still continued to have positive growth year-over-year. Then if you look at Canada, Belgium, U.K. and France, the negatives were less negative than they were a quarter ago. So when you put the package together, you get the trend line you described. I'd say that versus 90 days ago, our field leadership team outside the U.S. is modestly more positive but not dramatically so, and our guidance reflects that.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then, separately, looking at your -- the growth in permanent placement costs in the second quarter, it looks like they were up almost 6% year-over-year. They've been up a little less than 2% in the first quarter. Can you talk about what's driving the increase? And should we expect that rate to continue? Or is there any reason that costs would ramp further?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, the costs are up because of; a, if you look at the growth rates in the U.S. particularly, that justifies some additions to headcount; further outside the U.S., we're optimistic about Germany tech, and we've done some hiring there in advance of actual growth. That in combination where if you get some negative leverage in those markets where you got negative growth rates, the combination of which gives you costs rising modestly quicker than revenues. But that said, we still had perm operating margins that were 16%, 17% for the quarter, which isn't bad. And in fact, it was anniversary-ing 20% a year ago, which was the highest margins we had a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wanted to focus a little bit on temp gross margins. Historically, you tend to see a little bit more of a pickup in temp gross margins between 1Q and 2Q than you did this quarter. Was there anything specifically going on and is this something we need to know about going forward?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I'd say, in the past, we were trying to recover significantly more unemployment costs, which was done on a phased basis, some of which was in Q1, some of which was in Q2. The headwind from unemployment costs this year hasn't been what it is, and therefore, we didn't -- that didn't repeat. So generally speaking, we're pleased with the progress we've made with gross margins, they were still up nicely year-on-year. But as you look to the third and to the fourth quarter, our guidance for the third quarter, as an example, is that sequentially and year-over-year, for that matter, they're pretty flat. We didn't see any lift for our workers comp actuarial accrual adjustments that we've seen in some quarters past, and that happens in the second quarter. So maybe not so much 1 year ago, but in years past, in the second quarter, we've gotten some lift from the actuarial reassessment of our workers comp accruals.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. That's helpful. And shifting gears a bit. I know in the past, you've talked about the potential benefit to your business from Obamacare. And now, with the delay in the employer mandate, have you seen any, I guess, adverse impact on your business accordingly?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, as we've talked about on many calls, while we've had many discussions with our clients at this point, there hadn't been a lot of actual demand. I would further say this about the delay -- and the delay of the employer mandate is currently until January 1 of 2015. Understand that the determination of whether an employer has 50 or more full-time and equivalent employees is based on the previous calendar year. And therefore, assuming a Jan 1, '15 effective date, the prior year look-back period would begin January 1, 2014, which is less than 6 months away. And so while further regulations could change this, and other ACA provisions as well, we're still advising our clients to assume that the counting of their FTE's begins on January 1, 2014, because that's currently the law. And again, that's less than 6 months away. So I think there's a lot of visibility out there that this thing has been delayed until 2015. I'd say, our discussions with our clients would indicate there's much less visibility to -- that counting happens on a 1-year look back basis, and therefore, our clients are on the clock, so to speak, beginning January 1, 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","As the first one, ask about the Technology segment. The growth rate on a constant currency basis picked up a little bit. I know the comp was easier but I guess just qualitatively, how would you describe the market and what you're seeing? Is demand better or are some of the investments you made in that business starting to mature? I guess, just a little more color on what you're seeing?","M. Keith Waddell","I'd say that the demand remains strong. As we've talked about before, we've invested particularly in the tech development, the application developers, the Web developers, the higher end of the tech market relative to the tech support, where we've typically focused. I believe that those investments we've made paid off to a larger degree this past quarter than they have in quarters past. We were very pleased with our tech performance. And we continue to be very optimistic about our tech performance as we move forward.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","By the way, it sounds like you wouldn't say that environment is any different from what you've seen?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, not significantly different, it's clearly more candidate-challenged than our other markets. But that's a matter of he who is the best recruiter wins. And frankly, we like our chances when that's what the battle is.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, just going back to the earlier comment about Q3. You expect the gross margin relatively flat year-over-year. I know Europe is a bit of a headwind to the gross margin right now, but are you reaching a point from a pricing and kind of bill rate spread perspective in the cycle, where it's just going to be harder to get that improvement, or do you feel good about continuing to drive that forward, I guess, kind of exclusive of whatever happens with conversion fees, which are outside of your control a bit?","M. Keith Waddell","Right. So I guess we would observe that, given the relative minor macro lift we've gotten this far, we've done really well getting our gross margins north of 36%. And a corollary, we believe that when we do get some macro lift, that we can participate in that nicely, including with higher gross margins. But in the absence of much of a macro lift, it seems that given where we are, to assume that they're anything more than flattish would probably be too aggressive. But I want to make clear that we believe that if and when the macro economy, particularly in the U.S., does pick up more solidly, that there is gross margin expansion opportunities at that time. It's just we've gotten them where we've gotten them in the absence of that, and we're probably about where we can get to in the absence of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Keith, just wondering what your exposure to mortgage processing is. I mean, can you talk us through those trends, what they look like, the macro mortgage data we're looking at?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, without getting particularly granular on exact percentages, I will say this, if you look at Accountemps and if you look at Management Resources, and if you look at their year-over-year growth rates, they're clearly impacted by the decline in the mortgage, the foreclosure look-back work. And it has the impact of 2 or 3 year-over-year growth rate points, or 200 to 300 basis points, however you want to look at it. So if you look at their year-over-year growth rates that we showed in constant currency, you add 2 to 3, and it's a little different for Accountemps and MR, but it's in that order of magnitude. Our remaining exposure to mortgage is a modest single-digit amount. And as we've said on prior calls, if we're talking our exposure generally, relative to our total revenues, it's pretty small. But if you're looking at growth rates and growth dollars, then the impact of lesser amounts for mortgage and foreclosure look back, it's more significant. And as I said, you have the impact of 2 to 3 growth rate points year-over-year.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And in your 3Q guidance, have you assumed that's going to be a bigger headwind?","M. Keith Waddell","We haven't assumed much change there. The big drop off was early in the year, when there was the big settlement that occurred. I think, it was in January. And since then, it's been relatively stable. That drop-off doesn't anniversary until the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie Research.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Keith, it looks like, sequentially, Protiviti was up kind of $14 million, that's almost 2x the rate of the last couple of years. Was there anything specific in there that drove that? And as you think about that, the pull-forward effect, if you will, around Management Resources and Accountemps, was there, again, anything specific, or as we think about that going forward, is that kind of the trend rate we should think about?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, there are no discrete revenue items that, by definition, fall away. Again, we saw more demand in the financial services risk and compliance area, in the technology application controls, technology security. It's a continuation of the nice trends we've seen for a few quarters now. As to the pull-forward effect to our other divisions, clearly, Protiviti uses staff from our staffing operations on some of those engagements. And further, it helps our other staffing divisions focus on which skill sets are particularly in demand that they can offer not only to Protiviti as a client, but to third-party clients as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could describe tech demand and whether you're experiencing better demand on the high-end of your skill sets and bill rates or on the lower end?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, we've invested disproportionately on the higher end, and we're seeing more success for that reason. I think we're seeing very solid demand at the higher end and in the tech support positions. But because we have more internal capacity relative to a year ago at the higher end, our grower rates are higher there.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then, relative to the ACA and its cost impact on your business, do you have any refined thoughts on what it would mean for Robert Half's expense growth?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, clearly, the delay means we'll delay by a year offering bronze level coverage to our temporaries. It will give us another year to measure what percentage would qualify for whatever our requirement is ultimately ended up at. It will give us another year to see how many of our temporaries go to the public exchanges, and to what extent they qualify for subsidies. So I think we'll have another year's worth of data. But frankly, the data we've looked at in the last 6 to 9 months is really consistent with the data we looked at a year ago. So we don't expect any huge surprises there. Our strategy was that we would simultaneously offer to our temporaries bronze level coverage, and also a much lower-cost plan, and they could choose between the 2. Our current thinking is to go forward with the lower-cost plans, but not to go forward, at least in '14, with the bronze level plan. So we'll also see what kind of sign-up rate we get for that lower cost plan. But based on everything we know today, including the effect of the delay, we don't expect the costs to be certainly any more than what we first projected them to be, which we thought would be manageable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Reece with Avondale Partners.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","If you were to extract some of the small segments, like Legal and The Creative Group, and look at the remainder, would that change comparisons at all? Is there anything meaningfully different there?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, I'd say The Creative Group is doing particularly well in the digital media area. But because of the relative size of Accountemps and The Creative Group, it's hard for The Creative Group to move the needle in the combined Accountemps number. So it's doing very well in its own right, but it's small relative to total Accountemps. So what you get when we report Accountemps, for all intents and purposes, is Accountemps.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I would expect Legal to not be so hot lately. Is that the trend you've seen?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, Legal is holding its own, but it's certainly not in the digital media space, which is doing much better, which is why I mentioned it first.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","My inclination, when it comes to the mortgage review work is to think that, that revenue continued into part of the first quarter, but really trailed off toward the end. Did you have any significant revenue in the second quarter?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, we continue to have some mortgage revenue, including in the second quarter. And as I said earlier, it's a small single-digit percentage of our overall revenues. I mean, we've had some mortgage revenue for years and we would expect to have that for years to come.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I was talking about particularly the look-backs.","M. Keith Waddell","The look-back was a very discrete, very special thing, and that pretty abruptly came to an end, I believe, it was the early part of January. And from that moment on, we've had virtually no foreclosure look-back work. But normal mortgage refi and mortgage origination processing demand continues at a low single-digit rate of our revenues.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","That doesn't really bother me. I was just trying to understand the effect on your comps, just of that particular surprise settlement that caught a number of the vendors by surprise. If you just kind of pull that out, is Accountemps in the U.S. following what you would typically see when GDP kind of grinds down like this?","M. Keith Waddell","As we said earlier, the foreclosure look-back decline impacts Accountemps and MR growth rates between 2 and 3 growth rate points. So you can add those back to get what it's doing absent the fall-off of that work. And again, given the context of very little macro, very little cyclical lift at this point in the cycle, Accountemps isn't doing unexpectedly.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Was that impact similar in the first quarter, the year-over-year?","M. Keith Waddell","I think, because we had a little bit of it, the impact was a little less.","Randle G. Reece - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I didn't know how much you had in the same quarter of the previous year. It seemed like with other vendors, it ramped pretty significantly through the year, last year.","M. Keith Waddell","Right. But concentrated more in the second half and on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with R. W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Two questions. I mean, just a follow-on from Randy's question. Assuming that we don't -- that we just keep muddling along in the U.S., how are you thinking about Accountemps' longer-term growth rates? If we add back in the 200 to 300 bps for the mortgage look-back, do you think that's kind of a trend that we'll see in this kind of environment?","Harold Max Messmer","Well, if we talk longer-term, we still believe that Accountemps is under-penetrated relative to the little market opportunity it has, starting in the United States, where we do business with fewer than 10% of all prospects, and that's all divisions combined, that's not just Accountemps. And therefore, we continue to be optimistic about Accountemps and our other divisions' prospects because middle-market companies are less penetrated, as it relates to temporary help, than our larger companies. And we believe bridging that gap, narrowing that gap, presents a large opportunity for us.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Agreed. You've obviously been saying that for quite a long time and you've been proving it right for quite a long time. Just wondering, would you have to do anything differently than you've been doing? Has anything in the environment changed at all, just as it relates to demand for F&A within the mid market?","M. Keith Waddell","There are no trends, no structural changes. The competitive landscape, there are none of those things that would cause us concern. In the accounting finance, where all change is always good, be it tax change, accounting regulation change, internal control requirement changes, and usually, in accounting and finance, there are always something that's changing.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then, shifting over to IT, where you're seeing an acceleration and he who has the best recruiters, wins, and you guys are quite good at that, do you -- how are you thinking about investing in that area over the next few years, in terms of -- it's been outsized, looks like it's proven successful. Should we continue to expect continued outsized investment in that area?","M. Keith Waddell","Well, for continued outsized financial results, we'll continue to make outsized investments, because there's nothing like organic growth. Our return on equity is in the high 20s, which is some of the highest returns you get anywhere, particularly in staffing. And you get that with internal growth. And so the extent we take a few margin points off the table by investing higher in one division than the others because it's growing faster, you still get high 20s return on equity, which we're very proud of.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just wanted to stick in another couple of numbers questions. What should we be modeling for capital spending and tax rate for the rest of the year?","M. Keith Waddell","So CapEx, it appears that some of our projects are going to lap over into next year, so we were first guiding to $60 million, plus or minus $5 million. We would probably guide now to $50 million, plus or minus $5 million. On the tax rate, the tax rate has come down. We've done some structuring things overseas that helps us better utilize some of their prior losses. We would expect the tax rate for the balance of the year to be 36.5% to 37.5%, maybe a touch lower than what we've had the first half of the year, but somewhere in that ballpark.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And I know you're not giving any guidance beyond that, but should that be the normal rate or, I guess, the rate we use for next year?","M. Keith Waddell","It's hard to define normal in tax. Enterprise-owned credits come and go. Losses and how you utilize losses changes. It's hard to define normal. But somewhere in the 37%, 38% range is mostly normal.","Harold Max Messmer","That was our last question.

Before we begin we would like to remind you that comments made on today\u2019s call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions.","We believe these remarks to be reasonable, but they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update statements made on today's call.","Beginning this quarter, we are publishing our prepared remarks for this conference call at the same time the quarterly earnings statement is released. The prepared remarks were included with today\u2019s press release and are available on the Robert Half website by using the quarterly conference calls link on the homepage of the Investor Center.","Now let\u2019s discuss the first quarter. First quarter revenues were $1.08 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Income per share was $0.45, up $0.12 -- 12% from one year ago. Cash flow from operations was $59 million during the first quarter and capital expenditures were $12 million.","Our Board of Directors increased the company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend by $0.02 per share during the quarter to $0.18. The dividend was paid to shareholders on March 14, 2014 at a cost of $24 million. We started paying a cash dividend 10 years ago and have increased it annually.","We repurchased 800,000 Robert Half shares during the first quarter at a cost of $33 million, approximately 7.3 million shares remain available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We were pleased with the company\u2019s operating results for the first quarter. We saw strong demand in all areas of the business, especially in the latter part of the quarter. Growth was strongest in our Protiviti, technology staffing and permanent placement divisions. Non-U.S. operations also improved, particularly permanent placement services, which reported solid sequential and year-over-year revenue gains during the quarter.","This was Robert Half\u2019s 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 27% for the quarter.","Now, I will turn the call over to Keith for more detail review of our first quarter financial results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. Global revenues were $1.08 billion in the first quarter. This is up 6% from the first quarter one year ago on both a reported and same-day constant-currency basis.","Global staffing revenues were up 5% on a same-day constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $720 million in the first quarter, up 6% on a same-day basis. International staffing revenues were $230 million in the first quarter, up 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis. We have 342 staffing locations worldwide, including 99 locations in 18 countries outside the U.S.","We had 62.4 billing days in the first quarter, compared to 62.2 in the first quarter of 2013. This had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing growth rates by 0.5%. The current quarter has 63.2 billing days, compared to 63.5 billing days in the year ago quarter.","Currency exchange rates reduced first quarter year-over-year staffing revenues by $2 million. The strengthening of the euro and pound sterling were more than offset by weaknesses in the Canadian and Australian dollars. This reduced year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.2% in the first quarter.","We provide a supplemental schedule with our earnings release that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for our various staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as on a same-day constant-currency basis.","The schedule further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You can find the schedule in today\u2019s press release and in the Investor Center of our website. This is a non-GAAP financial measure. We provide it to give you information on certain revenue trends in our staffing operations.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $134 million in the first quarter, with $108 million in revenues in the United States and $26 million in revenues outside the U.S. Global revenues for Protiviti were up 15% year-over-year, with U.S. revenues up 19% and non-U.S. revenues flat with the prior year. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.","Turning now to gross margin, in our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 36.1% of applicable revenues. This is the same as the prior year\u2019s first quarter.","First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.7% of overall staffing revenues, compared to 9.2% of staffing revenues in the first quarter a year ago. Together with the temporary and consulting gross margin previously discussed, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 40 basis points versus one year ago to 42.3%.","First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $37 million, or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues, compared to $30 million or 25.7% of Protiviti revenues one year ago. The increase is due primarily to higher staff utilization.","Staffing SG&A costs were 32.3% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.5% in the first quarter of 2013. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 21.9% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter versus 22.5% of Protiviti revenues reported this time last year.","Operating income from our staffing divisions was $95 million in the first quarter or 10% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $78 million in operating income or 9% of applicable revenues. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $17 million in the first quarter or 18.7% of applicable revenues.","First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $7 million or 5.5% of Protiviti revenues, compared to $4 million or 3.2% of revenues in the first quarter one year ago. Protiviti operating profit increased 96% over the prior year.","Our first quarter 2014 income tax rate increased to 39.7%, up from 37.5% in the first quarter of 2013. This was primarily due to fewer available unused foreign tax benefits. The higher tax rate lowered our first quarter results by approximately $0.02 per share.","At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $587 million. Implied days sales outstanding DSO was 49.3 days, compared to 48.7 days at the end of the first quarter of 2013.","And now for second-quarter guidance, we saw the following trends in the first quarter and so far in April. In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions decelerated in January, accelerated in February and accelerated at an even faster pace in March. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement division accelerated in January, accelerated again in February and slowed slightly in March.","Outside the U.S., year-over-year temporary and consulting staffing growth rates decelerated in January, accelerated in February turning positive, and stayed positive in March. Permanent placement growth rates outside the U.S. decelerated in January, accelerated in February and remained at February levels in March.","For the first two weeks of April, revenues for our temporary and consulting operations were up 9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 10% and non-U.S. temporary and consulting revenues up 5%.","For the first three weeks of April, permanent placement revenues were up 14% on a same-day, constant-currency basis compared to the same period last year, with U.S. perm revenues up 24% and non-U.S. perm revenues down 4%.","We provide this information with the caveat that it is difficult to read a great deal into these trends given the short time periods they represent. We offer the following second quarter guidance, revenues, $1.11 billion to $1.16 billion, income per share, $0.48 to $0.53. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. Demand for our professional staffing services and Protiviti consulting solutions remained solid during the first quarter, with growth rates accelerating in March and so far in April. We were also pleased to see higher staffing demand outside the United States, including Europe.","In the United States, the unemployment rate for college-educated workers 25 years of age and older, which we view as an indicator of professional-level demand is 3.4%. U.S. jobless claims have approached a seven-year low.","The first quarter saw the number of temporary workers as a percentage of total U.S. employment exceed the all-time high established in 2000. More and more businesses appreciate the value of interim staff to better manage variable workloads and specialized project demands.","We work with companies of all sizes, but Robert Half is a particularly smart staffing option for small and midsize businesses. The cost of a bad hiring decision can affect these companies disproportionately compared to larger firms that may have a deeper bench of workers from which to draw. Our clients value our personal service approach, our expertise at assessing skills and our deep talent networks.","Protiviti is serving and expanding client base. All of Protiviti\u2019s key services grew nicely during the quarter, most notably IT consulting, risk and compliance, and internal audit. Client demand was driven by improving market conditions and a more stringent regulatory environment.","At this time, we will be happy to answer questions. We would request that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. My question revolves around the temp staffing trends that you were seeing by segment. It was nice to see the continued improvement on Accountemps. I was wondering if you could talk little bit about your experiences from a cyclical perspective in terms of the driver, in terms of the resumption to year-over-year growth on the Accountemp side and how you would expect that to play out as the year unfolds? And then secondly, as it relates to RH Technology against solid comps, we saw little bit of deceleration. I was wondering if there is any color that you could provide there as well. Thank you.","Max Messmer","Okay. From a cyclical perspective, so first of all, as we look through the quarter, January, February were clearly revenue, weather impacted. We would estimate that weather reduced our growth rates on the temp side by about 1%. We then look at March. March was a very solid quarter. As we talked about those growth rates accelerated very nicely into the first two weeks of April.","I guess, cyclically we were also encouraged by, we saw rising pay rates for our temporary staff which in turn rising bill rates. Our bill rates were up 2.6% year-over-year this quarter and that compares to 1.7%. So we were encouraged that we\u2019re starting to see some wage inflation which is usually indicative as you\u2019re beginning to start the growth part of the cycle in earnest.","The Accountemps acceleration you saw are adjusted for weather is about in line with what we talked about for the absence of foreclosure look back the prior year. When you look at Robert Half Technology, the deceleration I think is a little misleading because the prior quarter, it\u2019s year-ago comparison was quite easy.","If you take a look at the fourth quarter of \u201812 versus the third quarter of \u201812 and the first quarter of \u201813, you will see that that wasn\u2019t the easiest comparison of the year. So given the more difficult comparison, I think Robert Half Technology growth rates are more understandable and still among the best we reported for the quarter.","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","And if we adjust for the weather, then we're probably looking at something that would be north of double digits?","Harold Max Messmer","That\u2019s correct.","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Great. And then can you talk a little bit about Protiviti, I mean, obviously great progress there. Can you talk a little bit more about the outlook as we think about the next 12 to 24 months?","Keith Waddell","Well, I\u2019d say Protiviti was the continuation of very good trends we\u2019ve seen for a few quarters. Internal audit was quite strong. We talked about PCAOV inspections that are dictating more audit work which trickles down their internal audit. We\u2019ve talked about more IPOs which is more public company readiness work for Protiviti as well as internal audit co-sourcing and outsourcing thereafter.","We\u2019ve talked about risk and compliance particularly in the financial services industry, anti-money laundering, model validation. We\u2019ve also talked about IT security business continuity, all remain strong. All the trends remained intact that we\u2019ve talked about for the last couple of quarters. And as we talked to our people at Protiviti, their outlook would remain as positive going throughout 2014 as it has been in the last few quarters.","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan","Hi. Keith, maybe you can help us a little bit squaring away the April trends that you gave. And I know that doesn't include Protiviti to the middle of guidance. So if you look at the middle of second quarter guidance, that's up about 7% year-over-year. And I know that's on a reported basis, that's why I'm asking about it. But when you look at the April trends in the temp side, it was 9% and on perm it was 10%. How do you aggregate that up and kind of get to the middle range of your guidance, thinking about days and currency and any other factors?","Keith Waddell","So our guidance certainly relative to our April start is quite conservative. So one way to look at guidance is for the first quarter, Justin did on the staff side same day constant currency we grew at 4.5%. At the midpoint that grows to 6.5%. And that 6.5% looks a lot more like March than it does to start in April. So I thought was given that our April start while we are static about and it\u2019s the best growth we\u2019ve seen in years frankly. What we did was we targeted our midpoint to the growth we saw in March, which was the non-weather impacted month during the quarter.","Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan","Yes. That makes sense. And then just make a comment on Protiviti in the second quarter, what would be included in the guidance, would it be similar year-over-year growth that it was in the first quarter?","Max Messmer","The guidance for Protiviti, again as the comparisons in Protiviti are the toughest that we have, we would have those growth rate slowing a little bit but still say staying nicely double digit.","Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Co. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.","Yes. Thank you. First, just on the SG&A leverage at this point, SG&A for the staffing operations were down a little bit and I know you have been -- you're kind of investing ahead of growth, which now you seem to be having. I guess how should we think about it from this point? Are you -- I guess were you pulling back on some investments? And I guess as growth picks up, do you double down investment, invest -- reverse that and invest even more, or will you kind of leverage it, just trying to think about SG&A leverage the next year or so?","Max Messmer","So we talked on the last call and prior about how we front ended to some extent our headcount investments in the middle part of 2013. So for the first quarter of this year, we hold our headcounts pretty flat. So you got some leverage from headcounts being flat. In the aggregate, SG&A came down a little bit, primarily because of things like travel, meals, printing, those kinds of costs in the fourth quarter are typically higher. It\u2019s budget season, it\u2019s holiday time, you\u2019re printing stuff for the following year. So it was those costs that came down on an absolute basis. If you look at our payroll costs for our staff, they were pretty flat.","As we go forward in the second quarter and the rest of the year, the thought is we will continue -- we will begin to add staff again but not disproportionately to the growth we expect. So the staff we expect at, at least in the second quarter we expect to be commensurate with the revenue growth, that\u2019s implicit in our guidance, which would say SG&A, we should get a little leverage just because we are going to lever the fixed cost more with growth. But from a payroll standpoint as a percent of revenue that should stay pretty constant.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.","Okay. And then, I guess, just as we, I guess, go forward, where in high level are we with kind of IT staffing investment that you\u2019ve talked about the last few years in terms of building out a bigger overhead. Have we seen enough growth to absorb that, or is that still an overhead cost that we need to grow into more the next year, two year?","Max Messmer","Well, we have invested more in our internal IT staffing headcount. We think that\u2019s paid off nicely. I would say our investments from this point on would be more commensurate with the revenue growth, which still remains double digit, but it will be as outsized to revenue growth as that\u2019s been in the past. We still have a bit of a operating income drag from technology as it has a relatively higher headcount than our other divisions, but we think that\u2019s money well spend.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.","So, I mean, I guess, altogether, do you think SG&A expense for the temp and perm businesses, is that\u2019s the part as I look at the income statement where you still seem to have a fair amount of leverage relative to the prior peak. Do you think I guess over the next, as you started to see growth pick up, is the prior peak in terms of SG&A as a percentage of revenue a reasonable number that you might be able to get to as growth is better?","Max Messmer","We are hopeful we can do better than we were at a prior peak, but we would be very disappointed if we don\u2019t do at least as well.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks so much. Just wanted to go back to Protiviti, it looked like you had some diverging trends where U.S. growth was fairly strong and international business was flat, can you just give us a little bit more color what was going on in the different regions?","Keith Waddell","So the U.S. was particularly strong. The U.S. has much more diversified revenue sources than does international. They have more exposure to FSI risk and regulatory. They have more exposure to IT security. And so because they have more exposure to those high growth areas, you're going to see more growth in the U.S. than outside the U.S. We continue to do reasonably well in Europe, our challenges remain in Asia. We're making progress in Asia, but there is more progress to be made.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","All right, fair enough. And just a couple quick modeling questions, which would be using for tax rate for the rest of the year and what are you budgeting for capital spending? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Tax rate kind of mid 39% in that range. It's higher as we\u2019ve said because the foreign tax credits that we had last year have been absorbed. CapEx, we talked about $60 million to $65 million for the year that will be a little back ended. So it might be a little light to first half, but we'll catch it up in the second half, but it's in that range.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","All right, great. Thanks so much Keith.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Inside of perm fees, how are temp to perm fees trending?","Max Messmer","Temp to perm is pretty stable. We've talked about traditionally it's a range of 3% to 5% of revenue in each of our temp lines of business. We've been bumping along around 3% for many quarters and there wasn't much change during the quarter. We're very pleased that if you look at our pay bill spreads, our pay bill spreads are essentially back at peak levels. What is in back at peak levels are temp to perm conversion and further we're carrying a higher fringe costs today than at peak levels, because as you know for staking federal unemployment there is a lag between the cleans and your rate.","So we still have a much higher state and federal unemployment costs today that we did the peak and I think there is about a 50 basis point differential which should be some upside as the cycle improves. So with the combination or conversions and less fringe or unemployment costs we feel like we've got some upside in gross margin and that's assume we don't make anymore progress with pay bill spreads which we will certainly attempt to. And as pay rates begin to rise which we're starting to see that typically is the backdrop where we expand our pay bill spreads. So a lot of good news on the cycle front with the progression during the quarter and then we're just delighted with the first couple of weeks of April.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then question on gross margins in temp staffing. You have more the international today than in the past. So I'm wondering if you think about gross margin potential for temp staffing over time, would you expect to go back to prior peak, how does international impact that?","Max Messmer","Well, I guess, the comments I may hold globally, our gross margins are a bit higher in the U.S., but as you look at the future growth non-U.S., it's going to be concentrated in companies like Germany and Belgium that have higher than non-U.S. average margins, and therefore if anything mix would be your friend relative to status quo. So I certainly don't expect a drag on gross margin expansion because of non-U.S. mix given the countries we expect that growth to occur.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Just one clarification you talked about the build rate up 2.6% than you made another come about 1.7%, was 1.7% the last quarter?","Keith Waddell","It was last quarter's increase year-over-year. So fourth quarter is up 1.7, first quarter is up 2.6 and pay rates are up commensurately. So we're starting to see some pay rate increases in earnest as the candidate situation begins to tighten or having to pay more, we're seeing higher pay rates, we're seeing higher build rates the passes that on and we think that's a good sign relative to the cycle.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank","Great. And just quick on, I know it's not a big part of your business at the mortgage processing. When do the comps get a lot easier mortgage processing, is that in the third quarter?","Keith Waddell","Well, so let's split mortgage in the two distinct pieces, one was in the full closure look back and we anniversary that in early January. The other is refinancing ordinary course. So that's drifted down a bit, the last few quarters, but it has -- it had anywhere near the cliff impact that the full closure look back has. It was a little bit of headwind for accountants during the quarter, but nothing like the full closure look back.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank","Right. And it based on the run rate now when is it no longer become headwind?","Keith Waddell","Well, again, I don't, it wouldn't otherwise register such they we're not going to make a deal that of it. But it did drift down a bit in the first quarter.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Hello. This is Anj Singh dialing in for Hamzah Mazari. I was wondering if you could give us an update on ACA and if there is any further activity you're seeing there beyond what you saw with healthcare providers and insurance company last quarter?","Max Messmer","There is not a lot of update, as you know the lock at deferred so for employers between 50 and 99 they don't have to comply now until January of 16th rather than January of 15th. So the strategy to stay below 50 for company's close essentially got push back for yet another year. So we've seen a little activity there but not much.","As we talked about last quarter primarily in office team, primarily in customer service, we have seen some demand from both the exchanges and from insurance carriers that demand continued in the first quarter. But it doesn't move the needle in a major way.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, on the perm growth, how sustainable do you see that trend being and can you call out any particular pockets of strength there? And also do you still have the same view on your headcount investments on the perm side of the business you did prior or is there any change to that?","Keith Waddell","Well, it's not a typical that a perm gets hit harder on a down cycle and grows more rapidly back to prior peaks. So as we seat here today we\u2019re at 90% of peak on the temp side, we\u2019re at 80% of peak on the perm side, that's globally. U.S. is obviously better. But the point is, it's not at all unusual to see perm outgrowing temp given where we are in the cycle and we're not a bit afraid to invest in headcount in perm as we've talked about in the past. But it's an investment that we think will be commenced with the revenues we expect.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust","Thanks. I know most of your customer concentration is focused on smaller and mid-sized businesses. Are you seeing any distinguishing futures of demand by customer size to the limited extent you have exposure to larger businesses?","Max Messmer","We have some exposure to larger businesses but it\u2019s usually in small quantities or smaller number of temporaries per client than many of the other staffing firms. We know best the small to mid size market. We clearly saw strengthening during the course of the quarter, adjusted for weather, look at March on a standalone basis, look at the start of April.","So clearly with our sweet spot, we see broad-based improving demand. I would particularly call out Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Management Resources. Those saw a lot of strengthening to latter part of March and the early part of April, for which we\u2019re delighted by us, I said earlier. So while we do business with larger firms in smaller quantities and what we know best is small to mid size and it\u2019s the best trend in demand, small to mid size we\u2019ve seen in several quarters.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust","Is there any discernible variation in the duration of your assignments or perhaps said a different way strengthening in demand of assignments and professionals engaged in longer term projects?","Max Messmer","Our mix, the duration of our assignments overall hasn\u2019t change dramatically and nor has the mix between small to middle sized businesses and semi larger firms. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any discernible trend or change that we would call out.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee - RBC","Hi, good afternoon. Could you give us a sense of how much of the productivity revenue base now is outside of the historical and I guess still core F&A area. Is IT -- you\u2019ve said a few -- over the last few quarters that audit actually has been among the strongest areas but if the mix of IT in the financial compliance is risen sharply in the last couple of years?","Max Messmer","Well, certainly, IT and the risk and compliance have come on but the last couple of quarters, internal audit has been even stronger, such that there when you look at our mix of business between the two, it hasn\u2019t changed dramatically. The largest single segment is internal audit, financial advisory, which would also includes some Sarbanes-Oxley but IT consulting and risk and compliance have made meaningful contributions.","Gary Bisbee - RBC","Okay.","Max Messmer","They\u2019ve all been good. So the relative size of each hasn\u2019t changed much because they\u2019ve all been good.","Gary Bisbee - RBC","Okay. All right, fair enough. And then on the perm margins, they were the strongest they\u2019ve been in a while. I assume that just the slow down in headcount growth. But as you grow in line with revenues, you talked about for the next quarter so is this a good area to be in, this 18.7% operating margin or could that number sort of over, maybe a little higher than it should be because of the no headcount growth this quarter and then it comes down?","Keith Waddell","I\u2019d say mid to high teams should be a sustainable level as long as we gauge headcount additions to anticipated growth rates. If we decide to get more aggressive and add even more heads which would be a good sign, might it drift down from there. But mid-to-high teens, if you look back to history, isn\u2019t a bad run rate operating margin for perm.","Gary Bisbee - RBC","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","We have just one caller left in the queue, so this will be the last call of question for the day. Your next question comes from the line of Randle Reece with Avondale Partners. Your line is open.","Randle Reece - Avondale Partners","Afternoon. It seems like a lot of recruiters around the country attribute efficiency gains to technology they\u2019ve implemented. And I have to -- it doesn\u2019t seem to be stranger to that. Do you think that between that and some price compression say in some of the areas like online advertising, have we seen the best that we are going to see as far as those cost improvements go?","Max Messmer","Well, Randy, we spend a lot of time internally looking at how technology can better enable our people to do their jobs. And I would say, we\u2019re optimistic that we can get some further efficiency gains from technology investments we\u2019re making today. Some of which relates to how we recruit candidate, some relates to how we determine, which leads are most actionable.","The online advertising, cost savings are there, but they don\u2019t move the needle. But at the end of the day, we\u2019re optimistic that our people can get more productive with the assist they can get with technology. But let\u2019s not forget at the end of the day, somebody has to close the deal. And we\u2019ve yet to find a new technology that\u2019s very good at closing.","Randle Reece - Avondale Partners","That\u2019s something that stuck out in our research. By our count, there are fewer people in corporate America responsible for recruiting now than there were in 2007 and we're back to similar employment levels, but the hiring pace has been slow. It looks like hiring and recruiting is still a very labor intensive business regardless of the technology you apply. Do you think that there is going to be a little bit more opportunity this time around as the labor market recovers because customers are so lean in HR?","Max Messmer","Well, I think, it is correct that they\u2019re leaner and I think our client size has never made the investment in internal HR that other companies have anyway because they rely on companies like us for that purpose. So, I do think, you could make a case that there is more upside as we move forward because the starting point has a leaner client investment in HR. But I'll also believe that we can get efficiency gains and have our people spend more time closing than identifying the population of candidates to determine, which is the best fit for our clients.","Randle Reece - Avondale Partners","Very good. Thank you very much.","Max Messmer","That was our last question. We would like to thank you again for joining us on today\u2019s call.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Quarterly revenues were $1.344 billion, up 6% from the second quarter one year ago. Income per share was $0.71, also up 6% from last year's second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $129 million, and capital expenditures were $25 million in the second quarter.","We paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on June 15, for a total cash outlay of $29 million.

We have 8.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board-authorized stock repurchase plan.","Our second quarter results reflect continued solid demand for our professional staffing and consulting services. Our financial staffing divisions and Protiviti reported the strongest year-over-year revenue gains. In the second quarter, unlevered return on equity for the company was 35%.","I'll turn the call over to Keith now, for a closer look at our results.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Max. Global revenues were $1.344 billion in the second quarter. This is up 6% from the second quarter of 2015 on a reported basis and up 5% on a same day constant currency basis.","Second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% on a same day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $911 million in the second quarter, up 3%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $234 million, up 8% when adjusted for billing days and currency-exchange rates. We have 328 staffing locations worldwide including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The second quarter had 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 billing days in last year's second quarter. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the quarter by 1%. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 billing days in the third quarter of 2015.","Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $4 million in the second quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%.","Global revenues for Protiviti were $199 million in the second quarter with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $35 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 8% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6% and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's second quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $400,000 in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%.","Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure we offer to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.6% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period one year ago due primarily to higher pay\/bill spreads. The second quarters of 2016 and 2015 include workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and $2.1 million respectively, pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.","Second quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down slightly from last year's 10.1%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased by 10 basis points versus one year ago, to 43.8%.","Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues. Last year, second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $54 million or 29.9% of Protiviti revenues.","Second quarter SG&A costs were 32.3% of staffing revenues, compared to 31.9% in the second quarter one year ago. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the second quarter versus 18.6% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.","Operating income from our staffing divisions was $131 million in the second quarter of 2016, up 2% from the previous year. Operating margin was 11.5%, down slightly from the 11.8% in last year's second quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $107 million in operating income, an increase of 2% from the second quarter of 2015. This resulted in an operating margin of 10.4%.","Operating income for our permanent placement division was $24 million in the second quarter, up 2% from the previous year and producing an operating margin of 21.7%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 9.0%. At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $732 million. Implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 49.6 days.","Before we move to third quarter guidance, I'd like to give you some more color on our Q2 results, specifically the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and thus far in July, all normalized for billing days and currency.","Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the second quarter, and we exited the quarter with June revenues growing 3.7% compared to an increase of 4.5% for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first two weeks of July was up 2.8% compared to the prior year.","Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the quarter with June revenues declining 1.6% compared to 2.1% for the full quarter. For the first three weeks of July, permanent placement revenues declined 17.6% compared to the same period last year. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers, as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance.","Revenues: $1.335 billion to $1.395 billion. Income per share: $0.68 to $0.74. Note that our third quarter guidance considers the estimated revenue and cost impacts to all U.S. Staffing and Protiviti office of converting to new front-office CRM and project management systems, respectively. These are both scheduled to occur in the third quarter.","The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4.0% on a reported basis and 4.6% adjusted for billing days and currency, including Protiviti; and negative EPS growth of 3%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Max.","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Keith. The U.S. job market rebounded strongly in June with 287,000 jobs added during the month. It was the largest single monthly job expansion since October of 2015. This was on the heels of weaker reports in April and May. The U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 4.9% as a result of more workers entering the workforce in June.","Outside the United States, we were pleased with the improved revenue growth rates in our international staffing and Protiviti operations. The Brexit vote in the U.K. has dominated news headlines, but we believe it is too early to tell what if any impact it will have on our operations there, and the U.K. only accounts for 3% of our revenues in any event.","The demand for skilled talent remains a consistent theme for us. For a number of years now, many of our specialty areas have had unemployment rates of less than half the overall rate of unemployment in the United States. The unemployment rate for accountants and auditors is just 2.2%; and for software developers, it is just 1% according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.","These are just two examples that place a spotlight on the talent shortages that exist in the United States and elsewhere in some job categories. This is resulting in demand for both temporary and full-time staffing in the professional segments we serve.","Looking at Protiviti, it is building a strong brand that is resulting in continued expansion of its client base and a broadening of its service offerings. This is a business that benefits from a strong regulatory environment because of its strength in helping clients navigate these environments. Protiviti excels at helping clients develop stronger internal controls, data security measures and other important safeguards.","At this time, Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we'll try to return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. I've got one question and one follow-up. With regards to the first question, could you just talk a little bit about the trends that you are seeing in RH Technology, specifically with regards to what you're seeing in terms of order rates relative to fill rates and how that's impacting trends?","And then the second question has to do with what you're anticipating in terms of the new systems that are going into place in the U.S. in the third quarter, both in terms of potential disruption for revenue as well as incremental expense that maybe just for one or two quarters? Thank you.","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Mark. I'd say, our Robert Half Technology division \u2013 our growth rates did slow during the quarter on very tough comps. Note that a year ago, we did grow at 19%. For our Tech Support division or subdivision, which is desktop support, helpdesk et cetera, clients did get more cautious on the demand side. There was less sense of urgency. For our tech development positions, which were the programmer, analysts, the software engineers, candidate supply was the issue which continued to tighten.","Further, in the tech development area, we withdrew from a very large client due to their, what we viewed, as excessive pricing demands. Our support and development mix is about 50-50 based on hours, and it's 40-60 in favor of development based on dollars.","As it relates to our new systems, let's talk a little bit about those then we'll talk about impact as well. So first of all, we're replacing 15-year-old proprietary legacy systems which were very difficult to use and maintain. We're going to a single global front-office platform. Note that we've already rolled this out in five other countries successfully, I might add.","It is cloud-based versus our own hosted data center, which will have the benefit of giving our people mobile access to our system. It has a modern user interface, which will significantly enhance the new hire ramp time over time. It further greatly facilitates future changes, including our innovation initiatives, including integration with the client-facing digital functionality that we've been working on for some time. Further, we get real-time reporting and dashboards. In short, we're actually very excited to be where we are and to be on the \u2013 right on the verge of this conversion.","There is going to be some disruption. Using the other five countries as a guide, understanding that none are at the size and scale that is the case in the United States. We estimate the revenue impact to be between a half a day and one and a half days of revenue, and in the U.S. that's about $14 million of revenue impact at the midpoint.","Protiviti, it actually has the benefit of taking the people that are going to be on training and figuring out their chargeability, their rate et cetera, and the impact of their revenues will be about $2 million. So that overall, again at the midpoint of our estimate, we're thinking about a $16 million revenue impact that converts at our normal gross margins to about an $8 million gross margin impact.","Further, there's going to be out-of-pocket training, out-of-pocket travel. There's going to be labor cost with \u2013 connected to the support of the conversion period, both before and after. So we estimate the SG&A impact to be between $4 million and $5 million, call it $4.5 million at the midpoint. So that would total up to an operating income impact of $12 million to $13 million, which is $0.05 to $0.07 per share.","So, while relative to the quarter, it has a significant impact on the basis that this is something you do every 15 years or 20 years and we have a long history of getting a lot of use out of our software, it's not that large of impact. But the facts are, it all falls in the third quarter, not only for staffing, but Protiviti as well is going to their new project management system and hence the Protiviti inclusion in the numbers that I just talked about.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I really appreciate the color. Did any of that impact July at all?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we started training. We began some of the training, some in the United States. You train the trainers, and then the trainers train the super users and then the super users train the rest of the staff; and that training did begin in July. But remember now, the post-quarter period includes the Fourth of July and the fourth quarter \u2013 I mean excuse me, the Fourth of July, there's always volatility around how that's impacted.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Protiviti slowed down quite a bit in the U.S. the growth rate. Could you talk about the trends that you're seeing there and what you're expecting aside from the impact of the new project management system?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So Protiviti did grow 8% on super tough comps. They grew 23% a year ago, but clearly fell short of their estimates as well. So our FSI regulatory consulting practice was negatively impacted by heightened client cost-cutting, which impacted both our hours billed and our rates. New projects that we started had lower rates than previously completed projects. Our other solution practices had a very solid quarter. Our gross margins compressed by about 180 basis points due to this lower mix of higher margin, FSI regulatory practice and the lower staff utilization attributable to less-than-expected revenue growth.","Protiviti operating margins were still quite good at 9%, but they certainly compared unfavorably to a year-ago's very strong 11%. Our Q3 Protiviti guidance assumes mid single-digit revenue growth, again, on very tough comps. They grew 23% a year ago in the third quarter. Operating margins, which \u2013 while they're projected to rise sequentially, they will be quite a bit lower than the very high levels a year ago.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. And then, last quarter you had talked a bit about seeing lengthening in the sales cycle with some caution on the client side, but confidence on the candidate side. Have you seen any changes in that in the last couple of months?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, on the client side, we would say they're incrementally more cautious, they incrementally have less sense of urgency, and therefore, there is some slowing for that reason. On the candidate side, the most acute supply issue we have is Tech development, but even in the other divisions we see the lower level positions, call it accounting operations, with relatively more supply than we do the upper level positions where supply is more of an issue, but not as much of an issue as it is intact.","I think one of the highlights for the quarter is how we did \u2013 how well we did with our gross margins that's particularly in accounting and finance and that's not only better pay\/bill spreads, but that's also mix gravitating to higher level longer duration assignments. So, we were very pleased with our accounting gross margins during the quarter.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. Wanted to focus on your 3Q guidance, you were just kind enough to give us a little bit more color on Protiviti's impact on the guidance. Can we do the same thing on the Temp and Perm divisions if we can talk about revenue and margin trends you're expecting in the third quarter? Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","So overall, our staffing growth rates do decelerate slightly, but that's less than a point. As we just said, clients remain cautious. There's less sense of urgency. Our higher level and demand candidates have options as we've talked about in the past. We've got the conversion to our Salesforce platform that we've also talked about. So, absent the Salesforce conversion, the trends would say there's some continued slowing, but it's not necessarily off trend line from what it has for the past few quarters.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. And I'm sorry, that would be both \u2013 that would be the Temp side. How about the Perm side, and again some margin color would be great.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Okay. The Perm side, there the lengthening of the sales cycle clearly has an impact. You've got clients ever more selective. They want to see more candidates before making a decision. There is more vetting as a way to slow play us or slow the process generally. So, we clearly are seeing sales cycle slowing in the Perm side.","As we go down the P&L, gross margins, we do expect to see up 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year due to continued strong spreads, due to continued mix shift to the higher level accounting and finance assignments. Protiviti gross margins going to be down 3.5 percentage points to 4 percentage points. That's lower mix of the higher margin FSI regulatory and it's the cost impact of the annual campus hires and the interns, which come on board in the third quarter.","SG&A up 60 basis points year-over-year, 40 basis points to 50 basis points of that is the Salesforce and Protiviti conversion. One thing that was quite unusual in the quarter and continues on into the third quarter a bit, is our internal medical insurance costs. For the first time in many, many, many, many years, we had a negative surprise in our internal medical insurance costs which were up almost 40 basis points into the second quarter year-over-year.","Those higher costs are expected to continue into the third quarter, but maybe not quite to that extent on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti's SG&A would be up 1 to 2 percentage points, with the additional training and travel cost related to their conversion, which then as you go down to the P&L, at our midpoint of guidance, you've got Temp operating margins down about 50 basis points primarily due to the higher SG&A from the conversion to Salesforce.","Perm operating margins down 1 to 2 percentage points, primarily because of the conversion to Salesforce.com. And then Protiviti, it's operating margins would be down about 5 percentage points, as the combination of the lower gross margin that we talked about earlier and the higher SG&A because of, one, their conversion; two, the training and travel costs relative to their new hires and their interns. But again, remember, comparable for Protiviti, its third quarter operating margins were 15.7%","Those were the toughest operating margin comps we had of any division a year ago. So while they will make sequential progress in both revenues and operating margin, notwithstanding their conversion, they're comparing to a year ago's very high comps.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","We appreciate the color, if I could sneak just one more in; just about tax rate and share count for the third quarter. Thanks so much.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the tax rate is going to be in the range of 38.5% plus or minus 0.5%. And the share count, if you carry through the repurchases that we did during the quarter and assume some in the quarter to come, the share count should be somewhere down 700,000 shares, 750,000 shares. Note that, on a year-to-date basis, we've returned over 90% of our free cash flow back to shareholders, either as a dividend or as stock repurchases.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Stephen H. Sheldon - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. It's Stephen Sheldon for Tim today. Thanks for taking my questions. First, strong performance internationally in the quarter, so could you talk some more about what you're seeing in Europe specifically on a country level basis, and also what trends are like throughout the quarter and end of July? Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","So internationally, as we talk about for many quarters, Germany carried the day. Germany had a very, very strong quarter that we are very proud of. We've invested head count in Germany for some time and it's paying off significantly. Belgium also had a very strong quarter. The UK was solid. France, a little less so. Australia, very strong quarter; and Canada not quite as negative as it had been in quarters past. The trends, they're mixed, they're uneven. I would say, those that were strong in the second quarter that continued their strength into the third quarter. So we certainly have high expectations of Germany and Belgium specifically.","In the UK, with all the Brexit talk, remember UK is 3% of our revenues. While on the one hand some clients have deferred hiring, on the other hand some clients need help figuring out what Brexit may mean, which is stimulated hiring. And net-net so far, there hasn't been much impact, but the focus is on so far.","Stephen H. Sheldon - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned that you withdrew from a large client in RH Technology. Could you just quantify the impact of that in the quarter?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","It's not you huge, huge, but it's 2 percentage points or 3 percentage points on our growth rate.","Stephen H. Sheldon - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is actually Jay Hanna on the line for Gary today. Given the level of margin contraction, particularly within Protiviti, how much of that is attributable to additional new hires in the quarter if at all?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, so the margin contraction is principally mix-related, where you've got significantly less mix toward higher margin financial services regulatory compliance. There weren't necessarily that many hires during the quarter, but you had the carryover impact of the raises that were granted January 1. Protiviti's hiring is largely campus hiring and interns, and that largely occurs during the third quarter.","So while Protiviti will have a nice lift sequentially in quarter three revenues, they will also have incremental payroll costs from the campus hires and the interns they committed to almost a year ago.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, just given the current level of demand in recent margin performance I guess in this quarter and previous quarter, with reduction in head count a strategy to consider going forward or at least somewhat of a slowdown?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, so first of all, let's not forget, overall we're still growing. And while we front-ended our head count for this year into the latter part of last year, we've almost caught up with that. So the thought would be, because we're still growing our headcounts will grow a little toward the divisions that are growing. And again, I would offer that our accounting and finance divisions; particularly Accountemps, particularly Management Resources, they had very good quarters and we will add to their headcounts.","That said, we had other divisions that aren't showing that kind of growth, so we would let attrition play out to some degree and fund the head count additions to we make to those divisions that are growing. So net, we see small increases to our net overall head count. But let's not forget, we need to continue to feed our accounting and finance staffing divisions, because they're growing nicely.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Anj Singh from Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, following up on the Protiviti margins. What's your outlook for Protiviti margins in light of some of the issues on mix and the CRM systems migration that you highlighted? Do you still anticipate hitting double-digit operating margins for the full year, as you did at Q2?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, we certainly haven't changed our long-term view of Protiviti operating margins. Clearly, given that we made head count commitments almost a year in advance, with the benefit of hindsight, we were a little aggressive in the hiring that we committed to with Protiviti. But over a few quarters, we can work that out. We had double-digit operating margins the second half of last year. We still believe, and our estimates consider, that we'll have double-digit operating margins in the second half of this year, just not as strong as they were a year ago.","So, there's been a pullback with our financial services clients that have gotten much more focused on their costs. That's had a double impact, because it's not only fewer hours for us, but they're the most profitable hours that we've had, but that's something we can adjust to over time. It's just that when you commit to your staff levels three quarters or four quarters in advance, you can't turn on a dime marrying that to the demand as we now see it.","So, the margins are still going to be good and decent and double-digit. There's nothing wrong with a business growing at Protiviti's rates, given the comps that they have, to have low double-digit operating margins. It's just less than we enjoyed a year ago, and so the comparison when you put them next to each other is negative.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it. And on my second question, could you talk a bit about the weaker Perm growth at Q2? I believe you typically gotten a nice sequential lift versus Q1, and I think you'd anticipated this at Q1. I know you've called out the lengthening of the sales cycles, et cetera, but I guess what changed from the time you issued guidance at Q1 that led to some of the weaker sequential growth in Perm?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","I think clients got incrementally more selective. They got incrementally less sense of urgency in doing their hiring. And therefore, Perm didn't get the sequential lift that it traditionally enjoys in the second quarter. It still got some sequential lift, it just didn't get either what we expected or what had seen in the past.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it. Quick one from me. Did you mention the bill rate increase in conversions? If not, I'd appreciate you just discussing those. Thanks.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","So the bill rate increases were 4.8%, which were very close. Last quarter's was 4.7%. So again, back on the theme that our gross margin was quite strong for the quarter, that's confirmed by the year-over-year bill rate increases that we saw. Conversions were 3.3% of revenue, which I believe year-on-year was down a few basis points and sequentially was up a few basis points. So frankly, it's still hovering in and around the same number.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from Randy Reece from Avondale Partners.","Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey, guys. This is Ben Flox on for Randy. I wanted to circle back on Perm for a second. Can you talk about the competitive landscape there and kind of how that's escalated over the last four quarters to six quarters?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure the competitive landscape's really changed in the last four quarters to six quarters. Again, I think it's more about our middle market client base getting incrementally more cautious.","Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay.","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I really don't think it's about new competition or heightened competition in the last four quarters to six quarters.","Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, can you talk about \u2013 when you talk about Temp trends you're seeing in the first few weeks of July, can you speak to that specifically to the U.S. and kind of where you're seeing strengths and weaknesses?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There are always state-by-state differences. Northern California is the strongest, it's been the strongest for some time. That's not surprising. Texas is the weakest, it's been the weakest for quite some time. That's not surprising. Everything else is somewhere in between. There are always pluses and minuses. I think nothing just screams at you and moves the needle in a major way.","Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC","Looking at segments rather than geographically?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Segments, the trends that you've seen in the last few quarters continue. We would expect that Accountemps and Management Resources would do the best in quarter three. We would believe that Robert Half Technology and OfficeTeam, again with very tough comparisons, would do, not as well, as the accounting and finance divisions.","Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Digging deeper into the Protiviti business, can you discuss your expectations around financial services, regulatory mix going forward, and any actions you have to improve staff utilization?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, we believe that FSI regulatory mix will continue to drift downward and we've seen that now for two quarters in a row. But we've built that into our guidance, and notwithstanding that, we're still estimating that we're going to get nice double-digit operating margins in the third quarter.","Staff utilization, again as we talked about earlier, we commit to campus hires, we commit to interns well in advance. We remain committed to them, and it will take a few quarters to get the utilization backup to where it had been in the near past. As we look forward to this year's hiring season, on-campus and within interns, we will throttle that back further. We'll look at the contractor usage of Protiviti, where they do have variable labor costs, primarily with contractors sourced through Robert Half. Those will be looked at. But we will have solid operating margins for the next few quarters, and in the background we will throttle back our capacity, our additions to capacity given new revenue realities.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Very helpful. In your temp and consulting segment, gross margins expanded year-over-year yet operating margins declined. Does this reflect elevated recruiter hiring or other investments you made in the quarter?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, it's actually quite simple. The delta is the outside medical insurance expenses we incurred during the quarter which were about a 40 basis points surprise. It is very unusual that we would have that kind of spike in that short a period of time. Some of that spike will continue for a quarter or two, but we're certainly told by our outside advisors and actuaries in that area that our company specific trend at the moment is very unusual and would expect to normalize itself in the next year.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Got it. Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. This is Ryan filling in for Manav. Just a question on buybacks, looking out obviously another pretty solid quarter. Is that a trend you think you could continue or is it something where it's clearly opportunistic and you'll just kind of play it as the market goes?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","I think, again, so far this year we return to shareholders about 92% of our free cash flow. That's a continuation of something we've done for many, many, many quarters. So the plan would be, we first determine what our operating requirements are and then with the residual, we pretty much return it to shareholders, first through dividends and then with what's left through buybacks. So what we did during the second quarter is very similar to what we've done in prior quarters and as the price goes up and down, we get fewer or more shares and over time we dollar cost average and it seems to work out just fine.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Fair enough. Thanks. Is there anything in the quarter to call out just in terms of kind of one time seasonality events, obviously, we saw it in the May jobs report there seem to be an outsize impact I guess from the Verizon strike. I mean, were there any kind of timing things in the quarter that kind of, could skew growth trends in your business?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't \u2013 nothing comes to mind and we were not impacted by Verizon.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fair enough, thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi Keith. I understand you're saying that the midsized clients are just more cautious on the labor front here. I was just wondering if you sense that the U.S. is not in a 2% real GDP environment like our JPMorgan economist think we're already back in. And so, what needs to change for Robert Half's revenue growth to stabilize and perhaps reaccelerate? Is there anything on the supply side?","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, I mean, frankly, Andrew the only division that's significantly impacted by supply is Tech Development for us. The rest of our divisions, primarily need more orders...","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","Than they need more candidates. So, you ask kind of in a double negative way, it appears that the U.S. economy is slugging along in the 1% to 2% GDP path that it has for some time, but as clients have gotten more cautious, our growth rates have slowed.","And then the third quarter is going to be a very noisy quarter for these conversions that we've got going, that are going to impact virtually every single person that works for us in the United States. So third quarter, it's very hard to figure out trend lines given how noisy it's going to be. But if you step above that, it seems to be more of the same versus the last three quarters \u2013 versus the last few quarters, maybe with clients getting a little more cautious.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. But if you...","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","What has to change \u2013 what has to change is...","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","M. Keith Waddell - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Financial Officer","They need to get less cautious, right? They need to do less vetting. They need to say yes, I'll take them rather than show me somebody else or let me compare.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thanks Keith. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to clarify your response to a prior question. The large client that you withdrew from, you said it was a 2% to 3% impact on the growth rate, was that for revenue overall or for Robert Half Technology specifically?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's just Robert Half Technology.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Randy Reece from Avondale partners.","Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey, guys. Ben Flox again. Just wanted to follow-up on one last thing kind of higher level. If hiring demand in the U.S. does regain some momentum, how far behind should we expect Accounting and Finance Staffing demand to lag?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would argue quite frankly it's doing the best in the current environment, and therefore, would participate quickly in an improved environment. So it would be the one I would least be concerned that there's any lag for. As I say, this trend toward higher level more complex has certainly served it well for the last few quarters relative to the market and our other lines of business, but I would think as market conditions improve, because I think you'd see it in our accounting operations positions which tend to be more transactions volume driven than the more complex accounting analyst, senior accountants and above. So I don't think there'd be that much of a lag in Accounting.","Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","It looks like we have just one more question. The last question is from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. I'm curious in the tech space, you had contracted \u2013 there was some pricing that you didn't like. Is there \u2013 are you seeing the same kind of behavior among large customers as well as your more traditional ones? I know generally you don't serve a lot of large customers, but in the tech space, that's a little bit more inherent in the market. Thank you.","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say financial services clients be it tech or otherwise are more focused on controlling their cost than any other sector, and to the extent we have exposure to financial services, we've talked very openly about Protiviti and the impact on Protiviti. But other than that sector, and as you pointed out, larger clients aren't our sweet spot, but we do have a few here and there and when we can get reasonable margins, we're happy to do that business. When we can't get reasonable margins, we withdraw. And other staffing firms don't have that same view. But that's who we are, and that's who we've been for a long time.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Have you notice a difference between a public demand from public companies versus private entrepreneur owned and led businesses?","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I mean sweet spot is more the privately held 75 to 150 employee firm. So, I think if you look at our results and say it's a proxy for anything, it's not for public companies. It's for smaller, midsized private companies.","Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Harold M. Messmer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That was our last question. We'd like to thank everyone again for joining us on today's call.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Our hosts for today's call are Mr. Max Messmer, Chairman and CEO of Robert Half; and Mr. Keith Waddell, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer.","Mr. Messmer, you may begin.","Max Messmer","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks you for joining us. As is our custom, I would like to remind you there are comments on the call today that contain predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable; however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today\u2019s 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today\u2019s call. For your convenience, our prepared remarks also are available on our website at www.roberthalf.com. From the \u201cAbout Us\u201d tab, go to our Investor Center, where you will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link.","Now, let\u2019s review our first quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.303 billion, up 8% from the first quarter one year ago. Income per share was $0.64, up 10% from this time last year. Cash flow from operations was $79 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $19 million.","In February, we increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This is the 11th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased the dividend amount. The dividend was paid to shareholders on March 15, for a total cash outlay of $29 million. We also repurchased 700,000 Robert Half shares during the first quarter, at a cost of $29 million. We have 9.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan.","The U.S. job market remained solid in the first quarter as did demand for our professional staffing and consulting services, resulting in year-over-year revenue growth in all lines of business. Our accounting and finance staffing divisions had a particularly strong first quarter. This was the company\u2019s 24th straight quarter of double-digit earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 33%.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. Global revenues were $1.303 billion in the first quarter, up 8% from the first quarter a year ago on a reported basis, and on a same day, constant currency basis. First quarter staffing revenues were up 7% on a same day, constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $900 million in the first quarter, up 9%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $215 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 330 staffing locations worldwide, including 90 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The first quarter had 62.7 billing days, compared to 62.0 days in the first quarter one year ago. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing by 1% of the reported year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter. The current second quarter has 63.9 billing days, compared to 63.2 days in the second quarter of last year.","Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million in the first quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 1%. Global revenues for Protiviti were $187 million in the first quarter, with $158 million in revenues in the United States and $29 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 14% year-over-year on a same day, constant currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 8% from the prior year.","Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","Now, let\u2019s talk about gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the first quarter was 37.1% of applicable revenues. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period one year ago as higher pay\/bill spreads offset lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues.","First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up slightly from last year\u2019s 9.4%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved by 20 basis points versus one year ago, to 43.1%. First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $51 million, or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin one year ago for Protiviti was $47 million, or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues.","Staffing SG&A costs were 32.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.2% in last year\u2019s first quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 18.8% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. Operating income from our staffing divisions was $119 million in the first quarter, up 7% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.7%, the same as the prior year. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, an increase of 5%over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.7%.","Operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million in the first quarter, up 13% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 20.2%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $15 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 7.8 %. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $734 million, implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 51.3 days.","Now, turning into guidance. Before we turn to guidance, let\u2019s review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency. Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated slightly during the quarter, and we exited the quarter with March revenues growing 6.3% compared to 6.7% for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first two weeks of April was up 5.5% compared to the prior year.","Global permanent placement revenue growth rates accelerated during the first part of the quarter then moderated thereafter, with March revenues growing 1.5% compared to 8.6% for the full quarter. For the first three weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were flat compared to the same period last year. This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the first quarter and in April. But, as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.","With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance. Revenues: $1.325 billion to $1.385 billion, income per share $0.70 to $0.76. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 6% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency, including Protiviti, and EPS growth of 8%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We were pleased with the company\u2019s performance during the first quarter. Our results were boosted by still low U.S. unemployment in numerous professional occupations and stronger labor markets in key international locations. The number of U.S. job openings has exceeded the number of hires since February 2015, according to the most recent Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.","The competition for skilled talent is intense. Multiple offers and counteroffers are common for high-demand candidates, particularly in technology and accounting. Internationally, we see higher demand for professional level talent in a number of markets, notwithstanding the economic headwinds that persist outside the United States.","We feel we will continue to benefit from a widening skills gap in a number of our professional specialty areas. Employers that are struggling to find needed talent are recognizing that flexible staffing can help them manage total labor costs and also increase the pool of potential full time talent through temporary-to-hire arrangements.","Turning now to Protiviti: We were pleased with Protiviti\u2019s performance during the quarter, including once again reporting double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti has an excellent growth outlook based on multiple factors favorably influencing service demand. These include a robust regulatory environment and increased need for stronger internal controls and data security measures, among others.","At this time Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits we'll certainly try to return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","All right. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Just wondering, with regards to the trends that you've been seeing on a monthly basis as well as quarter-to-quarter and on a same business day perspective, how would you characterize this relative to what you've seen in prior stages, you know, prior cycles and what this is telling us with regards to where we are in this current cycle? I know you are always realistic about, not saying that you're economists, but just, you know, got a ton of experience. So that's one. And then secondly can you just talk a little bit specifically about what you saw in RH Technology as well as in Perm you know, in this quarter and in March?","Max Messmer","Okay. So several sub questions there. So about trends, comparing cycles, clearly we see clients remaining cautious due to the uncertain macro environment. That lengthens the sale cycle. Further as we talked about before, candidates have many options with their current employer, with other employers. That makes them harder to close. That also lengthens the sale cycle. So generally speaking across our divisions, less so with the accounting and finance ones, but the sale cycle has elongated which has impacted our growth rates and is expected to impact our growth rates into the second quarter.","Compared to prior cycles, it usually gets white hot for candidates such that clients will very quickly take any candidate that's close and the current environment is no where near that environment, so to the extent in prior cycles, late stage has been indicated by this white hot hyper demand where permanent placement grows at very high double-digit rates. That hasn't happened and notwithstanding the fact that we're in year seven or whatever of this cycle, we still don't see that type of hyper demand that we would typically see late cycle, but instead we continue to slug it out in this relatively sluggish macro environment. We saw that again in the first quarter. Our guidance anticipates more of same in the second quarter.","With respect to RH Tech and Perm I would say those trends were particularly evident in both of those divisions. While it's true that Tech's year-over-year growth rate slowed from 10% to 6%, if you look at the year-ago comps they got harder from 12% to 19%. So given the tougher comps, the deceleration in the growth wasn't totally unexpected. Perm did fine in the beginning of the quarter, as we said. It decelerated late. That deceleration continued into the first part of this quarter. That said, we all know from experience that those are short periods of time. They were disproportionately impacted in the post-quarter start by our non-U.S. operations. But on balance the guidance we're giving is that the economy will continue to chug along at a slow rate. The sales cycle has elongated. Its taken longer to close deals; that includes Perm, that includes Tech. And therefore our growth rates have slowed modestly.","Mark Marcon","And as the year unfolds the comps get easier. Do you think on a sequential seasonally-adjusted basis things will continue to slow? Or do you think it's basically, based on what you're currently seeing, kind of holds around this level?","Max Messmer","Well, as you know we typically don't go beyond a quarter, but we've been slugging it out in a 1% or 2% GDP environment for several years. The comps do get easier; that's certainly better than them getting harder. It gives us a better shot at decent growth rates in the back side of the year. They are certainly plenty of economist types out there that say GDP growth will accelerate in the back half of the year. We don't know if that's true or not but easier comps are better than harder comps.","Mark Marcon","Great. Thanks for the very comprehensive answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.","Stephen Shelman","Hi. It's Stephen Shelman in for Tim. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I believe this was the first year-over-year margin decline that we've seen in a while for Protiviti. So what caused the underlying decline? How has consultant utilization trended? And how should we think about overall Protiviti margins kind of going forward?","Keith Waddell","Yes. So first of all Protiviti once again, on very tough comps reported very robust revenue growth. They were up 14% on comps that had grown 26% in the year-ago period. That said, on the cost side there have been many investment hires on the MD side to expand their practice, both in the U.S. and abroad. January 1 is the date for the annual raises for their entire practice. The raises, due to the competitiveness of the market, were higher this year than they were in years past, so the combination of those two, their direct costs were up 17% on the revenues that were up 14%. Clearly some of those costs are front loaded for the full year. We expect to leverage those as we progress through the year.","We would also observe that in the Financial Services Regulatory Consulting Practice we had some projects again that were delayed and deferred. On a few new projects the rates were lower than they had been in the past as some clients get a little more cost conscious. That Regulatory Practice for many quarters in a row has had absolute hyper growth. In this quarter it went from hyper growth to fantastic growth. It's just shades of really good, but it was slightly slower this quarter than we expected frankly. And to the extent it was a little light relative to our plan, all of that lightness dropped all the way to the bottom line. So notwithstanding very robust revenue growth, our margins declined year-over-year, as you noted.","As we move into the year for the second quarter, we expect Protiviti to still have growth in the low to mid-teens. Again, that's on very tough comps a year ago, which were up 23%. We think the margins will grow nicely sequentially but the margins will still be slightly below last year's levels. That said, we do expect to get back into double-digit percentage operating margins, which is certainly going in the right direction.","Demand for Protiviti's services remain strong. The pipeline remains strong. It had a very good quarter. It certainly has been aggressive, adding to capacity. It will now leverage that capacity over the rest of the year and the margins will improve. It's our fastest-growing division. It's been our fastest-growing division for several quarters running. We're very pleased with Protiviti.","Stephen Shelman","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a numbers question; what was the conversion fees in the quarter as a percentage of revenue?","Keith Waddell","So conversions were 3.2% of revenue for the quarter. As we said earlier, overall our Temp margins expended by 10 basis points. That's notwithstanding a 10 basis point contraction in conversions, which mean our pay bill spreads more than made up for that, so they were down a tick. Clearly we would have liked to have seen those a bit higher. We're still optimistic over the medium-term that we have some upside in conversions, but for this quarter they backed up just a little bit.","Stephen Shelman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color by geography, specifically outside the United States? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","Sure. The \u2013 once again Germany by leaps and bounds was our strongest non-U.S. operation. It performed just wonderfully on very tough, tough comps a year ago. It's where we've invested the most head count. It's where we focused the most effort. And we're getting a very nice return on our German investment. The UK and Belgium were also very solid. On the flip side we had challenges in Canada and Australia, which are minerals mining related and France continues to struggle a little bit as well, but Germany easily number one, UK Belgium solid, the other three trailing behind a bit.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Great. And we noticed I guess the spike in year-over-year growth in some of your accounting areas. Is there anything specific that's moving that needle?","Keith Waddell","Let's say first of all, across all of our accounting related divisions, whether it's Accountemps, whether it's Management Resources or whether it's Protiviti, you've got a backdrop of more focus on internal controls, you've got a backdrop of more regulation that has to be figured out, processed, dealt with, complied with, so that overall umbrella is helpful for all our accounting divisions, but further than that we would also observe that there's a shift to higher-level skills.","In Accountemps it's a shift from accounts payable\/accounts receivable payroll to staff and senior accountants and to business analysts and management resources gets the shift to more accounting managers, more controllers, more senior analysts. So the net of that is the assignments are a little longer, there's a little less candidate turnover and so you see higher growth rates in Accountemps, Management Resources, and as we talked about earlier that, and Protiviti, that are all somewhat related with more complexity comes the need for higher skills and we are seeing that positive skill drift if you will, that you can see we're benefiting from in those divisions.","Jeff Silber","All right. Great. And just a quick numbers question. I noticed the tax rate was down a little bit year-over-year, was there something specific going on and what should we be modeling for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Keith Waddell","So the tax rate was lower. Our foreign tax rate was lower than we had projected. We made some elections that reduced those rates positively. Some of that actually carries through for the rest of the year, so we've talked about 39% being the midpoint of our range of 38% to 40%, so maybe rather than 39%, maybe it's now 38.75%. I mean it's still in that range, but as you know and as you've seen for many quarters our tax rates are bit volatile and the source of the volatility is typically non-U.S. tax rates.","Jeff Silber","All right. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sara Gubins","Thank you. I'm hoping you can give us some more detail about what's incorporated into the second quarter guidance for revenue by segment, gross margins and SG&A trends. And I know you already went through some of that Protiviti.","Keith Waddell","Okay. So by segment I would say, without getting totally granular, generally speaking we would expect Accountemps and Management Resources to have higher growth rates than the other staffing divisions. We've already talked about Protiviti. At the gross margin line our guidance contemplates a contraction of 10 to 20 basis points for temp gross margin; however, that's because we have not considered any additional worker's compensation credit that we got a year ago, that a year ago was 20 basis points. So with no consideration of a worker's compensation credit this quarter we're talking about temp G&A being down 10 to 20 basis points. If you figure we get our worker's compensation credit, which we have a third-party review and we just don't know although for many quarters we have gotten one, then we wouldn't have that contraction.","On the staffing SG&A side we believe we will start to leverage the headcount investments we made in the second half of last year because we're holding those pretty much constant in the quarter just ended as well as the second quarter ahead, as we've talked about in the past, so that we should get 10 to 20 basis points of year-over-year SG&A leverage.","So again, in the absence of any worker's comp credit our staffing operating income percentage would be down 30 to 40 basis points year-over-year; half of that would be worker's comp. A piece of the balance of that would be expected less Perm mix than we had a year ago. The second quarter's always a strong Perm quarter and you get a nice lift sequentially. We got a really nice lift a year ago. We're expecting a lift this quarter, but not as much lift as we had a year ago.","We talked about Protiviti; year-on-year we'll be down a point or two operating margin wise but that will be up sequentially versus what we just reported. Tax rate we just talked about, share count would be down half a million shares or so, as they flow through what we bought in the first quarter.","Max Messmer","So at a high level, we see a couple of points of top-line deceleration as we go into the second quarter, we hope we're being conservative, but with, when people start talking about Q1 GDP growth being sub 1%, we thought it prudent to be conservative and frankly our start in April is a little stronger than the full quarter guidance that we've given, but it's not a lot stronger.","Sara Gubins","Okay, great. And then given the trends that you've seen, I know you're not adding to headcount, but are you making, are you starting to consider or planning any cost cuts in Temp or in Perm?","Keith Waddell","We constantly look at our headcounts and with the turnover early in our business, there's a lot of attrition. So you get a lot of opportunities to decide do you replace the attrition or do you not replace the attrition, so we will focus carefully on our headcounts. We still are growing, projected to be 5% or 6% top-line, so it's not like we're not growing. But we always look at our headcounts and to the extent we feel like adjustments are needed, it's just part of the ordinary course of our business with attrition that we get a lot of opportunities to adjust in a very quiet behind-the-scenes kind of way.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jay Hanna","Hey, this is actually Jay Hanna on the line for Gary today. You mentioned it earlier but typically as a cycle matures we begin to see Perm again the really accelerate and outgrow Temp which hasn't truly happened yet. I was wondering if you could shed anymore light on this and also just give your thoughts on what's really happening within the dynamics of each. Thanks.","Keith Waddell","We would agree, as we talked about earlier, typically when you get late cycle you get hyper Perm growth and we haven't seen that. Demand has not overheated anywhere near to the extent that it has in prior cycles. That in and of itself would be indicative of we're not late cycle. That said, we are in the condition where our internal sale cycle has lengthened clients take longer to pull the trigger. Candidates with all their options take longer to close and even with robust demand and even with Canada's supply, when it takes longer to close a deal that shows up in our growth rates. But relative to cycles past, the demand environment has not overheated nowhere near to the extent which it has in prior cycles. And our Perm growth rates are pretty reflective of that.","Jay Hanna","Great. Good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anj Singh","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First off I wanted to touch on international Perm. I guess I had anticipated it to be a little bit better. You had been talking about some headcount additions there. Could you talk about perhaps how international Perm did versus your expectation? And when we may start seeing some of your headcount adds they are start showing up in your results?","Keith Waddell","Well, as we talked earlier it's a very mixed bag. The most headcount investments we've made have been in Germany, Temp and Perm, but including Perm. And no question Germany came through with flying colors and we're very happy with the investment and we're real happy with the return. That improvement was offset by some declines in the other countries that I talked about. So when you put the two back together you don't see the net improvement that we would like to see, but it's not because the places where we invested didn't perform; it's more because the places where we didn't invest were more challenged than what we expected.","Anj Singh","Got it. And then touching on Tech, I know it was discussed a little bit earlier; could you just talk about that some more? Did you experience that market slowing a little bit? Some of your competitors have mentioned that the Tech Staffing market was a little softer in Q1. Curious to see if you saw that also or if the slowdown was purely a function of tougher comps?","Keith Waddell","Well, clearly tougher comps was a big part of the story, given how much tougher the comps got. But this whole this phenomena of the sales cycle elongating certainly applies to Tech. We have had clients take longer to pull the trigger; if you want to call that softening that would be fair. Candidates are still in tight supply, particularly the mid to higher level candidates. It does take longer to close them. That impacts growth rates as well. So we would characterize as the market for Tech as firm, as strong, but it's taking us longer to get deals closed and therefore our growth rates are slowing, exacerbated by the toughness of the comps.","Anj Singh","Okay. Understood. And then one last quick one from me; as you look at industries that are perhaps seeing longer sales cycles, is there anything that stands out in particular? Is there an industry in particular that's causing this, I just curious to hear your thoughts there? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","Particularly on the staffing we're very diversified from an industry end market point of view, so I wouldn't necessarily single out any industry per se. On the Protiviti side it is more Financial Services focused. You do have some of the larger Financial Services firms a little more focused on cost control than they have been in the past. Having said that, the regulatory compliance environment, even at those largest of the large Financial Services firms, is still robust; it\u2019s just not quite as robust as it has been. It\u2019s degrees of strong, it\u2019s not the difference between strong and weak.","Anj Singh","Okay. Great. Thank you for your time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","My first question is how much were bill rates up? And my second question, and I know you keep on saying candidates are in tight supply, taking longer to close, do you mean that supply is holding back your growth rates?","Keith Waddell","So bill rates were up 4.7% year-over-year. That\u2019s down slightly from the 5% they were down last quarter, but not...","Andrew Steinerman","Yes.","Keith Waddell","Right. That\u2019s a smaller rate of growth than the 5% rate of growth from last quarter, to be real clear. And is candidate supply holding growth? It\u2019s certainly impacting growth, yes. There\u2019s no question that if we could close candidates more quickly we would be growing more quickly. That\u2019s not to say that the candidates aren\u2019t there, it\u2019s their confidence level that if they don\u2019t take this job there\u2019s going to be another job available to them makes it harder to convince them to take this job. And to the extent it\u2019s harder and takes longer, that impacts our growth rates.","So are we saying the candidates aren\u2019t there? We are not. Are we saying because they have more confidence in their alternatives it takes longer to get them to say yes? We are saying that.","Andrew Steinerman","And that\u2019s even true on the Accounting Temporary Help side, right?","Keith Waddell","It\u2019s true on the accounting side. I\u2019d say it\u2019s not as severe in, as it is in Tech development, but on the accounting side in the mid to higher levels which is where our practice near term is gravitating toward, but clearly there are shortages. Our regulatory compliance would certainly be the case. Senior financial analysts certainly would be the case.","So there are pockets in Accounting\/Finance, but as a percent of Accounting overall, they\u2019re not as significant as is the case in Tech.","Andrew Steinerman","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Kwan Kim","Hi. This is Kwan Kim on for Tobey. Thank you for taking my questions. Could you talk about the head count additions and how they rate by area? You mentioned investment hires in Germany. Could you give us more color in those areas?","Keith Waddell ","Okay. So for the quarter there virtually were not any head count additions which is what we expected the case to be. We front loaded 2016\u2019s higher than the second half of 2015 and we announced then that we didn\u2019t expect much in the way of head count addition in the first half of 2016 and that has in fact been the case. Now there are always pluses and minuses, one line of business to another and one country to another, but outside the U.S. we\u2019ve been the most aggressive in adding to head count in Germany. And as I said earlier, that\u2019s both Temp and Perm and it\u2019s paid off nicely. It continues to pay off and will continue to invest heads in Germany. But we will net up as many heads as we\u2019re adding to Germany alone because we\u2019re doing some adjusting in other countries.","Got it. And on the Technology segment, what is your outlook for the bill rate growth? Does the growth be on par with the company average?","Keith Waddell ","Our expectation would be bill rate growth would be a little higher than our overall bill rate growth because candidates are in shorter supply. That said, just as a sector, there seems to be more pressure on bill rates and technology than our other lines of business. Whereas our other lines of business clients focus on our markup or our margin, in technology they tend to focus more on the absolute bill rate and that\u2019s something that\u2019s existed for decades which is a little head scratching, frankly, given supply and demand dynamics.","But short story is the bill rates in Tech are a little higher than overall, but arguably aren\u2019t as much higher as you would expect them to be given relative supply and demand of candidates.","Kwan Kim","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. Following-up on the earlier question on lower Temp conversions in the quarter, can you discuss how broad based this was? And what factors you believe may have contributed to this decline?","Keith Waddell","Well, as to how broad based it was, it wasn\u2019t isolated and it was certainly something we saw in more than just one or two lines of business. First of all, let\u2019s keep in mind we\u2019re talking about 10 basis points. So we can\u2019t come up with broad theories over 10 basis points. But we did say \u2013 we did see situations where \u2013 that weren\u2019t isolated where we had an order that was a temp to hire order, and because the market is hot our candidate left for a full-time job with some other client rather than hang around and be converted to full time on the assignment they started with us, which is yet another indication of candidate tightness.","Having said that, in the past we would typically see clients converting them more quickly to avoid that situation. And that isn\u2019t happening at the moment with the macro conditions and the macro backdrop we\u2019ve described.","George Tong","Got it. And then just a quick second question; notwithstanding the pending workers\u2019 comp credit, can you discuss whether you believe we\u2019re at or near a peak in Temp gross margins? And if not, wherever they can go?","Keith Waddell","Well, we do not believe we\u2019re at or near peak on Temp gross margins. We do not believe 3.2% of revenue is peak conversions when the traditional range is 3% to 5%, midpoint being 4%; we just do not accept that 3.2% is as good as it gets. And whatever more we get above that is pure margin. Further, we\u2019ve still got 30 basis points to 40 basis points in unemployment fringe cost higher than what they were at the last low point. That\u2019s upside, that upside will be offset a little bit by you\u2019ve got more and more states adding mandatory sick pay for our temporaries, and so that sick pay is going to offset some of those 30 basis points to 40 basis points that you\u2019re going to get on unemployment. But net we still think there\u2019s upside between the two.","On the pay bill spreads, as late as this quarter just ended we did expand our pay bill spreads. There\u2019s not as much upside there as there is in the other two areas, but we\u2019ve done a nice job with our pay bill spreads but we\u2019ve \u2013 that continued into this quarter. While we think we\u2019ve got a little room to go with our pay bill spreads, we think more of the future expansion will come from conversions and lower fringe charges.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Reece with Avondale Partners. Your line is open.","Randy Reece","Afternoon. I wanted to discuss the question of how you avoid earnings shortfalls in an environment like this when recruiting effort necessary to fill positions seems to be rising, making it more difficult to improve recruiting efficiency. Your actual placement rate can be choppy because demand is all over the place. And then you can have people converted out from under you because of a tight labor market.","Keith Waddell","Well, and to some degree all those things are true, Randy, but to the extent clients get more bullish, if in fact the second half macro improves, they\u2019re not going to wait as long to pull the trigger. And to the extent they don\u2019t wait as long to pull the trigger, then the sales cycle shortens and we expand our margins. And further, while we\u2019re growing mid-single-digits in this environment, we still get some operating leverage from doing that; notwithstanding that we are making infrastructure improvements internally to our ERP system, to our staff payroll system, to Protiviti\u2019s front office system as well. We still get some operating leverage over time from growing revenues, period.","So we believe we certainly have not peaked from an operating margin standpoint. Protiviti\u2019s cost got a little ahead of their revenues this quarter, but for heaven\u2019s sakes, they grew their revenues almost 15% on mid-20% growth a year ago. They\u2019ve got the rest of the year to leverage themselves out of that and you\u2019ll see margin improvement from it.","Randy Reece","The other question I had regard to the office team, the revenue has just been kind of decelerating there pretty steadily for a while and I was wondering if there was any particular phenomenon involved there or if it\u2019s a lot of different explanations?","Keith Waddell","It\u2019s a lot of different explanations except I think you\u2019ve got an open enrollment lift the last couple of years as company reviewed their medical insurance policies, whether they should go to private exchanges, whether it was ACA motivated or related or not. There\u2019s been a lot of motion and active with clients in the insurance enrollment area, medical insurance enrollment area. And that hasn\u2019t been quite as robust the last couple of quarters as it was in quarter\u2019s past.","Randy Reece","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Ryan, filling in for Manav. Just a question, on the first quarter we saw obviously the share price was under, it was levels that I think a lot of us were surprised to see. So just kind of curious what if that process was with the buybacks and whether there\u2019s any discussion about kind of going above and beyond and it really kind of stepping in with that market dislocation?","Keith Waddell","I guess our experience over many years is that you never know whether it is undervalued or overvalued over a short period of time. And generally speaking we spend our cash flow, if it's down we get more shares, if it's up we get fewer shares. And so during the quarter we spent a little more than our cash flow not much, but it's pretty much dollar cost average, because over short periods of time you don\u2019t know. We bought more shares than we would have bought because of the price. And that's been our policy and philosophy for many years. It seems to have done well for us when the price dips and goes back up, we can always be criticized for not getting more. We've also seen the other happen, but at the end of the day it's pretty much we spend our cash flow.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Fair enough. And there's a lot of talk on kind of the cycle and tighten if the labor market. Is there any possibility that this cycle is different because of the impact of technology especially on higher end candidates who maybe are leveraging different tools to look for jobs or companies that are leveraging these online tools to find candidates that maybe having an impact this time versus prior cycle?","Keith Waddell","Look, anything is possible. I guess as the labor markets tighten, we would observe. It takes more human intervention, not less, because somebody has to convince either or both sides that they need to move forward with this job or what this candidate. So whereas clearly there are more technology options to be job boards, to be job aggregators, be it social media including LinkedIn, finding the identity or an existence of a candidate or a job isn't hard nor has it been hard for a long period of time. But just as our efforts are more labor intensive to get things closed, we would argue self-service either by a candidate or by a client is less effective as well.","And in fact, those same technology driven options you describe, are also places, are also tools we use in our own recruiting of candidates, and in our own pursuit of leads for which clients are looking for people. We have more visibility to open job orders or unfilled openings today than we've ever had. We have more visibility candidates in our functional roles today than we've ever had. But notwithstanding that greater visibility in the both sides of our business, we find it's more labor intensive today, not late \u2013 less labor intensive to get things done.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Hansa Mazzarri with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Hansa Mazzarri","Thank you. Just heard a question on the sales cycle, you gave a lot of color on it being elongated versus prior cycles. Just curious order of magnitude, is this the longest elongation that you've seen versus prior cycles? Any sense of how to compare to what you've seen before? Thank you.","Keith Waddell","That\u2019s a subjective evaluation on our part. I'd say, we certainly haven't seen a cycle that's lasted this long, that's had sluggish 2% and less growth rates economically for this long. And so you've got this odd situation where clients are still cautious because they're worried about the macro. But because the lapse time has been so long on the candidate side, they have a lot of choices. And so you get both sides of the equation dragging their feet to our detriment to some degree. And we've been here now 30 years. And because it's easier to remember the near-term than the long ago, it's easy to say yes, it's the longest we can ever remember, but as a subjective answer.","Max Messmer","I\u2019d just add to what Keith said. The current environment is really peculiar because you have a lot of small and mid-size clients we deal with, who on the one hand know they need help, on the other hand they're nervous about the economy, and there's a lot of delay and procrastination involved. They they're about as uncertain as which way the economy is going as the stock market appears to be. That the slow GDP growth rates make them nervous, they're part of it. And yet they see demand in their own businesses, so that\u2019s encouraging.","So I think everyone is in a little bit state of limbo here, waiting to see what the macro economy is going to do. From our standpoint, it certainly doesn't feel late cycle, let's put it that way. We've had elongated sales cycles in the past and my guess this one will change also and go to a more traditional format depending on which way the economy breaks in the months ahead.","Hansa Mazzarri","Great. Thank you, thank you so much.","Max Messmer","Thank you. That was our last question. We appreciate everyone joining us on today's call.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Companywide revenues were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from last year\u2019s first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.","Net income per share for the quarter was $0.93, compared to $0.78 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 19%. Cash flow from operations was $127 million and capital expenditures were $13 million in the first quarter. In February of this year, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.28 to $0.31 per share, and in March, we distributed that dividend to shareholders, for a total cash outlay of $38 million. We also repurchased roughly 800,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $52 million. We have 5.9 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.","We saw solid revenue growth in our staffing and Protiviti operations during the quarter, both in our US and non-US operations. Persistent tight labor markets globally continue to result in heightened demand for our professional staffing services. During the first quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 41%.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed discussion of our results.","Keith Waddell","Thank you, Max. As just noted, global revenues in the first quarter were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from the prior year\u2019s first quarter on a reported basis, and up 9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis from the year-ago period.","Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and an as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by US and non-US operations. The term \u201cas-adjusted\u201d reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations, and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.","For our staffing business, first quarter revenues were up 7% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. US staffing revenues were $931 million, up 6% on a same-day basis, and non-US staffing revenues were $285 million, up 11% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.","The first quarter had 62.2 billing days, compared to 63 days in the first quarter of 2018. The shorter 2019 first quarter reduced our reported year-over-year staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days, compared to 63.5 days in the second quarter one year ago.","Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $22 million in the first quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.9 percentage points. For Protiviti, first-quarter global revenues were $252 million, with $192 million coming from business within the United States and $60 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.","On a same-day basis, US Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the first quarter, while non-US revenues were up 19% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effects of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $4 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.7 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms served clients through a network of 85 locations in 27 countries.","Now, let\u2019s turn to gross margin in the first quarter. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.0% of applicable revenues, compared to 37.2% of applicable revenues in the same period one year ago. Expanding bill\/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees were the largest contributors to the increase.","First-quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.8% of consolidated staffing revenues, versus 10.2% of consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2018. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 110 basis points versus one year ago, to 44.7%.","For Protiviti, gross margin in the first quarter was $64 million, or 25.3% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $55 million, or 26.4% of Protiviti revenues.","First-quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.2% of staffing revenues, compared to 33.5% one year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 30 basis points to the quarter\u2019s SG&A ratio. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter, compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.","First-quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $128 million, up 7% from the first quarter of 2018. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $106 million in operating income, an increase of 10% from the first quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.8%. In the first quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $22 million. This was down 4% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 16.4%.","Operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million in the first quarter, an increase of 22% from the year-ago period. This produced an operating margin of 7.4%. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $826 million, and implied days sales outstanding (DSO) was 50.5 days. Before we move to second-quarter guidance, let\u2019s review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter of 2019 and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days.","Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues up 4.7% versus the prior year, compared to 6.2% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first two weeks of April were 3.7% compared to the same period in April of 2018. March revenues for our permanent placement division were up 16.1% versus 2018, compared to a 12.3% increase for the full quarter. For the first three weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were up 6.3% compared to the same period last year.","This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the first quarter and thus far in April. But, as you know, they represent brief periods of time, and we caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following second-quarter guidance. Revenues, $1.485 billion to $1.550 billion. Income per share, $0.95 to $1.01. The midpoint of our first-quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis including Protiviti and EPS growth of 10%.","We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Max.","Max Messmer","Thank you, Keith. We ended the quarter with solid revenue growth throughout our staffing operations and Protiviti. Current trends leave us optimistic about where the company is positioned. Last year, the economy produced 2.7 million new jobs. The March 2019 BLS report showed job gains of nearly 200,000, exceeding economists\u2019 estimates.","Our key staffing client base of small and midsize businesses is feeling the pinch. The NFIB\u2019s March jobs report showed that 60% of small to medium size business owners are either hiring or trying to hire, and their biggest business problem is a lack of available, skilled talent. Increasingly, they are turning to Robert Half for help.","We are also seeing wage increases start to materialize as more employers recognize that they need to pay more to get the candidates they want. Wage inflation trends are now more typical of those we\u2019ve seen in past tight labor markets. Our brands are among the staffing and consulting world\u2019s most recognized and respected, our financial position is strong, and we have the most experienced field and corporate management team in the industry.","The combination of technology and personal service we bring to market is key, and all of our people and technology investments are designed to offer an optimal mix of high-tech and high-touch. We are convinced that you can\u2019t have one without the other and still provide clients with the type of hiring assistance they need.","With respect to Protiviti, we believe their leadership and talent have made them a formidable competitor in consulting. Their suite of consulting offerings now includes risk and compliance, data and analytics, and performance improvement, among others. Protiviti is also putting more focus on technology consulting, with additional emphasis on cybersecurity, cloud computing, and digital transformation.","As noted on prior calls, we are actively marketing our full suite of staffing and Protiviti capabilities in a managed solutions model. We believe our ability, as a single provider, to offer clients project oversight and deliverables, deep subject matter expertise, and a scalable network of experienced interim staff is unique in our industry.","Now, Keith and I would be happy to respond to questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we\u2019ll certainly return to you if you have additional questions. Thank you.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird.","Mark Marcon","I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit about the trends that we saw through the quarter and specifically the exit rate relative to the quarterly average. And then obviously, the first couple of weeks is a fairly short time period, wondering how you would view that in context to the uncertainty that we ended up seeing towards the end of the fourth quarter and kind of the behavior that you're seeing among your clients. And specifically, are those revenue trends reflective of what you're seeing in terms of order and fill rates over the last say six, seven weeks and how you would think about that unfolding.","Keith Waddell","So Mark, there is a lot going on here. And so first of all, as you know, the comps certainly got tougher, as we progress through the quarter. Further in Europe, we saw macro slowing in Germany, Belgium, France, a little beyond what we had expected. In the United States, particularly for accountants and office team, we saw clients get more selective, either because, they were replacing attrition and were looking for people to essentially hire on a full time basis, ultimately, which made them more spec driven than they might otherwise have been. ","And we further saw their demand being more measured as we progress through the quarter. That said, we had double digit growth in perm, in management resources and in tech, that were all quite strong throughout the quarter. As to the first couple of weeks and relative to the exit, so first of all, for a perm, post quarter, if you look a year ago, we had monster comps during that same short period where we grew 25% year on year. So I would discount the post quarter perm for that reason. ","If you looked at post quarter temp, just in the United States, it actually accelerated versus the exit rate in the first quarter in the US. It's non-US that caused the overall reduction in the post quarter growth rate versus the prior quarter and the exit rate. And again, that was principally Europe. But again, to put everything in context, for the quarter just ended, we did grow 9% year-on-year, notwithstanding tougher comps. We did grow EPS 19%. For the guidance, we've given for the second quarter, we still expect 5% or 6% at midpoint revenue growth and double digit EPS growth, which in this environment isn't bad.","Mark Marcon","No, it certainly isn't. And I fully appreciate that and appreciate the comps. With regards to, in the last quarter, we talked about the headcount additions, particularly on perm and productivity. I'm wondering, how we should think about headcount and additions going forward and what the impact, how we should think about the margin progression in perm and Protiviti as the hires mature and gain experience and productivity.","Keith Waddell","And so the headcount strategy hasn't changed, it's to roughly stay in line with top line growth. You'll note that perm margins were slightly lower year-on-year in Q1. That's because, it's quite typical that our field people would somewhat front end their hiring for the year. So we expect, as the year progresses, that perm margins would expand as well, which is embedded in our second quarter guidance. So headcount, in line with top line growth, we've got some of our divisions growing nicely at double digit rates. Those, we will continue to feed with additional headcount. ","Those that are growing less will get less headcount. Protiviti is our fastest grower and the largest contributor to Protiviti\u2019s growth are these joint solutions with staffing, as Max talked about, we have this unique offering where from Protiviti, you get project oversight, you get deep subject matter expertise, you get deliverables and then from staffing, you get scalable, experienced staff. That's the largest portion of Protiviti\u2019s growth, it continues to get traction. We're very excited about that. ","While 75% to 80% of the staff come from the staffing divisions, 100% of the revenues get reported via Protiviti because it has the contract with the client. But again, it's a joint effort, we're getting more traction, and it's the largest single contributor to Protiviti\u2019s growth during the quarter, which we\u2019re quite pleased with. Not that data was our only source of growth and in fact, if you just look at Protiviti, it remains very balanced between internal audit, technology consulting and financial services, risk and compliance consulting.","Mark Marcon","And the margin, as is typical, I mean, we should see the expansion towards the back half of the year?","Keith Waddell","That's correct. In Protiviti, seasonally, Q1 is always down versus Q4. As internal audit gets crowded out at clients as they focus on external audit, their margins are doubly impacted in that for their entire firm, they do salary increases and promotions as of January 1. It takes them some time to recover that and bill rates. So Q1 margins are always trough, but year-on-year Protiviti margins were as good as they were a year ago. But our expectation and our guidance considers that those margins improve as we move throughout 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Nomura.","Dan Dolev","Can you may be quickly give us the global hours and the bill rate for the quarter?","Keith Waddell","So, bill rates were up 5.7% year-on-year. That's an increase from last quarter when they were up 5.2% year-on-year. You back into the hours, hours are pressured, because a, it takes longer to recruit candidates in this market. Further, they leave assignments more quickly as they receive full time jobs, and we have to replace them. So it's not unusual in a tight labor market that the hours gets trained from the reasons I just mentioned.","Dan Dolev","Got it. So, there were about 60 basis points of growth in the hours? Is that fair?","Keith Waddell","Well, the combination of hours conversions, I mean, there's more than just hours there. But hours have been flattish to slightly down for a few quarters.","Dan Dolev","And if you kind of think about, you said the US versus Europe, so all else equal, if you were just -- if you basically didn't have that European business, you would say that your outlook would have been more bullish about the overall company if that\u2019s just the European issue or is this something more broad based, both in Europe and in the US.","Keith Waddell","So, Europe's growth rates declined more than the US, but they still, in absolute terms, were higher than US. But clearly the trends in Europe are not as optimistic as they are in the US and we were happy to see that our temp post quarter start was better than our US temp quarter one exit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Keith, in your earlier remarks, you talked about the sequential change in gross margin in Protiviti. I'm just curious on a year-over-year basis, what drove the year-over-year decline in gross margins at Protiviti.","Keith Waddell","Again, quite common that they do their raises and promotions firm wide on January 1, it takes a quarter or two to recover that. So, there's gross margin compression early that picks up steam as you progress during the year. They offset that in Q1 with operating leverage on the SG&A line such that their operating margins year-over-year were flat on a percentage basis.","Jeff Silber","But were the bonuses relatively higher than a year ago, is it maybe because you're doing more of the managed solutions offering? Again, I'm just looking at the 26.4 last year and the 25.3 this year?","Keith Waddell","Right. So it\u2019s base pay increases and promotions. Both happen all at once. And you don't pass those through all at once. In the tight labor market we're in, Protiviti is having to give increasingly larger raises and they're giving promotions a little sooner than they had in the past, both of which pressure costs. But again, they totally offset that with operating leverage such that their operating margins came in same as last year, which is a good thing.","Jeff Silber","I got it. Thanks so much. And then just a quick follow up on the office team, I know it's one of your smaller divisions. But, same day constant currency growth took a turn for the worse in the quarter. Is there anything specifically going on there different from some of your other divisions?","Keith Waddell","The only thing we would observe is that office team for the last two or three years has been the beneficiary of a lot of activities on the part of clients with respect to changes to their healthcare plans in and around open enrollment. And for the most part, most companies that made those changes have totally digested them. And that source of demand has essentially dried up. So the only thing that's really that specific to office team is this open enrollment, health insurance administration plan changing that settled down after a period where they had two or three years of lift from that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Keith, could you just make a quick comment about Protiviti in the second quarter from a revenue growth standpoint.","Keith Waddell","So, second quarter guidance for Protiviti has double digit growth rates embedded. And that's notwithstanding monster comps. If you look a year ago, the growth rates jumped 10 percentage points between Q1 and Q2. So notwithstanding those monster comps, we still expect they'll grow by double digits in Q2. Again, for all the reasons we talked earlier, the balance solutions plus the joint activities with staffing.","Andrew Steinerman","Any comment about Protiviti in Europe?","Keith Waddell","Protiviti Europe again, done quite well. The Germany, Italy were both strong, again, the comps there are very high. If you look a year ago, first quarter, it grew 22%, so it slowed to 19% this year, but I'll take 19% on top of 22% any day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gary Bisbee","So, as I just look at the trends over the last couple of years, it's sort of surprising that your international staffing businesses have continued to outpace the US, despite in Europe, at least broadly, slower economic growth and in just what seems like less tight labor markets in general, and it sounds like that slowing now is at least exiting the quarter, but how should we think about the potential for the international business to continue to put up good growth? And also, do you feel like there's potential for the US businesses to accelerate further, given the markets that we've got here?","Keith Waddell","Well, we have had very strong growth from non-US operations. Germany has been a standout, Belgium has consistently been solid from years on hand. UK, Brexit notwithstanding, has been solid for us. And then Canada is part of non-US, Canada has been strong. Australia has been good. So country by country, we've done well. We've invested a lot in Germany for a long period of time. That's continued to pay off. ","So as we spoken from a trend standpoint, we had the most slowing in Europe, but slowing to a level that still exceeds growth in the US. From a US standpoint, we've seen some slowing of late in our account temps and office team operations, not so much our management resources, perm and technology. So we have seen some macro uncertainty in the US, the external reports we've seen of late are mixed. NFIB, solid, but all highs, weekly unemployment claims quite low, quite good. ","JOLTS, mostly good, although openings were down a bit. PMI services that came out last week were negative. So, the economic external metrics, if you will, are more mixed than they've been in the last several quarters and so given that, we were more conservative in our US guidance, notwithstanding the fact that at least out of the gate, we accelerated versus exit, if you talk to our top people in the field, they would tell you their order rates have increased of late, but those order rates haven't yet shown themselves as revenue.","Gary Bisbee","And then, so it sounds like some softening and potentially some conservatism also, much more difficult comps for the business overall. Would it be right to say that those two factors are in the same sort of zip code in terms of the impact on the deceleration here or is there, the comp is a much bigger factor than just the softening you're seeing? I don't know if you can ballpark.","Keith Waddell","Well, the comps are different by line of business. Tech has the toughest comps for the quarter versus the first. Protiviti, as I said earlier, has a monster comp to compete with, notwithstanding that, they still think because their pipeline is strong, they can double digit grow away from that. So, I'd say, while maybe in the same zip code, we anticipate more non-US slowing than we do US.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse.","Kevin McVeigh","Keith, Protiviti feels like it's a lot more synchronized at this point in the cycle than it was last time and just thinking about the peaking Sarbanes Oxley and that kind of coming off in the temp business continued to grow. Is that kind of still the case? And, would you expect the outsized growth in Protiviti as a benefit from kind of the feed within management resources if you would?","Keith Waddell","Well, it is clear that Protiviti has a much more balanced revenue stream today than they did in prior cycles. There was a time when Sarbanes Oxley was 75% to 80% of their revenue. Today, it's less than 20. Further, you've got this growth engine going to market together with staffing that essentially didn't exist to any material degree in prior cycles. So, there's no question that structurally, Protiviti is in a better place than it was in prior cycles, no question.","Kevin McVeigh","And then just the temp date overall, relative to the BLS was kind of negative the first three months of the year, was that more kind of the December effect or kind of inability to fill or just any thoughts around that? Or is that just again, the general macro uncertainty that you've been talking about, for kind of the first 30 minutes of the call here?","Keith Waddell","Well, there's a lot of things you could point to, it's hard to pinpoint. There was a Fed scare, the market last fall, there was delayed impact from, the weather wasn\u2019t great, particularly in February, the government shutdown was a little bit of a negative overhang. So, there was a lot of little pieces. But no one of those by themselves explains anything. But there's no question we saw our clients get more measured during the quarter, which made them more selective, which slows down our sales cycle, particularly in the transaction level people that we place, accounting operations and account temps and an office team. Our project businesses, management resources, Robert Half technology, Protiviti, they have strong pipeline, so they're growing well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust.","Joseph Thompson","Hi, this is Joseph Thompson on the line for Tobey Sommer this evening. Digging in on the European business a bit, what have conversations with clients in the region looked like? And in your opinion, do these conversations and the macro data pretend a soft patch or more of a significant slowdown? Thank you.","Max Messmer","Well, soft patch versus more of a slowdown, I don't think anybody would disagree that our European staffing businesses have outperformed the industry for several quarters consecutively. While they're slowing from those levels, they're still solid. And so, would we prefer that they not be slowing? Of course, but they're still solid to the point. We're going to support them to the extent their growth supports that. So we feel very good about the progress and the performance that our European businesses have had for several quarters, particularly Germany, particularly Belgium, the UK, given its circumstances, I think you'd be pleasantly surprised if we broke those numbers out individually. So, our European operations have been stellar for several quarters relative to the market, but they're not totally immune from the market, and they're seeing some slowing.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Tim McHugh","I just want to follow-up on international, I guess, do you still think, I guess in 2Q at least, do you expect that to still grow faster than the US on the staffing part of the business, trying to understand the magnitude of the slowdown you're seeing there versus I guess what you said?","Keith Waddell","Well, so permanent placement is getting close already. Europe temp still has quite the margin over US temp, but they're converging. So we're within a quarter or two of them getting close. We just described more fully the conditions as we see them in Europe.","Tim McHugh","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I just wanted to put some numbers behind it. And then, I want to circle back to the comment you made, which the last couple of quarters, the volume essentially has been flattish, even slightly down. And I understand that the tight labor market, as people are moving jobs more often. I guess. But how unusual is that to you versus history? And do you think that's the norm? Is that just something we should expect at this point? Or, I guess, how do you view that metric and think about that more medium term.","Keith Waddell","And so given the low level of unemployment relative to history, it's not a surprise and it's consistent generally with what we've seen in the past. It takes longer to recruit fee eligible candidates. And once you get them on assignment, because many of them want full time employment, they find full time employment more quickly than they do at other points in the cycle, which means we are then obliged to backfill for them.","This quarter, as I spoke to earlier, at that same time, as clients have gotten more selective, it just puts more pressure on that. And to the extent client attrition is driving temp demand, they're more selective yet again when they're looking to replace full time, the attrition that they're seeing more of because of the tight labor market.","So it's a not a surprise that volumes are pressured as the labor market tightens, and that's very consistent with the past. And one could argue that the labor market has never been tighter than it is, as we speak. So that when you do have a fee eligible candidate and when you place them, you charge more for them. That's why our bill rates are accelerating into a range, more typical of what we see in a tight labor market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Ryan Leonard","Hi, this is Ryan Leonard for Manav. Just a question on Protiviti. You talked about, in the last call, how you were in the early innings of some of these hybrid offerings, but also, this quarter, it seems to be the biggest driver of growth. I guess, what inning are we in this kind of hybrid push? And I think you'd mentioned you're rolling it out to some cities last time, can you just help us maybe contextualize that offering over the longer term and you guys are obviously excited about it. So just curious what inning we're at and where that can go from here.","Keith Waddell","It is hard to ascribe in any number, it's certainly a one or a two or a three. It's nothing beyond that. But also understand that many of these projects are sold by people from our staffing divisions where we have more distribution, because of the number of locations and the number of people. When there's a client need for a temporary, there's often a root cause, which results in a project if you're thinking that way. And now with the capability to whistle Protiviti on the field with their subject matter experts, our staffing people are starting to think through, gee whiz, this order for one person is really symptomatic of a larger project opportunity. ","And therefore, Protiviti comes in and jointly, they handle it. So the point is, it's not like this is totally handled by a dedicated sales force that we're adding location by location by location, not at all. What it is, is educating our existing staff to be more mindful of project opportunities that they ultimately benefit from themselves because they participate in the project revenue to a greater extent than they would, had they just placed that one temporary on assignment.","Ryan Leonard","Got it. And then maybe, I guess, could you give some reasons why the clients are being a little bit more hesitant and just on the labor supply side, obviously, we're seeing unemployment rates, particularly in finance and accounting roles at pretty, pretty low levels. Can you just talk about maybe the candidate supply that you see today and how challenging that is?","Keith Waddell","I'd say we said our clients are more measured, a, because attrition is driving part of the demand. We also said there's macro uncertainty. We talked about various external factors you can look to. I think services PMI, which came out last week, you can read yourself, which also was reflective of that. On the supply side, supply has been tight for quite some time. We've made a lot of investments in technology, I think, more than any other area. The payback we're getting from our technology investments has been in the recruiting of candidates. ","Now, we use AI in our discovery of candidates, we use AI in our outreach to candidates, we use AI in our matching candidates to orders. So I believe we're getting the most with what we have, in large part, because of our technology investments, which have been significant. But that doesn't change that it's a tight labor market. And while on the one hand, we're trying to sell talent to a client, many clients are buying specific skills. And when you don't have those specific skills, you sell overall talent that can acquire those skills on the job and hints some friction.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.","Blake Johnson","This is Blake Johnson on for George Tong. You mentioned rising bill price spreads continue to drive gross margin expansion in the quarter. How are the dynamics in international labor markets affecting bill pay spreads in your non-US businesses, particularly Germany, Belgium and the UK?","Keith Waddell","So we clearly do not see the same rate of expansion non-US, which is correlated with the macro comments we made earlier. We are seeing some expansion, but not to the same degree we're seeing it in the US where we're seeing significant expansion. As I said before, in a labor short market, once you have a fee eligible candidate in hand, the market says, you should get paid for them, which we are.","Blake Johnson","Great. That's helpful. Can you give us some detail on the kind of economic environment your guidance is assuming? Are you assuming no change from the prior quarter, slower US growth, any improvement in Europe?","Keith Waddell","Well, we don't see a huge change in the trend line based on what we're talking and we're only talking guidance for one quarter. As we said, we\u2019re encouraged by our US temp start is better than our exit. We're, for practical, as it comes to reality as it relates to Europe. So we've continued those trends. So we hope we're being conservative. If you look at our guidance overall, notwithstanding two points of tougher comps, we're still going to grow five percentage points. ","But we have assumed that the trends for our US AT\/OT clients stay more measured and selective, but that our management resources, technology, permanent placement and Protiviti businesses, all continue to grow nicely in double digits that our margins, our operating margins actually expand on the staffing side 20 to 40 basis points, on the Protiviti side 10 to 30 basis points. Now, our tax rate for the second quarter jumps up to 28%, 28.5%. ","We lose some of the stock deductions you get in the first quarter because that's when our stock vest further. There are some expenses that become non-deductible with the new Tax Act, both of which give you a higher tax rate 20 to 28.5, which is up pretty significantly, at least sequentially and up 100 basis points versus a year ago. So when you put the package together, profitability actually improves year-on-year and sequentially. And growth notwithstanding tougher comps is mid singles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] filling in for Hamzah. You guys have talked a lot about the international business, but I was just curious if you can comment on, if you're seeing anything from a labor reform or regulatory perspective in the international market that could have any impact on the business.","Keith Waddell","There's nothing that moves the needle. I mean, there are some UK regulations being discussed that aren\u2019t -- certainly not final that could have an impact, but there's nothing that moves the needle, nothing overly dramatic to the point where it's on our radar screen in a major way.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you. And I guess, maybe you can comment on whether you're seeing any changes in the competitive environment in terms of the competition from non-traditional staffing companies, for example, like the online players, and do you see any changes in candidate behavior or preference outside of again, what you said, given the tight labor market, and how they\u2019ve been switching pretty quickly.","Keith Waddell","So, I'd say the competitive environment from non-traditional players, we don't think is having a significant impact. So, first of all, most of them are focused on permanent placement, rather than temp and consulting. And permanent placement is one of our strongest businesses, as we speak. And frankly, the biggest challenge there is what we call closing candidates, where you're trying to get a candidate to take the position in discussion rather than to hold out for yet a better position and as labor consultants because that's what our people do all day. They have a much better perspective on the market than any one person can have. And many times, it's that consulting our people do with candidates that gets them over the hump. And that activity that can happen with the online perm competitors. ","As far as impact on candidates, again, while there are platforms they can go to, they need to be convinced, they need to be nudged further with our clients, many of them are not household names. So part of what value our people add is they sell these non-household names, they sell those opportunities in ways that the client themselves couldn't do. So they add value there as well. So, we don't see an outflow of candidates to platforms having a major impact on supply and in fact, as I said earlier, if anything, we see our own technology initiatives, benefiting supply and frankly disproportionately so, at least to our traditional competitors, and we don't see much linkage to non-traditional competitors in that way.","Operator","Our next question is Seth Weber, RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","Keith, I just wanted to clarify your response to some of the Protiviti gross margin questions. Are you comfortable thinking that gross margin will be up year-over-year by the end of 2019? Is that what we -- is that what I heard or is it just a thing -- trends will just get better sequentially?","Keith Waddell","It's our hope that by the end of the year, they'll be up year-on-year. But it will take us some time to capture the additional costs that I talked about earlier, which is an annual thing. There are many ways they manage their gross margin, ones, what they call the shape of the pyramid, which is the ratio of higher level people to lower level people. That's something they manage, utilization or chargeability, how many hours is a person on an account versus not chargeable? They manage that. ","Further, do they choose a staffing contractor or did they choose one of their own staff that's already on the payroll. That's another way they manage their gross margin. So, there's a lot of levers there that they have to deal with their, they're quite astute in managing those levers and how they impact their gross margin. They're also very astute and they understand, they can look at year-on-year, sequential gross margin just like you and I do. And so the plan is by the end of the year, that year-on-year, they have higher gross margins.","Seth Weber","And then just maybe, on the tech business, the growth was really strong, again, double digits, like you said, the comps do get harder here. Do you think that that can continue to grow double digits here in the second and third quarters?","Keith Waddell","Well, I certainly hope so. Prudence says to me, I would probably give you a range of high singles to low doubles, just to hedge a bit. But the point is that business is strong, full stack cloud, cyber, digital transformation, Windows 10, machine learning, IT apps, IT ops. It's all pretty good and we're optimistic. But common sense says when you\u2019ve got the comps getting tougher by, let's see, 6 points, that's a big increase in comps. So it would seem to me prudent for a man to kind of consider that when he's doing his estimating.","Operator","Our last question is a follow-up from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Just a quick numbers question. Keith, you mentioned the tax rate guidance for the second quarter. Should that be the number we use for the rest of the year as well?","Keith Waddell","Oh, no, no, no. The rest of the year will come back down somewhat. And so, we're probably talking 26, 27 for the rest of the year.","Max Messmer","Thank you. That was our last question. We appreciate you joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.
