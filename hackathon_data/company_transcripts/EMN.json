Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. This call is also being broadcast live on Eastman's website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over, for opening remarks and introductions to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Companies Investor Relations. Greg, please go ahead.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thank you, Debbie, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Fernando Subijana, Manager of Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 2 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual results could differ materially from our plans and expectations. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's second quarter 2012 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the form 10-K filed for full year 2011 and the form 10-Q to be filed for second quarter 2012.","Second, except where otherwise indicated, Eastman financial measures referenced in this presentation are non-GAAP financial measures, such as earnings per share and operating earnings that exclude Solutia acquisition, financing transaction integration costs and the second quarter 2011 gain from the sale of a previously impaired asset. In addition, Solutia earnings are presented as","adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization and certain items that affect comparability and noncash stock compensation expense.","A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures, including a description of the Solutia acquisition transaction financing integration costs, the gain from the sale of a previously impaired asset and Solutia-adjusted EBITDA, are available in our second quarter financial results news release and the tables accompanying the news release available on our website, eastman.com.","Lastly, we have posted slides that accompany our remarks for this morning's presentation on our website in the Presentations and Events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm told we got a record number of people on the phone this morning, so thanks for joining us. That could be because we're doing it on a Tuesday, but more likely, it's because we have a little bit more to talk about with not only our heritage business, but also the Solutia business.","So let me start on Slide 3. As is my normal practice, I'll start by reviewing our key outlook statements. First, when we announced the Solutia acquisition back in January, we indicated we expected to close the transaction midyear 2012. And thanks to a lot of hard work, we were able to meet that timeline closing on July 2, and we're very happy to have Solutia as part of Eastman. Obviously, I'll talk more about Solutia second quarter results in a few minutes, and then Curt will talk about our progress on integration and synergies in his section.","Next, back in April, we indicated we expected our full year EPS to be approximately $5.30 in 2012, and we are still on track for that target. And I'd remind you that this would be 10% earnings growth. And lastly, we indicated we expected to generate $1 billion of free cash over the next 2 years. And again, we're on track to deliver on that commitment.  Given all the portfolio work we've done over the last several years, including the acquisition of Solutia, we now have a portfolio of businesses that we expect will generate solid, consistent earnings growth and cash generation for years to come.","On Slide 4, I'll cover Eastman corporate results. Sales revenue declined 2%, driven mostly by the Specialty Plastics and Fibers segments. Operating earnings increased, with particular strength in the CASPI and PCI segments. Second quarter EPS was $1.40, slightly below second quarter 2011 EPS. And I'd remind you that last year's second quarter EPS was a record for any quarter. And second quarter 2012 is the second-highest EPS we've ever reported.","We also had a higher tax rate year-over-year, up about 300 basis points, primarily due to the mix of earnings being more domestic. And overall, our heritage Eastman businesses continue to deliver strong results despite an uncertain global economic environment.","Before I give some color on the heritage Eastman segments, beginning on Slide 5 with CASPI, I'll remind you that second quarter will be the last time we report on this basis. When we announced the close of the Solutia transaction, we also announced the new organizational structure with 5 segments, and we will report on that basis beginning with the third quarter.","With that said, sales revenue for CASPI was pretty stable year-over-year, down 1%. Operating earnings increased to a quarterly record of $114 million, up $10 million year-over-year and $16 million sequentially. They were able to increase spread, primarily in solvents, as the decline in raw material and energy costs was only partially offset by lower selling prices, which were down 1%. And we continue to expect the underlying CASPI business to deliver strong results in 2012, albeit with some seasonal decline in demand.","Fibers is next on Slide 6. Revenue was down 4% year-over-year, with a big driver being an unfavorable shift in product mix. Operating earnings were down slightly year-over-year. But as you know, operating earnings for the fiber segment can move around quarter-to-quarter based on customer buying patterns. What is more important is the annual earnings growth we've been able to deliver, and we continue to expect that fibers will report a very strong year, increasing earnings for the ninth year in a row.","PCI is on Slide 7. Sales revenue was unchanged, but there were a few moving parts. Volume increased 4%, and a favorable shift in product mix helped revenue by 2%, both due to higher acetyl sales in the U.S. and the impact of the Sterling and Scandiflex acquisitions, both of which closed in third quarter last year.","Selling prices declined primarily in the olefin derivative product lines due to lower raw material and energy cost. Operating earnings increased both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to lower raw material and energy cost and the benefit of producing versus purchasing olefin. We currently expect olefin frac-ing spreads will be favorable in 2012 compared with 2011 due to both the continued benefit of propane to propylene spread and improvement in ethylene spreads. These spreads are expected to narrow somewhat in third quarter, but PCI's businesses should have a strong second half of the year.","On Slide 8 is Specialty Plastics. Sales revenue year-over-year was down 6%, primarily due to lower sales volume.  That was partially offset by a favorable shift in product mix and higher selling prices. The volume decline was mainly in the U.S. and Europe and was for copolyester products going into the consumer and durable goods markets. Sequentially, volume was about flat. Of course, volume in the first half of 2011 was very strong, and we expect the year-over-year comparisons will be a little easier the second half of the year. The favorable shift in mix was primarily due to higher sales of cellulose esters into the LCD market, where we saw some acceleration in the second quarter from fairly low levels in the first quarter.","Operating earnings were down $4 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower sales volume and resulting lower capacity utilization. Sequentially, operating earnings increased $8 million due to the higher sales into the LCD market and lower raw material costs, particularly for paraxylene, which was down slightly from first quarter. Looking at the year, we expect normal seasonality in the second half of the year but continue to expect Specialty Plastics business to have a solid year.","Next up on Slide 9 is the summary of Solutia's second quarter results. As a reminder, Solutia earnings are not included in our second quarter results since the acquisition closed on July 2, but we thought it obviously made sense to provide you with some color on their performance.","Sales revenue declined by 4% year-over-year. This was driven by the exchange rate effect of the strengthening dollar, primarily versus the euro. Volume overall also declined slightly, with an increase in both the Technical Specialties and Performance Film segments, more than offset by decline in the Advanced Interlayers segments, which includes photovoltaics.","Adjusted EBITDA declined to $115 million from $141 million in the year ago quarter. Most of the EBITDA decline was in the Advanced Interlayers businesses, and there were 3 primary factors. First, lower sales volume for the Saflex product lines in Europe, and this was for both the architectural and the auto market.  Second, lower sales volume and margins for the photovoltaic encapsulants product lines. And third, cost associated with growth initiatives, particularly for Saflex and Crystex.","Curt will talk more in his comments about the favorable financing we obtained for the transaction, the progress we are making on integration and achieving the cost synergies we have targeted and the very strong cash flow we're expecting over the next 2 years.","Turning now to our outlook on Slide 10. There continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the global economy. Our view is that Europe is near at a recessionary level, but we are not anticipating things to get worse. In Asia Pacific, and particularly in China, growth has slowed, but we don't see signs of further weakening there, either. And the U.S. remained solid, and we expect that will continue.","Factoring in our strong first half earnings, our expectations from normal seasonality in the second half of the year and our expectation of raw material and energy cost will continue to be less volatile than in past years. We expect to generate earnings growth in 2012 compared with 2011. This earnings growth is driven primarily by 2 factors: solid performance of our heritage Eastman businesses, which continue to deliver strong earnings; and earnings in the second half from the Solutia businesses.","One other factor is the higher tax rate, which, as I mentioned earlier, was up in the second quarter. We expect this will continue in the second half of the year, and the corporate rate for the remainder of the year will be approximately 34%. And I remind you that we continue to work through purchase accounting related to the Solutia acquisition. Considering all of these factors, we continue to expect 2012 earnings per share of approximately $5.30, which would be an increase of about 10% compared to 2011 and would be our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.","Now I started a practice of having a 1-minute CEO spotlight. And this time, you'll see it on Page 11, Slide 11, where I wanted to talk about the new joint venture that we're just announcing. And as I do this, I want to compliment the CASPI team for all the work not only for putting up the quarter they put up, but, at the same time, nailing this one down. And just kudos all around for an excellent 90 days.","I'll conclude my comments, then, on Slide 11 by announcing the joint venture with YPC to build a world-scale hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins plant. Let me remind you that we have a successful JV with our partner, YPC, that has been producing hydrogenated resin since 2001. This new plant at 50,000 net tons will be much larger than the existing Chinese facility.","As you can see in the chart, Eastman has been aggressively expanding its presence in this growing market. We estimate that the global market is growing at 7% on a compound annual basis. And this explains why although we have been continually adding capacity, we've been on allocation for most of the last several years. Market growth has been fueled by hygiene adhesives, with disposable diapers being the most important driver. Overall, diaper consumption is only 20% to 25% of potential demand, with high penetration in developed countries, but very low penetration in the rest of the world. Additionally, new, more sophisticated diapers require increased quantities of hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin.","Another growing application is hot-melt packaging adhesives. New formulations enabled by our resins are replacing more traditional adhesives as they reduce downtime and production lines, which, therefore, increases throughput.","As a summary, the capacity that we will be bringing to the market represents 2 years of market growth and will be located in the region of the world that we expect will experience the highest part of that growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our solid cash performance in the second quarter, as highlighted on Slide 13. Cash from operations was $316 million. This is driven by continued strong net earnings. Working capital was up slightly in the quarter and is about flat for the first half of the year. Free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $194 million. Capital expenditures were $87 million, and I'll talk more about our full year expectations for capital expenditures in a few minutes.","And, of course, we paid our dividend in the quarter, which was $35 million. This solid performance keeps us on track to meet our previous free cash flow expectations for the year for heritage Eastman.","Next, on Slide 14, I'll review the financing for the Solutia transaction. As you can see from the table, we were able to obtain very attractive financing for that acquisition. The notes were significantly oversubscribed, and we ended up increasing the allocation of the 30-year notes from originally $300 million to $500 million. The weighted average interest rate of 2.8% is better than our previous expectations.","Going forward with this new financing, we now have an annualized interest rate cost approaching $190 million for the company, including amortization of some pre-issuance interest rate hedges. And this level of interest cost will decline as we delever over the coming months.","Overall, we were very pleased with the financing for the transaction, and I want to congratulate our treasury team and their partners in achieving such a great outcome.","Next are some comments regarding integration on Slide 15. Even though the acquisition closed on July 2, we began planning our integration efforts shortly after the deal was announced. We have a number of cross-functional teams leading the integration effort, and they are doing an outstanding job. One of our key priorities is retaining key talent from the acquisition, and we have been successful there to date. The feedback from our employees on the acquisition has been very positive, and the professionalism exhibited by everyone I've encountered at Solutia sites has been outstanding.","As Jim mentioned earlier, we do have a new operating structure with 5 segments. We have been under way since close to implement this new structure, aligning activities with the new business responsibilities, and, importantly, everyone's remaining focused on serving our customers.","We also have a good start on merging the capabilities of the functions of the 2 companies in the areas like finance, HR, IT, supply chain, et cetera. And lastly, we also have received positive feedback from customers and suppliers that the transition post-closing has gone well. While still early, we're off to a very good start on our integration efforts.","Thus, we remain committed to the cost, tax and revenue synergies we announced back in January, as listed here on Slide 16. Starting with cost. We have identified cost synergies of approximately $100 million and are now developing specific implementation plans. These include reducing corporate costs, which you would expect with 2 public companies. About 1\/3 of these cost synergies were day 1 synergies that we had targeted, and we've already achieved those synergies, and we'll see the benefit of those in the second half of this year. We also see potential synergies in the purchase of raw materials and working -- we are working through different options and opportunities there. And we expect this combination will result in improved manufacturing and supply chain processes across all of our businesses. We remain highly confident that we will achieve a $100 million run rate of cost synergies by the end of 2013.","Moving next to tax synergies. These remain a source of value for the acquisition. Solutia has approximately $1.3 billion of NOLs that we can utilize over the next 15 years, of which 1\/2 will be utilized on the next 3 years on an accelerating basis. There are also foreign tax credits well in excess of $150 million that can be utilized over the next 10 years. And the combination of Solutia's geographical profile and efficient tax planning should still enable us to reduce our corporate tax rate to approximately 31%.","On the revenue synergy front, we have been working closely with our businesses since close, and we continue to have the confidence that these are real, but will take some time to realize. We also believe Eastman will bring strong commercial capabilities to supplement the existing Solutia businesses which will improve overall profitability in the medium and long term. In sum, we are on track to achieve the targeted synergies in each of these areas.","Let's turn to Slide 17 and talk about capital allocation. At first, I'd like you to point to the bottom of the page in the banner listed there. We are on track to meet or exceed our target of $1 billion of free cash flow over the next 2 years. And you can expect we'll remain balanced in allocating that free cash flow with a bias towards deleveraging over the next 18 months. While we do so, you can also expect we'll continue to pursue value-creating growth. On capital expenditures, the combined Eastman and Solutia capital expenditures for 2012 should be approximately $500 million, with $400 million for heritage Eastman and about $100 million for the Solutia businesses in the second half of the year. On debt, I already mentioned that we issued $2.4 billion of public debt and the new $1.2 billion term loan.","On joint ventures and acquisitions, besides the new Regalite joint venture that Jim just discussed, we are also on schedule for our joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation for 30,000 tonne -- met tonne acetate tow capacity, which is scheduled to be online mid-2013.","On the dividend, it continues to be reasonable for investors to expect that as we continue to grow earnings that the dividend would grow also. And of course, that will be a discussion we have with our board.","And as we achieve an acceptable level of deleveraging, share repurchases will be considered as part of our capital allocation choices, just as we've done in the past prior to Solutia acquisition. The main message here is that we are on track to deliver very strong cash over the next several years and beyond, and we will be disciplined in our capital allocation choices.","Finally, turning to Slide 18, I'd like to invite you to join us at our 2012 Investor Day in New York, scheduled for the afternoon of November 5. We're again holding the event at the Sentry Center in New York City. This meeting is a great opportunity to share with you our vision and our growth plans, showcase the depth of our product lines and our product innovations and give you a chance to interact with senior leaders of Eastman.","I'll look forward to seeing you there, and with that, I'll turn it back over to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks, Curt, and this concludes our prepared remarks. Debbie, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And we'll take our first question today from Dave Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just on the Solutia businesses, can you comment on, perhaps, second half expectations?  If you did 241 of EBITDA in the first half, what would you expect their EBITDA to be in the back half of the year?","James P. Rogers","First of all, I just want to say what a little smart aleck you are for your head -- for your title on your alert, \"guidance reaffirmed corrected.\"  I'm teasing you, because I felt a little funny about that. I'll get to your question on Solutia, but I felt a little funny about that, because we did beat, and then here we are, we didn't raise our guidance. And I know that goes through people's minds.  And you're kind of getting to it, asking about Solutia's second half. And obviously, we're just getting to know these businesses, getting to see the decisions they've made recently, let me put it that way. I would guess the second half will look something like the first half, maybe even a little lighter than the first half. We'll -- just talking from an EBITDA perspective. But I don't have a lot of surety around exactly what those numbers are going to be. That's why we kind of kept it at $5.30. We can see our businesses are performing quite well, quite strong. We can see the option as we got inside Solutia, how quickly we can get in there and make things happen, we'll see. But I'm guessing second half, if we use roughly the first half, that's probably not bad.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And Jim, just on the propane propylene benefit in Q2, can you comment on that? And you mentioned it will be a little bit narrower in Q3 and Q4 as well?","James P. Rogers","Yes. I mean -- but it's going to be a great year for the spread. I talked about how I wanted to kind of get away from talking about that. We even sized it for you 1 year just so you could see that it wasn't all that huge for us. And yet it feels really good when it's going our way, I got to tell you. It is a nice wind at our back, so the spread's going to be there. Again, the one thing as people think about spread and they look at some of the other names, one of the things they got to remember is the way we go to market. And we're really just exploding through to derivatives, and we're trying to be more stable for our customers in terms of pricing. So we're not always getting every last penny when the raws go up, and the flip side, we don't always give it back. And so partly what you see, great quarter this quarter, where that lag was probably working for us. Margins come in a little bit over the next couple of quarters when maybe the lag's working against us. But we've got a little bit different strategy than some of the guys who were a little uptight from us, you might say.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, any restocking, destocking trends you can call out in the businesses in June and\/or July?","James P. Rogers","That's a good question. I didn't really see anything that caught my attention. Curt looked at the orders. I guess the orders were staying fairly strong when we looked at our order book before the conference call. But that's thinking more of the heritage Eastman businesses.  But I didn't really hear a lot of comments on customer destocking, restocking...","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. David, when we look at -- you've heard us talk about or looking at our order books 3 weeks and 8 weeks out. Generally speaking, those trends remained to be pretty solid.  Probably the only exception where we saw some weakness was some packaging and durable goods in Asia in our Specialty Plastics business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, your pricing in PCI was a little weak with -- and that's understandable, given lower propylene prices. The recent oxo contract settled down 10%. So it just seems that this pricing weakness is likely to persist in second half. So wanted to get your comments on that, and what can you do to offset some of this weakness?","James P. Rogers","Greg is trying to get my attention.  So you've got some color you want to...","Gregory A. Riddle","Well, no, I mean, I agree. It was down 5%, and that's very much reflective of the lower propylene prices. And as we just talked about, in terms of lag, sometimes it takes a little while for the pricing to catch up with the lower raws, and so you might see some of that in the second half of the year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the second question was on, again, a little bit to follow up on propane to propylene. You could have a situation where propylene is a bit weak, but as we approach winter, propylene could go up, especially given that you've got new propane export terminals starting up. So given that, what's your outlook in second half and beyond?","James P. Rogers","I don't -- it seems like you're asking the same thing to try and get a different answer, different ways. I mean, you're right. The winter can move propane around some. We do typically do some hedging in the wintertime to try and shield you guys from that, to a certain extent, so you don't have to talk that much about it. I would say, overall, the markets have not done a fantastic job of calling where propane propylene spread's going to go. I remember last year, with some trepidation, we talked about how this -- we ought to have a little bit of a tailwind at our back, and it's probably a pretty decent tailwind at our back this year. But you're right, no one can predict what the winter's going to do, so that could move your raw material. I'd just, once again, remind people that our pricing strategy on the derivatives really doesn't just track 1x the propane ethane. And I guess the only other color I'd give you, P.J., is, obviously, it's the ethylene side that is quite beneficial when I look at year-over-year comparisons, propane to propylene, fairly similar as we think about what the year's going to look like. But the ethylene is the one that's outperforming.  And you know we keep half of that internally and sell half.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, you're expanding Regalite capacity so often, it's becoming a challenge to keep up with the various projects you're in. So with regard to your latest joint venture here with YPC in China, maybe can you just talk a little bit about the relationship with YPC? What the size of the Regalite business is today, to the extent that you can comment on that, as well as margins? And do you expect this level of growth to continue over the intermediate term? Just a little bit more color around this hydrogenated hydrocarbon business will be helpful.","James P. Rogers","Yes. I mean it's one of the bright spots. And when we lay out how we're reorganizing the company and our reporting segments, you're going to have more of a -- you're going to have more visibility into this business, because it's the adhesives piece that's going to be with the plasticizer piece. And you're going to see a couple of really strong growers with decent earnings, decent double-digit earnings. So overall, one of the bright spots deserves the capital, some of the better returns when you line up all your capital projects. A relationship with YPC is exactly what would you -- what you would want. You'd want a partner like a Sinopec partner.  You'd want to be in China. The other part you didn't ask but that deserves some credit, we got fantastic relationships with the multinational global customers here, very strong. I mean, it's with them that we're comfortable. It's our relationship with them that gets us the comfort to go ahead and do this expansion because we can see where the product's going to go that comes out of this plant. We know the -- basically, know the names for who's going to be taking this product, who wants this product, because this market's been so tight. So I mean, I could go on and on, on this segment. I don't want to size it for you. You can probably get an indication of size when you look at some of the expansions that were done. I mean, this is more than just a Regalite that's in there. Do we talk about the revenue for this -- for Regalite specifically? I don't think we ever have, but good growing business, significant. You're going to see more of it when it's put together with the plasticizer business.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is it safe to say this is a premium-margin business for you?","James P. Rogers","Oh, yes. The hydrogenated hydrocarbons is the good stuff.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, okay. Then second question, Jim, I understand you're hard at work extracting the various synergies. But to the extent that the external environment today is presumably weaker than what everyone would've thought several quarters ago, are there additional levers that you can pull in terms of cost extraction, restructuring initiatives, either on the legacy Eastman side or on the legacy Solutia side? And I guess, similar question for CapEx in terms of cash maximization.  How are you thinking about that in terms of contingency planning?","James P. Rogers","The answer is yes. Most smart management teams won't talk exactly about all the different levers that they could pull. You're right that the economic environment is not quite as good as we'd want them. But let's face it, Europe's pretty much in recession right now, or at least the bulk of Europe is in recession. And so the way I'm looking at it, I'm seeing what Solutia looks like when one of its major market segments is in recession. And if I think about it, as we head to being more diversified, as we are, so we're not as quite as dependent on North America and get diversified by geographies and by markets, there's always going to be something that's a headwind. There's always going to be something that's a tailwind. I happen to think that's one of the strengths of Eastman right now, that as you look across the company, there's -- we can talk positively about the frac-ing spreads but then kind of moan together about what Europe looks like. Long term, I think this is going to steady out our earnings and help us continue that double-digit earnings growth. When I look within Solutia and think about the synergies, I feel really good about the $100 million. In fact, if you'll let me, just a little back of the envelope, the way I think about this sometimes, if you think about interest expense we've picked up being about $100 million a year and the synergies we're going after being about $100 million a year and then if you get aggressive on your synergy targets over time, and say, maybe we can get a little more out of that and say, \"Well, I issued some extra shares.  What's the dividend carry on those extra shares I issued?\" you could get to the point with time that your synergies were basically covering your carrying costs of the data buying this thing. So therefore, what you got left is the cash flows off of the business less the CapEx that pay off your debt. And again, because of the environment, yes, negative economically but strong financial market-wise, this one's going to look really good. I can look inside the businesses and see that some of the stuff, some of the decisions they've had to make, which, admittedly, have had more of a short-term focus, they've been more restrained in terms of coming out of bankruptcy, I can just see things already that we're going to do differently as we focus on a balance between short- and midterm, say, results. And very confident that you're going to see what these businesses can really do. It will take us a couple of quarters here for a lot of that to kick in. I agree with Curt. I think it's -- the timing will be through '13 that we'll be able to capture these synergies. I'm sure we'll be looking at $100 million as a floor and saying, \"We've got to do better than that.\"  In terms of other levers, let's be honest. They've pulled a few levers back in the last recession and did some things. I don't see anything as dramatic as they did 3 or 4 years ago for us. I think we're going to be able to focus much more on the opportunities, how we can help them in product development, how we can help them in manufacturing, how we're going to accelerate some of the stuff they wanted to get done, capture the value earlier. But having said that, I think we got a bit of a track record, and I think we should get credit for knowing how to handle ourselves in various different economic environments. And when we say we're going to do 5 30 this year and next year is going to have a 6 in front of it, we're going to be taking the actions necessary to make that happen.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Edlain Rodriguez with Lazard Capital Markets.","Edlain S. Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just one quick question on CASPI [indiscernible], Jim. Back in April, you had mentioned how on all of CASPI's business lines were up within at high levels with many products now being sold out. How has that changed since then?  And how do you see the domain data mix for the second half of the year?","James P. Rogers","Well, I wish I could go ahead and do this quarter over and over and over again. That would be pretty cool. I don't remember saying there was a lot sold out. I know, in particular, we were talking about the resins business being on allocation and quite tight. On some of their other businesses, particularly their polymer, some of the really high-margin stuff, maybe stuff that we're the only ones in the world who make it, we never let the utilization rate get too high without debottlenecking that in some capacity. So it's rare that on the -- I was using the phrase, really good stuff -- the really good stuff, the stuff that we're the only ones who make, it's rare that we would ever get into a sold-out situation.  We just don't want to ever do that to our customers. So we got the juice left to meet it. I think the issue probably comes down more to the demand we see around the globe in the different end markets. And guys, it's tough out there. One of the things I'm proud of is that we were able to deliver these results the way the world looks right now. I mean, Europe is a mess. And then you can go kind of market by market, whether it's building and construction, particularly durable goods, things like that. It's quite soft out there, so we'll see how CASPI does. I mean, I think last time we gave guidance for the full year, we thought they'd be around 3 80 or so. And I think they're going to do better than that, obviously, with what they've got under the belt already. But we'll just have to -- we'll have to see how they do. But I'm not worried about capacity or our market share, things like that. If anything, it's just more that end market demand in places like Europe.","Edlain S. Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, makes sense. All right, one quick question like longer term, like in terms of acquisitions. I mean now that you have Solutia, like, do you feel that the portfolio is complete now?  Or do you still think that there's some more room for more additional bolt-on acquisitions in the Eastman legacy businesses? And where do you see there's a need for that?","James P. Rogers","Okay. we'll start with our mandate. Our #1 mandate is to grow the value of the company, and particularly, grow the earnings of the company, so we're going to do that on 2 legs. And of course, there's always the organic growth. You're asking about the inorganic piece. We just took a really big step with Solutia. We deserve a little bit of time to get it under our belt. I wanted to echo, by the way, Curt's comments. The employees of Solutia have just been fantastic. I think they're pretty upbeat about being part of a larger chemical company. We're not meeting any resistance when it comes to getting synergies and getting things done. In fact, there's a lot of excitement about how we can grow these businesses together. Part of that excitement comes from -- that we'll have the ability to do bolt-ons in their existing businesses if we see the opportunity, but also in the core businesses. And having said that, we got the opportunity. We'll have the financial strength to do that. Of course, top priority for cash is paying down debt here in the near term. But then the issue is, is there really much in the way of bolt-ons out there?  And that's kind of where you were coming from. We'll just have to see. I mean I was -- I got to tell you, I was a little disappointed we didn't see more bolt-ons in the 2010, 2011 timeframe. We did a few in the plasticizer world. There may be some more out there, but we take such a disciplined approach in terms of what we're willing to pay and does it drive us in the direction we want to go. But I don't want to pull up a lot of hopes for there's going to be a lot more bolt-ons or something coming. If it makes sense, we'll do it, but I'm not sure how many there are in the core businesses.","Operator","We'll go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the Solutia part itself, I guess, one, it wasn't under your control, but how did that 1 15 number kind of come in relative to your expectations for the business sitting from the outside? And then when you think about moving from a nearer-term view that the Solutia management had to kind of your medium- to longer-term view, does that really mean that margins are going to come down as we're going to have to put some more SG&A, R&D through these businesses to get them to grow more over time?","James P. Rogers","Yes, let me start there. That's not the signal I was trying to send. Let me start with the beginning of your question, the 1 15. Yes, that was a disappointment, no doubt about it. I was hoping that they would do a little better. I can understand that 3 months before your company gets sold that you might not expect crackerjack results. I know that they had some things that I might think of as more onetime, or at least, I hope they're onetime, like some bad debts adding to environmental reserves, things like that.","But still, it was a disappointment. It was mainly around Europe. It was mainly Saflex in the photovoltaic business. And I think we know how to help both of those businesses. When I talk about short term versus medium term, it doesn't necessarily mean spending more money. A lot of this has to do with how you approach the market and some of the decisions you make in terms of your contracting, your pricing, either relationships you build with your customers, et cetera. So maybe you're not just going quarter-to-quarter maximizing earnings.  Maybe what you're trying to do was think a little bit longer term with your key customers and take a longer-term approach to value capture out of the marketplace. So I think I said it before, I see opportunities for things we will do differently. And I'm guessing that you won't be able to see much of that through the rest of this year, that '13 will be a year of transition. And when we get to 2014, you're really going to like the way these businesses look.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then shifting to Specialty Plastics, a little smaller business. But copolyesters was taking some pretty good market share, so for volumes to be down that significantly was a surprise to me. Do you think there was an inventory effect there? Can you talk a little bit about -- more about the market share you're taking with copolyesters and what's happening with volumes there?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I can. I mean -- and maybe Curt wants to add some color, because I feel like I'm doing all the talking here. But I can tell you the place I see that got hit was really the durables. And Mark Costa's given me the example yesterday about, Jim, when the economy's tough, people just aren't out buying new blenders and new durable goods that might have our copoly unit. You saw a nice pickup in the CT, cellulose triacetate, that goes into the displays in flat screens. That really helped Asia and helped that business sequentially. But I would say they're very much exposed to the durable goods part of it. They've got a lot of work under way to move their mix to things more like medical, et cetera, but that takes time. I'd say on the Tritan line, the second line we brought up, we filled that first one out really fast. I'd say we got kind of spoiled on that one. Tritan, when you think about the markets it's going into, it's fighting the same kind of durable goods battle right now, so that was flat. And it's probably going to take us a little longer to fill that second line now, but that doesn't shake my confidence. I can see the value proposition. I know we've got a good product. I know we'll take share from some of the competing materials. I don't know if there's anything...","Curtis E. Espeland","The thing I might add is that some of their businesses are more economically sensitive than others. The great thing about that, we've made the investment. We have the capacity so when those end markets come back, this business is well positioned to improve its performance.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate your comment about you deserve maybe credit for some stuff that you guys have done over time. But I guess when I look at your margin structure, it sort of says specialty. But when I look at your multiple, it screams commodity. And maybe this is a function of your historic legacy in polyethylene and PET. But I'm just curious, what can you guys do or how do you think you get to a reasonable shareholder investor regard for your portfolio when it seems stuck sort of in the history?","James P. Rogers","I very much appreciate the question. It's one that, quite often, we ask people on your side of the desk. Look, we all know multiples are sticky. We know there's lots of CEO's out there who try and jawbone them up, et cetera. I never thought that really has any kind of lasting impact. I do think it -- a lot depends on how we talk about ourselves and think of ourselves and how we represent our businesses. So just to be very open, talking about things like volume doesn't sound as much like a specialty business as just talking about end markets and growth in end markets. And as we roll these businesses together and we get our new segments, I think it's going to be clearer to people just the results of all the work that's been done and what we see as our prospects for growth in our margins. So I always have a hard time if someone says specialty versus commodity. And then you say, \"Well, define specialty,\" and then you get 5 or 6 different answers. But to us, what we're driving, and I think people are going to have to eventually recognize, is we're driving year-over-year earnings growth. And we're doing it whichever way is the most efficient and makes the most sense. We have a great financing market. We saw an opportunity with Solutia to pick up some quality businesses and put it into a portfolio of other businesses that have strong cash flows. So you really don't have to leave opportunities on the table, like maybe you do if you come out of bankruptcy and were pretty inhibited in your cash flows. And I think it's just a matter of time. But how quickly the market gets there, I'm not sure.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can I ask you on your portfolio, in the quarter, you had a 1% price decline, which was clearly far better than a lot of commodity companies. But it was still a decline. You mentioned you're trying not to price your products on sort of a cost basis. So for a typical Eastman product, how often do you reset pricing, and how do those contracts look?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I mean as much as I'd love to say, it's just all specialty, part of that is the fact that the raws came up. We actually expanded spreads in the company overall when I look at just price versus raw materials and energy, it actually expanded a little bit. But much of our markets, much of our businesses, the pricing is more quarterly, annual in some places, like fibers. Probably the correct way to do it is to have pricing formulas that are more monthly, frankly, monthly to quarterly. But again, it just depends on the product.  So that would be true for the more heritage, commodity-like stuff for the more specialty stuff that's priced off of value proposition, some of the stuff in CASPI, for example, will just get repriced once a year. Fibers is once a year. Some of the Solutia businesses are just once a year. So we'll try and hit the right mix, the right blend working with our customers and what works for them.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One of the themes of Eastman since you announced the Solutia transaction has been your tax savings. And yet, in the second half, you now think that the tax rate will be 34%. So did you run into obstacles that are keeping you from using some of the NOLs or some of the tax strategies that you thought you could employ?","James P. Rogers","I'll let Curt take this one.","Curtis E. Espeland","Jeff, no, the answer to that is no. What you're seeing right now is just simply the effect of a more predominant earnings mix of U.S. versus outside the U.S. We think, over time, that will correct itself. As it relates to implementing tax planning or tax efficiency structures, we're in the process of doing that today. A lot of that will be put in place the end of third quarter, some going into fourth quarter. So we do believe we'll see the benefit of tax structure. And so we will get to those benefits. And if you get some reasonable return to the mix of domestic and foreign earnings, that's what gives us comfort to get to that 31% rate. On the usage of the NOL, we're still highly confident to use that. You saw in our S-4, we thought that number's going to be about $675 million. We still feel good about that number.  Maybe it will be even a little bit better.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I don't think that you expected that your tax rate would be that high for the second quarter. And I think about the conditions under which you bought Solutia, and that was a world in which ethylene prices were $0.55 a pound. Then order of magnitude, they dropped into the high 30s, now they're in the low 40s. So presumably, the raw material synergies that you expected from Solutia really should be much larger than what you originally expected. So are you getting more -- because you must have higher pretax income with this higher tax rate. So are you getting more raw material synergies that you forecast in the second half that's offset by a higher tax rate?","James P. Rogers","Let me start of, then Curt may want to add. But again, the tax rate had more to do with where the earnings are. And as you know, the way most companies get that lower tax rate is by having more overseas earnings and lower tax jurisdictions. When I think about raw material synergies, it's not what price ethylene is at any one point in time. It's what we're going to be able to do within our supply chain in terms of buying their raw materials, et cetera, or the swaps that we'll do with other companies. So I don't know, Curt, do you want to...","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, Jeff, if you're talking about 2 aspects of your question. I think, first of all, as it relates to the tax rate, yes, that tax rate is higher than we'd probably envisioned back in January. So if you think about just kind of our expectations at that time, what you're seeing is Eastman's businesses are probably doing a little bit better. Solutia's business is doing a little bit worse. But then offsetting some of that tax rate impact is the better financing that we had in place. As it relates to the $100 million of cost synergies, we have assumed some modest improvement in raw material savings and logistics savings. I think a year or so from now, we're going to -- when we talk about and report on about how we did against those synergies, I think we'll do better than that, particularly in the raw material side.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, in the last conference call, you talked about, I think in 2015, being able to buy 300 million pounds of propylene, or, effectively, something like that from PDH producer. I guess now it's clear that that's enterprise. So when you did that deal, do you have to pay an upfront fee that gives you cost economics? And if you do, is it $100 million or $50 million or -- if you don't, why is it rational for them to just give you manufacturing economics in propylene?","James P. Rogers","Yes, actually, Jeff, there's no upfront fee. And in fact, there's a contract that gives us propylene even sooner than the plant being finished that's also advantaged. So we'll get some benefiting before the plant comes online. Why does it makes sense for them? Because they have the surety of a nice credit like Eastman taking a big chunk of their offtake, and they build up the plant. I mean, they really could accept a lower return. It's really a good return, by the way, but they could accept a lower return because they have such a low-risk project. At least, that's the way I would analyze their side of the table.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I noted that you said that you guys had the second-highest quarter this past quarter. So that would give you the silver medal, but we're all expecting gold here. Can we see gold-medal performance in the third quarter?","James P. Rogers","That's going to be tough. That's going to be tough. My guess, we're not really giving quarter-by-quarter guidance, but if you were a betting man, you would say it's going to look similar to the second quarter. Now realize, we didn't go into it a lot. There's going to be a lot of noise and confusion, because when you buy a company, you write all their inventories up to market, and there's all that kind of stuff we're going to have to guide you through. But assuming that the world kind of holds together here, you're probably going to have a similar -- speaking just of the heritage businesses, a similar kind of quarter.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","But my guess is, then, there is some level of accretion that comes at Solutia. So I mean you're really only -- you're guiding to an average of 1 34 per quarter the next 2 quarters, is what you're guiding to with that 5 30 number.","James P. Rogers","And realize some of the headwinds here, though. I mean you just -- Curt was talking about one with Jeff on the tax rate being a headwind. The Solutia businesses are underperforming where we hope they'd be this year.  Not worried because we think we see that what we can do with those businesses, and there's still fantastic value in the long term there with those businesses. The interest expense came in a little better than what we thought. I mean, we've got this mix of headwinds, tailwinds, and we're just trying to give you the straight-up that it's looking like 5 30. I mean, as one of the reports said, maybe I had a little bit of a cushion the last time we said 5 30. It's -- we got to do a little more work to hit it this time.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, let's take a look at Solutia. You said -- I think you say you know how to help those businesses. So you said Saflex in Europe was obviously difficult. Global auto builds are pretty good. So globally, I would anticipate Saflex is doing fine as a product, but obviously in Europe, it's suffering. But you're getting growth in the U.S., you're getting growth in Asia. So then that begs the question, photovoltaics. What's your game plan on that business?","James P. Rogers","Just on Saflex, first of all, Europe's an important market for them, so they -- hopefully, they've talked about that before. But it is their more profitable market. So $1 of sales in Europe is not the same as $1 of sales in Asia. And so that's -- so it hurts when Europe's down. You think about the automakers in Europe, et cetera, I don't see that being a long-term trend. We see that coming back. And in terms of photovoltaic, what can I tell you? We didn't think we paid a lot for it as we value the company. I think we've said that before. They are definitely under pressure. We deserve a little bit of time to assess what a turnaround plan would look like, the probability of success on that turnaround plan for that business. And we're not the most patient people. The shareholders of Eastman are not always the most patient people, and I would expect we'll have more to talk about on that, what our path is going forward, on Investors Day.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, All right. And I was struck by Curt's comment that you expect to spend $500 million this year, of which $100 million is Solutia in the second half of the year. I mean, that seems like a rather high number for Solutia.  Very high number for Solutia.","James P. Rogers","Don't annualize that.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, and if I might add, one of the growth aspects that Solutia brings is expansion options in Kuantan, Malaysia to serve the Asian market. Obviously, that is one of the levers we'll look at as we continue to look at how the economies are shaping up. And we'll see if we have to make adjustments for that. But that's kind of where we're at to start out of the  gate.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. My early betting line is that you don't spend $500 million this year, but that's just me. And lastly, Jim, you flagged out the Fibers' buying pattern being a negative in the second quarter. Is -- were those business just traditionally lumpy good, lumpy bad? Second half of the year, lumpy good?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I got 0 worries about Fibers, Frank. I mean, if I put my list of worries down on a piece of paper, fibers doesn't even show up on the page. So it was in Asia, it was the classic customer buying pattern. I think we're going to be close to selling out on tow this year, so I'm not worried about which quarter it comes in. I think for the year, they're going to have a very good year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Curious about in PCI how much Sterling and Scandiflex added to volumes since you haven't anniversary-ed those 2 acquisitions?","James P. Rogers","Well, it did help. They're not huge. I don't know, Curt, if you've got any comment.","Curtis E. Espeland","I tell you, it did help, but not as material number on a year-over-year basis.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on your cellulose esters and triacetates and LCD, are your -- is your mix somewhat geared more towards panels than LCD TVs? Because we saw, certainly, some weakness in LCD TVs in the developed markets. I'm just curious, it seems like you performed a little bit better than the overall market. What was driving that?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I'm not sure, and I don't know exactly what the mix is between the 2. I know we're in several layers on the screens. I think that usually what moves our results is more the customers and their inventory positions. And I know they got fairly light in inventories and had a lot of make-up to do after the first quarter. And so I think that drove it. So I don't if you can extrapolate our results to the end market results, because the way this supply chain works is not always the most logical. So I think our customers have their inventories get fairly low and then had to play some catch-up and do some buying.","Curtis E. Espeland","Okay. And Nils, if I could, just come back to remind on Sterling. We talked about the acetic acid business that came with that. That's about $100 million of revenue a year. The real benefit of that plant acquisition will be, as we start up this new PC asset, plasticizer asset, you'll start seeing that benefit over the coming quarters.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And I think you said you could get to $200 million at some point in a couple of years. Is that still...","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, that's still -- that's still the path.  Yes, absolutely.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. Just a question on Europe. It seems from at least your comments during the call, it's a lot worse than expected. And yet, in the prepared kind of slides, you said it doesn't seem to be deteriorating anymore. So could you help parse those 2? What are you seeing that suggests that it's not getting any worse?  Because it certainly sounds like from your comments that it's not too good.","James P. Rogers","Yes, I hear you. The bit about it being worse than expected, I was really thinking more of Solutia's business and their exposure to Europe and how that went with the auto builds being negative in Europe year-over-year versus the rest of the world. So for the -- for our heritage business or for the combined entity, I don't think there was that big a difference between first and second quarter if I look at the volumes that -- how they came off, a little bit more in the second quarter than what it was for the whole first half of the year, right?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, but a notch.","James P. Rogers","But a notch is like -- difference being 6% for the half and 7% in the quarter, something like that. So I don't know, maybe there's a bit of hope in there as well, but I just -- as we look at the order patterns that we can see, talk to the customers, and I just had 2 weeks in Europe getting -- hitting a bunch of countries and our different locations, et cetera. It seems to be a disconnect between the talking heads on TV back here and what the guys in the trenches in Europe are seeing. So our best guess, I'll just say it that way, our best guess is that Europe just kind of putters along down here to level it's at through the end of the year.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one last question, if I may. It seems like at least on your currency in Latin America, you didn't suffer nearly as much as a headwind as many of your peers, who saw large single-digit declines. What is -- is there a different exposure to your business that you're able to offset that? What caused it to be less of a headwind?","Curtis E. Espeland","So you're talking about the euro, I think is what you mentioned?","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Latin America, actually.","Curtis E. Espeland","Latin America?  I mean, I think....","James P. Rogers","Instability [ph] in currency, the only thing I can think.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, it comes down to how we price some of our products that we export to those marketplaces.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Andrew Feinman with Iridian.","Andrew Feinman","I was just wondering if you could give us any update on Tritan 2 and acetylated wood?","James P. Rogers","Yes, thanks, Andy. It's exciting stuff. I mean, I mentioned Tritan a little bit earlier, that it's probably going to take us a little longer to fill out that second line than maybe we first thought. It's not, frankly, hardly anything to do with Tritan, everything to do with the economy and the durables goods markets, et cetera, like I was mentioning before. But I'd say that's fantastic product, we will fill the line out. It is going to take share from the other materials, it's just going to take us a little bit longer. On the acetylated wood, and thanks for giving me a chance to talk about it. In the market right now, both pro-channel and big-box channel, getting the results in, obviously still early. I think we're going to have good customer acceptance. We're learning some stuff about coding versus not coding, et cetera. But I think we've got a good one there, but we're going to want to do it a measured pace. When you deal with the retail market, you only get one chance to put a good brand out there, so we want to make sure we do it the right way. I can tell you just from a manufacturing point of view, the little semi works, if you want to call it that, plant that we built here in Kingsport, running very well, getting more capacity out of it than we thought, typical Eastman fashion, people continually finding ways to improve the process, get, in this case, more board feet out of the same plant. Decent market acceptance, but we've got some fine-tuning to do in terms of how we go to market, what the end product looks like, which segments we go into. So still a bit early, but overall, quite positive.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. This concludes -- thanks again for joining us this morning.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Riddle","Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results News Release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for the third quarter 2017 and the Form 10-K to be filed for 2017.","Second, earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-GAAP and unusual items. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including the description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the fourth quarter of full year of 2017 financial results News Release, which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projection of future earnings exclude any non-core or unusual items.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3.","2017 was a strong year for Eastman as we made great progress in our strategy to transform towards specialty portfolio and create attractive value for our shareholders. I am pleased to report that we met or exceeded the financial targets that we set last January.","On the EPS front we exceeded our goals to the strength of our performance over innovative specialty businesses. The key driver to the success was our continued strong growth, improving product mix, and cost structure leverage.","In 2017 we delivered over 7% volume growth in our two specialty segments combined which is more than double the underlying markets. Strong contributors included many of our premium products such as Triton, Saflex acoustics and heads up display interlayers, Crystex tire additives, tire resins and performance films.","In particular growth in premium products has been a key driver for the advanced materials segment and we\u2019re seeing this trend accelerate for additives and functional products. We achieved the highest rate of new product commercializations form our innovation growth portfolio in our history. We also benefited from high reliability suppliers as our Chinese competitors faced stronger environmental enforcement.","And we completed the construction of two of our new specially plants in Malaysia to support our future growth. At the same time we took actions to reduce cost in a disciplined way which has allowed us to strategically invest in long-term growth and further improve our cost structure.","As I said before, we are creating our own growth through innovation and leadership in specialty markets. Our cash engine generated an impressive $1 billion of free cash flow for the year, about 7% yield which enabled an increasing dividend further deleveraging and an accelerating rate of share repurchases. And we increased our dividend by 10% in 2017, the 8th straight year of increases. Over that time we have more than doubled our dividend providing an attractive yield to investors.","Overall during 2017 we returned approximately $650 million to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. These results are clear proof that we are on track and executing our strategy from innovating through our enterprise to managing our cost, to pricing discipline to returning cash to our stockholders.","Next on Slide 4, as you know in early October we had an operational incident in the coal gasification areas of our Kingsport site. First I said it before and I want to say it again, I want to complement the extraordinary professionalism and safety first focus of our operations team. This was a significant event and we're exceptionally proud of the actions of our team.","Our recovery team had twice a day, seven days a week for three months solving problems and driving results. The team came together with the Eastman can-do attitude and demonstrated how Eastman is exceptional at rising to a challenge.","Second our response to this incidence is a superb example of how we both delivered superior reliability for our customers and our minimized in the financial - impact the incident on our earnings. Our teams wire tireless to repair the facility we also implemented alternate processes to maintain operations of downstream derivative facilities of coal gas. We had an absolutely flawless startup which is a testament to our talented engineering and manufacturing teams. And in the end there was a zero impact to our derivative customers.","Third, this impressive timeline to get back up is due to the significant advantages we have in the scale and integration at our Tennessee site which is one of the largest integrated chemical facilities in the U.S.","Our integrated production systems across the four segments enabled us to make complex choices across the site which was essential in avoiding a site wide disruption. Our significant scale enables us to have dedicated experts and large-scale fabrication and engineering resources who rapidly and safely repair the facility.","For example, we rebuilt a five-story pipe bridge with 117 pipes and there were no leaks on start-up. We replaced 100s of valves some of which were over 2000 pounds. We rebuilt in our own big shop a number of new vessels some of which had walls that were three inches big.","Our scale and supply chain procurement also played a critical role in sourcing material and balancing the needs of our customers. This is another example of how we're exceptional in managing the large complex facilities.","I\u2019ll let Curt cover the financial implications as he reviews the corporate results next. With that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curt Espeland","Thanks Mark, and good morning everyone.","Continuing on Slide 4 let me cover three financial aspects related to the coal gasification incident. First, our net cost resulting from the incident are excluded from fourth quarter and full-year earnings results and the net earnings recovery in 2018 will also be excluded.","Second, thanks to our teams diligent effort resulting in an accelerated timeframe for bringing the site back up, as well as higher insurance recovery resulting from an increase on related capital expenditures, we anticipate the net financial impact of the incident will be between $25 million to $50 million lower than previously anticipated.","In fourth quarter, the net cost of the disruption and to the repair and reconstruction of the site were $112 million. In addition, lost sales attributed to the incident were $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily in the chemical intermediate segment.","Finally, the net cash impact of the incident is expected to be approximately $50 million to $70 million mostly impacting free cash flow in 2018. The free cash flow impact on fourth quarter 2017 was minimal as a net costs and capital expenditures related to the incident were offset by drawdown of inventory, an increase in trade payables.","Now moving to our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 5. We delivered solid earnings for the quarter. The increase in revenue largely reflected strong growth from our high margins specialty businesses along with continued improvement in chemical intermediates more than offsetting a decline in fibers.","Chemical intermediates revenue improved despite the negative impact of lost sales of approximately $40 million attributed to the coal gasification disruption. Operating earnings increased as growth in additives and functional products, advanced materials and chemical intermediates more than offset a decline in fibers.","Next on to Slide 6. Looking at the full year we delivered strong results despite a slow growth world reflecting the strong and robustness of our strategy to transform into a specialty portfolio. Overall sales revenue increased as strong growth from our high margins specialty businesses along with continued improvement in chemical intermediates more than offset a headwind in fibers.","Our operating results increased as increases in additives and functional products, advanced materials and chemical intermediates more than offset a decline in fibers. And we're growing operating earnings while we continue to invest in growth for both the near-term and long-term.","Our operating margin for the year was over 70% slightly higher than 2016 and our adjusted EBITDA margin was over 23% which remains one of the most attractive in our industry. Earnings per share increased 13% with higher operating earnings contributing almost 8% of the growth.","Moving next to the segment results beginning on Slide 7 and starting with advanced materials which delivered another year of strong growth driven by innovation platforms. Fourth quarter earnings increased year-over-year due to higher sales volume particularly from double-digit growth of high margin innovative products and improved product mix. Partially offset by higher growth spend and startup costs of the new PVD resin capacity in Malaysia and hurricane related costs.","For the year, sales revenue increased due to the improved product mix from higher sales volume of premium products including Triton, co-polyester, Saflex acoustic interlayers, and performance films.","Operating earnings increased for the year primarily driven by higher sales volume, lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization and improved product mix of premium products partially offset by higher growth spend. Advanced materials strong operating margin was maintained at over 19%. These results reflect execution of a multiyear strategy to deliver strong earnings growth.","Overall solid results for 2017 which continues advanced materials track record of success and reflects a high level of returns given the investments we have made. Looking to 2018, we expect stronger earnings growth in 2017 as advanced materials execute its strategy for mid-single digit volume growth, mixed improvement and fixed cost leverage. We continue to deliver compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through our innovation and market development.","Now to additives and function products on Slide 8 which had another outstanding quarter. Fourth quarter sales revenue increased 19% due to very strong sales volume for most product lines, a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates and higher selling prices. This impressive growth came from multiple sources.","Our improved commercial execution and heat transfer fluids led to a number of wins in solar energy, strong growth in tire additives due to innovation in our tire resins, and superior operational reliability and strong growth in animal nutrition and care chemicals. We also made good progress in improving our pricing on the strengths of our value proposition to our customers.","Operating earnings increased primarily due to higher sales volume, higher selling prices and fixed cost leverage. For the year sales revenue increased double digits primarily due to 10% higher sales volume which is across most of the segment, as well as higher selling prices. Operating earnings increased 8% primarily due to higher sales volume, fixed cost leverage related to strong volume growth and higher selling prices.","Looking at full year 2018, we expect solid earnings growth. We expect the continued solid growth in tire additives and animal attrition will be partially offset by some headwinds and adhesives and a tough comp for heat transfer fluids due to the timing of solar projects. We will also have higher costs associated with growth investments. All in, additives and functional products is well positioned to deliver solid earnings growth for the year.","Now the chemical intermediates on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices attributed to higher raw material costs, and continued improved market conditions. The increase was partially offset by lower sales volume particularly of acetyl derivative products due to the coal gasification incident.","Fourth quarter operating earnings increased slightly primarily due to higher selling prices and lower commodity hedge costs partially offset by lower sales volume and higher raw material and energy costs. For full-year, operating earnings increased primarily due to higher selling prices, lower commodity hedge costs, lower scheduled maintenance costs, and lower operating costs partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.","Sales volume was down somewhat with growth in our specialty businesses consuming intermediates that would have been sold to the market resulting in corporate mix upgrade. This is in line with our strategy for chemical intermediates which includes supporting growth in the specialty businesses.","Looking at full year 2018, we expect similar results to 2017. It looks like we are off to a good start here in the first quarter, however we are expecting all of our margins to compress somewhat towards the back half of the year.","We also have higher scheduled maintenance cost during the year which we will work to offset with productivity. Overall chemical intermediates is set up for 2018 earnings to be similar to 2017 which would be good performance.","I'll finish up the segment review with fibers on Slide 10. Full-year sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices particularly for acetate tow attributed to lower industry capacity utilization. A bright spot for the year was growth and acetate yarn which increased over 10% reflecting early success of our innovation initiatives.","Operating earnings for the year declined due to lower selling prices and lower sales volume partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from recent actions. However, operating earnings improved in the second half of 2017 and were 10% higher than the first half reflecting the actions we've taken to stabilize the business.","Looking forward, we expect 2018 earnings to be stable or somewhat higher than earnings in 2017. We expect total volumes to be stable with somewhat lower prices from competitive activity offset by an aggressive productivity program including raw material costs. We also expect continued growth from our innovation efforts and will tell you more about this great success next week.","One final point, we expect first quarter 2018 to be in line with the fourth quarter of 2017 with an improvement in earnings for the remaining three quarters as the benefits of lower costs flow through inventory.","On Slide 11, I will transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for 2017. We did an excellent job of generating cash in 2017 with operating cash flow of over $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $649 million including approximately $50 million for coal gasification repairs and reconstruction.","Free cash flow for the year was just over $1 billion, the best year of free cash flow in our history and a very attractive free cash flow conversion rate of over 90%, another testament to the quality of our portfolio and the capabilities of Eastman team. And we expect that to continue in 2018 with free cash flow expectation greater than $1.1 billion. This reflects cash from continued earnings growth, the benefit of tax reform and lower capital expenditures partially offset by the negative cash impact of the operational incident and increases in working capital requirements given our expected growth and rising raw material environment.","For 2018 we expect capital expenditures to moderate to $250 million to $550 million. This reflects the nearing or completion of several large growth projects, as well as an additional $20 million to complete the repairs of the coal gas facility.","In addition, given the expected benefits of tax reform, we are investing an additional $25 million for low-cost to bottlenecks and higher returns small capital projects to meet increasing demand for a variety of our specialties. And we\u2019ll continue to put our free cash flow to work in a balanced and disciplined manner. We used $350 million over free cash flow to pay down debt consistent with our deleveraging commitment.","Additionally, we remain committed to returning cash to our stockholders. Our full-year dividend was $296 million and this included a increase in the fourth quarter of 10%. And we had $350 million in share repurchases through the year including $75 million in the fourth quarter.","The combination of regular increases in our dividend and an increasing level of share repurchases reflect our continued confidence in future earnings and cash flows. And finally, our pro forma effective tax rate for the year was approximately 20% reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations and other positive tax attributes.","Tax reform also had an impact on our fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018. In the fourth quarter the company recognized an estimated $421 million tax benefit resulting from recent tax law changes impacting the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities offset by expected transition tax on deferred foreign income and a reduction in the expected benefit of foreign tax credits.","Our normalized effective tax rate is expected to go from 20% to 22% to 18% to 20% in 2018 reflecting the lower US tax rate partially offset by a reduction of foreign tax credits and other deductions. Overall, a strong year for Eastman and a solid foundation from which we'll continue to grow.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks Curt.","On Slide 12, I\u2019ll discuss our 2018 outlook. We continue to benefit from the strong growth of high value innovative products with leading positions in attractive niche markets. We're also delivering revenue synergies through launching new products and improvements in the commercial execution capabilities of our acquired businesses.","We\u2019re seeing the benefits of scale and integration, translating this attractive growth in earnings. And our continued aggressive productivity is expected to offset inflation and some of our growth. In addition a modest improvement in our tax rate is expected to contribute to grow.","Finally disciplined allocation of our strong free cash flow contribute to our growth including increasing our share repurchases in 2018 compared to 2017. To accelerate the momentum in the coming years, we\u2019re also continuing to invest in innovation and product development, and we expect higher scheduled maintenance costs in the year as we have significant turnaround of one of our crackers in Longview Texas, that only happens every five years.","And lastly, we expect some pressure in olefins spreads especially in the second half of the year. Putting this all together consistent with our previous guidance, we expect adjusted EPS growth in 2018 to be between 8% and 12%. And when you consider the shape of earnings this year, you should expect the first half to be modestly stronger than the second primarily in CI and AFP. We expect at least a 10% increase in our free cash flow which is one of the most compelling in the industry, especially when you consider we're investing in long-term growth at the same time.","Lastly this morning a quick reminder that we will host an Innovation Day in New York on the morning of this coming Tuesday, February 6. We're incredibly excited to spend the morning with you and talking about how much progress we've made in our innovation strategy and our capabilities across the organization and how its positioned us to continue to deliver strong attractive growth and increasing free cash flow.","In particular we\u2019ll share three things with you in this day. We'll talk quite extensively about our unique innovation, organic growth model that I think is exceptional in this industry and has delivered one of the most robust portfolios for growth that we've ever had and I think outstanding for this industry.","We will also talk about how aggressive portfolio management through years has positioned us to help growth across a range of attractive markets and structurally improved our earnings and cash flows and positioned us to deliver continued growth.","And of course we'll spend some time reviewing how we\u2019re going to be disciplined as that we always have been about deploying our free cash flow for the attractive returns for our shareholders. Through this discussion we'll demonstrate how we've created value in the past and more importantly how we positioned to continue doing it going forward. I hope you\u2019ll be able to join us.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn back to Greg.","Greg Riddle","Thanks Mark. We\u2019ve got a lot of people on the line this morning and like to get to as many questions as possible. So I'd appreciate it if you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And with that Jennifer we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Very strong quarter in the AFP business on topline basis, another 14% volume mix. How sustainable is that number in 2018?","Mark Costa","Yes, we\u2019re incredibly proud of the team in AFP. They have just done a phenomenal job through the year of driving growth as all you know we had a bit slow start to the year. And really delivered great acceleration through the year and it was strong volume on a number of fronts. We had great growth that was delivered in the back half of the year in particular both third and fourth quarter from our solar fills as Curt mentioned. We won a number of projects there and saw that benefit.","We also had tremendous success in driving revenue synergies through the Taminco acquisition, an accelerating growth in animal nutrition and care chemical, delivering a lot of strong volume growth and tires which is a great success story both on the innovation efforts around tire resins and Crystex, as well as PVDs as we demonstrated how reliable we are to our customers compared to some of the competitors that we had faced out of China who've been shut down for environmental reasons.","So strong drivers across the market. I would note that coating was more in line with how our customers' grew in that mix. But as we look at 2018 we are confident to continue strong growth in sort of the mid-single digits areas. So it\u2019s going to moderate a bit from where we were in 2017.","The key things are this year we don't have that many solar fills so that's going to be a tough comp in the back half of the year, but we will see a return of those solar fills in 2019 and 2020. It's just those orders tend to be chunky and when they fall not just within the year but also across years, it\u2019s a great business just chunky.","In addition, we saw some growth really driven by this Chinese environmental enforcement in the AFP as well CI. And what happen there is, we gained a lot of market share in some places we expect to sustain that market share. We don't associate another step up in share this year.","I would note that AFP is advantage when it really becomes a - demonstrating our reliability supply in that front because of how well our assets run how and we maintain them and most of our competitors may have feel on the specialty side are small Asian players who have one line and in this case we\u2019ve shown the value of being aligned with us.","So you have a few things that just not going to repeat and as we mentioned will have some price pressure on the pieces business as we have a competitive add some capacity and we\u2019ve been talking about that for a while. So overall very much confident of delivering solid growth this year, the rate of growth will be moderate on the volume side as a result of these things.","David Begleiter","And Curt just on the cash flow, what\u2019s your working capital expectation for usage this year and how much debt do you expect to paydown in 2018?","Curt Espeland","So if you think about cash flow again we\u2019re expecting greater than 1.1 billion embedded in that is a growth - I'd call modest growth in working capital. If you think about our cash conversion cycle, it should be about the same. I think depend on how you calculate, it's 98, 99 days that will be the same cash conversion cycle in 2018 and just have to kind of input your own thoughts on what you think the rising raw material environment is going to be.","As it relates to the uses of cash flow, you\u2019re going to see that same disciplined capital allocation philosophy you have seen this year. So if you think about greater than $1.1 billion, the increase in dividend is roughly going to be a $325 million use of cash. You'll probably see us continue deleveraging about the same level maybe little lower and that we did in 2017. And in absence of any bolt-on acquisitions the rest of it will be deployed to share repurchases.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Did you have to purchase all of your silicon hydride during the quarter or were you able to utilize some swaps where you have to return the volumes in the future?","Mark Costa","I\u2019m not going to get in all different mechanics that how we secured the acetic acid but yes we did have to go the marketplace and secure so.","Curt Espeland","I would say that it was an impressive display of supply chain management where we're normally exporting a modest amount of asset in hydride out of this site because we consume most of what we make for our specialty products vast majority. Bringing in a phenomenal amount of acetic acid in the site, it was just extraordinary to see that flow shift in less than 30 days.","John Roberts","And it seems like your adjusted results added back the cost of the purchase acetic or asset or in hydride, is that because when you're in normal operations running the gasifier, the net cost of the raw material coal after the coproduct intermediate credit is essentially zero and see it add back the cost of any purchased raw material?","Mark Costa","Well you got to keep them, the reason we added back the cost of the instant because first of all we have pretty good line aside of what the additional costs are. And what you have typically is the cost of the incident which is basically supported by the insurance process to go through it is actually reflects the additional cost of procuring and moving the additional raw materials into our facilities versus what it would cost for us to have produced.","Operator","We'll go next to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet.","Aleksey Yefremov","Could you discuss the start-up costs in relating to 2017 and if there is any benefit from lapsing those costs in 2018?","Curt Espeland","Well I think if you look at maybe total cost - Mark talked about some cost headwinds, we call it investments. And so what you have there is typically between the three manufacturing sites that we\u2019re bringing on stream that will come with about $30 million of its additional fixed cost that we will deal with in 2018 that we will grow into starting at 2018 and going into that 2019 period et cetera.","And just round it out, if you think about that plus we\u2019ll have some additional I\u2019ll call it roughly $20 million of costs associated with turnarounds that we didn't have in 2017, and plus you got some additional growth and innovation spend et cetera.","So now you think about that, we are using productivities to try to maybe cut half of that gross spend in half and combine that with roughly 70 million of inflation we always have deal with this each year. We will have about $100 million cost reduction program. But in general we\u2019ll have a $30 million to $40 million cost headwind related to growth investments to help or support our long-term growth going into 2018.","Aleksey Yefremov","As a follow-up, what are your expectations for the benefit of the PDH agreement that are embedded in your guidance and how conservative are those assumptions compared to current spot PDH margins?","Curt Espeland","So the expectations or the benefits of that PDH agreement of us obviously moderated with the changes in oil price in olefins market. We still have a benefit but it will be relatively modest.","Operator","We'll go next to Duffy Fisher with Barclays.","Duffy Fisher","First question just around tow, you had gone to great lengths to kind of lock in some longer-term contracts. So the price down in the fourth quarter and some price coming down next year. Did that play out like you thought or is that kind of an incremental negative versus what you thought when you went to those longer-term contracts?","Mark Costa","So as we said we secured about two thirds of our tow volume in long-term agreements. Obviously there was a third that wasn't and we saw some residual competitive pressure in that space, the price down you saw in the fourth quarter it just the nature of the pricing and the agreements we set for the year. But as you look at 2018, you will see some - sort of more moderate reduction in price associated with some continued competitive conditions throughout the year last year.","But as Curt said, those moderate price declines in comparison last year will be more than offset by some of the cost reduction efforts we have to volume being the same. So in general, we feel good about so where it all nets out to being stable for the year with. I think we have a good chance of drive for some very modest growth when you include the innovation program. So really excited to walk you through all of that next week and show how much progress we\u2019ve made.","On the innovation portfolio, I have been pushing it off with you guys for a while to sort of get into the market and see success and we really have delivered some tremendous success. And can we just share with you.","Duffy Fisher","And then just to go back to the cash flow, you seem much more confident or bullish kind of on the more than 10% growth in free cash flow where your earnings guide or EPS guide is kind of 8 to 12. But yet, you're going to buy back some shares, so that should be a positive for EPS relative to cash flow, working capital will be a net negative on cash flow wouldn't be for EPS? So where's the increase bullishness coming from on the cash flow side relative to the EPS growth?","Curt Espeland","Well, first of all it comes from our underline businesses. I mean, our underlying businesses generate good cash flows and that will continue. And so, cash flows are not always equal exactly 100% for the growth rate. But we are going to see good cash flow growth there.","We are expecting some benefits of tax reform. You've heard me talk about the challenges or headwinds we expected with higher cash taxes in the U.S. and so, that will help moderate that, in fact as we got transition that headwind maybe more '19 than '18. So that helps our cash flows in '18. And again you see good working capital this month.","The other thing I'd remind yourself is our capital expenditures are also down 100 million. So that's also a driver of that confidence in free cash flow.","Mark Costa","The other thing I would note on the earnings side of this when it comes to tax is that as, we looked at our guidance we've kept the range 8% to 12%, but where we were leading you guys last fall was we'd be at the low end of that range from what we could obviously with this tax benefit, we\u2019ll now move into the middle of the range on that 8% to 12%.","Operator","We'll go next to P. J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar","Mark you guys did a good job in ASP and Advanced Materials in terms of volumes but pricing has been somewhat weak, particularly in AdMat for last several quarters. And that is despite rising raw materials. So, what does it take to get pricing up there or are your sales people not pushing price to get volumes? Can you just talk about that?","Mark Costa","So, in Advanced Materials as you noted the prices didn't change that much. There is a lot in that mix as well that you have to keep in mind. But the first thing I would note is, compared to CI and AFP the rate of raw material increase in Advanced Materials is actually quite modest.","The PX market is pretty competitive and we didn't see that much increase in PX really, compared to other segments. What we're really focused on in Advanced Materials is driving mix upgrade that's how we've created all this value. And when we're growing things like trident acoustics and heads of display interlayers and all of the performance films business had pretty attractive high margins, that's how we drive growth and that's how we deliver earnings growth over the last five years in that business.","On the pricing front, we didn\u2019t make good progress actually on pricing relative to PX on the co-polyester side of the business, but the prices were flat due to the annual contracts and interlayers so that mitigated how you're seeing the overall price movement in the segment.","And of course, we had some prices come off in a few places. But I actually feel that we did a great job on that and we have some good momentum and feel good about how we're going to manage price versus rise in '18","P. J. Juvekar","And then you talked about the Chinese competitors having issues. Can you just talk about what products that you're seeing that benefit? And generally, if you can talk about your China operations outside of [Wiltertoe]? Thank you. ","Mark Costa","So especially in AFP and CI we have a number of competitors who are based out of China. And in AFP, there are players that we have in products like Crystex, some of the olefin related products where they are typically very small private companies who start up a plant somewhere. And in this case, many of them were not in an industrial park.","So when they start to enforce environmental restrictions they had to shut down because they were in some suburb or some place and that wasn't appropriate. And we really benefit from that, especially in tires but also in some of the olefin related businesses as well.","And then as you think about the overall China business, it's a great business. I mean tow has obviously got its own unique story, but we're well positioned across advanced materials and as of functional products and selling a number of specialties into that market across the whole spectrum from transportation to consumables, consumer durables et cetera. So it's a robust business but a big driver of growth for us. ","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","With the lower U.S. tax rate, I guess just a couple of questions around it. Obviously, you're still presumably trying to sell the Longview Cracker. So any update there? Maybe that's helpful to have a lower tax rate now. But also you talked about the $25 million incremental investment. But as you think about broader capital allocation whether it's organic or for M&A, are you more focused on the U.S. now with the lower tax rate than you might have been otherwise or how is your calculus changed, if any?","Mark Costa","First you asked a question about the status of the ethylene sale, let me start there and then we'll talk about tax rate and then how we might think about the investment. So first of all on the sale process, divesting the excess ethylene positioned and a potential commodity ethylene derivatives it remains a priority for us. You've heard that before, but nothing has changed there.","While excess ethylene is a source of volatility and not strategic to our future growth, the underlying assets are high-quality that generate significant value. So we're just going to continue with our process. It's an active process with multiple parties seriously engage with us. And so we are working hard to see if we can get a transaction completed.","On the tax rate, just to clarify again, we are expecting a modest impact as part of the effective tax rate. In addition as we transition, that minimizes some of the headwinds we have on taxes.","We're going to '18 by a face of more '19. But then on a cash basis between all the things, there's probably is a $50 million cash benefit for us relative to some of those headwinds we're starting to face. So that allows us to have a little extra cash to put to work.","Mark Costa","So as we reflected on the benefits for us, like most companies in the U.S. are doing, we wanted to make sure that we stay true to our strategy. So if we think about how we invest some of these tailwinds - and by the way, overall tax reform I think for this country, for Eastman, is fantastic to improve our competitiveness in the world.","We wanted to really reinvest in our strategy. So we're going to increase our resourcing in the R&D side and the growth resources on the commercial side to accelerate these innovation programs that we have moving in place. We also saw the opportunity to take some of the cash and reinvest it in debottlenecking some of our plans, improving yields and quality on some of our plans to support us better in the strong growth we're having.","So that's how we decided to do it. We think that's the best way to improve the quality of our employees, so our jobs security and carrier tracks and we also think it's a great way to create some attractive jobs in this country. Chemical sector is a great place to work, our salaries are well above the industrial average and significantly above the service sector.","It's a mix upgrade just like in our strategy if you think about America and what we're doing. So we think tax is great. One of the thing I'd note is, the biggest upside to tax reform I think for all of us is stimulating economic growth in this country and by association around the world. And if that growth stimulus happens, that would be upside to our forecast.","Vincent Andrews","And just as a follow-up, can you give us a sense of the FX impact that you're expecting for 2018 at current rate?","Curt Espeland","Well, we've assumed then the - outlook right now is - the biggest thing is Euro to Dollar relationship. We've assumed a little about a 120 maybe, a little stronger. And that's built into our outlook statement. I know it's trading a little higher than that, but let's see if that stays there for a period of time before we talk any further upside to our forecast. But if it does, it will have an impact on our outlook. But right now, we're assuming $120 or so.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Mark, in your prepared remarks, I think you indicated that you'd anticipate a greater share repurchases in 2018 versus 2017. Can you put that into context for us versus the $350 million that you did. It looks like, for example, you de-lever by $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter. Are you happy with the balance sheet where it is now and should we anticipate a meaningful shift in that regard looking ahead?","Curt Espeland","First of all, we love our balance sheet. Well, there is still some additional deleveraging that we need to do consistent with our commitment to maintain a solid investment credit rating. So the deleveraging that we're going to do is going to, again, be similar to or little less than we did in 2016, and that will continue to improve our metrics especially as we also then grow our EBITDA.","As it relates to the capital allocation, again, you should always assume our free cash flow is fully deployed. I know that still - I don't think it's fully appreciated in the industry yet that we will fully deploy our capital, our cash flow.","So, yes, in absence of bolt-on acquisitions, we will see an increase in share repurchases. I still like to see an execution of that kind of spread throughout the year. We tend not to do accelerated programs, but we'll see how the year progresses and whether we change our strategy, but that's how we currently think about it.","Kevin McCarthy","And then as a follow-up sticking with the same subject, how would you characterize your M&A pipeline activity has been relatively quiet. It seems to me over the last year or so, do you see interesting bolt-ons or anything larger of interest looking ahead?","Mark Costa","So, first, you're right. We've been very focused on demonstrating we can deliver organic growth not just from heritage Eastman but also from our acquired businesses. Next week you'll see tremendous innovation and growth stories across our portfolio, and it's amazing how much we've accelerated growth and what we've acquired, not just what we've had. So that's been our focus, and I think it's important to drive confidence for all of our shareholders that we can get a good return on our investments, both capital and acquisitions.","As we look forward, we are aiming for doing bolt-on acquisitions that reinforce and strengthen some of the positions we have in our specialty businesses. And so we'll look to try and make that happen as balanced approach in capital allocation. I will tell you right now, we don't have anything active, but it is something that we hope to do as we forward from this point forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","What was your cash tax rate in 2017? Where do you expect it to be in 2018 and what do you forecast for 2019?","Mark Costa","Well, you see in the cash flow statement, you can see what the impact is on differed taxes. So I think our cash tax rate actually increased slightly in 2017. One of the ways I try to characterize kind of that headwind taxes is we've been benefitted from the NOLs we acquired from Solutia. So that was about $1.5 billion of NOLs.","And we've really enjoyed the benefit of those kind of over the five years tax effect that you can get a rough sense of how much we benefited. And then as that benefit of NOLs rolled off, we were starting to use the foreign tax credits. Now, as we transition to a territorial tax system, we've now lost some of the benefit of those foreign tax credits.","2018 is still a transition year. So we'll see how much we can manage through this. But you will see our cash tax rates to grow modestly in 2018 and a little bit more in 2019, but, Jeff, the bottomline, we don't quantify the exact cash tax rate, but you can see how it's reflected in our free cash flow goals overall.","Jeff Zekauskas","So what you said is your cash tax rate will arise in 2018, and then rise a little bit in 2019?","Mark Costa","Yes, it will rise a little bit in 2018, and it'll probably rise a little bit more in 2019.","Curt Espeland","Overall, we're confident of our free cash flow as a company increasing this year and continue to increase as we move forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","You mentioned, and Curt as well, that at the Innovation Day, you're going to give some direction on the things you've been working on and the value it creates. Just curious, as you look forward in AFP and AM, should we expect to see that manifest as margin lift or primarily volume lift?","And then secondly, is it good or bad for Eastman Chemical if there is broad inflation in your feedstock base?","Mark Costa","So on the first question, Bob, we'll extensively cover that topic about how innovations is going to drive growth through a company across AM, AFP as well as starting to help fibers in the portfolio. So that will be our focus. It is a volume driven story more than it is a margin driven story.","We get a great mix uplift that moves our margin up within the segments, especially advanced materials. But when you think about AFP and AM, the margin there are much more attractive than CI. So as we're driving growth there and intentionally not growing CI at the same rate because they're sending intermediates down to the growing specialties.","That's a huge mix upgrade within the portfolio. So you do get margins improving over time, but the real story is volume and mix upgrade in the specialties. So that's sort of where you get on that front.","On the oil question, what we'd say is a steady oil environment and an increase in oil environment is favorable to Eastman, a volatile oil environment is not in general over the long term because when it's spiking up and down its just always hard to manage the pricing.","As we look at the current situation, 2018 what I'd say is you know on methanol so amines and acetyls we see a nice tailwind coming with oil and associated methanol going up. When we think about the olefin side in the short-term there is a supply demand dynamic issue that goes on top of oil. We have all these crackers and PDH units coming up so we\u2019re expecting some short-term pressure but long-term we feel good about how those spreads with all.","Operator","We'll go next to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch","Congrats on getting the coal gas unit up before year end. Curt I wanted to follow up on Slide 12 the near-term headwinds I took down a bunch of numbers I just want to make sure I got this correct and also wanted to learn more about the cost reduction program you referenced. So the cost of strategic growth investments I believe you said was 30 million to 40 million headwind 2018 versus 2017 was that correct?","Curt Espeland","Yes, again that\u2019s mainly the impact of the cost of bringing these new production facilities online. A good portion of that just the higher depreciation that comes with bringing assets online?","Frank Mitsch","And then also the higher scheduled maintenance cost I think you referenced 20 million year-over-year net increase is the correct?","Curt Espeland","That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s primarily related to a cracker turnaround in second quarter.","Frank Mitsch","In Q2, that\u2019s all in Q2.","Curt Espeland","Yes, that cracker turnaround is in Q2.","Frank Mitsch","And then I believe you said that there was - and then you also said you have general inflation labor costs et cetera 70 million and lot of this will be offset by $100 million cost reduction program. Can you go into anymore details on that program?","Curt Espeland","Well again we have a great team of people at Eastman know how to manage cost it\u2019s in our DNA. And so this is a group of people who have been working on offsetting inflation every year and we asked them to deliver more than that periodically like we've done in the past. We asked them to deliver more than inflation in 2017.","What we\u2019re asking for that team to do is help offset some of this growth investment as we grow into it, to help us kind of have earnings growth, good earnings growth in 2018 and as those growth investments take off and you get the benefits of it, we\u2019ll continue to offset inflation through the productivity programs.","Mark Costa","Frank just to sort of summarize that up first of all the productivity programs and we do this every year. So this is standard to what we do. A lot of it is manufacturing improving yields, quality, debottlenecking, stretching plants, but it\u2019s just great productivity, it\u2019s not that people related this year.","When you think about that and all the cost that Curt has laid out from the growth investments and the higher maintenance costs, the point we\u2019re trying to say is net. We\u2019ll offset inflation to 70 and of this growth spend and maintenance costs, we also have a portion of that but not all of it. So net-net you've got a fixed cost headwind in the $30 million to $40 million range all in from 2017 to 2018.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael Sison","In terms of EPS growth for 2017 how much of that do you think was driven by your specialty businesses and I guess by your outlook for the segments in 2018 did the specialty businesses support more of that EPS growth as we head into next year?","Curt Espeland","So if you think about it and the way I think about it is the specialty businesses is where the key driver for earnings growth last year and they\u2019re going to be key driver for earnings growth this year. It\u2019s a little bit different story on how you do that. In 2017 you had a recovery in CI especially the hedge rolling off basically offsetting the headroom we had in fibers. So CI and fibers sort of neutralize each other out and we delivered growth in the specialties, as well as leveraging other elements of our income statement from interest cost to tax rate and share count.","As you look at this year it sort of the same story. We're going to have strong growth in the specialty businesses as we've guided. Fiber actually will be stable to 2017, CI will be stable 2017. And so same story about where the net earnings growth comes from and of course we\u2019re going to keep levering the other elements of the income statement to. So better interest cost, better tax, better share reduction than last year's so it all comes together in developing a pretty compelling story and equally important increasing free cash flow to a very attractive level.","Michael Sison","And then if you think about bolt-on acquisitions, you've done a nice job adding specialty businesses over the last several years. Are there certain areas within the product lines that you like to reinforce or opportunities to maybe get bigger in certain of the specialty businesses?","Mark Costa","We\u2019re not going to get into specific target areas until we actually deliver the acquisitions Mike but there are definitely attractive parts of advanced materials where we can see value in doing some bolt-on M&A. We got a great track record already in advanced materials and some bolt-on M&A in the performance films business, and then are few other places beyond that as well that we can look at.","In additives and functional products, the combination of Taminco with Eastman\u2019s capabilities create some opportunities for looking for some bolt-on acquisitions to improve our growth rate. And so it\u2019s a target rich area in that space as well. So we have a bunch of ideas and things we\u2019re considering and looking forward to using that as another lever but right now we\u2019re focused on delivering our organic growth, focused on managing cost, focused on delivering free cash flow and returning it to shareholders and as we get those done we\u2019ll do it.","I\u2019d also note we have a great track record of being exceptionally disciplined in what we pay for our acquisitions. And that's also why we\u2019ve been a little bit slow because we want make sure we don\u2019t over pay.","Operator","We'll go next to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","Just wanted to confirm the cadence for EPS. Did you say that Q4 would be similar to Q1? Or was that a fibers only comment? And then similarly, for first half, that would be greater than second half, maybe just remind us what the cadence was on EPS? Thanks.","Curt Espeland","Yes, so what we said is that the first half is going to be mostly stronger than the second half of the year at the corporate level for EPS. And in particular what we see is - we see actually quite a good strong start to the year as we\u2019re going right now so we feel good about the first quarter across the portfolio. But as you look at the back half of the year, you got some sort one-off headwinds in AFP like the solar fills they\u2019re not repeating this year compared to the back half of last year and some of this pressure and uses and you know as well as the olefin pressure that we expect in the back half of the year. So that's sort of what moderates the back half a little bit relative to the first half.","Arun Viswanathan","And just as a follow-up, just curious on China I mean you've alluded to a lot of capacity having to move to parks or being shutdown. Is there any estimate on how much of their industry that is you know relative to what it was in the past or how is it improved the supply demand environment over there? Thanks.","Mark Costa","Yes, on China effect and there is a lot people talking about but it's encouraging to see the Chinese enforce their environment laws and cleanup their impact on the global environment and we appreciate and applaud their efforts. The impact is shutting down a bunch of particularly private companies that are typically small, typically trying to get into the specialty side of the equation because they are located in the right location. And so most of those guys are under pressure if they\u2019re operating appropriately.","Curt Espeland","Some may be able to get financing to move to new Chemical Park and if they do and do start-up they\u2019re going to have higher operational costs in those locations than where they were in the past.","So either way we look at it they don't come back obviously that's helpful if they do come back they\u2019re going to have a higher cost structure, but we do expect some to come back. But it\u2019s unclear because the Chinese government is also trying to improve their control on financing and cleaning up bad debt. So it's not clear exactly how many people we\u2019ll get financing to sort of comeback.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay thanks.","Greg Riddle","Let's make the next question the last question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Dan Rizzo","It's Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. So you indicated that the solar fills will kind of have a tough comp and the order patterns will be falling off a bit in 2018 I was wondering if solar have a kind of outsized where they really hit margins they really help margins or is it just something that you kind of work through?","Mark Costa","So in the solar fills side it\u2019s not margin story it\u2019s just a volume story so we had expect some amount volume on solar in the back half of last year. Just thinking of the margins are similar to the segment average, so it\u2019s not a margin story.","Curt Espeland","And if I could add what we mentioned earlier that the capabilities and our team that manages that business is a great example of the type of capabilities we\u2019re building at Eastman that you\u2019re going to hear a lot more about on Tuesday.","Dan Rizzo","And then forgive me if you already mentioned this but did you talk about potentially repatriating cash just what it contains in the tax code and what that means?","Curt Espeland","So when you look about the repatriation that\u2019s really not a material issue for us. We've always been able to move our cash freely. So the impact of the repatriation is really on the mandatory piece that 8% piece that was assumed in our calculation. So truly not a cash issue for us other than we're having to pay that transitional attacks as we migrate to the new territorial tax system.","Mark Costa","So in summary, I just want to say that we\u2019re incredibly proud of our teams working hard everywhere to drive volume, manage cost and deliver an outstanding year of 13% EPS growth and tremendous free cash flow in 2017 demonstrating our ability to grow both of our specialty businesses which is now becoming above 70% of our total earnings.","And we're really excited about Innovation Day next week where we\u2019re going to walk through how we\u2019re going to keep driving that, keep improving these businesses, stabilize and improve fibers and our growth model allows us to sustain this year-over-year. So look forward to seeing you guys on Tuesday morning. Thank you.","Greg Riddle","Thanks for joining us again this morning. Go ahead Jennifer.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. Also this call will be broadcast live on Eastman's website at www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Thank you, Jake, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Costa, Executive Vice President, Specialty Polymers, Coatings and Adhesives.","Before we begin, I'll cover 3 items. First, during this call, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations for first quarter and full year 2012 and the acquisition of Solutia. Actual results could differ materially from our plans and expectations. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results news release and in our news release announcing the agreement to acquire Solutia, both of which are on our website and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for third quarter 2011 and the Form 10-K to be filed for full year 2011.","Second, certain Eastman financial measures referenced in this presentation are non-GAAP financial measures such as earnings per share, operating earnings and cash flow from operating activities that exclude asset impairments or restructuring charges and early debt extinguishment costs. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the asset impairments and restructuring charges and early debt extinguishment costs, are available on our fourth quarter and full year financial results news release and the tables accompanying the news release, which are both available at www.investors.eastman.com.","Third, this morning we issued a news release, which is available on our website, announcing a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia. I direct you to review the sections in the release regarding where you can find additional information about the transaction that provide additional details about the participants in the merger solicitation and about information for the nonsolicitation. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Last night, we announced our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and then this morning, we announced we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia. So I'll start this morning with a few slides about our strong 2011 earnings and then I'll spend most of the time this morning talking about why we're excited to be acquiring this great company, Solutia. ","Last night, we announced our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results, yes, then this morning it was Solutia. Our agenda this morning begins with a quick review of our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. I'm going to do an overview of the transaction and I'll walk through the strategic rationale for our acquisition of Solutia. Then we'll do a quick overview of Solutia, which I'm sure many of you are familiar with. And then Curt will discuss our financial summary and our EPS forecast for 2012 and 2013, and I'll end with a quick summary before we turn it over to questions. So starting with a recap of our fourth quarter results on Slide 4.","Revenue increased by 18%, mainly due to higher selling prices, which increased in response to higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings declined year-over-year primarily in the Specialty Plastics and PCI segments. The primary driver for Specialty Plastics was lower sales volume and lower capacity utilization. For PCI, higher selling prices were more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs. EPS of $0.71, slightly above last year. Still, our second best fourth quarter EPS in our history, and this was achieved we think in a challenging, uncertain environment and underscores that our businesses are solid even in the most difficult environments.","Looking at our full year results on Slide 6. Our EPS of $4.56 is an annual record, eclipsing the record from 2010. Sales revenue was up 23%, and the increase was across the company. Operating earnings increased significantly in 2011 compared with 2010 as all of our 4 segments had year-over-year earnings growth. Fiber's operating earnings were a record, and 2011 was the eighth straight year for earnings growth. And even CASPI now has grown their operating earnings 3 years in a row at better than a 10% rate. And we've now grown our EPS by about 140% since 2009. The appendix to this presentation has the remainder of our normal earning slide deck for your information. ","But now I'm going to transition into discussing our acquisition of Solutia that we announced earlier this morning.","So we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia for $22 in cash and 0.12 shares of Eastman stock. Total enterprise value for the transaction is $4.7 billion, which includes $3.4 billion of equity value and the assumption of $1.3 billion of Solutia debt. Based on last 12 months EBITDA for Solutia, the multiple paid excluding the cost and tax synergies is approximately 9x. This represents a 42% premium to yesterday's closing price on the common stock. ","Moving next to the financial impact, we expect this transaction will be immediately accretive to earnings upon close and will be substantially accretive to our 2013 EPS. We've also identified approximately $100 million of cost synergies, which we expect to achieve by the end of 2013, and Curt will talk more about these in a few minutes.","There will also be a significant benefit from the utilization of Solutia's NOLs, and we expect our overall tax rate will decline. In addition, after this transaction is completed, Eastman will generate free cash flow of approximately $1 billion over the next 2 years. Conditions for closing include approval by Solutia shareholders and regulatory approvals, and we expect the transaction to close sometime midyear of 2012. ","Now over on Page 8. You may recall back at our 2011 Investor Day, I showed a slide very similar to this describing our strategic focus for growth. As we looked at acquiring Solutia, it became clear that it would hit each one of these focus areas. ","So starting with growing our core businesses, Eastman and Solutia have significant overlapping complementary and adjacent end markets, in particular, the auto and architectural markets. We also see the combination of technologies in areas such as polymers, overlapping business capabilities as potentially driving significant revenue opportunity. We've also had a bias toward growing in emerging markets. And back at our Investor Day, we told you that our 2010 revenue in emerging markets was over $2 billion. Including Solutia, 2011 revenue for Eastman would have been greater than $3 billion in those markets. And with the addition of Solutia, Eastman will be adding significant manufacturing capacity in Asia over the next couple of years to meet growth. ","We are also well positioned to take advantage of a growing middle class buying more premium products. We've also been focused on sustainable businesses, and this transaction expands our current portfolio in areas such as energy efficiency and safety. ","Lastly, given the strength of our balance sheet, we said we would use acquisitions and joint ventures as a means to execute our strategy, and this acquisition moves Eastman in the right direction on all key parameters we have defined for our growth strategy.","For those of you who are not that familiar with Solutia, we have an overview on Slide 9. They're a global leader in specialty chemicals and performance materials. They operate in 3 business segments: Advanced Interlayers, Performance Films and Technical Specialties, with a market leadership position in each segment. Their last 12 months revenue was over $2 billion with an EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. As you can see from the pie chart, Solutia is balanced across regions, with 14% of last 12 months revenue in China. ","Next on Slide 10, you can see both Eastman and Solutia have actively improved their respective portfolios over the past several years. Solutia exited commodity businesses, including nylon and feed ingredients. They also added to their portfolio more specialty businesses such as Flexsys, which is in their Technical Specialties segment. And they expanded their Saflex product line in the Advanced Interlayers segment. Eastman exited underperforming product lines in the CASPI segment and also divested our PET business with the sale of our last site completed in January 2011. ","We've also added more specialty businesses with the acquisition of Genovique in 2010 and the expansion of our Eastman Tritan copolyester product lines. With these actions, both companies have improved their portfolios, have market-leading position in a number of their key products, and this leads to superior financial performance.","On Slide 11, you can see the substantial presence of Solutia and Eastman have in Asia Pacific, particularly China. For 2011, Eastman had approximately 23% of revenue in Asia Pacific. Looking out through 2015, as you can see on the bar chart on the left, we expect growth to continue in the Asia Pacific region. The growth will be in areas such as acetate tow, Crystex and EVA, and we expect Solutia is well positioned to take advantage of trends such as an increasing middle class, which is buying more premium products in the move toward more sustainable products. We expect the overall growth in Asia Pacific and the investments we are making will lead to revenues well above $3 billion by 2015.","Turning next to Slide 12. Our continued geographic diversity also remains a source of strength, although sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased only slightly. Adding Solutia to our portfolio will accelerate our growth in Asia Pac and China specifically, as I mentioned. In addition, the amount of our revenue in North America declines on a pro forma basis meaningfully below 50%. And with Solutia, we are diversifying our asset base as 11 of their 24 manufacturing sites are outside of North America.","Turning next to Slide 13, to the end markets for Solutia Eastman and on a pro forma basis, you see the 3 pie charts there. Solutia has a significant presence in the auto and architectural markets. For auto, these include glass and tires and OEMs, replacement aftermarket glass and replacement tires. In architectural, these include new builds and energy solutions. ","Looking at Eastman on a pro forma basis, our revenue and transportation increases to 16% from 7%, and then building and construction increases to 19%, including energy solutions. We continue to have diverse end markets with no one end market being dominant. And with the addition of Solutia's market presence, we will have a deeper understanding of our most important end markets. ","Finally, our end market and geographic diversity will continue to be a source of earnings stability, we believe.","Slide 14, one my favorite slides, more clearly shows that we are a top-tier North American chemical company with the Solutia transaction. You can see on a pro forma basis where we compare to specialty and diversified chemical companies. Our combined EBITDA margin of approximately 20% compares very favorably to peers. And with EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion, we are one of the largest companies in our space. ","Now I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 15, we have an overview of the financing for this transaction. You can see in the table that the new debt financing will be $3.5 billion, and we expect this to be composed of both a low-interest term loan and public debt. In addition, we have available bridge financing with commitments in place from Barclays and Citi. Eastman equity issued to Solutia shareholders totaled $700 million, or about 20% of the overall purchase price. And we will use cash from Eastman and Solutia balance sheets expected to total $600 million.","A new revolver facility of $750 million will remain undrawn at closing. At closing, the pro forma debt to EBITDA ratio will be approximately 2.8x. Given the expected strong financial profile of both companies, free cash flow over the next 2 years is expected to be approximately $1 billion, allowing Eastman to quickly delever. And given the strength of our cash generation, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders with our strong annual dividend rate of $1.04 per share. Lastly, I reiterate that we remain firmly committed to maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating.","On Slide 16, we give you some detail on our cost, tax and revenue synergies. Starting with cost, we have clearly identified cost synergies that approach $100 million. These include reducing corporate costs, which you would expect with 2 public companies. We also see potential for synergies in the purchase of raw materials, and we expect this combination will result in improved manufacturing and supply chain processes. We expect to achieve the $100 million of cost synergies by the end of 2013, and we expect to update you on our progress as we move forward.","Moving to tax synergies, there are a source of value for this transaction. Solutia has approximately $1.5 billion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can utilize over the next 15 years, of which about half can be utilized over the next 3 years on an accelerated basis. There are also foreign tax credits totaling approximately $150 million that will be utilized over the next 10 years. And the combination of Solutia's geographical profile and our anticipated tax structure should enable us to reduce our corporate tax rate by a couple of hundred basis points.","On the revenue synergies, we view these as upsides, but we think they are very real. A couple of examples of leveraging technology from Eastman and Solutia. First, Solutia has solid position and deep customer connect in the tire market through its Crystex and Santoflex product lines. One of CASPI's most exciting new growth platforms is the opportunity we see to enable innovation for energy efficiency in tires. We already have growing sales of hydrocarbon resins that we believe would be accelerated. More significantly, we have been investing in research on novel product development, leveraging for -- leveraging our profitable cellulose ester product lines. We believe that both of these technologies can address significant unmet needs in the tire industry. Solutia's current position in the tire market should help to accelerate these developments.","Another example is exploding the intersection of Eastman's polymer materials technologies with Solutia's conductive coatings technologies to serve the increasing performance needs of the rapidly expanding touchscreen LCD and the flexible circuits markets. Complementary business capabilities, including leveraging our world-class market development capability and similar business models between CASPI and Specialty Plastics, and Solutia's businesses. And I as already mentioned, we have overlap in the auto and architectural markets which deepens our understanding of these markets, which we expect will lead to additional opportunities. ","Our track record from the numerous successful acquisitions and divestitures we've completed and the knowledge we've gained from these transactions gives us a lot of confidence that we will realize the cost and tax synergies we've listed here and that we'll make good progress on the revenue synergies.","We have a clear path to completion of this transaction, as you can see on Slide 17. The acquisition requires the approval of Solutia stockholders. We will also be working on receiving the necessary regulatory approvals. There are also standard and customary closing conditions. There is not a financing contingency, and the termination fee is $102 million. We expect to close this transaction by midyear 2012.","On Slide 18, you can see this transaction is expected to result in significant earnings per share accretion. For 2012, we expect EPS of approximately $5 a share. Included in this expectation is accretion from the Solutia acquisition plus some of the expected cost synergies. We also expect earnings growth from our organic growth initiatives and the acquisitions we made in 2011. We are also increasing our 2013 earnings per share guidance to greater than $6 per share. This includes greater accretion from the Solutia acquisition and additional benefits from our organic growth initiatives. We also expect additional benefits from cost synergies. With this acquisition, you can see from our earnings expectations we have accelerated our earnings growth. ","And now I'll turn it back over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Curt. So, if we walk through the details of the transaction this morning, I think you can see that the combination of Eastman and Solutia results in a pretty compelling value. From a strategic standpoint, the complementary and adjacent end markets, the combination of technologies and business capabilities, and the acceleration of growth in Asia Pacific, specifically China, all make clear that Solutia is a strong addition to Eastman.","Both the cost and tax synergies make this a compelling financial transaction, with revenue synergies as an upside. We expect to be able to complete this transaction while remaining committed to our investment-grade credit rating. Transaction has an attractive return on capital. And lastly, the transaction is highly accretive to Eastman's earnings per share, in effect accelerating our EPS growth and making it clear that we are on track to deliver continued earnings growth for the next several years.  ","Now as I turn it back over to Greg, I'll just mention I asked Mark Costa to join us this morning. Many of you know Mark. He leads our CASPI and Specialty Plastics business, also marketing sales innovation and the supply chain. But the reason -- main reason he's on the call is because Mark led the business due diligence that we did with Solutia as Mark led the financials. So when we get to the questions, probably all 3 of us will be pitching in to answer. ","And with that, let me turn it back over to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Thanks very much. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will begin with Jeff Quinn with Solutia.","Jeffry N. Quinn","I just wanted to call just to say hello and to say that here at Solutia, we totally agree with Jim's perspective on this transaction. And it is indeed a transformative transaction, and we at Solutia are very excited to be joining a world-class diversified chemicals producer like Eastman. Not only does the transaction deliver meaningful premium to our shareholders over our recent trading price, it enables our investors to benefit over the long term in the combined company due to the stock component in the purchase price. The Board of Solutia and I unanimously agreed that this transaction was in the best interest of our shareholders, but also was in the best interest of the other stakeholders. Our employees, our customers, our suppliers and all the communities around the world where we have operations. The combined company is going to have the financial strength, diversified and complementary mix of premium products, a geographic footprint to accelerate growth and to take advantage of the powerful global trends that are driving demand for our products, including rapid growth in emerging markets and improving living standards across the globe and increased urbanization. When evaluating this transaction, it was very important to me and the board that any transaction would see as being paired with a company that has a close strategic and financial fit, as well as a fit with the values and culture, that we have worked so hard to instill here at Solutia over the last 8 years. With Eastman's complementary operations and the vision of Jim and his team, our Advanced Interlayers, Performance Films and Technical Specialties businesses are poised to continue to build on the success we've achieved over the last few years. Solutia and Eastman are highly complementary to one another not only in terms of our businesses, geographic presence and products, but also in terms of what we stand for. Both companies are known for innovation, investment in high-growth markets worldwide and the highest level of customer support and service. We also share a deep and abiding commitment to operational excellence, developing products that respond directly to market demand and delivering value to our stakeholders. ","So, Jim, for all of us here at Solutia, I just want to say that we are terribly pleased with the transaction and look forward to working with you and your team to continue to create value for our shareholders, and we're very excited about what lies ahead and look forward to the future.","James P. Rogers","Thanks Jeff, and I'll return the compliment. It's been a pleasure to work with you and your team. I think you did a great job for your shareholders and all the rest to your stakeholders. So my only word of advice is try and get some sleep this weekend, okay?","Operator","And now we'll move to a question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, as you know, a lot of value at Solutia is in their Crystex business, a business that they keep under close scrutiny given its very high margins, very high market share. Can you go through the due diligence you've done on Cyrstex to get comfort that business is sustainable both in terms of the margins and its competitive technology differentiation?","James P. Rogers","Yes, we'll give some cursory comments. Again, I mean we're probably 6 months away from the close. But I want to make a general comment, then I'm going to get Mark to add some color as well. Let me just tell you overall, I was pleased with the way we work together with the Solutia team in terms of being able to work quickly but also very diligently and to get all our questions answered, not just on this particular business but financial, tax, markets, et cetera. So I feel very good about how we made our decision, what we were able to factor in. But Mark, do you want to comment more specifically on Crystex?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. Dave, it's a great question. And certainly it's one of the products we like best in the portfolio of Solutia. As you pointed out, it is a nice high-margin business. We like the industry structure there, which is reinforced by their leadership position and the quality of their products. So, it's not just their positioning capacity and cost relative to the small competitors that their product is a much higher performing product and delivering value and efficiency in the tire operation. It gives them a nice, sustainable position in the cost in the final tire being less than 1%, and the importance of performance gives them a very sustainable position, where you'd be very hesitant to switch to other products. We also like that there's no significant capacity on the horizon that would threaten the margins in that business. Certainly not at the capability that Solutia has. It's very similar also to the kind of positions we have in CASPI. When you look at our cellulose esters and coatings or our texanol and architectural paint, it's a very, very similar kind of cost and performance position that we have. It's the kind of business we understand quite well and know how to run. And it's the kind of the product portfolio we like best inside Eastman.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. Jim, can you comment on whether this transaction began at auction or was it a singular negotiation?","James P. Rogers","Well, I think that all that kind of detail, all the good stuff people like to read at night after they go home, that's all going to come out in the proxy. I'll just say from our side, we entered into a very, let's say, exhaustive process sometime last summer, working with our board about our strategy roadmap and decided that we would really look at the inorganic opportunities that are out there. And I can tell you that Solutia was #1 then and has stayed #1 through that whole process. I mean we looked at quite a few different possibilities for ourselves. And this was -- this rose to the top. I'll also say just on a personal note, I've been here since 1999. This is the best thing I've seen in a major way for Eastman to take a step forward on their growth. So we had a very thorough process. They rose to the top. We entered into discussions, and you see the result of that today.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jim, last thing, just on the fourth cracker down in Longview, what's your current thinking on that cracker going forward?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I'm glad you raised that because I was hoping we'd get a chance to talk about -- a little bit about the olefin picture. And I may get Mark to comment again as well because CASPI is affected by our cracking spreads and what we're doing there, as well as he's got the supply chain. But in general, I think things are looking up. Just as a recap, we restarted a cracker, I guess that was like early '10, right, and we think the economics of that was probably a good $30 million of EBIT. It's one way to think about it. We took a couple other smaller actions adding a furnace to one of those crackers and another little step that will probably kick in about $20 million of EBIT when I look at, what, '13 over '12 because I guess that will come on into '12. And then we've been talking about that we want to restart that fourth cracker. What's rising to the top is the idea of an olefins conversion unit, and we are in discussions now with the potential partners on that unit. And it's the kind of thing that would probably kick in, in 2014 such that we would get earnings growth, say, a little '14 over '13, but then '15 over '14. And that olefin conversion unit, our piece of the economics of that -- and as I'm talking, I'm realizing I'm saying everything Mark probably would have said. But our piece of that is going to be greater than the last cracker that we started up. In other words, the EBIT should be quite good on that unit as well. So there'll be more coming on that. Then maybe a better alternative than just restarting that fourth cracker. Is that fair? And maybe while around, if I could just get Mark to comment what we're seeing on the propane propylene spreads as well.","Mark J. Costa","Sure. I mean I think that we certainly feel very good about the long-term spreads in olefins versus the propane, ethane. In the short term, we're also feeling better in the last couple of weeks relative to where we've been in the fourth quarter, as I'm sure you've seen Exxon is going out with a nomination, the $0.20 increase in propylene. And so there's a lot of discussion out there in the marketplace around how propylene prices may increase significantly here as we go into February and March, and certainly that would be an attractive improvement for spreads for us given our position in the -- with our crackers and some upside to earnings.","James P. Rogers","Yes, just to be a fair, those nominations usually you end up with some percent of that, so these are just early indications. But that's probably a little better than we felt 3 months ago when we were talking about bottoming in the fourth and first quarter, maybe starting up in the second, maybe we'll start up a little sooner than that.","Operator","And now we will move to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm looking at your Slide 18, and it looks as if Eastman on its own might have grown something like -- your expectation for 2012 might have been for something like 3% to 4% growth in earnings and EPS. But with Solutia now, obviously you're expecting double-digit type of growth. Is that predicated on Solutia coming into the portfolio on July 1? If the deal is delayed, how do you think about the 2012 earnings and Solutia's impact on that?","James P. Rogers","Yes, expectation is right around midyear, Frank. So and by the way, the slide is just representative, so don't get your ruler out and measure that little slide, which you've probably already done, so it's too late. But I guess what I'm saying is, I mean, we thought we would have some growth in our earnings this year whether we did an acquisition or not. So that was just the straight up running the core businesses. We knew we were going to use cash, use our balance sheet, so either buying back stock, doing small acquisitions. So, there was going to be growth on top of that, and that's the guidance we would have given. Let's just say, we have this beautiful opportunity to add a property like Solutia to our portfolio. And if it happens in midyear, we'll get about half the year of those earnings. We'll have captured some of the synergies right up front. Obviously, this is kind of excluding the onetime cost of getting the deal done, et cetera. So kind of factor in a midyear and then you can head for that $5.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I see, okay. Because it was interesting looking at the -- your release last night, and I saw the pace of share buyback was materially lower in the fourth quarter. And obviously, I realized why this morning. And then, I guess, lastly, on the revenue synergy side, I know Curt you talked a little bit about the tire market and the touchscreen market. I was wondering if you could give us a preliminary look in terms of sizes of revenue synergies out there, either in macro or at least rank order, where you think the best overlap is and where you can really drive top line growth with Solutia now part of the portfolio.","James P. Rogers","And Frank, let me take your questions. I want Curt to just comment just briefly on the kind of some of the cost synergies and the work we went through to identify that. Then I'm really going to turn your revenue synergy question to Mark, because a lot of the synergies are going to be with businesses that he runs today. But Curt, just in general.","Curtis E. Espeland","So again, Jim mentioned the level of diligence we were able to complete. Let me just add, first on the tax side, we feel very good about the tax benefits that come with this transaction, both in the next several years and longer term. On the cost synergies, we've been looking through different components and different buckets. Obviously, we're trying to be very mindful to make sure both businesses are still operating strong. We made some early assessments. We feel comfortable with the target that we've established. And as we get further into understanding the infrastructure and the footprint, we may adjust that number. But right now, we feel good about the $100 million.","James P. Rogers","Yes, and just on the revenue synergies, I don't feel like we had to factor a lot of that into our valuation models. But I want Mark just to talk about what the potential could be.","Mark J. Costa","Sir, I'm just going to give 2 examples. The first one is on the tires, as you asked, Frank. With tires, we certainly see some significant opportunities today. We already have resin sales in tires. As the regulations are driving for more fuel efficiency in tires and they're looking to also, of course, maintain wear and traction at the same time, which is what they call the magic triangle, you're always trying to formulate that tire just like you are formulating a coating to get optimal performance in that magic triangle. It turns out that some of our hydrocarbon resins and even more significantly some of our cellulose ester products can perform some pretty interesting improvements in optimizing those performance parameters that have us quite excited. And as I said, we're already seeing some resin sales. So I think that there's at least $100 million of upside around that opportunity for us. It's still a bit early, so I don\u2019t want to get into specifics. And those are relatively high-margin products. So it's a meaningful opportunity for us, and we certainly have a deep respect for the quality of relationships that Solutia has with tire companies and their application development capability and believe they'll bring a lot to our efforts in this area in improving our probability of success and accelerating it as well. I think the other place where we see significant opportunity, Frank, is in the combination of Specialty Plastics and our capabilities there and Solutia's coatings capability and performance films. There's a lot of opportunity there around combining those 2 technologies. Rarely do you get the opportunity to work both on the -- when you have control of both the coatings and the substrate. Today, they're limited by commodity PET as a substrate. When you look at the challenges you have in improving performance, it's usually something around heat resistance, clarity in the optical properties, chemical resistance and toughness that you're trying to improve in the substrate and the coating. When you take our copolyesters and Tritan and our unique world capability, to do modification of those substrates combined with our coating capability, it opens up a lot of innovation in conductive films and flexible circuits that we're pretty excited about.","James P. Rogers","And Frank, before we go to next question, Frank had raised the slowing down on our stock buyback. I was just going ask Curt. We just couldn't help ourselves, we had to go back out of curiosity and see what the average price we had paid for the stock we'd bought back over the last.","Curtis E. Espeland","So, if you look at last 2 years, 2010 and 2011, we bought $600 million in shares or roughly 15 million shares at an average price of $40 a share.","Operator","We'll now move to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could elaborate on how exactly you arrived at the valuation coming down to 9x trailing EBITDA. What metrics did you tend to focus on and what the approach was there? And then related to that, how did you arrive at the cash and equity split? Not sure what level of conversations you may have had with the rating agencies, but perhaps you could help us understand how that was apportioned.","James P. Rogers","Okay, sure. On the first part, the valuation, we didn't reinvent the wheel. The way we approached it was the way everyone does, basically, on a number of fronts. I'd say we're mainly driven by thinking of cash flow, so you have all your discounted cash flow analysis and you really work from there. And of course, you're forced to look at other multiples of transactions, you're forced to look at how things are trading in the marketplace. And as you know, both boards will have, or do have, fairness opinions from their banks. So the valuation is going to be a complicated process as that looks at a number of things. Those of you know me know I always start from my financial background. So if I could really dumb it down, it had to be a good deal. And I think putting the 2 companies together created value in a way that made us the logical buyer. But I would say, most of my thinking was strictly driven off the cash flows and what we thought we could do with these businesses. In terms of the -- and by the way, so the multiple you say is, of course, before the synergies and before we look at those tax benefits. On the cash versus stock, obviously, a negotiated item. I think Jeff did very well for his shareholders. I think they got a great deal, nice premium. I think that we, from our side, very protective of our investment-grade rating. We think by being investment grade, we maintain our flexibility to pursue all the growth alternatives that we see in front of us. And remember, we were pretty content with the portfolio of organic opportunities we have. This was just an extraordinary chance for us to take advantage of inorganic opportunity. The rating agencies, I don't want to preempt their story, I think they'll be out later today, but we think we have a very strong credit profile and hopefully, you don't have long to wait to hear what they think.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then following closure at the deal, Jim, can you comment on what the future of the portfolio may look like? It's not obvious to me that you would have any subsequent divestitures or peel-offs either for antitrust or strategic reasons. But how do you think the combination affects your future deployment capital?","James P. Rogers","That's a good question and I -- just to pick up on that, I really don't think there's much overlap at all that would give rise during the HSR issues or antitrust issues. We like their portfolio. They got some very strong businesses. I think it's premature to kind of walk through each one. I think the places where the Solutia management today realizes they need to do some work and maybe adjust their game plan, we agree with them. And so we'll be watching what they do over the next several months. Remember, they're still running this company until the middle of the year. But net-net, we like their portfolio of businesses. And when you hear us Eastman execs stand up and talk about strong core businesses, we're just going to have more strong core businesses to talk about.","Operator","Now moving to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of the utilization of the tax assets that Solutia has, is there anything unique about Eastman that allows you to use them in a way that someone else couldn't use them?","Curtis E. Espeland","Jeff, this is Curt. I think it's fair to say that our tax positions are very complementary. If you think about Eastman as a U.S. multinational, we have a fairly large U.S. taxable income, and that enables us to utilize the results of the NOLs. That would be harder to say for someone that is not a strategic U.S. chemical company like Eastman.","James P. Rogers","Or a private equity player.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And what about the entity structure, can you just elaborate a tiny bit on that as to how that would give you extra tax synergies?","Curtis E. Espeland","So what that would entail is a couple things. And again, there's still a lot of work to do between now and closing to finalize that. But part of it is simply just their foreign income versus our foreign income and just the benefits and attributes that provides. And then just when you take 2 companies like this, you have the ability to look at your overall tax structure, do some effective tax planning and they have an impact on your overall effective tax rate. So we could be coming between 30% and 31% on an overall combined basis, which will be very attractive for us.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then in terms of your core operations, can you give me an idea of what the sequential volume change was in CASPI and PCI and Specialty Plastics?","James P. Rogers","Over what period are you thinking, Jeff?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","From the third quarter to the fourth quarter.","James P. Rogers","Well, If I could just in general, I think we've got some tables in there. But in general, third to fourth was mainly the typical seasonal downturn with -- and then add on top of it more destocking than we've seen in probably 3 of the 4 businesses, right? So fibers is almost -- there's nothing to think about or talk about there, just once again, excellent performance. The other 3 businesses, they each had their own story. Specialty Plastics, probably the biggest story in terms of destocking and how their business came off. I think maybe what I'll do since I got the guy who has CASPI and SPBO in the room, maybe I'll let Mark just comment on third to fourth. And then maybe also a look forward at what you see coming back in the first quarter.","Mark J. Costa","Sure. Jeff, on Specialty Plastics, as Jim mentioned, I would really characterize it more as a first half versus second half story, where we saw a pretty material drop in demand in the second half. I would note that, that drop in demand was in line with what we're seeing in all the other sort of comparative polymer industries. So if you go to CMAI or some other source and look at demand drops in polycarbonate PBC and some other polymers there, you'll see a pretty significant drop, too, and it's mostly what we can tell is the slowdown in the economy and the typical pull with inventory correction you get in the polymers industry. There's no question that on a modest basis, we probably lost a little bit of share there as we've increased prices pretty substantially through the year to cover PX. But I would note that I feel very good about the business, our ability to maintain margins and value propositions that have stuck with our customers gives me good confidence this year. We've already seen a good recovery in orders in January for Specialty Plastics, so we feel like we're back on track there. In CASPI, I'd characterize it more as your typical seasonal adjustments of volumes. I would say that it also was more of a second half story, where some of our high-margin products like cellulose esters saw a drop in demand both third and fourth quarter. What was unique in the fourth quarter wasn't so much a drop in revenue from third to fourth, it was a correction in production rates and inventory management that led to unabsorbed fixed costs. The spreads in both businesses held up quite well, and I'm feeling good about them in the first quarter.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, I guess, lastly for Curt. In the $100 million synergies that you've identified, in ballpark terms, what would it cost you to achieve those?","Curtis E. Espeland","When we look at integration costs, we're talking about probably an equivalent amount $100 million over that same time period, 18 months.","Operator","And now we move to next question and that will come from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Currently, are there any synergies in terms of raw material? Are you -- are both Solutia and Eastman buying similar raw materials?","James P. Rogers","Yes, we are. And again, just so I don't do all the talking, Mark, you've got supply chain. I think we both know the answer because this is one we like. So I'm going to give the good one to Mark. Go ahead.","Mark J. Costa","So we certainly see quite a bit of overlap in some opportunities there. So if you look at Solutia's top 10 raw material purchases, we either make or buy 8 of those top 10 raw materials. So there's quite a bit of overlap that we see either in leveraging production assets we have or improving our combined buy and some different kinds of swaps we might be able to pursue to optimize our cost position. So we think it's a good opportunity area. I think we've been relatively conservative so far in the value what we think we can get from there.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And then in terms of customer overlap, it sounds like there is a fair amount. Could you give us a sense of percent of businesses or revenues that you guys overlap?","James P. Rogers","Yes, we probably don't want to do that at this stage. I mean what we thought was perhaps more useful was just to give you some examples. And so that's what Mark did earlier when he was talking about, for example, the tire customers or when you get into film. So let us beg off on that for a little bit, and we'll be able to talk about that more in the quarters to come.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just finally, in Specialty Plastics in the fourth quarter, I believe there was some planned maintenance. How much did that hurt earnings?","James P. Rogers","That was about a $5 million hit in the earnings in the fourth quarter.","Operator","We'll now move to the next question and that will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In Specialty Plastics, you had certain decline in volumes in 4Q. Can you just talk about that and what kind of ramp up do you see in 2012?","James P. Rogers","Yes, and again, I'm going to let Mark answer, but let me just say, we did -- there was some lower margin business that we were walking away from, so you probably do need to hear a little more color to get the understanding of really what's going on in the business. One of the things I'm most proud of is Tritan seems to be staying very strong because that's one of the places we're adding capacity, so we feel pretty good about that. But Mark, do you want to throw some more color on that?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. I mean it's a mixed story, PJ. There is part of it which is, as Jim mentioned, where we continue to see very good and continuous growth. So Tritan grew well over 20% year-over-year from '10 to '11, and we're continuing to see that growth into '12 as we just completed, mechanically, the second 30,000-ton expansion for Tritan in January. So we're feeling very good about that part. The second part I'd say is the displays industry, as you can probably see from a lot of other companies out there, went through a pretty rough patch in the second half of last year of severe destocking, and we saw the similar kind of significant drop in orders for displays. And we expect that to continue to be soft as that industry is still going through inventory correction in the first half of this year. But we expect a pretty strong recovery in that market. Overall, we think displays is going to continue to have very solid strong sort of 20-plus-percent growth in the downstream market that will make that business attractive. And then on the copolyesters, the core part of the business, that one is the one where we had more of the volume drop than Tritan of course. And that was just your typical inventory correction, as I mentioned earlier, that the whole polymer industry saw. And I do think we've seen good recovery across all markets in January as people are starting to come back and the market recovered from that destocking.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the merger, when you look at revenue synergies, is it fair to say that the chemistry overlap between the 2 companies is between Solutia's Performance Films business and your CASPI business?","James P. Rogers","Okay, more of the Specialty Plastics and more of the polymer chemistry in general. I don't know, Mark, do you want to add anything to that?","Mark J. Costa","I think that's right. I think we see a good connect in their polymer businesses and Specialty Plastics. I would say the CASPI connect is more with the rubber additives business, and where we see the connection there.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Jim, one last question on your Slide 14. You haven the pro forma company mapped out fine in terms of EBITDA. So when you look at the future, sort of longer term, what do you see? And do you see that you will digest this acquisition in the next couple of years and then try to continue to move to the left?","James P. Rogers","I think we've got -- we're thinking in terms of an 18-month plan. I think, again, you're going to see a pretty strong credit profile. So while pay down of debt is going to be one of the top priorities for cash, I don't think we have to go completely silent. I mean, obviously, in the next 12 months or so, after we close on the transaction, we're going to be very focused on doing this integration right and capturing at least what we promised. But I think we will be able to lift our heads up, continue pursuing the organic opportunities we got and there'll be a time at which we get more active again inorganically. And honestly, if I had to choose between the directions, yes, I'd rather go left than right. But I want to tell you something. This isn't so much an ego-driven culture that, well, we've just got to be bigger. We're really about creating shareholder value. What I feel the best about, when I look out over the next few years, is how we're kind of increasing, greatly increasing, I would say, the odds of year-over-year earnings growth for multiple years. So we had earnings growth '10 and over '09, '11 over '10. Now I'm seeing a pretty clear path to '12 over '11. I think we've just attacked on a cushion there. And then '13 over '12 for sure as I look at getting the synergies in. And '14 over '13, the same story. So you don't have to hit the ball out of the park every time, you just need to have that consistent track record of growing your earnings at this kind of rate. And we're going to look pretty darn good. So that's more the game plan, it's value creation and driving your earnings per share.","Operator","And now we'll move to a question from Harry Mateer with Barclays Capital.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Three questions for you. I guess first on the rating side, it sounds like you ran this by the agencies ahead of time. But just to put a finer point on it, are you comfortable running the business at low BBB or do you expect to retain your existing mid BBB ratings?","James P. Rogers","So again, I'm not going to steal the thunder from the agencies. They do their own releases, do their own analysis. I'm telling you we feel like we have a very strong credit profile. I'd be comfortable with either of those ratings. I mean, they're both investment grade. We like every much where we are, and I think we have maximum flexibility where we are.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And can you give us a sense for the anticipated mix of loans and bonds for the new debt financing?","James P. Rogers","It's not final yet but, Curt, why don\u2019t you tell him what we're thinking.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, we're working through aspects and we'll obviously see what the market does over the coming years. But we were looking at a mix of 5, 10 and 30 years. And then what's nice about the current market is the after tax rate on that debt is probably going to be closer to 3%.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the term loan, any sense for what the tenure of that is going to be?","Curtis E. Espeland","The term loan is a 5-year term loan with accelerating payments on the back end. But with the free cash flow profile you see here, you can see us paying that probably on a more accelerated pace.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay and then last just in terms of the Solutia debt, I know those bonds have some equity claw language. Can you share your expectations for how you're going to deal with that?","James P. Rogers","Not yet, that's still to be discussed. And there'll be the appropriate time to say something on that.","Curtis E. Espeland","And just to be clear, maybe on the term loan, that's going to be about $1 billion of the debt mix.","Operator","And now moving to a question from Andrew Feinman with Iridian Asset Management.","Andrew Feinman","Well, first of all, I just wanted to say that, Jim, you told us that when you spend some money, it's going to be something where right out of the box your owners are going to like it and it's going to make your stock go up. And sure enough, the stocks have 4 points pre-market, so thank you for living up to your commitment. So how many shares of Solutia are there? I'm just trying to figure out how many shares of Eastman there will be created.","James P. Rogers","I think it's about 15 million shares of Eastman, because it's, what, 124 million?","Curtis E. Espeland","About 124 million shares will be on the Solutia side, and we'll be issuing about 15 million, which, like I mentioned, is almost equivalent to the 15 million we bought back over the last 2 years.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Paul Leming with Ticonderoga.","Paul Leming - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division","I'm just curious whether or not you could highlight what you believe are some of the key end-market growth drivers that acquiring Solutia will really give you a greater exposure to you. You've talked about tires. Beyond tires, what are the other key markets, end markets that you really see as strong growth propositions for Solutia?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. Great question, and certainly the automotive tire part is part of the story, but I wouldn't leave it there. The architectural market we see is very attractive and especially at this time of the cycle in the architectural, we're buying in at a good position in the demand trends for architectural. But they -- Solutia has some great products, bringing energy efficiency and safety and aesthetic performance in the architectural market, and we see that as quite exciting. I'd also say that applies to the automotive window market as well and some of the things we're doing in Performance Films for the same set of drivers. So as you see a world becoming much more conscious about energy efficiency, looking to upgrade the quality of products that they have in aesthetics and performance, they're in a great spot to leverage both those trends of architectural and automotive and performance films and Saflex. And then we see the electronic space, which is certainly very high growth and an attractive part of our Specialty Plastics business, leveraging that same set of trends. And what they have emerging in performance films creates a whole new market space that, while it's still relatively small at Solutia, I think it has tremendous upside growth to it for both companies, especially as we bring a very unique capability together because we'll be the only player in the industry that has both the ability to modify substrates as well as coatings at the same time, so we'll be very uniquely positioned.","Operator","And that question will come from Greg Goodnight with UBS.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It sounds like to me after the Sterling acquisition you guys are trying to piece together the old Monsanto chemical. You wouldn't comment on that? A couple of questions for you. You mentioned about half of the NOLs being accessible in 3 years. Could you comment on what you think your eventual ability to capture the rest of the NOLs or the domiciled where you will have access to them?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. The NOLs, as you know when you have NOLs, you inherit certain limitations as well as it has to complement your own. But right now, we feel we'll get half in the next 3 years and we'll get all of it over the next 10 to 12 years.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. It may be a bit early to answer this question. Could you comment on your access to the historic patent state of Solutia and Monsanto? And have you ascribed any value to that? You think you can ring some value out of the intellectual property that this thing brings to the party?","James P. Rogers","I guess all I want to say now because as you might imagine valuation is going to be a topic very quickly here, speak around it a little bit. But let me just say, we were able to do the diligence we needed to do, look at the things we needed to look at in order to reach what we thought was an appropriate value.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And speaking of value, if you add the NOLs and the synergies and the like you're talking multiples more in the -- potential multiples more in the 6 to 7 range, which seems very attractive. Do you think that's a reasonable analysis?","James P. Rogers","I think the things you mentioned do have value, and I think it's -- again, let me just say, I think it's quite attractive for our shareholders, but I also realize that the folks on the other side of the table got a very good deal. I think they got a nice premium, and I think they continue to get some upside as they have a piece of our stock. So good deal all around.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. My thinking is in knowing both your companies, I worked for Solutia for a long time, and I would comment that the cultures are extremely similar, and it's very striking in that. I think the Solutia folks, employees certainly ought to be very happy with this. To me it goes beyond a friendly takeover and the sort of approach as a marriage. What do you think about the 2 cultures?","James P. Rogers","I appreciate that. We agree with you completely. I can tell you that the -- everyone we've met at Solutia were truly professional, and it felt like a good fit from day one. So I can tell you, I'm just so pleased that we were able to get together.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay, thanks again for joining us this morning. A web replay will be available on January 30. Have a great day.","Operator","And with that, that will conclude your conference for today.

Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Co., Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Thank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Josh Morgan, Manager of Investor Relations. Before we begin, I'll cover 3 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's second quarter 2014 financial results news release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for 2013 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for second quarter 2014. Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation excludes certain non-core or nonrecurring costs, charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in our first quarter 2014 financial results news release, which can be found at eastman.com in the Investors section. Projection of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the second quarter news release.","Lastly, we have posted slides that accompany our remarks for this morning's call on our website in the Presentations and Events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'll start on Slide 3, and I'll begin this morning with the key highlights from our second quarter. We delivered solid EPS in the -- both the second quarter and the first half despite the challenges we faced, and we are on track for another year of solid earnings growth in 2014. We continue to expect this will be our fifth consecutive year of earnings growth and remain confident we will continue to grow earnings in 2015 and beyond. Earnings growth is a reflection of our leadership position in key markets, the diversity of the end markets we serve and our broad geographic footprint, as well as the value of our vertical integration. I've spoken to you previously about Eastman's specific actions we're taking to increase our earnings in 2014. We continue to see strong growth in our high-value products, driven by favorable macro trends, and expect this growth will accelerate in the second half of the year. And we continue to benefit from the integration of Solutia, including the impact on our effective tax rate. However, we also have some actions that are taking longer than we had expected. I have previously mentioned that the technology licensing we have been expecting in 2014 is more likely to be completed in 2015. While we are seeing good growth with the switch to non-phthalate plasticizers, this growth is currently being offset by competitive pricing pressure, and we're experiencing some softness in demand in our heat transfer fluids due to delays and cancellations of industrial products -- projects. As a result, on balance, we're moving a little slower than we'd expected on these actions, meaning, some of the benefit will spill over into 2015. But despite this and the other challenges we have faced so far in 2014, we remain on track for 2014 EPS guidance we gave you in January. Also, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of BPA Aviation Turbine Oil business. This acquisition expands our footprint in the growing aviation fluids market. In addition, we issued $500 million of 30-year notes at an attractive interest rate on 4.65%. And lastly, we generated $234 million of free cash flow in the quarter, once again, confirming the ability of our portfolio to deliver very strong cash flow.","On Slide 4, I'll cover our second quarter corporate results, and I'll start with some of the challenges we faced in the quarter. First, we had an unplanned outage at our Kingsport facility, which is our largest manufacturing site due to a widespread power disruption. Although you never want something like this to happen, I am proud to say there were no injuries or impact to the environment, and that is due to the quick and professional response of the Eastman team. Financial impact was an approximately $10 million negative hit in the quarter to operating earnings from increased costs. In addition, the lack of available material contributed to the decline in revenue of the Specialty Fluids & Intermediates segment, given the integrated nature of our facility. Also impacting revenue, and to a lesser extent, operating earnings, was a spillover effect to the unplanned outage we had at one of our olefin cracking units in Longview, Texas towards the end of the first quarter. This also limited the material available to sell, which, again, was most significant in the SFI segment.","In addition, we had the flow through effect of propane costs from the first quarter, which also impacted the second quarter. If you remember that propane was as high as $1.60 per gallon in the first -- in the early part of the first quarter, and though it came down, it's now closer to $1.05 per gallon. We still had flow-through effects, and these are most pronounced in SFI and Additives & Functional Products segments. With all that, sales revenue is up slightly year-over-year for the quarter. The solid growth in our high-value product lines was mostly offset by declines in some of our core product lines, and sequentially, sales revenue was up 7% driven by higher volumes. Operating earnings were down slightly year-over-year, as the benefit of continued improvements in product mix with growth in high-value products was offset by higher raw material and energy costs, site outage cost and competitive pressure in some core products. However, operating earnings were up $58 million or 15% sequentially, and our operating margin for the quarter was approximately 18%. Earnings per share was up $0.12 year-over-year, and as we have said previously, we're using all lines of the income statement to increase our earnings, with both the lower tax rate and a lower share count contributing to the EPS improvement.","With that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Okay. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5 with a review of Additives & Functional Products results. Sales revenue was higher by 5%, primarily due to higher sales volume for coatings product lines, which was attributed to strong demand across multiple end markets. Tire demand improved sequentially, and was flat year-over-year, as growth in Europe and North America was offset by continuing destocking in China, particularly towards commercial tires. Operating earnings were down slightly, as higher raw material and energy cost, particularly for propane, more than offset higher sales volume.","Looking at the second half and full year of 2014. We expect volume will be stronger in the second half of the year compared with the first half, as we won't have the impact of colder weather that impacted our North America business in January and February of 2014, and the destocking of commercial tires in China seems to be running its course. We also expect the impact of propane to moderate in the second half of 2014. These factors, coupled with continued solid demand in the coatings market should more than offset normal seasonality for this business. We are also continuing to invest enhancements to the technology for our market-leading Crystex product line with a full year cost of approximately $10 million higher mostly in the second and third quarters, and we continue to see increasing competition for solvent, primarily due to economic weakness in China. As a result, we expect both revenue and earnings in the second half of the year will be higher than the first, and continue to expect operating earnings will be between $410 million and $430 million for the year, albeit more towards the lower end of that range.","Adhesives & Plasticizers is on Slide 6. Sales revenue was higher by 6%, as higher sales volume more than offset lower selling prices. The higher sales volume in adhesive resins was primarily attributed to stronger end-market demand and a lack of customer destocking that negatively impacted results in the second quarter of 2013. The higher sales volume for plasticizers was attributed to the timing of substitution of phthalate-based plasticizers with Eastman's non-phthalates-based plasticizers. Lower selling prices were in both adhesive resins and plasticizers, and primarily due to continued competitive pressure that has continued from 2013. Operating earnings increased primarily due to higher sales volume and associated higher capacity utilization, as well as lower operating costs in the quarter that included targeted cost reduction. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect the adhesive resins market to continue to stabilize at current levels with a more balanced market going forward, as well as stronger demand in key end use markets, including hygiene, packaging and building and construction. However, a competitor outage that had a positive impact on our results in the first half of the year is not expected to continue into the second half. An additional announced capacity of an adhesives competitor is still a headwind as well. For plasticizers, we expect competitive pressure to continue to challenge margins, partially offset by continued strong volume growth. As a result, we now expect Adhesives & Plasticizers earnings to be above $175 million for the year.","Moving next to Advanced Materials on Slide 7. Revenue was relatively unchanged as volume growth in our premium product was offset by lower volume in core products. Premium products volume growth was driven by interlayers with acoustic properties in Eastman Tritan copolyester, each of which continue to benefit from strong adoption in their respective market. The lower sales volume was for core products, such as our Flexvue coated films. Operating earnings was flat, as lower raw material and energy cost and strong mix improvement were offset by the impact of costs associated with the unplanned shutdown at the Kingsport site and some other costs.","Looking at the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year revenue growth for the segment to be between 4% and 5% due to strong premium product growth in several areas. For Tritan, we see accelerated growth due to continued market penetration and some new customer adaptations, supported by additional capacity scheduled to come online later this year. We expect strong growth for interlayers with acoustic properties, as it is more widely adopted in the market. Growth should also increase for cellulose esters for displays, including the benefit of a successful product launch of Eastman digitalized material into mobile devices. And we expect a change in window film order patterns with more volume -- more balanced across the year compared with 2013 when volume was more front-end loaded due to, in large part, of the incentive structure. These are expected to be partially offset by core product declines, including our Flexvue products and a slight decline in revenue for core copolyester due to continued competitive pressure in some of the lower margin product lines. As a result, we continue to expect operating earnings will be between $280 million and $300 million. And given the strong results in the first half of the year, Advanced Materials could be near the top end of that range.","Next up is Fibers on Slide 8. Sales revenue increased, as higher selling prices and sales of acetate flake to our China -- acetate tow joint venture more than offset at lower acetate tow sales volume. The lower acetate tow sales volume was due to the impact of additional industry capacity, including our new joint venture capacity in China. Operating earnings increased as higher selling prices, sales of acetate flake to the China joint venture and lower raw material and energy costs more than offset lower acetate tow sales volume, and higher operating costs resulting from lower capacity utilization and the unplanned shutdown of the Kingsport site.","For the second half of 2014, we expect lower acetate tow sales volume due to customer destocking in Asia Pacific, as they built inventory during 2013, in expectation of stronger demand levels that now appear to be flat versus 2014. We expect the impact of this destocking on our operating earnings will be most significant in the third quarter. As a result, we now anticipate Fibers operating earnings to be approximately $480 million, which would still be the 11th consecutive year of earnings growth.","I'll finish up the segment reviews with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on Slide 9. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume attributed to 2 factors. First is the impact of the unplanned outages, both the first quarter weather-related outage at the Longview, Texas site and the second quarter unplanned shutdown at the Kingsport site. Second, sales volume was also declined for intermediate product lines with the increased use of intermediate in the manufacture of higher-value downstream derivatives in other segments as we continue to value up our advantaged vertical integration. From a regional perspective, the largest volume decline was in the Asia Pacific region, which is a more marginal market for us. Operating earnings declined year-over-year due to lower sales volume, higher raw material and energy cost and cost for the unplanned outage at the Kingsport site.","Looking at the second half of the year for SFI, we expect revenue and margins for intermediate product lines are expected to improve due to selling demand and lower propane costs, but this is expected to be largely offset by a maintenance shutdown with one of our largest crackers at our Longview site. This shutdown occurs every 5 years. In addition, the aviation fluids market remains strong, and we will benefit from our recent acquisition there, and demand for heat transfer fluids is expected to be soft due to delays or cancellation of industrial products, in particular, for polymer manufacturing facilities in China and the renewable energy market. Taking this together, we expect the operating earnings for the full year to be in the range of $300 million and $320 million for the year.","Moving next to Slide 13. On June 2, we completed our acquisition of BP's aviation turbine engine oil business. The total purchase price for this acquisition was $283 million, and was ultimately an asset deal. With this acquisition, we gained a growing and nicely profitable specialty business that aligns well with our existing Skydrol aviation fluids business, allowing us to serve our customers with a more complete suite of product offering. As a result, we will be better able to meet the needs of the global aviation industry, which we expect will grow above GDP levels. This business is now part of the Specialty Fluids & Intermediates segment, and 2013 annual revenues were approximately $100 million. Excluding acquisition-related costs, we expect this acquisition will be modestly accretive to 2014 earnings per share, with full year 2015 accretion expected to be in the high-single-digit level. This acquisition is an example of Eastman's deploying capital to a business where we have a leadership position in order to strengthen that position and accelerate growth, and we are confident that the returns from this acquisition, as well as the results from the Commonwealth acquisition we expect to close later this year, will be consistent with our value creation expectations.","On Slide 11, I'll cover some other financial highlights. During the second quarter, we generated $419 million in operating cash, in line with our expectation. Net earnings were solid, and we had normal seasonal working capital increase for receivables. For the second quarter, we generated $234 million of free cash flow. Capital expenditures totaled $132 million in the second quarter, and we expect full year 2014 CapEx to total approximately $575 million, which is slightly lower than previous guidance as some of our growth and infrastructure spending will shift into 2015. With expectations for cash from operations approximating up $1.4 billion for the full year, we are on track for free cash flow of $600 million, which excludes, again, our capital expenditures and our dividend. We continue to return cash to stockholders, including share repurchases of $360 million through the first half of the year, of which $100 million was completed in the second quarter. We have $800 million left on our current $1 billion authorization and we continue to expect the pace of our repurchases to moderate in the second half of the year. Lastly, our tax rate for the quarter was 28%, similar to the first quarter and significantly below second quarter 2013, reflecting continued benefits from the integration of Eastman and Solutia business operations and legal entity structures. We continue to expect our tax rate for the full year to be approximately 28%, and as a reminder, our tax rate excludes any potential benefits of tax extenders that could be passed by our legislators. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa","Thanks, Curt. I'll review our outlook for 2014, which is on Slide 12. Given the results in the first half of the year, we are on track for a fifth consecutive year of solid earnings growth. As I look at the second half of 2014, we expect sales revenue year-over-year to increase roughly in line with global GDP, reflecting acceleration of growth in our premium products and Advanced Materials, the stronger coatings market benefiting the ASP segment, the continuing benefit for macro trends such as the move to non-phthalate plasticizers from phthalate-based plasticizers. These should be partially offset by lower acetate tow demand and normal seasonality. Sequentially, we expect revenue will be similar to the first half levels. Operating earnings in the second half should be up year-over-year and down sequentially. The year-over-year improvement is expected to be driven by growth in Advanced Materials as growth accelerates for premium products, including Tritan copolyester, displays, interlayers with acoustic properties and window films, and we expect the sequential decline will be due to costs from a high level of planned outages in the second half of the year, including the major maintenance turnaround at our largest cracker in Longview, Texas, which Curt mentioned in the SFI section.","We also expect to benefit from the capital deployment, including both the acquisition that we've completed and share repurchases. As a result, we continue to be on track for 2014 earnings per share in the range of $6.70 to $7, which would be strong growth. And as I think about the cadence of the second half, I would expect year-over-year EPS growth in both quarters -- both for the growth to be more significant -- for the growth to be more significant in the fourth quarter.","Next is capital allocation, Slide 14. In the second quarter, we were balanced across each of the buckets in how we allocated capital. We continue to spend on the growth in our capital expenditures. As we mentioned, we took advantage of the very attractive public debt market with an attractive offering. We completed a bolt-on acquisition during the quarter, and are on track to close a second before the end of the year, and we continue to return cash to stockholders in the form of both share repurchases and a healthy dividend. Looking forward, we remain committed to a balanced deployment of capital. We continue to look at the M&A market, and are looking for opportunities that fit with Eastman, and we continue to review -- view returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases and an increasing dividend as a good use of cash. So we'd expect more of the same as we put our cash flow to work.","On Slide 15, lastly, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be hosting an Investor Day in New York on Thursday, November 6. The main purpose of our Investor Day this year will be for our senior management to share with you our strategy for building on the progress we've made to grow earnings for years to come. We will be sending out more details via e-mail shortly. I hope that you'll be able to join us. And with that, I'll turn it back to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks, Mark, and we have a number of people on the line this morning. We'd like to get to as many questions as possible. [Operator Instructions] And with that, Adam, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mark, you guys lowered your outlook for Fibers down from 520 down to 480, and you mentioned that destock is having an impact. You also mentioned demand falling as part of a cause. Are we near peak here? Is the impact of e-cigs capping future growth in that business? How should we think about that business into the future?","Mark J. Costa","Thanks, Frank, and good to hear you this morning. Fibers is a great business. It's delivered 11 years of consecutive earnings growth, and it produces a tremendous amount of [ph] cash flow. So we certainly are very pleased with this business. But as you noted, we think about the business as plateauing. I don't like the word peak. So what we're seeing is demand flattening out, not declining. But that does really create some problems for 2014, and potentially '15, specifically in China. So they were building a lot of inventory in 2013, expecting sort of normal growth in '14, which didn't materialize. And so they're going through some inventory corrections in production, and that's sort of the demand correction we're seeing in the back half of this year. What we don't know is, in 2015, to the extent that there is continued destocking to further correct demand, but I wouldn't call it peaking, but it's certainly plateauing.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, that's very helpful. And obviously, in a similar vein, you maintained -- you did maintain your 2014 outlook. I'm curious if you have any updated thoughts on your targets for 2015, the $8 number and what might it take to get there?","Mark J. Costa","Frank, I can't believe you asked that question. I mean, I never thought it would come. So as we think about 2015, and we certainly are spending a lot of time thinking about it and doing everything we can to deliver great results, what I'd say is we're committed to still driving towards $8 a share in '15, but getting to $8 is becoming more of a stretch. Given what we know at this point, we can see that -- we can definitely see it delivering double-digit earnings growth in the $7.50 to $8 range. There's a number of factors that are really still very much going in Eastman's way, driving our revenue and our earnings growth. We expect the economy to continue to grow. In particular, we have some favorable positions in our top 2 end markets of transportation and building, construction, where we can see better than GDP sectorial growth there, and we continue to be very excited about seeing how we're valuing up the mix in our company. We have a number of high-value products across the company, like Tritan, acoustic interlayers, window films, coatings additives, non-phthalate plasticizers, resins. We're now taking into tires. They give us very strong high-value growth, improving our mix. I think we also have a different strategy going into '15 versus '14. On our propane cost side, we've gone with a much more aggressive hedging strategy. We've shifted our mix towards 30% ethane on our crackers from 20%. So I think we're in a much better cost position to avoid that sort of spike and hit that we went through this year. And we certainly intend to have improved operational performance next year, so we have more product available to sell. And we've also got pretty aggressive productivity programs across the country, holding costs flat. That means that the growth that we do get in the top line should fall to the bottom line. And then the part I love best about our company is our incredibly strong free cash flow that we're fully committed to deploying, and we certainly already evidenced our commitment to be balanced in our deployment with the 2 bolt-on acquisitions that we did this year and the $360 million of stock buybacks we've already completed. And still have $800 million left on our authorization. So we have a number of things that help the growth map, see how you drive towards the $8, in that range of $7.50 to $8, but we also have some headwinds that we have to recognize. First, the economies, while it's growing, certainly not growing at the rate that I think any of us would like. I would continue describing it as lack-luster on a global basis, and that creates a bit of a challenge. In particular, I'd say Europe is -- it's certainly encouraging to see some growth this year versus last year, but we also have to keep in mind we're coming off of a really low base. And then we have a few new things, like this Fibers question around demand next year and the heat transfer fluid demand slowing down this year, and we think that will probably continue to be at modest levels next year with improvements in '16 when we look at the plant build situation in China. So those are some of the headwinds that we certainly hadn't factored in if you think about Investor Day. But it's important to keep in mind, we've got a great portfolio of specialty businesses, great diversity in our product lines, our end markets, our geographies. We've got great world-class technology platforms that allow us to continue to innovate to defend our current markets and margins, as well as find new applications to grow, and most importantly, a very high EBITDA margin that produces a lot of cash flow for giving us a lot of options about how we grow. So I'd still feel confident we're going to deliver double-digit earnings growth, still driving to the $8 a share as best as we can.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just another question on Fibers on the cost side of things. It looks like wood pulp costs are coming down, and some believe that they may go down a lot more from here. So I'm just curious how that flows through in terms of your contract structure. Do you have some where that's pass through or is there discretion where you could try to hold on to a fair amount, if not, all of it? And I guess the complexity might be just sort of the volume situation that you referenced in your comments earlier.","Mark J. Costa","Thanks, Vince, for the question. The Fibers business is one that is great about its stability, which means we have a fairly predictable demand and price curve for the year because the contracts are done on an annual basis. So we go through those negotiations. We pretty much set our sort of our price in our contract, and then pulp does what it does and then we get those results, and that's certainly been a benefit as we've expanded our margin this year with pulp declining.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So if pulp continues to go lower next year, you would expect to capture that?","Mark J. Costa","Well, I think you have to -- remember, it's always a balance in those contract negotiations going into 2015 of price and where pulp goes, and so we don't discuss those kind of contract negotiations ahead of time, but we'll do our best as we always do. I'll remind you, this industry has been disciplined in its history, and we'd expect that to continue.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar, Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark, this year [ph], you mentioned increased resin supply. Can you talk about that? And have you seen China rosin prices come down? And then you also talked about new competitor capacity, and can you just tell us how big that is?","Mark J. Costa","Sure, P.J. The adhesive business has got a lot of moving parts as we've discussed on past calls. What we're excited and encouraged about is seeing the solid demand growth continue, especially in things like hygiene and the hot melt adhesive packaging, and that growth rate has sort of gone back to what we would call normal, and strong this year relative to what was relatively weak last year. So the demand side of this equation is to some degree back in gear. On the supply side, the rosin capacity, which is an alternative to hydrocarbon resins, is a bit tighter this year, where it was extremely loose last year with very low prices. And as we look at the -- people climbing up the mountains to pull rosin off the trees this year, it looks like it's going to be more of an average to slightly tight year. So we expect rosin prices to remain where they are, which makes that -- them less attractive to use versus our tackifying resins. So we're encouraged to see that tightening up a bit and giving us some market stability. When it comes to direct competitors in resin capacity, principally, a company in Korea added a hydrogenated resin capacity that created some competitive pressure this year. But so far, that seems to be relatively stable. And I think that, overall, that's led to nice conditions in the first half of the year, which were also further improved by one of our competitors having a serious outage. As we look at the second half of the year, we continue to see attractive growth and what I would call stability, but we do have some favorable things in the first half of the year that won't continue in the second.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And quickly for Curt, with your efforts to bring down tax rate and use of NOLs from Solutia, can you talk about how much NOLs are left and where could your long-term tax rate go?","Curtis E. Espeland","So if we look at the overall tax rate, we continue to expect that to be 28%. The tax team is still working through different options by which to continue to lower that effective tax rate. I often characterize what the tax department was able to do with some of the Solutia businesses, and legal structures was a triple or home run. Now they're working on singles and doubles, if you don't mind, the baseball analogy. And I'd also remind people that don't be afraid to call your legislators because if they get the tax extenders impacted, that could have a further reduction of our rate of about 1%. So we believe in tax extenders, and what we put in place is permanent tax fixes, tax adjustments. Our rate could be driving more towards 27%. On the NOLs, we pretty much said about 2\/3 of the NOLs, $1.5 billion, was going to be used kind of half of '12, '13, '14 and '15. And you just take that number and do some math off those to kind of get you per [ph] kind of pro-rata basis the amount you're going to get from the NOL cash benefit, but we'll continue to have NOL benefit going into 2015.","Operator","We'll take our next question from James Sheehan, SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just with respect to the outage at Kingsport. I was wondering if you could discuss us your monthly order trends and how they've progressed through the quarter, and how you would have seen that flowing had the outage not occurred? And also, if you could update us on your order books for July?","Curtis E. Espeland","So on the order books, if you think about most of our segment, you're able to work through the outage by using your inventory and working with your customers, trying to prioritize shipments, et cetera. So I'd say the order books, while had some delay in them, generally speaking, our order books were still pretty solid through the second quarter for most [ph] segment. The one that we highlighted is Specialty Fluids & Intermediates. As you know, how our integrated streams run, to the extent some of the molecules aren't used by the derivatives, there are certain lower commodity product lines, like acetic acid, that just aren't available for them to sell. And so that's where you saw the declines in the second quarter in volumes. But generally speaking, I think our businesses did a pretty good job working with our customers and keeping revenue going through the outage. As we look at the July order books, everything is on track with the revenue growth outlook that Mark mentioned earlier across all the portfolio.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And on propane and the cracking spreads, you had identified about $0.30 to $0.40 of headwind in the first half. Just wondering how you would size that on -- how it reverses in the second half if you can provide any insight.","Curtis E. Espeland","So if you think about the propane costs and the impact of the spike up in the first quarter and the flow through effect you've seen in the first half of the year, we quantify that to be $0.30 or $0.40 in the early part of the year. I'd say, as we look at the map today, it's on the high end of that range. But now that propane is down at this more modest -- I shouldn't say modest level, at the current levels it's at, and as you can imagine, Mark mentioned our hedging program, we are much more -- before, we used to hedge only 6 months out to kind of give our businesses a little more time to price into it because some of the volatility, as well as we just looked at how the forward curves have behaved, in particular, with propane. We were much more aggressive getting our hedge positions in place, going into this winter season than we had in the past, and we're looking to do that 2 years out as well because of some of that forward curve. So as it relates to the second half of the year, that $0.30 to $0.40 -- that $0.40 roughly headwind is behind us, and should moderate the second half of the year and that's reflected in our outlook.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mark, just on the guidance for this year, still a pretty wide range for the back half of 2014. What would it take to make the low end of the range, and what would it take to make the high end of the range?","Mark J. Costa","Good question. We spend a lot of time looking at that. The -- first of all, I think that if I think about this year and the last call I was on, I would have said we were at the top end of the range. Things were clicking along, and I'd say that we feel like we probably moved a little bit more back into the range. I mean -- and what's changed for us is the -- on the positive side, we see Advanced Materials and A&P doing much better than expected, but we also have some new headwinds in Fibers demand, destocking, as we've mentioned, and some of those further slowdown and heat transfer fluids, and of course, the Tennessee outage. The low end of the range would take some other things that we don't know about and creating some challenges for us, like an economy slow down or something else that pops up. But we're working hard to continue to deliver the best earnings growth we can for the year, and we still have strong free cash flow that gives us additional option.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Mark, just on Longview, can you size the impact of the outage? And also, give us an update on the tariff dispute with West Lake.","Mark J. Costa","We'll let Curt answer this one.","Curtis E. Espeland","Okay. Let me start with West Lake, and then I'll need a reminder of the first part of the question. But as you know, with West Lake, we continue to explore options with monetizing our excess ethylene. And specifically, in regards to the dispute with Westlake, let me remind you that there's really 3 disputes. The first is the removal of the bidirectional flow with the pipeline. The second is the removal of the exchange rights or what's often referred to as the ability to do swaps. And then the third dispute is around the change in the tariff rates. A hearing was held on the first 2 items back in May, and we are waiting on an examiner's ruling. I can't tell you exactly when that's going to happen. I hear it could happen any day, but we're still waiting for that ruling. The rate tariff is scheduled for review in August. So we're still working through the Railroad Commission to get this resolved. We continue to be very confident that this will be resolved in our -- to our satisfaction.","Mark J. Costa","Dave, the first part of your question was around the Longview outage. Could you elaborate?","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, the impact, the dollar impact for the outage in Q3.","Curtis E. Espeland","Well, on Q2, I think...","Mark J. Costa","Are you talking about the planned shutdown, Dave?","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I'm sorry, the plant shutdown, I'm sorry.","Curtis E. Espeland","So this is Curt again. So if you look at kind of the impact of that is going to be predominantly in the fourth quarter. If you look at our maintenance cost in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, the difference is going to be roughly about $25 million of higher maintenance cost in the fourth quarter of this year, and about $20 million of that is associated with the Longview turnaround of the cracker.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions, if I might. Firstly, in the emerging markets, mostly, it's not quite as robust as folks had hoped. I'm just wondering, have you seen any change in underlying trends in what you think has to happen, and particularly in Asia, to get things percolating? And then secondly, I noticed exceptional expense control at the SG&A line. Can you talk about maybe some specifics of what you've done and how much of that has traction to continue or how much of that might have been more short-term oriented?","Mark J. Costa","In regards to Asia Pacific, in particular, and the emerging market growth, we have to be careful about how we look at that revenue number. The key driver of why the revenue was not what you would normally expect was the intermediate sales from the Specialty Fluids segment. So we have these large engines here where we make a lot of intermediates and we sell what's left over that we don't value up in the Specialties. We focus primarily on selling those in North America and Europe, where the margins are most attractive, and then what's left over, we sell in Asia Pacific. So when they have outages, like we've had in the first half of the year at both Longview and Tennessee, the big impact on the revenue is those intermediate sales in Asia Pacific, which are the lowest margin sales for us. So that's a big driver. When you strip that out, I'd say revenue growth in Asia Pacific in the first half of the year was on track and solid. The broader question around emerging markets, in places like Russia, Latin America, fortunately for us, we don't have much revenue in those regions, and aren't being hurt by the dramatic slowdown on those economies this year, and we continue to be very confident about our goal to continue growing in Asia Pacific.","Curtis E. Espeland","If I could, Bob, on the SG&A, one of the things I love about the Eastman culture is we've had productivity embedded in our culture across of our operations for years, and that's why you still see us not having to announce big large cost reduction programs because our people are focused on that everyday. If you look at the SG&A line specifically, what you're seeing there is that same productivity mentality being applied to the SG&A line. Where again, we're looking at ways we can keep our cost flat year-over-year as we offset inflations with productivity efforts, et cetera. And then on top of that, what we're working on is where we spend those dollars, and we're focusing a lot of that spend on our growth and our other initiatives to help grow the bottom line. So it's kind of been a shift where we spend it and how we spend it is really -- I think is also going to be in the DNA of Eastman, as you look at us, over the next several years. The one thing that we do see, SG&A tends to increase a little bit in the second half of the year because of some seasonality spending that we have. But generally speaking, what you're seeing in our SG&A line is the focus of Eastman and supports the growth efforts we have.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Roberts, UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about how broad your strategy is in your functional fluids area? I mean, there are a lot of other areas, like metalworking fluids or broader presence in de-icing and so forth, how broad should we think about the strategy here?","Mark J. Costa","Well, clearly, I'd say we have sort of 3 main product groups that we currently have to go in the different applications. So we have heat transfer fluids that are principally used for that purpose. We've got significant issues about transporting heat from one location to another. So the polymer and chemical manufacturing plants use a lot of heat transfer fluids, concentrating solar power rays, use a lot of heat transfer fluids, as well as some other energy-related facilities. So that's a market area that we've been a very strong leader in for years, continue to be a strong leader. But as we noted, we've hit some demand slowdown because there's not as many energy investments being made at the moment, although we do see that coming back in the '16, '17 timeframe. And then on the polymer plant side in China, we see a slow down there of PET plants, in particular, because they were significantly overbuilt and demand is catching up, but that fluid gets applied to specifically those areas. And of course, we've got 2 different aviation-related fluids as well. We've been a long-term leader in Skydrol, which is hydraulic fluid for commercial aircraft, and then the acquisition of the BP turbine oil business allows us to also complement that with our customers for the turbine oil. But right now, those are the areas that -- and applications we're in. Those products don\u2019t tend to go into a lot of other applications. Although we like this area in this business, and so we continue to look for other opportunities to add fluids, other potential fluids of this portfolio, is one of the areas we're looking at when we talk about M&A.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and your comment about Fibers, and you talked about some stocking that went on in anticipation of Asian growth, and now it's flat, are you saying end consumption of fiber in Asia is flat for 2014, and with the outlook, and be flat again in 2015?","Mark J. Costa","So what we're seeing is flat demand. I would say, specifically, in China. There are other places where we continue to see modest growth in Asia Pacific. But in China, which is the big driver of demand in Asia Pacific, we see demand being basically flat this year relative to last year all the way down to cigarette consumption. It's not just a tow issue. That's what this destocking is about, is continuing to correct cigarette inventory, and therefore, tow inventory for serving the market in China.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And what do you see the actual end consumption, so you're talking about at the cigarette inventory consumption and correction in China? You're not talking about down smoking?","Mark J. Costa","Well, I think that what we're seeing is there's less or flattening of the level of smoking in China. Used to modestly grow for many of the years. But with the austerity measures and some other things going on in China, it's flattened out, the amount of cigarette consumption.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Walker, Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So propane will be a tailwind in the second half this year, but what are you assuming in your 2015 outlook? Should it be a tailwind to '15 versus '14 or another headwind or flat?","Curtis E. Espeland","So if you look at propane, what I'd suggest you do is that we look at the forward curve. And if you look at the forward curve and you believe what it's telling you, is that, on average, the total cost of propane will be lower in 2015 relative to 2014. And because of that forward curve, as I mentioned, we're probably looking at that forward curve and saying that's maybe some -- it would be prudent for us to put in some hedges to lock in some of that lower propane cost for next year.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And as you look at your M&A pipeline, I guess, how does that look and are you happy with your mix of end markets or might you add another value chain?","Mark J. Costa","We continue to look at the M&A market, and we will continue to be disciplined about looking at the M&A market looking for attractive opportunities. But I'd say we look for both. We look for bolt-on acquisitions that reinforce the existing businesses we have, and we are open to attractive additions of new legs to our company as well if they make a lot of sense.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark, you took your guidance up a little bit in Adhesives & Plasticizers. On the plasticizer piece of it, it seems like we've been talking about price erosion for quite a while. Could you comment on what the sequential trend is there, and whether or not the phthalate-based higher cost producers are making any money? Just trying to get a sense of what the residual price risk is there.","Mark J. Costa","So on the plasticizer side, on the growth side, we feel great. We see continued strong growth as people switch from phthalate to non-phthalate plasticizers. But as you noted, we've continued to see increased price pressure last year, and some of that has continued in the first half of this year. Principally, what's going on is that you have some players who make non-phthalate plasticizers in Asia that sold all of it traditionally into China. And with the slowdown of the Chinese economy, they've been pushed out of China and looking for new homes in Europe and North America, and putting price pressure on the market as they try and buy market share. Those prices have come down considerably from the beginning of 2013. And we see that pressure lessening as we go into the second half of the year. So I think we're getting to a price point, where the economics aren't making sense for further aggression by the Asians going after the business here, but it's a little too hard to call that precisely.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears to Longview. As you move through the planned shutdown in the back half of the year, would your feedstock mix remain the same at about 70 propane, 30 ethane through that process? Or is there any opportunity to continue to tweak the ethane ratio a bit higher?","Mark J. Costa","At this point, I think we're at the 30, 70 propane. This shutdown is a true maintenance shutdown. It's not reconfiguring the plant, and we don't see it changing that big [ph].","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","How long is the cracker outage on the fourth quarter? When does it start and when do you expect it to be completed?","Curtis E. Espeland","It starts towards the end of the third quarter, and I believe, Jeff, that it is a 3-week outage -- oh, 3 to 4, I'm sorry.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","3 to 4, and this is your billion pound cracker?","Curtis E. Espeland","This is the largest of the 4 crackers, that is correct.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, in terms of your propane outlook, if I understand what you -- better yet, what was the EBITDA of the acquired BP business?","Mark J. Costa","Well, we haven't given a specific EBITDA, Jeff, for that business. I think what we've talked about is, in 2015, it will be on an earnings per share basis, high-single-digits accretion. It's about $100 million of revenue. And I think people have done some rough math off that. I've heard some numbers thrown around, around $30 million, but we haven't disclosed specifically what the EBITDA is of that group.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of Advanced Materials, you're looking for a pick up in sales growth in the second half of the year. What do you think needs to happen for you to hit those numbers? And is some of it within your control to some degree?","Mark J. Costa","Mike, I do think some of it's in our control. As we look at some of the high value premium products we have in that segment, we've been working hard in a lot of new applications in Tritan, where we've closed those opportunities. As you close them, you can start seeing how that volume's going to roll in, and so we see an acceleration in Tritan volume growth in the second half relative to the first half. It's the other places, like acoustic interlayers, we've had great growth in the first half, and expect that to just continue going into the second half. There's a lot of -- OEMs are switching to acoustic high-performance products versus the standard interlayers to quiet the cabin and pursue light-weighting of the car, and so that's a great macro trend, a great margin improvement -- mix improvement for our business. The window films side of the business also, I think, is one where we had shifted incentives and order patterns intentionally to even-out orders to actual consumption with our market. And so we see good indications of those orders flowing in, consistent with that intentional strategy. There are, of course, always uncertainty as part of the challenge we had in window films this year. There's a little slow down in demand, in places like Indonesia and Thailand, due to macroeconomic factors that are beyond our control. But I think we can see a number of things going our way, and there's always the things you don't expect that can either be favorable or unfavorable that play out. But as long as the economy remains solid, I feel like we should be on a good track there.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when you think 2015 for Advanced Materials, it's got a long way to go. Do you think it's just more of a delay to get to that number? Is the profitability potential of that business still where you think it could be longer term?","Mark J. Costa","First of all, we don't see any sort of derailment on strategy in the Advanced Materials segment. It's doing great this year, and likely to perform at the high-end of the range, and I think it's going to deliver very attractive earnings growth next year. It's obviously not going to get to $380 million. If you want to go back to 2012 Investor Day, I think we commented on this in the past. There are certain things that have changed that have slowed down the rate of growth in that business, in particular, the European demand and things like automotive and architectural buildings for the interlayer business. It just hasn't come back from what we would have assumed back in 2012, but the premium products are growing strong, including interlayers. The window film business is growing strong. The main issue this segment has had in getting to that original guidance is just overall macroeconomic growth being off of what we would have assumed. So I see us continuing to deliver consistent earnings growth over several years in this business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Nils Wallin, CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","A question on outlook for hydrocarbon resins. I know Exxon is building a fairly sizable plant over the next couple of years and wondering what you think about the long-term prospect for that, that part of the business?","Mark J. Costa","The hydrocarbon resin business, obviously, has gone through some serious adjustments if you look at its performance in '12 to '13, and now starting to recover in '14. It's still a great business. It's got attractive EBIT margins. It's got ROIC that is 2 to 3 percentage points above its EBIT margins. So it's creating a lot of value on a cost of capital basis for our shareholders. Certainty, there are questions around demand and supply going forward, like the Exxon announcement you just mentioned, but we see it continue to be a stable good business at this point. Demand trends are very favorable. There's plenty of hygiene and hot melt adhesive packaging and other things that drive demand for this business. We will continue to look at the supply demand balance to make sure that it's going to be value creating going forward, and make decisions as appropriate.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And then just -- as there seems to be an interplay between pricing for rosin versus hydrocarbon resins and, obviously, you have capacity in both, would you be able to give us a sense of how that might change your margin or mix effect as those 2 play off one another?","Mark J. Costa","I think when we think about rosins, which is lower quality alternative to hydrocarbon resins, especially our hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins, where we have a more differentiated position, they play a factor in creating a price pull, if you will, on the market downward if there's a large excess supply of rosins, and those prices are quite low. Last year was an exceptionally bad year for rosin prices in that they were quite low. What we see now is back to more of a stable situation, but it's a crop, and it will have a certain amount of volatility to it, going forward, in the future. So I don't think anything's changed in that dynamic as we look at this business. And I think that as people go to more high-performance products, we continue to benefit from that trend because, in particular, hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins are the high-quality alternative. So if you want a high-quality diaper, you go hydrogenated resins because rosins have an odor. If you're going to a high-performance packaging facility, you're going to go with hydrogenated resins. So the macro trends is emerging middle-income classes, upscaling what they want, drive favorable demand to our product technology.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","So would you say there's a meaningful share shift or share gain by the hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins away from rosin and how large will that be?","Mark J. Costa","Yes, I think it is when rosin prices are sort of stable. When rosin prices become really cheap, like they did last year, and the economy is weak, the customers will make trade-offs and accept a lower quality adhesive formulation in favor of those economics, and make those kind of switching choices in their formulation. So that's going to happen some times. But in general, if you look at a stable relative pricing situation over a long term, we should see some continued share shift. I wouldn't say it's dramatic, but share shift towards our technology.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Riddle, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Gregory A. Riddle","Thank you, Adam. And thanks, again, everyone, for joining us this morning.

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Eastman Chemical Company First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thank you Kim, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jake LaRoe, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's first quarter 2019 financial results news release, also during this call and in the accompanying slides, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for 2018 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for first quarter 2019.","Second, earnings referenced in this presentation excludes certain non-core and unusual items. In addition, historic quarterly earnings use an adjusted tax rate, using the forecasted tax rate for the full year that excludes the provision for income taxes for the same non-core and unusual items. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the first quarter 2019 financial results news release, which can be found on our website www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings exclude any non-core unusual or non-recurring items","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks Greg, and good morning everyone. I'll start on page 3. In the first quarter of 2019, we had a number of accomplishments we can be proud of, and a number of challenges to take on. Before we get into the financial results of the quarter, I'd like to pause and take a moment to discuss some of the important highlights from the quarter.","First, after challenging fourth quarter, we delivered a 28% sequential improvement in our earnings, and we expect this momentum to continue on to the second quarter. We also received an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year award for the eighth consecutive year, demonstrating our commitment to operate our facilities responsibly and efficiently.","Eastman is always searching for ways to leverage our world-class operations and macro trends like sustainability, and I'm proud of the investments we're making in methanolysis and the carbon renewal technology, which provides serious solutions to enable the circular economy. In this environment, we continue to see strong customer engagement with our innovation programs and delivered an 8% increase in new businesses revenue closes from our innovative products. As always, we also continue to aggressively execute on cost management, running a highly productive organization and we have increased our cost reduction actions given the short-term macro-economic challenges.","Consistent with our strategy to pursue bolt-on acquisitions in our specialty businesses, we completed the acquisition of Marlotherm heat-transfer fluids from Sasol, opening up their product offerings in new regions and we'll continue to pursue bolt-on M&A where it makes sense.","Core to how we win is our ethics and integrity and we appreciate the recognition is one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere for the sixth consecutive time. And finally, these awards and the focus of our strategy comes back to our owners, where we consistently return cash to our shareholders. We returned $212 million to shareholders in the first quarter of 2019, an 18% increase over the first quarter of 2018.","On slide 4, we continue to execute our innovation-driven growth model to create superior value. Today, I'd like to highlight two specialty product lines: one is, Advanced Materials and another is Additives & Functional Products, both in a challenging end market transportation.","Although, we've seen weakness in global transportation markets over the past two quarters, especially in Asia. I'm very excited to report that our team continues to deliver strong growth in our premium innovative products. One example, fueling this growth is Saflex heads-up display, where we are delivering double-digit growth, including an impressive 20% growth in Europe.","We're well positioned to create growth in an even challenging transportation market for a number of reasons. Our world-class PVB technology platform enables us to continue to introduce new products to meet the evolving needs of the marketplace.","We are deeply engaged both with our customers, and equally important across the entire value chain, including the premium auto OEM brands and project -- and projected manufacturers. And our application development capabilities enable us to tune our products for the unique challenges associated with each model, including standards for optical clarity and the complexity of the design. The end result is our products sold at a premium price growing at multiples of the underlying market, to meet this reinforce of the value of our innovation-driven growth model.","Another innovation in transportation is where we're winning with customers in our next-generation Crystex product, which is essential in a challenging tires market. It is produced at our new facility in Kuantan, Malaysia, which is now fully operational, and we're seeing accelerated adoption of our new and innovative product Crystex Cure Pro.","Tire makers who win in their markets are under constant pressure to improve tire performance, as well as operational efficiency. Working closely with our customers to better understand these challenges drove us to develop a superior product, and we're getting validation from customers that they're seeing significant benefit in line speed improvements, scrap reduction and energy savings.","As a testament to the tire additives team's relentless engagement with the market, we're now working with more than half of the top 30 tire makers in the world on our next-generation Crystex, and have nine new plant trials in progress in the first quarter. Finally, we're proud that Crystex Cure Pro is recognized as a finalist in the 2019 Tire Technology International Awards for Innovation and Excellence. And we're the only innovation honored that was now created by a tire company.","While the tires markets will be challenging for us in this year given our legacy products, Cure Pro is already demonstrating that we can extend our differentiated position as we move forward in filling out this new plant. These are just two of many great examples we have that demonstrate how our specialties are delivering today and our innovation and market connections position us to continue to win in the future.","With that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curt Espeland","Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to spend this hour together. I'll begin with a review of our corporate results on slide 5. Although challenges from the fourth quarter persisted into the first, we increased EBIT by 28% sequentially with growth in three of our four segments. Driving this improvement was a seasonal increase in volume, improved product mix and higher spreads.","On a year-over-year basis, sales revenue and earnings decreased mostly due to lower volume. We managed our controllable cost down significantly in the quarter. These actions will more than offset by a stronger dollar and cost in which we have less discretion such as higher pension costs netting out to greater than a $30 million headwind year-over-year.","Looking across to our end markets, we experienced volume softness, particularly, in transportation, consumables and consumer durables, especially, in Asia and Europe. Global economic uncertainty persisted throughout the first quarter, which contributed to the softness and particular higher-margin specialty businesses such as tire additives, adhesives and specialty plastics were most impacted by the challenges in these end markets. The primary driver continues to be the U.S.-China trade wars impact on demand in China and its associated impact on Europe which is highly dependent on exports to Asia.","Looking at the cadence through the quarter. January was about as expected, but after Chinese New Year demand was sluggish and did not pick-up as we had hoped. Destocking was evident throughout the quarter and a substantial contributor to our volume decline. That said March was a strong month and April orders gave us confidence we'll continue the trend upwards into the second quarter and we're seeing signs of destocking coming to an end across many of our end markets.","Moving now to our segment reviews and beginning with Advanced Materials on slide 6. Both sales revenue and EBIT increased sequentially with EBIT up $30 million or 42%. Higher sales volume and improved product mix drove the sequential improvement in first quarter.","On a year-over-year basis sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower specialty plastics sales volume and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. Lower volume in specialty plastics was due to continued customer inventory destocking particularly consumer durables related to the uncertainty caused by the U.S.-China trade dispute. As a highlight for the quarter, performance films and advanced interlayers volume and mix were relatively unchanged despite declining vehicle build rates globally.","Growth in high-margin innovation products such as paint protection film heads-up display interlayers and architectural interlayers is offsetting declines in the underlying auto market. EBIT declined year-over-year, primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable exchange rates and we're also still working of our high-cost inventory from last year.","Looking forward, we expect strong sequential improvement for revenue and EBIT in the second quarter due to a few factors. Tritan destocking coming to an end with primary demand intact, continued mix upgrade due to products like paint protection films and premium interlayer products, typical seasonality and improvement in the flow of the lower raw material costs in our inventory. Taking these factors together we expect, EBIT in the segment will be similar to the second quarter of 2018. Looking at the full year given the positive trends in the business we continue to expect Advanced Materials will grow EBIT between 7% and 10% relative to 2019.","Moving now to slide 7. Additives & Functional Products also had strong sequential improvement with EBIT up $27 million or 22%. The sequential improvement was due to improved product mix and increased spreads. Sales revenue decreased year-over-year particularly for adhesives resins due to continued competitive pressures and for tire additives products attributed to trade-related pressures.","In tire additives in particular, trade-related uncertainty has had a significant impact on Chinese tire production during the time when overall Chinese economic demand is going down. Chinese tire producers have adjusted accordingly by destocking their inventories. As a result, tire additive competitors have excess capacity in China, which has caused some short-term competitive dynamics in our legacy products. We have confidence that dynamics will improve as we continue to see great adoption of our next-generation Crystex Cure Pro in the marketplace.","For adhesives we face competitive pressure from new competitor capacity as we have discussed in prior calls. Revenues were also negatively impacted by a stronger dollar. Lower selling prices year-over-year were largely attributed to Care Chemicals due to cost pass-through contracts producing stable earnings.","Looking at EBIT, the year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. To a lesser extent, excluding the Care Chemicals cost pass-through contracts prices were relatively flat sequentially, with higher costs raw material flow through creating some pressure on spreads year-over-year.","Looking at the second quarter, we expect sequential improvement in both revenue and EBIT, due to seasonally stronger volume, an increase in spreads as lower cost raw materials continue to flow through inventory, but earnings will not get back to last year's levels, due to volume still recovering and unfavorable currency, and we expect spreads to be similar to last year.","As we move to the second half of the year, we expect demand to improve for coatings, adhesives and tire additives assuming the trade dispute with China is resolved. There may also be some upside as China appears to be stepping up the environmental enforcement actions. For the full year, we expect 2019 EBIT to be similar to, or slightly better than 2018.","Now the slide 8 and Chemical Intermediates, which delivered a strong improvement in sequential earnings. On a year-over-year basis sales revenue decreased, primarily due to lower sales volume, mostly because of the refinery-grade propylene project, reducing bulk ethylene sales as planned.","Remember in the first quarter of 2018, we were still selling ethylene at attractive prices due to market conditions. Lower raw material prices in a few products also led to reduced pricing in the segment. EBIT decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices declining slightly more than raw material cost for our few olefin products particularly glycols.","Looking at the second quarter, while we don't have the headwinds of the industrial gas supplier outages market conditions have changed from a year ago. The benefit of not having supplier outages from last year is being offset by a sequential decline in spreads and acetyls and some continued pressure in glycols. Similarly, in the full year, we expect to benefit from the lack of some of the 2018 headwinds and 2019 to be offset by weakening market conditions, especially impacting spreads in acetyls and glycols leading us to expect EBIT in 2019, to be similar to 2018.","Finishing up the segment reviews of Fibers on slide 9. Sales revenue decreased year-over-year, primarily due to lower acetate tow sales volume attributed to China trade-related issues and other customer volume patterns as well as lower acetate tow selling prices. EBIT decreased primarily due to lower acetate tow sales volume, somewhat offset by growth in textiles and lower raw material costs. This is consistent with the guidance we gave you on our fourth quarter call that first quarter EBIT will be the lowest quarter for the year.","For the full year, we expect acetate tow volume declines consistent with the underlying market plus the impact of the headwinds from China trade issues from the first half of the year offset by growth in textile market and cost-reduction actions. Therefore, we continue to expect Fibers' EBIT to be about the same as 2018.","On slide 10, I'll transition to some corporate financial highlights. In the first quarter, we did a nice job managing our cash flows and remain on track to deliver greater than $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2019. Priorities for use of this cash will remain balance between deleveraging, funding an increasing dividend and in the absence of bolt-on M&A we will use the remainder of our cash for share repurchases.","I'll add that, you should always assume that we fully deploy our cash. We've returned $212 million to stockholders in the first quarter through share repurchases and dividends and we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and we'll delever as needed to maintain our solid balance sheet likely in the $250 million to $300 million range. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was roughly 16.5% consistent with our full year expectation of between 16% to 17%.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Curt. On slide 11, I'll provide an update on our 2019 outlook. Our earnings challenge in the first half of the year is predominantly a volume challenge for our high-value specialties and the slow growth world especially in Asia and Europe, compounded by the destocking.","Spreads in the specialties in the second quarter improving and are expected to be similar to last year's level. The volume challenge, we see is primarily trade related and to a lesser extent, due to slowdown in the global transportation market. That said, we are encouraged by the improvement in our orders through March into April and believe most of the destocking is behind us.","And as the 16th largest exporter by volume in the U.S. with Exxon as the only chemical company above us, we're probably more exposed to trade disruptions, we've seen for the last two quarters. The stronger U.S. dollar is having a negative impact which is a challenge given our U.S. manufacturing footprint. We've assumed that on average the dollar-euro exchange rate will be around $1.14 for the year. And we expect the impact of the first half to be around $30 million with AFP and AM most impacted, and with limited impact in the second half.","You recall from our fourth quarter call that we discussed that slow flow through of high-cost raw materials from last year would impact our earnings in the first quarter, which it did. Given this lower-than-expected volume in the first part of this year, this impact was greater than we expected. So the benefits of the lower cost raw materials will now be more of a second half impact.","Lastly, we're expecting higher pension costs for the year and this is approximately $30 million split relatively evenly between the quarters. Putting this together, we're expecting second quarter EBIT to increase between 15% and 20%, compared to the first quarter.","Moving next to the second half of the year. We're assuming that the U.S.-China trade dispute is settled at some point here in the second quarter, removing uncertainty that is impacting the Chinese economy. We're also expecting improving global demand and we are starting to see it already with strong demand in March and April compared with January and February. I will describe April at more normal levels, plus innovation is creating our own growth.","As demand improves, our asset utilization levels will pick up and that should result in lower cost raw materials and conversion costs flowing through. And roughly $30 million first half year-over-year headwind from the stronger dollar is expected to be much lower in the second half of the year. Then we have the additional $40 million of cost actions we're taking.","Moving on to the full year. Obviously, we have to offset a substantial earnings decline in the first half. It's also important to remember that we have an easy comp in Q4. With all of the growth drivers in the second half that I have mentioned, we have confidence that we can deliver low single-digit EBIT growth for the year. And then with returning cash to shareholders and share repurchases and lower interest expense, we expect our EPS can grow at the low end of the 6% to 10% range that we provided in the fourth quarter call.","As Curt mentioned earlier, we continue to see a pathway to free cash flow for greater than $1.1 billion. I often get asked what makes me confident of Eastman's future. And here is the bottom line from me. Big picture, we continue to focus on what we can control and are winning with customers because of our innovation-driven growth model. And at the same time, we're aggressively reducing our cost to accelerate top line growth to the bottom line. Nothing happens without the dedication and drive of -- the people of Eastman throughout the world who face our challenges and opportunities head on and every day they find ways to overcome them and are determined to win. And that's why I'm confident we're going to win today and far far into the future.","With that I'll turn it back to Greg.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thanks Mark. We've got a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to you as many questions as possible. So as always, I ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that Kim, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","Q \u2013 David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. On your full year guidance, it looks like you lowered segment guidance in one segment AFP, but maintained in the other three. You maintained a full year guidance. Can you talk about that dynamic? And why you didn't take the opposite -- opportunity now to trim the full year guide given the challenging macro?","A \u2013 Mark Costa","Thanks Dave. And in your observation around the guidance is sort of directionally correct. Obviously in the first quarter, our earnings came in a little bit lower than we expected and we have that adjustment in the second quarter. And that's why you saw us take the aggressive cost actions that we announced in late March. So while we have these challenges, we stepped up our cost reductions to take another $40 million out relative to the plans we had in the beginning of the year. That sort of balances that equation out, allows us to stay on track for our guidance.","And we also feel very encouraged by the improvement in volume we saw in March and the continued improvement in the volume that we're seeing as we go into April and getting our mix back. One of the bigger challenges we've had here is mix of our high-value products and that gives us confidence. We're on the right track for the rest of the year.","Q \u2013 David Begleiter","And Mark, on these additional cost actions, how permanent are these actions? And where are they coming from?","A \u2013 Curt Espeland","So David, as we started the year as a reminder, we already taken aggressive cost actions to kind of help offset higher turnaround costs and other anticipated challenges at that time. So as Mark mentioned, as we started the year, we decided to take additional actions which are primarily headcount contractors and discretionary spend. So the additional actions are expected to contribute $40 million to our 2019 results. So I'd call those pretty permanent kind of reductions and again predominantly in the second half of the year. So these factors plus the additional expectation -- expected improvements in 2019, should provide us good momentum going into 2020.","A \u2013 Mark Costa","I'd also note about three quarters of those cost reductions going to manufacturing and they'll go into our COGS and then they will have to flow out. So that's why they're going to very back-end loaded and where the benefits shows up.","Q \u2013 David Begleiter","Thank you, very much.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Q \u2013 Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. What was the magnitude of the cash restructuring charge that you took in the first quarter?","A \u2013 Curt Espeland","So you saw the restructuring charge, I believe it was about $28 million. That's a good portion of that is the anticipated severance of our restructuring programs. There will be a little bit more in the second quarter and maybe a small tail in the second half of the year, but a good portion of that is that $28 million of severance charge accruals that we took in the first quarter. That will be the cash impact. Now not all that cash flows out. This year, it could go over a 12-month time period too, so some of these severances accruals get paid out over a 12-month period.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then, for my follow-up, your prices in Advanced Materials in the quarter, I think, were up 1%. And if you -- and you had negative volumes in the quarter of some mid-single-digit level. And like, if you think about the Celanese's earnings, I think, in there engineered materials their prices were up 7% and they had a similar volume decline to you.","When you look at your businesses versus their businesses, do you find them in any way comparable? Do you think you're more disadvantaged in terms of being able to raise price? Or do you think that there was an opportunity where you could have been more aggressive and you plan to be more aggressive in the future? Can you kind of assess this difference? Can you assess that comparison?","Mark Costa","Sure, Jeff and good morning. First of all, the Celanese's business and our business are just fundamentally different. So it really doesn't make sense to make a lot of comparisons. They're primarily a compounding business with a completely different set of polymers and different set of applications. So I'm really focused on us.","The business that we have has been incredibly successful delivering very strong earnings growth for the last six years and this year it will be the seventh. And the underlying driver of that is volume and mix improvement, as the key to sort of driving that growth where we're selling at very high-growth rates, very high value, high-margin products like Tritan and heads-up display, interlayers, performance films, et cetera, relative to the segment average and we keep on driving the weighted average mix growth up. So that's the core and heart of our strategy.","Pricing is, obviously, a key part of how you manage your spreads for any product relative to raw materials. And our goal is always to keep it stable, because that's how you keep a solid relationship with your customers long-term for innovation.","So in our business -- and SP was probably -- the specialty plastics guys are probably up about 3% in price and then that was offset by some price declines in advance interlayers for a high-value products. We've discussed this all back at Innovation Day.","When you have these very high-value products and you're in the early phases of adoption, your prices gets your cost structure quite high. And then as you develop scale and volume and growth of that, you share some of that benefits of scale with your customers in price declines, which is especially typical in the automotive industry where those products go.","So you see that going on, but the volume mix growth is so strong, double-digit levels, that the earnings grow despite those modest price declines. So in general, that's sort of where it played out. What I'd say is that, when you're trying to build a business and have innovation be at the heart of your business.","And the markets we serve where we work with the same large customers forever, right, the glass customers or even the tire coating customers in the AFP side. You got to have a relationship where they have trust in you and that you're being balanced on how you manage your price versus raws, which we do very well. Our spreads are relatively stable, but you can't be greedy, right?","So when you have a declining raw material situation, raising prices aggressively at the same time creates a significant amount of tension with your customers, where they are not as excited about innovating with you and they are certainly very motivated to find alternative suppliers to you when you -- if you do that.","And in specialty business, you can do that for a short period of time, in our kind of businesses, but then you suffer the consequence later on about losing volume 12 months or so later, as they work to find alternatives. So we think we have a good balanced relationship with our customers. They understand what we're trying to do. We keep our spread steady and we drive volume\/mix growth and set around innovation.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question today is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. This is Regina [ph] filling on for Bob. You're highlighting some sequential earnings improvements through the year and the 4Q to 1Q improvement was notable. But when you fast-forward to 4Q 2019 what kind of year-over-year growth is possible, given the easier comp?","Mark Costa","So, great question and it's an important one to remember when we talk about our back half guidance. With macroeconomic growth occurring with innovation in our high-value specialties, also creating our own growth, we're assuming that 2018 -- I mean, 2019 is going to be materially better and the fourth quarter is an easy comp, right?","So if we can just get back to 2017 levels in Q4, that's $80 million of the hole we have to fill in the first half. And then we look at, for both the third and fourth quarter volume and mix growth being better than 2017. So you've got that as a tailwind to help the back half of the year. And you got the cost flow through, which will flow through, through the back of the year, especially as you go into the fourth quarter. So I expect the fourth quarter to be very strong compared to the past.","Curt Espeland","And what I might add on top of it, I'll remind you the roughly $30 million of impact of foreign currency you're expecting in the first half of the year goes away to a greater extent in the second half of the year, so we don't have that headwind overcome any more in both third and fourth quarters.","Mark Costa","Right. So you put all that together and you -- and the cost reductions, you've got the hole basically being filled in the front half and you've got to just believe in some reasonable volume mix growth and some raw material tailwinds and you can get to our guidance.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you. And are you seeing any signs that the specialty plastics destocking has ended? Any indication on volume changes for that for quarter-over-quarter and may be also year-over-year for 2Q?","Mark Costa","Yes. We've already seen that. So January, in particular February were rough. The destocking in the fourth quarter that continued in those first two months was pretty significant. You have to remember that the vast majority of what we sell into China from specialty plastics is made into products that are predominantly exported back to the U.S. and to some extent Europe.","So when you get into this trade war issue. A lot of those producers really lost confidence in their ability to sort of export back to the U.S., because they fear the trade there and tariff is going back to 25%. That's what held them up in the third quarter -- I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter last year as well as the uncertainty what would happen on March 1.","As things started to sort of stabilize, and look like things we\u2019re going to get settled to some degree, people starting to getting back to business and we saw a pretty good recovery in Tritan orders, in particular in March and March was, as a month pretty strong, and those orders are holding up as we go into April.","So we feel pretty good about the destocking question when it comes to specialty plastics. And when you combine that with raw materials, finally starting to flow through at a benefit in the second quarter, it leads to a pretty strong second quarter sequentially from the first.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just kind of maybe a little bit of a follow-up on the last one. As it relates to trade and the settlement of the trade dispute, what's your sort of sense from talking to customers about how activity or behavior or buying patterns will improve?","It sounds like there's already been some improvement sort of as people sense that a resolution is within sight. So how much of an incremental step up would you anticipate right away post settlement? Or is this something that's going to take a few months or a quarter before we sort of have a real sense of how much of a snap back there's going to be?","Mark Costa","Vincent, a great question, and it's obviously a pretty difficult one to forecast since we're depended on President Trump settling a trade dispute with President Xi and the timing of that is unknown or and the details of it are unknown. But based on everything we've seen, which is the same stuff you've seen, it seems like they're making good progress, and the odds of escalation now are going down. And I'd say that's very well covered here in the press in the U.S.","But from what we can tell in China, they're pretty quiet. They're very being very careful about declaring any kind of victory or possible victory with their -- inside their country, because they just don't know what's going to happen with President Trump. So there's still a lot of caution and uncertainty in China today.","But I'd say, the destocking is mostly playing out and behind us, so you've got the removal of that headwind. And primary demand is still out there including exports to some degree, but we really haven't seen any restocking yet. That could be material at some point, and we're not banking on much of that in our forecast, so that would be upside. So what we need is a trade settlement to sort of get settled, not escalate and the Chinese government to send the all-clear signal to their companies and their consumers that things are going to get back to normal.","You've also got them dumping a ton of stimulus into their economy, which is also of course helping improve things right now. We can see some of that benefit. So when we put that altogether, we feel like it is stabilizing. News is getting out that the things are going to be okay in China, but we're not really seeing a dramatic recovery yet. But we're a lot better off than where we were in January and February.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And on the adhesives resins competitive activity, has that been sort of made worse by the trade issue and -- or just weak demand? And if that's something that potentially were about to lap or could snap back post resolution?","Mark Costa","Yes. So far on adhesives, the global underlying market growth rates for adhesives is very strong. It's in your consumables hygiene applications. And overall I'd say, it's pretty good. There's no question in China demand has been a bit off, especially in some applications. They are a little bit more consumer discretionary, and that's contributed to some of the pressure in the marketplace. But adhesives is more of a supply-driven issue than it is a demand-driven issue.","As we told you in the past, we've had new capacity come in the marketplace in Asia, and the growth slowing down a bit doesn't help in that equation. The good news is this business has very strong underlying market growth rates that will continue that are really not that discretionary. We got to use the diapers and we got to use them. And so we feel good about observing this capacity that's been added.","On top of that, we've got innovation rolling out in the marketplace this year. That is a huge sustainability trend. This market is no order -- preferably no order no VOC kind of product. We've now launched the best-in-class product for those applications with this sensitivity on the environment out there. And it's expected to grow quite well. We'll get that in the marketplace in the back half of this year towards the end, and that gives us another way to grow out of this business. And the raws and resin conversions also continues where same environmental trend raws have a lot of odor and smell too. Consumers don't want that. And so that's another way we're picking up resin growth to fill up the capacity.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Mark Costa","We expect second half to be better.","Operator","PJ Juvekar from Citi has our next question.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning, PJ.","PJ Juvekar","I'm looking at ethylene prices. Ethylene prices have collapsed. They're down to what $0.13. And I know you don't sell as much ethylene now, which are RGP project. But then looking at propylene, it's also down with propylene inventories close to six million barrels. So I guess my question is if one or more complex remains weak, are you able to get pricing on your derivative products?","Mark Costa","Yeah. Good question. So on the ethylene side as you just mentioned, we had a considerable headwind in ethylene last year, and the RGP investment we made this year, which is up and running incredibly well and actually performing better than we expected is taking us a long way in reducing the ethylene we sell this year in the merchant market and that helps mitigate a lot of that headwind giving us a year-over-year benefit. So that's been great.","When it comes to derivatives, you're right to point out that propylene and ethylene don't define the price of a derivative. It's just an indicator of the underlying market conditions. And in a lot of places, prices are holding up well in our derivatives from propylene and ethylene but there are few places where Curt called out that we do see some price pressure in particular glycols MPG, MEG and glycol ether, places where we're seeing some price pressure creating some spread compression.","So that's factored into our guidance. And to some degree that's what offsets the benefits we've created through RGP and not having the industrial gas outages from last year those net out those benefits to keep the segment stable this year.","PJ Juvekar","Okay. And then you added a lot of new capacity in products like Triton, Crystex and PVB. So if I look at all of them together in aggregate, what ballpark EBITDA do you expect in 2019 from that?","Curt Espeland","PJ, we don't breakout the EBITDA growth just from distinct projects. What they are really driving is the underlying growth in the markets we serve that we've been providing in our guidance. So like Advanced Materials where we're talking about earlier, again that business is looking to grow EBIT, 7% to 10% EBITDA would be reciprocal to that other than the factors a little different.","So overall those projects are typically greater than cost of capital returns, driving good returns and there will be one of the factors that long-term contribute to our EBITDA growth as a percentage.","Mark Costa","I mean, what I'd add is that the fact that we did all those plants is because our volume growth has been so strong from 2015 through 2017. We are running out of capacity on all those products last summer and they started up just in time. And, obviously, we didn't predict a trade war impacting demand in the short-term.","But as those markets come back through this short-term disruption on the macro, the fixed cost leverage of all that's going to be very attractive when that volume from those high value products come in and as we work through the back half of this year-end and even more so in 2020.","PJ Juvekar","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet.","Matt Skowronski","Hey good morning, it's Matt Skowronski on Aleksey this morning. On the last call you gave out a Brent crude prediction for the year. It seems to change since then. Can you just tell us how this changes your outlook?","Curt Espeland","It doesn't really have much of an impact on our outlook. We're in the $70 range. We're now what $74 before. So I think that it's important to remember that oil is part of an indicator of how raw material prices move, but it's not the only indicator.","Last year oil did move up quite a bit especially as we got into the third quarter, but the spreads above oil also dramatically increased. So if you've looked at something like paraxylene, normal spreads above naphtha are like $300 a ton. You at history we were well over $700 in the third quarter last year and we're now back to sort of in the $500 range.","And even with the oil up, we expect that $500 keep moving its way back to normal because there's a lot of capacity coming along in PX in the back half of this year. So you got to remember that those are indicators but they're not -- there's a lot more going on in any of these markets.","So even if with oil being a bit higher than we expected a lot of the raw materials that we buy we don't expect those prices to move up much. And in places where they do, we'll increase prices. We've have demonstrated we're very disciplined about managing prices. We offset all the raw material increases through the third quarter last year with price increases. And as we look at the price raw trade-off in the specialties, we expect to get back to the second quarter spreads of last year by the second quarter of this year and then that becomes a tailwind as we go to the back half. So we can manage that.","Matt Skowronski","Thanks for that. And then in Fibers, on the last call you noted that it will be the weakest quarter, which it was. How did trends look so far in April? And can you give an outlook on pricing for the remainder of the year?","Mark Costa","Sure. So on the volume side as Curt mentioned, we expect volumes for the year to be slightly down with the overall market decline. So what's underneath that assumption is customer buying patterns in this business as you look at our history bounce around a lot. So Q1 was just uniquely low customer buying pattern outside of China.","In China this is a trade related issue where they stop buying tow from us made in the U.S. And we had to start shifting to our Korean facility to import in the U.S. We have orders now from the Korean facility, but we're still in the qualification process on some of the -- with some of the customer plants there. But we feel like we'll get back to sort of where we needed to be on that volume relative to last year as well.","So, I think we're fine. It's just going to be lumpy in how it spreads out. I mean second quarter will be a lot better than the first quarter in volume. And price, another good question.","Prices were down a little bit more in the first quarter versus the rest of the year because some of the price declines we put in place last year didn't go effective until April 1. So, you're going to just see a bit more of a drop in Q1, than what you'll see for the rest of the year. On a full year basis prices won't be down very much at all.","Matt Skowronski","Thank you.","Mark Costa","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.","Q \u2013 Frank Mitsch","Hey Good morning, folks I\u2019d appreciate some of the colors so far. Curt you were talking about the use of that $1.1 billion plus free cash flow that bolt-on are part of that equation. How is that, market looking to you right now? How should we think about the probabilities or the possibilities of Eastman doing more than just Marlotherm?","A \u2013 Curt Espeland","Yeah. I would say our bolt-on acquisition pipeline is active. There are several opportunities we're looking at. As always it's got to make sure you does the right diligence pay a fair price? And hopefully don't find bigger spreads. I'd say right now it's possible. You might see one or two more small acquisitions during the course of the year, but we'll see how those play out.","Q \u2013 Frank Mitsch","And small -- just for definitional purposes, less than $100 million sort of a ballpark?","A \u2013 Curt Espeland","Yeah. I would say, less than $100 million in that ballpark yes in aggregate.","Q \u2013 Frank Mitsch","All right, all right, terrific. And Mark, you did a nice job talking about how March came back in terms of volumes and certainly you're seeing that through the month of April as well. So, I'm wondering if you can give some granularity by region on what you're seeing there. And what the expectation is for the second quarter?","A \u2013 Curt Espeland","Sure. And good morning, Frank. So, the biggest hit across all regions when it comes to value was China. It's important to keep in mind that different regions have very different margin profile. So, when you look at our specialty businesses two-third of their revenue is outside the U.S.","And so when you are in China, we sell very few commodity products in there. It's almost all specialties, variable margins are substantially higher than the U.S. average that includes a lot of CIs and a very little of that is exporting.","So, the big volume and what I'm saying is mix hit was China and mostly that was where we also saw the most extreme amount of destocking going on things like Triton tires even a little bit of adhesives and some coatings. And so when we got to March, we saw a good recovery in Tritan.","We saw a good recovery in some of our highest value specialties in coatings. And tires are still sort of working it out so far. So China has been a pretty big -- pretty attractive snapback towards the end of the quarter. And it seems to be holding up so far through April.","Europe, it's a little bit late different story. And I would say Europe is still very much attached to the China trades issue. When the Chinese cut back on imports it's not just a U.S. impact it actually has a bigger impact on Germany than it does on us because they are so dependent on exports.","So you're seeing that economy slowdown all connected to the same issue. We're seeing demand recover there as well but it's more of a lag effect, so a little bit slower in its recovery. And that's why you see, AFP having a bit more challenge in recovering its earnings to last year versus AM which is much more sort of China dependent on where the impact occurred. The U.S. has been sort of stable and moving along just fine.","Q \u2013 Frank Mitsch","Terrific, thanks, Mark.","Operator","And up next we have Mike Sisson from KeyBanc.","Q \u2013 Mike Sisson","Hi guys. In terms of Advanced Materials they're still may be struggling a little bit to see the growth in the second half. I did the math. The EBIT growth -- operating growth needs to be somewhere around 30%.","You have three kinds of factors you noted like lower raw materials, volume and may be less FX. Can you maybe help us understand what -- are they about even in terms of the recovery for the second half? Or am I missing a couple of other variables that help to grow that?","A \u2013 Mark Costa","Volume mix is a primary driver Mike. Obviously, we don't have the currency headwind that we had in the first half of the year. So, you don't have that $15 million headwind. That is on AM in the first half of the year, repeating in the second half. So, there's that. There's raw material flow tailwind.","Of course with PX, that's going to help as that price comes off relative to a very high price last year. But the biggest driver by far is volume mix. You got to remember that -- what we're saying is we're going to grow volume mix, through the back half of this year relative to the first half of this year which means it's going to be materially better than 2017.","And when you look at the drop in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018, due to volume and mix and the higher raw material costs, you're going to fill that entire hole. And then add to it with some additional volume and mix especially when we got all these products like heads-up display interlayers and performance films growing at double-digits. So when we put all of math together, it's -- you can get to the guidance per revenue.","A \u2013 Curt Espeland","And on that fact I'll add just two comments on top of it. Don't forget that EV comp on the fourth quarter basis -- look at what they did in fourth quarter 2017 versus fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect that to be growing on top of what we saw back in the fourth quarter of 2017. So that is a good pillar. The second thing I'd add is this not only for Advanced Materials, but for the corporation as a whole is this benefit of the flow through of lower raw material costs.","And so to give you some sense, if you think about just the first quarter, the flow through of lower raw material costs was only a benefit of roughly $10 million and that is only a small piece. And within that it was mostly a benefit in the commodities and still a headwind in these specialties. So as these lower raw materials slow, second quarter as well second half of the year you will see improved EBIT resulting from the flow through lower raws on top of the utilization and the volume\/mix growth.","Mike Sisson","Got it.","Mark Costa","Yes. I also want to emphasis asset utilization is a big deal guys. So when you have to slow the plants like we did last year in the fourth quarter to adjust the demand situation and even run them a little bit slow in the first quarter, your asset utilization, your fixed cost per kg goes up in a meaningful way. So as volume picks up that starts to accelerate how all the cost cuts we're doing can flow into a lower cost per kg and benefit earnings in the back half of the year.","Mike Sisson","Okay. Great. And then a quick follow-up. You spent a lot of time over the years moving your portfolio into more specialty areas. If you look at the first -- the fourth and first quarter results for the specialty businesses, I'm still a little bit surprised the earnings got hit so much. So when you think about the performance that you expect to see and I understand it's -- there are much higher-margin businesses, but what's kind of the takeaway you want us to see in terms of supporting the notion that your portfolio is much more special than it was?","Mark Costa","Yes. So I mean, the growth in the specialties has really been a tremendous success story. If you even just go back and look at history here from 2014 to now, we've done a series of acquisitions here. We've delivered a significant amount of innovation growth on top of that. And we've grown the EBITDA from these two segments by over $500 million from 2014 and if you put on our constant-currency basis over $600 million. So this is a great story of delivering a phenomenal amount of earnings growth in the last five years all to -- due to our growth model and our innovation that allows us to sustain our spreads and drive volume and importantly mix upgrade.","And I don't think anything of that story has changed from a long-term point of view as I look forward. No question, we in our portfolio have a high exposure to consumer discretionary spend. Transportation B&C, consumer durables, it's about 45% of the company's total revenue. So if you have a situation where there is a correction and demand in those spaces and that is clearly what we saw in 4Q, 2Q and for 4Q and 1Q and a little bit still dragging on into 2Q for AFP.","When you lose that very high variable margin demand with destocking to correct to the sort of trade economic situation, you're going to take a hit given the value of those kgs relative to the company average. But the good news is, we've already seen demand coming back in March and April. So that demand comes back, the economies improve and that value that we've created over the last five years through volume and mix growth comes back in a pretty dramatic fashion on the other side of the equation just like it went away comes back the same way.","And so there's sort of sensitivity we have to consumer discretionary. I don't think that's a secret about our portfolio. And the good news is we make a lot of money in China. And I believe long term China is going to be an attractive growth market to continue to deliver a lot of growth in the future.","Curt Espeland","Mike one other just takeaway as you think about all those long-term benefits that Mark talked about. On a short-term basis, don't forget that these specialties have a long supply chain. And so when you have a disruption like these trade wars that's where you have some of the negative impact like you see in the fourth quarter and first quarter. Those will return to more normal levels and we have -- also might have a bounce back at some point as those supply chains fill back in. So just keep in mind short-term, it's been impacted by those supply chains in those of market dynamics.","Mike Sisson","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Dan Rizzo","Hi, guys. It's Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. How are you?","Curt Espeland","Good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","Dan Rizzo","I just really just have one question, the softness in auto and tire has been well documented. Can you just tell us what you're seeing in your construction and ag end markets?","Mark Costa","So on the ag market, obviously things are a little bit slower with the wet weather in the first quarter and we saw some of that impact particularly in CI. But everything we can see in those markets are all coming back as we'd expect. So we feel good about the ag market this year on a full year basis and we're seeing some innovative growth with a few of our customers to help us create our own growth there as well.","When it comes to the construction market, it's been relatively stable. So from an architectural interlayer\u2019s point of view, it has been great. Vast majority of where we're selling the layers is in Europe, where they do laminated glass and we've seen strong growth there through 2018 and that's continuing on through 2019 and that's pretty visible at the back order that you can see in construction.","On the architectural side, North America has been fine. Obviously, China and Europe have been a bit off but we're seeing some recovery there. One other thing I'd mentioned is environmental enforcement does create benefits as well. With this unfortunate accident that's occurred in China, we do see an impact on a few produces that we compete with being shutdown for environmental inspections and things like that. That's giving us a modest tailwind. We're not banking on much of that. But if that continues -- that enforcement continues, there will be an upside to our forecast.","Dan Rizzo","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Duffy Fischer from Barclays is up next.","Duffy Fischer","Yeah. Good morning. First question, just around the raws again. I know you've got an accounting benefit that will flow through in the back half, but a lot of your suppliers would talk about kind of the same destocking events happening that you are seeing with your products. So, if you get that back half pickup in economic activity like you're expecting, what do you think the odds are when you look at all your raw materials and kind of the supply demand that actually prices there will rise fairly rapidly and maybe we're talking about raw material headwinds in the back half of the year?","Mark Costa","Yeah. When we look at the specific products that we buy, Duffy, I don't see there is a significant risk there. I mean, you can always get into oil price scenarios. And if demand driven where oil goes up then we'll have the demand market conditions to raise prices and we'll be fine. Supply driven events in oil is a different discussion. But we're not really worried about that with the raws that we buy, especially because the one that was a biggest problem for us in the back half of last year was PX and there's so much new capacity coming online.","Duffy Fischer","Fair enough. And then just to jump to Fibers, can you breakout if you just look at say the EBITDA year-over-year kind of they're down $14 million, how much of that was China versus ex-China? And then do you think it will be difficult to get your Chinese business back once the deal is settled because obviously they are players inside China that have excess capacity they're probably back filling that today. Is that a structural step down do you think, or will that be pretty quick to come back?","Mark Costa","Yeah. As far as the demand goes in the first quarter I would say it's sort of balanced between the China factor and sort of just customer buying patterns across the quarters for this year with another customers.","In regards to your second question, there is no competitor in China backfilling us. The -- all the companies -- or the plants that make tow in China are joint ventures with CNTC, our customer. They run those plans flat out every day as best as they possibly can every year which is why imports dropped when they add that capacity over the last five years.","So the imports -- and we're now down to pretty small levels are just being shifted around from plants -- to different plants that are not outside of the U.S. But we have a great relationship with our customer there and they are working with us and we believe we'll get back in.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts","Thanks. You mentioned the coming paraxylene capacity, I think it's the primary target of some of the new crude to chemical projects coming online globally. So I guess this could be a multi-year kind of weakness in paraxylene. Do you think structurally you'll end up passing some of that through because the whole polyester, I guess, complex could come under pressure with weaker paraxylene over time here?","Mark Costa","Yeah. So there's a lot of PX coming online. The big chunks in the back half of this year are just traditional PX plants, not the sort of oil or the chemical things. But we -- there will be some passing along with some of that PX value to some of our customers which is natural and the logic -- I started with in the beginning of the Q&A session here I'll reference you back to which is you got to have a balanced approach to the customers if you want them continuing buy from you and we work with the same customers for the last decade and I hope the next decade. And so we got to have respect and trust and innovation together.","John Roberts","Thank you. ","Greg Riddle","Let\u2019s make the last -- the next question the last one, please.","Operator","And that will come from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you for squeezing me in. Mark, I had a question for you on interlayers. In your prepared remarks, I think you referenced double-digit growth prospects for Saflex. And you threw out I believe 20% in Europe. And so I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what is driving that? The build rates have obviously been tough and my recollection is that Sekisui was adding some capacity in the Netherlands.","So perhaps you could elaborate are you gaining share? Is it penetration mix heads-up displays construction what would be driving that premium?","Mark Costa","Yeah. So, specifically that 20% applies to heads-up display interlayers in Europe not the overall interlayer business. So what you're doing is you're replacing standard interlayers with one that includes acoustics and heads-up display. And we're the world leader in that specific product, but it's a very small percentage of the overall market right now. There's not that many heads-up displays in cars yet. So we're seeing just tremendous growth as we're adding that feature because auto OEMs are always looking us a way to value up cars especially in the slow growth markets. They want more feature packages to offer -- to get more volume per car which is a great lever for us in the different kind of features we had. So that's going quite well. And I'd also add the architectural is also growing really well in Europe as well. So that gives us a way to offset the underlying auto market trends. It's very impressive that performance films and interlayers is stable in this auto market.","Q \u2013 Kevin McCarthy","So Mark, how would you characterize the all-in structural growth rate in the interlayers business, I don't know over the next three-plus years or so?","A \u2013 Mark Costa","Well, I think that again volume mix, we continue to expect that the Advanced Materials segment including ASP will grow sort of double the underlying market growth rates. So any one guess on what the automotive growth rate is going to be, but we're real better in there.","Q \u2013 Kevin McCarthy","All right. Thank you.","A \u2013 Mark Costa","Thanks Kevin.","Greg Riddle","All right. Thanks again everyone for joining us this morning. A replay of this call will be available on the website later today. And hope you all have a great day.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference today. Thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on Eastman's website, at www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory Riddle","Thank you, Augusta and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are: Mark Costa, CEO; Curtis Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Josh Morgan, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 3 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's first quarter 2014 financial results news release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for 2013 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for first quarter 2014.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain noncore or nonrecurring costs and charges. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in our first quarter 2014 financial results news release, which can be found at eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the first quarter news release.","And lastly, we have posted slides that accompany our remarks for this morning's call on our website in the Presentations & Events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning. Thanks for joining us. It\u2019s good to be here emerging into the spring and putting the winter behind us. I would like to begin on Slide 3 with some of the highlights from the first quarter.","Business results from the first quarter were as expected and we feel good about our expected performance for the full year. Eastman specific actions which we expect to contribute $0.50 to $0.75 of earnings per share growth in 2014 are on track.","Some examples include mix improvements in Advanced Materials or [ph] products like Tritan copolyester and premium acoustic interlayers, we had the larger percentage of our revenue in the first quarter. Our acetate joint venture in China is also producing commercial quantities. And we continue to benefit from synergies related to Solutia acquisition.","Another Solutia related synergy is the progress we continue to make on our corporate tax rate this quarter, bringing the rate down to 28% and with the potential for it to go lower. As a comparison, for the full-year of 2010, our effective tax rate was 34%.","We also continue to be disciplined in how we deploy capital. During the quarter, we announced two bolt-on acquisitions which are complementary to our existing fluids and performance films businesses and will help us grow profitably and I will talk more about those later.","And our board authorized us to repurchase another $1 billion of shares and with $260 million of share repurchase in the quarter, we\u2019ve begun using this authorization after completing the previous $300 million authorization. This authorization further reinforces the board\u2019s commitment to returning cash to shareholders and its confidence in our ability to deliver consistent superior value.","Finally, Eastman was recognized by the EPA with the 2014 ENERGY STAR Partner of The Year \u2013 Sustained Excellence Award. This is the third consecutive year Eastman has been recognized as an Energy Star Partner of the year. And we are the only chemical company to have won 3 Energy Star awards.","This recognition is a great win for us on two fronts, as it represents both our commitment to improving the environment through energy conservation, as well as our ability to reduce energy costs through smart management, innovative sustainable solutions and ongoing productivity improvement.","On Slide 4, I will review our first quarter results. As we indicated back in January, we expected to start out the year a bit slower than we did in 2013 due to factors such as narrowing olefin spreads and customer buying patterns for certain product lines especially fluids, fibers and performance films, and our results are consistent with that guidance.","Sales revenue was essentially flat as volume growth in coatings, advanced materials \u2013 premium product lines and Adhesives & Plasticizers was offset by lower volume in specialty fluids, performance films and rubber additives.","Operating earnings declined by about 5% with higher propane costs being a significant headwind this quarter, particularly for Specialty Fluids & Intermediates segment and also impacting our Additives & Functional Products and Adhesives & Plasticizers segments.","Another factor that impacted our results in the first quarter was weak demand in China, particularly for solvents, tires and plasticizer product lines where we see slowing China growth results and increased composition in the North American and European markets. While longer-term we remain very positive on China in their shift towards a more consumer-based economy, midterm this transition is clearly challenged.","Earnings-per-share was about flat year over year as lower operating earnings was offset by a lower share count, stronger other income, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. And this result is consistent with our strategy of using all lines of the income statement to deliver EPS growth.","And I will turn over to Curt to review the segment results and our cash generation.","Curtis Espeland","Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. I will begin on Slide 5 with the review of the Additives & Functional Products segment.","Sales revenue increased slightly as higher sales volumes for coatings more than offset lower sales volumes for rubber additives. The higher sales volumes for coatings was primarily attributed to strong demand in both the building and construction and transportation end markets. The lower sales volume for rubber additives was primarily attributed to customer destocking in Asia-Pacific, which we believe is now behind us and we look forward to volume growth in this business for the balance of 2014.","Operating earnings were down $4 million as propane prices were roughly 55% higher year-over-year. Looking forward we expect strengthening [ph] demand in the coatings and tires markets generally will be a benefit. However higher year-over-year propane costs will continue to be challenged carrying into the second quarter. So we expect these higher costs will not be a factor in the second half of the year.","In addition, we are investing roughly $10 million in our tire business for the year. This is primarily to support enhancements in the technology for our market-leading Crystex product line and we expect this investment to begin ramping up in the second quarter. And we are seeing increasing competition for solvents primarily due to the impact of economic weakness in China. As a result, we continue to expect operating earnings will be between $410 million and $430 million for the year.","Adhesives & Plasticizers is next on Slide 6. Year over year revenue was flat as tire volume was offset by lower selling prices. Volume increased for adhesive resins as the hygiene and packaging markets strengthened and in the year ago quarter, there was customer inventory destocking.","Pricing decline for both adhesive resins and plasticizers due to increased competitive pressures. Operating earnings declined slightly year-over-year with lower selling prices and higher propane costs offsetting lower operating costs and volume growth. Given the challenge that adhesives and plasticizers experienced in 2013, I thought I would provide some sequential comments for this segment.","Sequentially revenue increased more than 7% with volume gains in adhesive resins driven by a competitor outage and some seasonality and volume gains in plasticizers due to continued substitution of phthalate plasticizers with non-phthalate plasticizers and seasonality. Operating earnings increased sequentially primarily due to the volume growth in adhesives resins.","Looking at the full-year 2014, we expect end markets, including hygiene, packaging and building and construction to have stronger demand. However we do not expect the competitor outages that occurred earlier part of the year to continue into the second half. We are also expecting increased competition from adhesive resins capacity being added by a competitor. As a result, we continue to expect adhesives and plasticizers earnings to be between $150 million and $175 million for the year.","Moving next to Advanced Materials on Slide 7. Revenue was relatively unchanged while operating earnings increased. For revenue higher sales volume for Tritan copolyesters and premium acoustic interlayers was offset by lower performance films volume due to a plan change in customer incentive terms in Asia-Pacific, shifting volume to second and third quarters.","The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to lower unit costs especially for copolyesters resulting from higher capacity utilization, partially offset by lower volume and lower capacity utilization in performance films. Additionally, product mix improvements continue to be a source of earnings growth for this segment and that was reflected in this quarter's results with the previously noted growth in Tritan and premium acoustic interlayers.","Looking at the full year, we continue to expect volumes to increase and product mix to improve as we grow our premium branded products, including Tritan, premium acoustic interlayers and performance films. As a result, we expect earnings to be between $280 million and $300 million which would be strong growth.","Next up is Fibers on Slide 8. Sales revenue increased as higher selling prices were partially offset by lower sales volume. The lower volume was primarily in acetate tow due to customer buying patterns and additional industry capacity, including our joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation, which is now producing commercial quantities. This was partially offset by acetate flake sales volume to the joint venture. We anticipate buying [ph] patterns for acetate tow will return to more normal levels beginning in the second quarter.","Operating earnings increased as the higher selling prices and the sales of flake to the JV were partially offset by the lower acetate tow volume. For the full year, Fibers is on track for operating earnings between $500 million and $520 million.","I will finish up the segment reviews with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on Slide 9. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower volume which was mostly offset by higher prices. The lower sales volume was in both specialty fluids and other intermediates. The lower sales volume in specialty fluids was primarily due to the timing of customer project completions.","The higher selling prices were primarily due to more sales of higher priced specialty fluids and higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings declined due to higher raw material energy costs, lower volume and cost of a weather related outage at our Longview Texas facility.","For the company, the weather related outage in Longview had about an $8 million negative impact on the first quarter's and there will be a smaller impact that will carry into the second quarter.","Looking at the full year, we expect higher raw material and energy costs will continue to be a challenge. We also expect some of our license activities to be completed in 2015 as opposed to during 2014. And we\u2019re expecting specialty fluids volumes to be down for the year as the slowdown in China negatively impacts the rate of construction for new chemical plants. As a result, we are expecting operating earnings will likely be towards the lower end of the range of $330 million to $370 million that we provided in January.","On Slide 10, I will cover some of our other financial highlight for the quarter. We used operating cash of $30 million in the first quarter which was in line with our expectations. Net earnings were solid and we had our normal seasonal working capital increased for receivables and inventory.","Moving to free cash flow, you see it was a negative $205 million in what is typically our seasonally lowest quarter for the free cash flow. Capital expenditures at $122 million is in line with our expectation for full-year 2004 capital expenditures of approximately $600 million. And we paid our dividend which was $53 million in the quarter.","We also repurchased $260 million in outstanding shares during the first quarter completing our prior authorization and using approximately $100 million of the new $1 billion authorization announced in February. With our first quarter results we're on track for the full-year free cash flow of approximately $600 million. I would note this expectation does not include the cash impact of any acquisition related costs.","Lastly, our tax rate for the first quarter was just over 28%, a nice improvement over our previous guidance, reflecting continuing benefits from the integration of Eastman and Solutia business operations and our underlying legal entity structures.","We currently expect our tax rate for the full-year to be approximately 28%. We are continuing our efforts with Solutia operation which could possibly result in a slightly lower effective tax rate going forward. Further, the effective tax rate excludes the benefits of any tax extenders in 2014 should our legislators be kind enough to extend them in this calendar year.","With that, though, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Curt. I am on Slide 11 to discuss our full-year 2014 outlook. Our first quarter earnings were solid start to the year putting us on track to meet our previous expectations. We continue to expect that Eastman- specific actions will continue to contribute $0.50 to $0.75 for the year. As we previously guided, the benefits of these actions should increase over the course of the year and be more significant in the second half.","We also haven't seen anything that changes our view on the impact of nearing olefin spreads on 2014 earnings. We still expect to be between $0.30 and $0.40 with more of the impacts in the first half given how high propane prices were at the beginning of the year.","We start out the year with flat revenue and we expect global economic growth to be lackluster this year. However second quarter revenue started out very strong.","And with that, and the expectations that will gain momentum this year, our revenue growth for the full year should be consistent with global GDP growth. We\u2019ll see economic growth improve globally from where it is now, and particularly in end markets such as transportation, building construction and consumables, we have leveraged to that growth. And we will continue to benefit from a disciplined approach to capital allocation including share repurchases and bolt-on acquisitions we have announced. As a result, we continue to expect 2014 EPS to be between $6.70 and $7.00 per share.","Turning next to Slide 12, we remain committed to our strategy of delivering consistent earnings growth from a portfolio, especially businesses, that we will grow through both organic efforts and acquisitions, at the heart of our strategy sustaining our earnings and growth in our core businesses that provides cash flow to deliver consistent growth. With two thirds of our sales revenue coming from product lines where we have the number one or two position we are well positioned in leading these markets including how we continue to innovate and win with our customers. Our growth in Tritan, premium acoustics are great examples of this success. At the foundation of our success is our world-class technologies and integrated nature of our streams which gives us an advantage.","We\u2019re well positioned to leverage our world-class technology platforms in cellulose, polyesters, olefins and PVB into new applications as we address global macro trends such as energy efficiency in emerging class and a move towards increased health and wellness. We\u2019re seeing great promise in several of our top organic growth platforms such as microfibers, cellulose for tires and polyesters for coatings. Further our significant stream integration not only gives us the cost advantage, but enables flexibility in how we manage our portfolio to flex where we can have the highest margins. The expectations we have for this year and beyond indicate they were making great progress implementing the strategy, which should enable us to drive growth above GDP in the long-term while maintaining our industry average margins \u2013 industry above average margins. And more importantly, this strategy delivers very strong free cash flow enables us to continue our balanced approach to capital allocation to create shareholder value.","On Slide 13, is a nerve review of the bolt-on acquisitions we announced during this quarter. Starting with the BP aviation turbine engine oil business we expect this acquisition will close in the second quarter and will be slightly accretive to 2014 earnings with high single digit EPS accretion in 2015. Results from this acquisition will be reported in specialty fluids intermediate segment and 2013 annual revenues were approximately $100 million. With this acquisition, we will grain a growing and nicely profitable business that aligns well with our existing Skydrol Aviation Fluids Business. As a result, we\u2019ll be better able to meet the needs of the global aviation industry which we expect will result in growth above GDP.","Next is Commonwealth Laminating and Coating or CLC. We expect this acquisition will close during the second half of the year and will be accretive in the first full year after close. Results from this acquisition will be reported in advanced material segment and as with the BP acquisition, 2013 revenues were approximately $100 million annual. With this acquisition, we will extend our performance films global product offerings for solar control window film and protective film applications, expanding our portfolio and our customer base. We also gain efficiencies to better utilization of our manufacturing assets. These acquisitions are examples of Eastman deploying capital to businesses where we have our leadership position in order to strengthen our position and accelerate growth and we are very confident that the returns from these acquisitions will be consistent with our expectation of value creating spread above the cost to capital.","Next is capital allocation on Slide 14. And in the first quarter, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. Starting with capital expenditures, we are in track for approximately $600 million in 2014 and we are spending on specialty products that will contribute to earnings growth this year such as Tritan expansion and the Therminol specialty fluids expansion of wells expected to start later this year or early 2015. Moving next to debt, after repaying the term loan from Solutia acquisition last year, our remaining debt maturities are attractive and our profile is consistent with our investment grade company. On joint ventures and acquisitions, we are continuing to look for additional acquisitions, but the market remains floppy. And on the trading cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, we did both in the quarter. We expect to continue to repurchase shares for the balance for the year, but expect the pace to moderate from the first quarter levels. And on the dividend it continues to be reasonable for investors expect that dividends will increase of their earnings.","Lastly this morning I\u2019m pleased to announce that we\u2019re hosting an Investor Day in New York on Thursday November 6. We\u2019ve been on quite a journey over the last decade to get to where we have a portfolio especially businesses with leading positions and product lines that represent two thirds of our revenue. We\u2019ve delivered four consecutive earnings growth \u2013 years of growth and are poised for a fifth year in 2014. The main purpose of our Investor Day this year will be for our senior management share with you our strategy for building on its foundation to grow earnings for the years to come. We\u2019ll be sending more detail shortly, I hope you all be able to join us, with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Greg.","Gregory Riddle","","Okay thanks, Mark. We have a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, Augusta, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer session","","Operator","","Thank you, Mr. Riddle. The question-and-answer session will be expected electronically [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yes, good morning. Mark can you discuss how your volume would\u2019ve trended on a monthly basis through the quarter recognizing you have the outage at long view? And then how you\u2019re order books were shaping up for April?","Mark Costa","Good morning, Kevin. The order trend as you might expect from our guidance trended upward from January through March. So January and February are softer than we expected due to all the factors that we mentioned and then we saw you know some good improvement in margin and even further strength in April.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then secondly, on the adhesives and plasticizers you indicated some issues there, how would you compare the sequential improvement to a normal seasonal pattern and to maybe can provide a little bit more color on the various issues, plasticizer pricing and how you see that playing out through the year?","Mark Costa","Sure, the adhesive and plasticizer segment I would describe as stabilizing this year and along lines of what we expected. So on the adhesive side these talking seems to be over when we put it behind us last year and we\u2019ve saw some reasonable improvement in demand in adhesives around packing, hygiene, in particular hygiene and that was a good source of strength for us in the demand improvement. I would also note though that last year was an easy comp where was a little bit of destocking in adhesives as the market loosened up and people are dumping safety stock in Q1, 2013. Overall demand came in nicely and we were also given an additional bump in demand because one of the key competitors in this market had several supply issues that drove some demand our way as well. But that continues to be solid strong growing market and we continue to expect to do so and look forward to that demand.","On the pricing side with adhesives I\u2019d say that the pricing discipline has stabilized for the first half of the year from what we can see rather than prices went up considerably and are staying relatively high which is the key alternative material to hydrocarbon resins, but we do expect some moderation rather than prices towards the back of the year because we can see people are climbing up the trees in China and up to mountain in China to tap the trees and expect a bit of a better raising crop this year and one of our competitors in hydrogen, hydrocarbon business is bringing some capacity online, we\u2019ll be looking to fill that out in the back half of the year.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s helpful, thanks a lot.","Mark Costa","I just want to make sure that I answered your plasticizer question too Kevin which is demand there is improving and quite strong. We see an acceleration and substitution towards 168 non-phthalate plasticizers especially with prop 65 in California naming DIMP as a product of concern for health effects, we\u2019re already seeing some strong moment there. So, the demand\u2019s good there but we continue to face competitor challenges on pricing in plasticizers as a result of Asia Pacific demand being week and competitor from Asia looking to place material in Europe and North America.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks Mark.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Robert Ford of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Ford \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Thank you good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","Robert Ford \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","If you could talk a little bit about the \u2013 I may have missed, when you talked about the film Customer Incentives in Asia that is one of issue or is it something that is a sustainable change.","Mark Costa","","It's a sustainable change in our shifting to customer order pattern where we hope to be more in line with demand and production through the season which is predominately strong in second and third quarter. We had some customers who are loading up in the beginning of the year and then are buying much and we\u2019re trying to smooth out the production patterns. So we expect that demand will be solid and on track for performance films for the year, it just as a slightly different shape and that will be the case in the future years.","Robert Ford \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","I think that\u2019s kind of rubber market and particularly in tires, we saw some pretty good macro data out there and I guess, if that was evident I didn\u2019t notice it in your trends, are there something going around buying patterns for rubber additives that we would have missed some of that better macro data during the quarter?","Mark Costa","No, it\u2019s not a buying pattern shift. This was more of a destocking issue. In Asia Pacific, we had a number of customers who had built more inventory than they needed through the end of last year and entire demand was not great over in Asia Pacific. And you have remembered that we\u2019re highly leveraged commercial truck and tire demand as oppose to passenger tires. And we saw a lot of destocking, I think some of our \u2013 other suppliers to this industry, saw a similar kind of event in Asia Pacific. But demand has already started to improve pretty dramatically relative to where we were in January and February across all the regions. So we feel good about the year from the demand point of view.","Robert Ford \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, it\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning and nice start to the year.","Mark Costa","Thank you.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","I just want to follow up also on this the non-phthalate and phthalate switching plasticizers side, obviously you had tasted some issues with phthalate guys dropping price to maintain share and that was capping your business. But now you\u2019re talking about some of the regulatory issues that are driving your business and how should we think about that switch going forward and the concerns from the competitor behavior from the phthalate guys?","Mark Costa","It\u2019s a good question, Frank. And as we look at, we\u2019re very confident in the demand growth on non-phthalate plasticizers in North America and Europe in particular, is going to be quite strong into the future. We\u2019re only a small percentage of the total plasticizers market at this point, so there is plenty of room for growth and this prop 65 event in California has pushed the number of customers over into finally switching, they all knew was coming and this was sort of \u2013 this rather broke the camel back we think. So on the demand side we feel quite good, but it\u2019s important to note that on the competitive side we still see a lot of competition in which weak demand in Asia there is still lot of price pressure in this business and with this large amount of demand growth we would expect other competitors to switch into trying to make non-phthalate plasticizers on a long-term basis. So great growth, competitor pressure still solid attractive business and the overall segment earnings well above the cost of capital for the business even though it\u2019s earnings we\u2019d like to improve from where we are today.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","All right great. Obviously that\u2019s agents of the guidance of the 150 to 175 for that business which kind of teams on the light side, but we\u2019ll see how the year progresses. And then I also want to follow up on that $0.50 to $0.75 of Eastman specific actions that you guys are taking on the capacity expansion improved mix, tech licensing and synergies. On the tech licensing I thought I heard you suggest that some of that might be slipping in to 2015, I don\u2019t know if I heard that correctly, can you expand upon that? And how are you feeling about that $0.50 to $0.75 for 2014?","Mark Costa","Frank, you heard correctly. The license was part of the $0.50 to $0.75 and the reason you had so much of range of $0.50 to $0.75 was some of the uncertainty we had around licensing on what would happen. So that would be pushing us towards the lower in to that. But I would also recognize Curtis tax department as delivering another solution related synergy on continuing to find ways to improve our taxes. And therefore earnings per share and I think as Curt noted we\u2019re guiding 28 but we have good chance of improving that number and continuing to deliver better EPS growth through that synergy.","Curtis Espeland","","I want to remind you Frank all those factors that some of the improvement that are specific Eastman actions like our expansion of Tritan in the a second half for the year. So we feel good about what\u2019s in $0.50 to $0.75 as it relates to things we control other than the licensing which we\u2019re at to some extent we have to work with our license fees. But it\u2019s really baked in well to our overall guidance for the year.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","All right, so that probably makes $8 a little bit easier for 2015. Thank you so much.","Mark Costa","Thanks Frank.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin \u2013 CLSA Limited","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. One is on Europe; a lot of your competitors have noted how strong Europe\u2019s been from a volume perspective and rebound in the economy there. It seems like your revenues were pretty flat year-over-year. So is there a mix effect, is there something different that\u2019s going out that you\u2019re seeing then others?","Mark Costa","I would say we feel good about Europe being solid. I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a strong volume growth for us. I\u2019m not sure which competitors were discussing strong Europe growth in which segments. What I can tell you is that we\u2019re seeing good strong growth in automotive demand, related to our Saflex products we\u2019re seeing good recovery and strength in the tire related demand and feel good about that. So it\u2019s pretty much in line with our expectations.","Nils-Bertil Wallin \u2013 CLSA Limited","Got it. And then just on the closure of the performance film factory in Taiwan. Was that because of poor costs or demand what was the reason for that closure?","Mark Costa","Yeah, well, we look that as ways to satisfy our business and I would say some of our demand for that Saflex probably is not as strong as we anticipated. So we really took these actions for twofold one is to respond to that expected demand, but also then to improve our costs support service.","Nils-Bertil Wallin \u2013 CLSA Limited","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","","Our next question will come from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","Hi, good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning John.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Could you tell us what the next step are in the Westlake pipeline dispute, and just give us an updated and status of any efforts to monetize assets long you?","Mark Costa","Well, I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019m going to ask Josh just to remind people where we stand with that \u2013 what is our excess ethylene position in Westlake, we have the taxes, but we continue to explore options for monetizing our excess ethylene Josh could just remind everyone on phone what that is?","Josh Morgan","","Sure. This is Josh, John. So the size of this we\u2019re talking about around 700 million pounds of excess ethylene that we sell to the market every year.","Mark Costa","So there is a various contractual and other complexities involved as we talked about. One of those complexities continues to be with our dispute with Westlake. We continue to feel good about our position. The next step is really the Texas Railroad Commission is going to be holding a hearing the next year here is coming up in May. So until we continue to progress with the those actions, we\u2019ll continue to try to monitor the situation. We still have people interested in that excess ethylene position but this just down now a matter of timing to get these results satisfactory.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","And then as a follow up, do you expand you propane hedge at all during the quarter and could you give us an update on that?","Mark Costa","Sure. As I mentioned at the last call, given the volatility in propane and some of our other input costs, we modified our commodity hedging program to extent up to a potential two years rather in the past we can only look at six months as winter spike protection and ultimately our goals to remove volatility of costs. I would say we\u2019re already actively executing out program and also we\u2019re much further along this year then we were at this point last year. So the only thing that\u2019s different year-over-year as I mentioned before we don\u2019t have any hedges on emergence of ethylene sales, but I feel very good about our steps that we\u2019re taking to protect some of our input costs over the next couple of years.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Thanks.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Thanks. Can you remind me what\u2019s in the other segment and what actually happened in the quarter that may they come in better?","Mark Costa","Sure. If you look at the other segment, that\u2019s a reflection of both some of our corporate growth spending that\u2019s not specific to any individual business, as well as some of our pension cost that are not allocated to a segment. When you look at the performance in the first quarter really couple of factors going on, one is there are some lower cost based on some of the actions we took last year, reducing some specific programs. We knew that some of those costs we\u2019re going to go in to some other segments as we supported those growth efforts and that\u2019s why being done so it might have reduced other segment, but it\u2019s being felt in other areas of the businesses. And then some of our gross spending is probably off to a opt to a little slower start then we anticipated, but that\u2019s good cost discipline and aligned with what we\u2019re trying to achieve, but I would expect our corporate growth spending to increase during the course of the year, but when I look at all those pieces together or other segment for the year we\u2019ll probably be more 55 million versus what I provided earlier in the year.","Josh Morgan","I just add, it\u2019s important to keep Curtis\u2019 comment about some of those resource is being deployed to other segment which matched a bit of the earnings growth that\u2019s going on in some this other segment as we\u2019re wrapping up and working on some critical growth programs for the future of the company especially AFP and AM. So just, it\u2019s important to keep that in mind as you\u2019re looking at the year-over-year comps.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Jeffrey Zekauskas Morgan Stanley \u2013 excuse me, JP Morgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, good morning. You spoke about improving your tax position. Does this change for cash taxes and if it does change for cash taxes, by what percent?","Mark Costa","I would say the changes that we\u2019re making on the effective tax rate also impact our cash taxes. These are real savings both in 2014 and going forward. So the things we\u2019re putting in place are things that will help Eastman for many years to come. The cash tax rate that is more \u2013 the change would be more in line with the change in the effective tax rates. So if you go down to 29% to 28% rate, you\u2019ll improve cash taxes by that same percentage point. And then as we improve it further and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll improve it just the order of magnitude, that will have the same impact on cash. The main factor going on right this year on cash taxes continues to the NOL that we\u2019re utilizing from the Solutia integration and that will continue this year and next year.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Right. And you also said that this $0.30 to $0.40 headwind from propane, how much of the $0.30 to $0.40 was in the first quarter?","Mark Costa","","$0.30 to $0.40 that we talked about, we said predominantly was going to be in the first half of the year and that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing, Jeff.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Right, I know that, but how much is in the first quarter?","Mark Costa","We\u2019re going to see a fair bit in the first half and it\u2019s probably a weighted a little bit more towards first quarter than second quarter.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","","Jeffery Fisher with Barclays has our next question.","Jeffery Fisher \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Yes, good morning. First questions, the continuing, kind of the propane \u2013 if we look at the conversation, propylene to your propylene derivatives, how successful on the commodity part of that have you been in getting price, you know with the run up in propane over the last six months?","Mark Costa","","On the propane to propylene side of the equation, we actually feel quite good about how we\u2019ve managed the pressures in the first quarter and what we expect in the second quarter. Obviously there\u2019s some pressure there, but propylene prices have been a little bit higher than last year giving us the ability to price in the marketplace and on the commodity side in particular, I think we\u2019ve done a good job of holding on to our pricing and doing well there. So that part feels good. The real challenge we face is more on the propane to ethylene side as I noted in the last call where ethylene prices are obviously \u2013 considerably lower than what we would have expected at the Investor Day in 2012, for example and so the pressure is more on the bulk olefins and some of the ethylene special derivatives.","Jeffery Fisher \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Okay, thank you. And then on the comments you made around your new JV and acetate tow, can you talk about the dynamics? It seems like you\u2019re kind of cannibalizing some of your old tow sales, but yet getting some flake sales into the JV. How should we expect that to roll through over the next year as this anniversaries?","Curtis Espeland","","This is Curt. So if you look at total volumes, again they\u2019re lower due to customer buying patterns again not unusual for this industry. But again, additionally industry is absorbing some additional capacity primarily at our 30,000 ton plant with the joint venture with the CNTC. So you can think of that 30,000 tons as the volume and revenue from that is being \u2013 we don\u2019t see that in our segment results. That\u2019s really going through our other income line for our 45% interest. But as expected, the volume loss that the industry is absorbing and we\u2019ve included our percentage of that industry absorption is resulting other tow lines but it\u2019s been offset by the acetate flake volumes that we\u2019re selling to the Joint Venture. So that\u2019s kind of the trade-off you\u2019re seeing in that. But again, fibers is delivering some pretty good earnings even with some of that shift from, you know direct sales versus due to joint venture delivering that $500 million to $520 million plus some of the benefits we\u2019ll see from that joint venture in the other income line.","Jeffery Fisher \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Great, thank you guys.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Mark Costa","","Good morning P.J.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","","Mark, there was a big decline, 500 basis point decline in specialty fluids in the intermediate margin. I know you had that outage, but how much of that was due to propane spike and how much of that was due to I think these specialty fluids destocking that you mentioned.","Mark Costa","","Yeah, the drop was primarily driven by the propane compression on ethylene and propylene related products. But specialty fluids was a contributor, a meaningful contributor as well. That\u2019s really just the chunkiness of demand patterns in specialty fluids. So the fields were just weren\u2019t as strong \u2013 in particular, solar fields can be quite large and cost a chunkiness nature across quarters. So it was soft in the first quarter. We actually expect it to be strong in the second quarter and balance itself out. I would note that this brings up a broader topic that it means that this year because of some of these propane related things, we\u2019re going to have a bit of a stronger second half than normal from an earnings point of view and softer first half. You can see it just by the cost loads there is and some of the ways demand patterns are picking up. And it\u2019s just important to keep in mind as you\u2019re thinking about your models.","Curtis Espeland","","And if I could Mark, if I look at overall cost increases from raw materials year over year it\u2019s roughly about $40 million. That\u2019s many times what Jeff will as in some of our calls. And of that $40 million, it\u2019s predominantly propane and natural gas. So Josh, remind me the percentage of the segment \u2013 of that propane headwind.","Josh Morgan","","Okay, so for propane just the pure cost is that the majority we\u2019re seeing this quarter is going to go as five, but it\u2019s also shared between [indiscernible].","Curtis Espeland","","So the majority of that \u2013 that raw material had when I mentioned [indiscernible].","Mark Costa","Just one other point which is the cost associated with the Longview outage which was about $8 million in the quarter. A good portion of that was in the specialty fluids in the intermediate segment as well.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","","Thank you. And then, secondly, sticking to this propane thing, you have this deal with enterprise on the PDH Unit and your long term contract. When that starts up, what kind of bottom line impact do you expect? Thank you.","Curtis Espeland","","Okay. So yeah, we\u2019re looking forward to that unit coming on and our participation with it. When we announced that opportunity, we also discussed a long term supply agreement we are already feeling the benefits of that. And I would say once we bring the PDH unit, there will be at a slight improvement over where we are today.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","","Can you quantify that at all? Thank you.","Mark Costa","","P.J. I don\u2019t have a number before you right now.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mike Sison of KeyBanc","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, good morning guys, nice start to the year.","Mark Costa","","Thank you.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Mark, you mentioned investing in a Crystex this year. Can you maybe help us what exactly that does for you in terms of maybe profitability or a longer term positioning?","Mark Costa","","We\u2019ve been working on a fairly comprehensive Crystex strategy about how we sustain earnings growth in this business. As those who followed Solutia know Crystex actually one of the key parts of Solutia, great product line which is insoluble salt that vulcanizes rubber. But it does phase competitive challenges with some competitors coming in great synergy between Eastman and Solutia where we were able to take some of our scientists to dramatically improve the process technology with them. And where we [indiscernible] a process technology that will enable us to improve the cost structure -- we\u2019ll start building by the end of the year by 20% to 30%.","[Indiscernible] this technology is that it allows us to retrofit existing plans and get significant cost improvements. It would be more exciting for me [indiscernible] it improves the performance characteristics of the product and allows us to differentiate ourselves in what we offer to the marketplace versus the current competitors. So we\u2019re actually starting the retrofit on one of the first lines in Europe and we\u2019re also doing a lot of piloting to make sure we understand all the product performance characteristics and validate all the left home with the process technology. And that\u2019s really what's causing the $10 million ramp up in cost. And I would note that that ramp up really starts happening in the second quarter through the end of the year on that $10 million. So it\u2019s a great long term investment. We\u2019re really excited about this. When you start these things, it takes some investment.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Okay, great. And then, when you look at advanced materials, you had a decent start to the year. But still if you take a look at the ramp that you need to see to head 2015, how are you feeling in terms of the \u2013 maybe structurally getting there from what you\u2019ve seen for the business thus far?","Mark Costa","","It was a great start to the year. You know, it was little masked by the performance comes over the patterned shift. But we feel great about the momentum in that segment for this year. The demand recovery and the automotive first sectors is driving good demand not just for the premium products, but for the standard products as well. And we certainly continue to see very robust demand for Tritan and our co-polyesters, so that part is going great, we\u2019re rushing to do our debottleneck expansion on Tritan to enable that growth which will be key contributor to 2015 earnings growth so we bring that additional capacity online to grow in especially plastics group. We also have some new product launches and they are doing well, we\u2019ll tell you more about later in the year that are getting us into some new products and markets in especially plastics and the electronics market.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks.","Mark Costa","","Overall I feel good about the momentum, I think that as you look to 2015 in earnings growth for advance materials I think it\u2019s well position to have another strong earnings growth in 15 over 14.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","And what I could Mick on top of that is if you remember our guidance back at the Investor Day that was built around three elements strong growth that Mark talked about with the product lines, levering the asset investments that we\u2019ve made in the improved product mix all those things are on target. I would remind you though that the two areas that may be are little softer than what we thought back in Investor Day is one is just what is the level of auto and interlayer growth in Europe.","And then secondly with the electronics business or display business is probably not as strong as we are visioning back there. So great fundamentals overall but those are the two areas of weak that\u2019s compared to what we were assumed back in Investor Day. And speaking on Investor Day just going back to one of the question PJ had, there is a slide we provide at the Investor Day that gave some \u2013 shows you some of the benefits we\u2019re expecting from the improvements we\u2019ve made in olefins from our cracker \u2013 some of our cracker expansions, the propylene contracts we have as well as what we expected the PDH unit benefit to be at 15 then the assumption at that time was a mid-year benefit, and the 15 \u2013 it was by the $10 million benefit going from 14 to 15 was our rough estimate of the benefit of that enterprise contract.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great, thank you.","Operator","","James Sheehan with SunTrust has our next question.","James Sheehan \u2013 SunTrust","Good morning, just wondering on your Crystex investment. You mentioned some weakness in China and you would specifically target the entire market for that, is there any concern about where the demand is for that new capacity or is that are you confident that the higher technology offering that you\u2019re giving is going to offset that?","Mark Costa","","We continue to view the overall global tire market holding around the 5% long-term growth rate and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going on right now and China indicates that there are some sort of structural changes in the need for tires in the future. I think that globally there is a question about changing consumer driving patters and all of that that feed into the long-term growth rate but we\u2019re seeing and say that we\u2019re concerned about demand. We\u2019d also note that when we build the Canton plant it is an extremely attractive plant and how we can leverage the existing fixed cost at our Canton sites since we\u2019re just adding another unit next to an existing one which gives us great flexibility going forward in the future to both support growth at the markets growing or if necessary if demand is not as strong as we would all like we\u2019ve got the flexibility to rationalize some of our smaller plant and improve our overall fixed cost structure across the globe. So it's a good investment no matter what scenario of the world you look at.","James Sheehan \u2013 SunTrust","Very good and then in just in fiber I noticed the pricing that go up this quarter that lower rate than in previous quarters, did you see that pricing gain decelerating over the rest of the year or are we getting back to the type of increases we have last year?","Mark Costa","","Well I think on the pricing side, I think while we tend to have is good conversations with their customers around what's the quality of our product and their ultimate demands as well as the change in input cost. So I think it\u2019s usually good transparency with both parties and pricing will be indicative of raw material inputs and just how the overall market is.","James Sheehan \u2013 SunTrust","","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Laurence Alexander of Jefferies LLC.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Good morning, one short-term question, one long-term question on fibers, can you give some detail on the negative volumes and particularly given class [ph] expansion you did what's going on in the industry dynamics?","And then longer term question is this you look at the bridge to 2015, you\u2019re going to have a tailwind from the acquisitions, it sounds like in the mid-teens, you have the buybacks, the product will catch up to the raw material pressure, you have the licensing that\u2019s moved into 2015 of lower core growth, if you put all those together, it sounds like you have about of $0.50 to $0.70 tailwind next year. What are the negatives that would offset that?","Mark Costa","","I\u2019ll get to the second question in a second, but could you repeat the first question, it was a little for some reason it was gobble that I couldn\u2019t hear it.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","So fiber volumes were down about 2% could you give some detail on what you\u2019re seeing in the industry and [indiscernible] contacts of your leasing capacity expansion?","Mark Costa","","Sure, on the first question around fiber demand, we certainly see a slowdown in fiber demand growth, we\u2019re not looking at the overall market in decline for 2014 relative to \u201913, but if it's at the lower end of the growth rate we would\u2019ve expected, it's not hard to imagine why that\u2019s happening with all the drivers out there from taxes to smoking concerns and to a minor extend e-cigarettes.","So that\u2019s consistent with how we think about and view the market, but I would say it's growing slower than it did if you look at past average primer growth rates over the last five years. In regards to 2015, as we look at that year and the challenges in general I\u2019d say we feel very good about the things that you noted, but the biggest challenge that\u2019s out there especially if people are asking their dollar share question is the global economic growth that Curt noted, propane prices are moving in ways that we expected from a propylene point of view as we discussed in last call we certainly face some compression on propylene, ethylene related products versus our original assumptions. So that\u2019s a bit of a headwind in 15 but it in the year-over-year headwind I think we \u2013 from 14 to 15 point of view that impact is already being felt in 14 and I don\u2019t expect a big year-over-year problem in 15 in fact I think we\u2019ve done a better job of hedging in the next year to mitigate some of that cost pressure we felt on 13 to 14 basis.","So I think we\u2019re actually well positioned on the propane topic. This is more of a general economic question and then you always have that question around competitive behavior, the biggest impact we\u2019ve had if you look at our 2012 Investor Day expectations with the drop in adhesives and plasticizer earnings relative to where were and we don\u2019t see that recovering back to high levels. I think it stabilized and I think our ability to improve from where it has, but certainly not going to jump back where it was.","Curt Espeland ","","One other thing I might add with this to, what I like about Eastman today may be when much you saw about Eastman ten years ago, the men and women at Eastman are focused on year-over-year earnings growth. So the specific actions we take, we know sometimes we\u2019ll have benefits in one year while they\u2019re continuing benefits into the other year. So we know some of that $0.50 to $0.75 benefit that we\u2019re expecting in \u201914, will have a benefit on a full year basis next year an example again is that Tritan expansion where we are to bottleneck in 25% of our capacity there. So we are focused on everything we can control to deliver that year-over-year earnings growth \u201814, \u201815, and beyond.","Mark Costa","","It's important to know the strength of our cash flows. So it gives us a lot of options. As you\u2019ve already seen, we demonstrated the willingness to continue doing acquisitions that are accretive and have good finishing with the company and willing to repurchase shares and we\u2019ve got a great organic portfolios, so we continue to feel very good about delivering consistent strong earnings growth as we go forward.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you, Mark. On fibers to reach the upper end of your guidance range, you\u2019ll need to add about $135 million of earnings in Q2 \u2013 Q4 that\u2019s versus $117 million in Q1, so what's going to drive that increase sequentially?","Mark Costa","Well David I appreciate your effort to try and give me to move to the upper end of the range in fibers, we have a range out there because there is some uncertainty about demand and so as we look at Q1 we don\u2019t think that\u2019s representative of the future. We certainly can see that the buying pattern shifting back to what we\u2019d actually call normal buying patterns. Last couple of years demand was so tight, people are buying a lot more in first quarter just to make sure they got product, in this year we see a more typical buying patter and develop where our first quarter was little bit softer than you\u2019d like and second will be stronger. And so we don\u2019t have any concerns we think demand will continue to develop us as we expected for the year, but certainly it's at a more moderate growth rate than what we saw in the past couple of years.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And just the buyback pace. Mark, you mentioned will slow over as Q1, just how much will it slow you think in the rest of the year on the total basis?","Mark Costa","Well, I couldn\u2019t answer that one.","Curt Espeland","","Yeah, I mean as you know you look at the share repurchases as one of the mechanisms to deploy cash. I mean, our priorities for cash remain capital expenditures to support our organic growth, attractive mergers and acquisition and share repurchases as just again a good valuable use of cash. We\u2019ve still have $900 million remaining on our authorization that our board was going up to provide us given the confidence in our financial positions and cash flows. But it will moderate, but having said that, we\u2019re in the market today and we\u2019ll be in the market throughout the year just not at that same pace of the first quarter and probably at a pace that\u2019s more similar to what you\u2019ve seen from us in the past.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks you.","Mark Costa","","We\u2019ve got time for one more question please.","Operator","And our last question will come from Bill [indiscernible]","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi, this question is for Mark, just and I hope that you might clarify a comment that you\u2019ve made earlier about the relationship between the first and second half, where you referring to the growth rates being stronger in the second half or the absolute dollars of earnings being stronger in the second half?","Mark Costa","","I was referring to earrings. So while we certainly would have preferred some revenue growth in the first quarter than what we saw, we see strong improvement in revenue growth already in the beginning of the second quarter and expect that to deliver a good revenue, sequential improvement in the second quarter and of course continuing out into the third and fourth. So it\u2019s really an earnings comment as the propane cost are primarily driven by the high propane prices in the winter of the first quarter, but of course a lot of still have to flow through into the second quarter and that creates some earnings headwinds. And we have some additional growth investments like the tires growth investment ramping up in the second quarter that wasn\u2019t in the first. So there is a few things that are creating some cost dynamics relative to revenue in the second quarter, but those are expected to abate by the end of the second quarter as well as the Texas outage I should know that would allow earnings to be better than what is a typical first half, second half seasonal or patterned earnings raising.","Curt Espeland","And if I may also, the eastern specific actions are weighted more towards latter part of the year than the first part.","Unidentified Analyst","I mean, just to be absolutely clear what you are saying is, unlike current first call estimates, the third quarter will be larger than the fourth quarter \u2013 larger than the second quarter, this was not the case in 2013, is that correct?","Mark Costa","Bill, we\u2019re not giving quarterly EPS or EBIT targets today, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing. So you are getting a directional guidance, but we\u2019re not going quite that specific.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great, thanks.","Mark Costa","Okay.","Curt Espeland","Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Well, replay and a replay and downloadable MP3 format will be available on our website beginning in approximately 11 AM.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on Eastman's website, www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay, thank you, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Morgan, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 4 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-Q, for the third quarter 2012 and our Form 10-K to be filed for 2012.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude mark-to-market pension and OPEB losses and gains, Solutia acquisition-related costs and asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in our fourth quarter full-year financial results news release, which can be found in the Investors section of our website, eastman.com.","Third, this presentation includes revenues and operating earnings on a pro forma combined basis, assuming the acquisition of Solutia had been completed prior to first quarter 2011 that compare post-acquisition results to pre-acquisition pro forma combined results. More information on pro forma combined results is in our fourth quarter and full-year financial results news release. Lastly, we have posted slides that accompany our remarks for this morning's call on our website in the Presentations and Events section. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll begin on Page 3, and the numbers are in. We had another outstanding year in 2012, the latest in a series of outstanding years, reflecting the significant improvements we've made, which have resulted in Eastman becoming a portfolio of specialty businesses.","There were numerous accomplishments throughout the year, with some of the more significant listed here. We began the year by announcing the Solutia acquisition, and with Solutia, we have broadened our global footprint, brought together complementary and adjacent technologies and diversified our end markets. We believe we're in the early stages of seeing the significant value that this acquisition will bring to Eastman. We also continue to add capacity in key markets where there's a secular trend driving growth and where we have a technology advantage.","A couple of examples from 2012. As the market continues to switch from plasticizers with phthalates to non-phthalate plasticizers, we completed the retrofit of an asset we acquired from Sterling to our proprietary Eastman 168 non-phthalate plasticizer. Earlier in the year, we started our second line of Tritan copolyester, and Tritan volume increased almost 25% in 2012, as it penetrates markets, including medical and durable goods with a superior value proposition. And as passengers demand improved features in the cars they drive, including noise reduction, we increased capacity in Belgium of our advanced Saflex PVB sheet, which offers enhanced acoustics performance among other properties. Going forward, we'll continue to meet the needs of our customers with expansions in growing markets.","Moving next to the earnings growth. With 2012 EPS of $5.38, we've delivered greater than 20% compounded annual growth for EPS over the past 2 years and nearly 40% over the past 3. And given the strength of our cash generation and the importance we place on returning cash to shareholders, in December, our board increased our dividend to 15%. And I remind you, this is our third increase in 2 years, and we have increased the dividend 36% since the beginning of 2010.","Going next to Slide 4. As is my normal practice on these calls, I'll take just a few minutes to hold us accountable and review some of our key outlook statements for '12. As previously mentioned, we closed the Solutia acquisition in 2012, doing so on July 2, thereby meeting the mid-year commitment we made to you last January when the deal was announced.","Next, in October, we raised our full year 2012 EPS expectation to a range of $5.30 to $5.40, and then reiterated that expectation at our Investor Day in December. We came in at the high end of that range, and I'll talk more about that in a moment. We also indicated we expected to generate $1 billion of free cash flow in 2012 and 2013 combined. With our cash generation in 2012 and our expectations for 2013, we are on track to exceed this projection, as Curt will cover in his section.","Lastly, we committed to being disciplined in our capital allocation, and if you look at how we put capital to work through the year and really over the last several years, I think you'll agree we've been disciplined and focused on returns. Overall, 2012 was a terrific year for Eastman, and it has positioned us well for profitable growth going forward.","On Slide 5, I'll review the Eastman corporate results for the fourth quarter. Pro forma combined operating earnings increased significantly, fourth quarter 2012 versus fourth quarter 2011, as lower raw material and energy costs more than offset lower selling prices. The earnings increase was broad-based with almost every segment showing a year-over-year increase, and our operating margin increased 370 basis points to 15%.","Fourth quarter EPS was $1.19, an increase of more than 50% over the year-ago quarter. As many of you know, fourth quarter has not always been our best, and I'm smiling as I say that, but I hope you'll agree that this is a very strong performance in an uncertain global economic environment.","Moving next to the full year results on Slide 6. Pro forma combined operating earnings increased in 2012 as lower raw material and energy costs more than offset lower selling prices and higher operating costs, particularly for labor and maintenance. As was the case in the fourth quarter, the earnings increase was broad-based with almost every segment showing improvement. In addition, our operating margin for the year was 16.3%, a 90 basis point improvement over 2011.","Full year EPS was $5.38, on the high end of the range we provided you back in October, and a record for Eastman Chemical Company. This is now the third year in a row that we have delivered double-digit earnings growth, the first time in our history as a public company that we've been able to achieve that. Given our portfolio of specialty businesses, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth in the coming years.","Now I'll start on the segments with Slide 7, where I'll begin with Additives & Functional Products. For both fourth quarter and full year, operating earnings increased year-over-year mainly due to lower raw material and energy costs, partially offset by lower selling prices, which were mostly in the solvent product lines. Within the segments, solvents product lines had the strongest 2012, mainly due to 3 factors. First, we've been taking action over the last several years to leverage our assets with a better product mix, and we're starting to see the benefits from these actions. Second, there's high capacity utilization in the U.S. for the industry, as no significant capacity has been added for the last several years. Key end markets, including autos, are rebounding, and the strong shale gas position in the U.S. is enabling exports globally. And third, solvents continue to benefit from producing versus purchasing olefins, and for solvents, this is mainly propylene.","For full year 2013, we expect Additives & Functional Products to have another strong year, increasing operating earnings to approximately $410 million, driven by solvents product lines continuing to see strong volumes and gradual improvements in the tires market, partially offset by higher benzene costs for our anti-degradants product lines.","Moving next to Slide 8 in Adhesives & Plasticizers. Fourth quarter operating earnings increased slightly, as lower raw material and energy costs and an 8% increase in sales volume more than offset lower selling prices. The higher sales volume was a result of continued substitution of phthalate plasticizers with Eastman's non-phthalate plasticizers. Full year operating earnings also increased, primarily due to a 5% increase in sales volume, which was partially offset by higher operating costs, including labor and maintenance and costs associated with the start-up of non-phthalate plasticizer assets at our Texas City facility. Looking forward to 2013, we expect Adhesives & Plasticizers to increase operating earnings to approximately $280 million, primarily due to continued growth in the non-phthalate plasticizers.","Advanced Materials is on Slide 9. Fourth quarter operating earnings declined year-over-year due to lower capacity utilization, which was primarily the result of efforts to reduce inventory in the PVB sheet and specialty materials product lines, as well as weakened demand in specialty copolyesters. For the full year, operating earnings declined due to lower capacity utilization and additional costs related to expansions. And as a reminder, we increased capacity for Tritan copolyester, cellulose triacetate, to serve the displays markets, Saflex and Flexvue to serve the electronics market during the year.","Looking forward to '13, we expect Advanced Materials to increase operating earnings to approximately $250 million due to increased volume in both specialty materials and performance films, higher value product mix in Advanced Interlayers and improvements in fixed cost absorption as we begin to fill out recent expansions.","Next is Fibers on Slide 10. And once again, they delivered an outstanding year. Earnings in both the fourth quarter and for the full year increased due to higher selling prices, with the increased selling prices for the full year partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp, and higher operating cost.","Sales volume declined both for the quarter and the year within the acetate yarn product line, and was a result of overall weak demand in the apparel market. Through 2012, the Fiber segment has now grown earnings for 9 consecutive years, and we expect 2013 to mark a decade of consecutive earnings growth due to continued strong acetate tow volume and higher selling prices.","I'll finish out the segments on Slide 11 with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates. Fourth quarter operating earnings nearly doubled compared with the year-ago period, as margins increased due to lower raw material and energy costs, particularly for propane, more than offsetting lower selling prices. For the full year, operating earnings increased by almost 30%, and the story is similar, as lower raw material costs more than offset lower prices and higher operating costs. The operating margin for the year was 14.5%, right in the middle of the 13% to 16% range we expect for this segment. Looking forward to 2013, we expect operating earnings for Specialty Fluids & Intermediates to be approximately $380 million, as olefin spreads are improving so far in 2013, and we also expect improved volume and mix in fluids.","One other item I want to cover here is our thoughts about actions we may take at our facility in Longview, Texas, including the one cracking unit that's currently shut down. And we've had a team working on options for a number of months now as they are currently engaged -- I should say, and they are currently engaged with multiple external parties that have strong interest in a variety of different options. And these options include some of the parties potentially building a derivative plant at our Longview site. While it is difficult to predict timing, one common theme, as we've been in discussions with third parties, is an interest in getting something done the first half of this year, an interest we share. So for now, we see value in the options we are discussing and we will provide more details when we can talk about it.","That brings me to Slide 12 and an update on our Perennial Wood growth initiative. In here, we're shifting our strategy for Perennial Wood in 2013 and narrow the focus down, as a result, reduce the spend for this growth initiative. The change in strategy is due to the insights we obtained by launching into what was, frankly, a difficult building and construction market, particularly for decking, in the first half of 2012. It's also due to the refining of our technology, which gives us an improved coating for our decking product. In 2013, we will narrow our decking marketing program to the Boston market and by the end of 2013, we'll be in a position to reassess this growth initiative and determine the best path forward. We remain confident in the value proposition of our Perennial Wood product and believe that the additional market understanding that we'll gain in 2013 will position us to make the best decision for this initiative by the end of the year.","I'll end on Slide 13 with our outlook for 2013. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, 2012 was the latest in a series of strong years for Eastman Chemical Company, and we're confident that in 2013, we will build on this strength. Our world-class technology platforms and leading positions in attractive end markets position us well to continue to deliver consistent superior value. And we enter 2013 with a number of tailwinds, including excellent progress on the integration of Solutia, expansions, capital expansions, serving customers in growing end markets and the increased benefit of producing versus purchasing olefins.","We also know global economic uncertainty continues, and Curt will speak more to the economic assumptions that underlie our expectations. When we put this all together, the result is that we are increasing our 2013 guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.40, which would be growth of between 17% and 19% over 2012. This would mean that we would have grown EPS from about $2 in 2009 to well over $6 in 2013, and I think with a clear path to EPS of approximately $8 in 2015.","Now with that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Okay. Jim, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 15 by reviewing some financial highlights for 2012. Cash from operations in 2012 was $1.1 billion. This is well above our 2011 total of $625 million, and is built off of a solid base of earnings, good discipline with working capital and the expected use of NOLs acquired from Solutia of approximately $150 million in the year. Within these free cash flows, we spent $465 million in capital expenditures, which was slightly more than our guidance earlier of $450 million. We also paid dividends of $192 million, which includes the $45 million of accelerated dividend payments the board authorized to pay stockholders on December 31. With the strong free cash flow generation, we paid a total of $250 million on the $1.2 billion acquisition term loan, and ended the year with $249 million in cash. Thus, our net debt at the end of 2012 was $4.5 billion.","Next, I'll mention several items that impacted our fourth quarter results and that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. During fourth quarter 2012, Eastman recognized a mark-to-market loss for pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $276 million. This was due to a reduction in the company's assumed weighted average discount rate versus prior year, partially offset by an increase in the pension asset values. In addition, we also had asset impairment and restructuring charges of $83 million primarily related to 4 items. First was termination of an operating agreement with a third-party site in Brazil and related facility closure costs. This site produces Santoflex anti-degradants and Saflex PVB resin. We will continue to meet customer demand with our other global manufacturing sites.","Second was discontinuance of the company's project to modify existing coal-based utility assets in order to meet recently enacted environmental regulations, and instead changing 50% of our furnace capacity to be fueled with natural gas. Third was inventory and other costs related to the change in strategy for Perennial Wood that Jim just covered earlier. And lastly, severance related to the acquisition and integration of Solutia. Finally, we had costs of $11 million related to the Solutia acquisition in the form of integration and costs related to the step-up of inventory.","Moving next to Slide 16 and our key assumptions for 2013 to help you with your models. Consistent with the outlook discussed at our December 2012 Investor Day, we expect global GDP in 2013 to be slightly above 2%, with the U.S. staying steady and coming in around 2%, Europe close to 0 for the full year and China near 8%. For the tax rate, we expect our 2013 rate to be approximately 31.5% with the exception of first quarter where we will see a $10 million benefit from several business tax credits recently extended by the Congress that will bring our net rate to slightly below 31%, all in, for 2013. We also expect to see a decrease in other corporate costs of $25 million in 2013 primarily to reduce spend in Perennial Wood, and we expect the fully diluted share count to be approximately 157 million shares for the year.","Moving next to Slide 17, where I'd like to give you some sense of how Eastman is working hard on multiple fronts to deliver consistent year-over-year earnings growth. Jim highlighted the remarkable earnings improvement the company has made the last several years. Our evolution to a portfolio of specialty businesses will significantly contribute to more consistent earnings growth. We believe this is the key attribute to being valued as a specialty chemical company.","We recognize, within our portfolio, there are some product lines that are more commodity-like in nature and other factors that could impact our ability to contribute to more consistent earnings growth. Thus, we have taken additional actions. First and foremost, our heritage businesses have worked hard the last 5-plus years improving our pricing systems, contracting strategies and commercial capabilities. This ensures we are able to work with our customers to deliver on our value proposition. If products are less differentiated, we try to tie pricing to underlying raw materials. We enter into multiple-year agreements to help lift the trough, while reducing the upside, et cetera.","We are bringing these same disciplines to enhance the practices of our recently acquired businesses. In addition, we have an ongoing hedging program that we will use to help our businesses manage raw material volatility, and to allow time for prices to adjust. We will, in some limited cases, also hedge the margins on some of our bulk olefin sales. For example, we have locked in approximately 50% of our bulk ethylene sales at margins similar to 2012. We will also hedge currencies on a short-term tactical basis and in some cases, longer-term strategic basis, with the goal to remove volatility in earnings due to currencies. You can see this at work with our 2012 revenues, which declined by just over 1% due to exchange rate movements. And we are continuously working to improve productivity both to reduce our overall costs, but also to identify opportunities to reduce volatility in earnings and cash flows. I highlight this today just to reemphasize the focus of the men and women at Eastman is to deliver consistent year-over-year earnings growth.","Next, moving to Slide 18, and an update on Solutia integration. As the slide indicates, we remain well on track with integration efforts. For the cost synergies, we closed 2012 at greater than $50 million on a run-rate basis, and we have every expectation that number will exceed $100 million on a run-rate basis by the end of 2013. On tax synergies, we are well on our way to use more than half of the $1.3 billion of NOLs, starting the second half of 2012, and extending through the end of 2014. We have also put in place initial tax structures to lower the effective tax rate, and we will continue to pursue other opportunities for further improvement.","Not included on this slide, but worth noting, are the revenue synergies. While these are no -- longer term in nature and more difficult to quantify at this point, I believe we have upside in this category and that we'll further strengthen this value -- this will further strengthen the value of this transaction.  As I've mentioned before, we have successfully retained key talent. For example, we've retained 97% of critical key talent identified, and we continue to be impressed with the capabilities our new employees are bringing to the Eastman team. Finally, a functional consolidation remains on track with the system integrations that are currently under way.","On Slide 19, I'll walk you through our current estimate for free cash flow. We currently project operating cash flows of roughly $1.3 billion in 2013. This is due to continued strength in earnings. This cash flow will also be impacted by cash outflows related to increased working capital as a result of increased sales and larger geographic footprint, funding of balance sheet accruals, such as the annual environmental funding of roughly $35 million for legacy solution sites and restructuring accruals such as that related to the termination of the Brazilian operating agreement.","We will have some additional Solutia restructuring and integration costs that are excluded from our earnings projections, but will impact our operating cash flows, and finally, the level of contributions to our U.S. defined benefit plans, which is currently estimated to be approximately $120 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $525 million this year. This capital includes both growth capital and infrastructure capital. In 2013, we expect an increase in infrastructure capital, as we integrate recently acquired sites, initiate the change with coal-based furnaces in Kingsport and other needs. In regards to our Kingsport facility, we currently use coal-based furnaces to provide electricity and steam generation for this site. As we evaluated both operating and capital costs to maintain this furnaces, we have elected to convert 50% of our capacity to  natural gas. We have signed an agreement with Spectra Energy to expand their natural gas pipeline to our site.","The capital required for this conversion is approximately $90 million, and is expected to be completed in 2016. This capital cost is significantly lower than what would have been required to modify the underlying coal-based furnaces to meet changing regulations. I would like you to note this has no impact on our coal gasification process, and Eastman will continue to use coal in the future as both an energy source and a raw material.","Our capital expenditures will be weighted more towards the second half of the year due to normal operational trends, as well as the timing of our key growth projects such as the planned Crystex and PVB resin expansions in Malaysia. Putting this all together, we expect free cash flow generation to be between $600 million and $650 million in 2013, with the midpoint of this range representing a growth rate of greater than 30% over 2012 levels.","Just to close on Slide 20, I'll remind you of our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Already mentioned, we expect capital expenditures of $525 million, which is similar, quite honestly, to 2012 when you factor in the $51 million Solutia spent prior to the close of the acquisition. This reflects our commitment to continue to pursue attractive organic growth projects across our portfolio.","On the debt side, we paid down $250 million of the $1.2 billion acquisition term loan in 2012 and expect to pay down a significant portion of the remaining balance in 2013. This remains a priority for cash in 2013.","On joint ventures and acquisitions, we will be progressing with our 2 announced joint ventures: the acetate total joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation, expected to be online mid-2013, and the Regalite hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin JV with Sinopec, expected online in 2014. In addition, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic bolt-ons. Lastly, we expect to continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in order to offset dilution. During 2013, we will probably be a little bit behind offsetting current and expected dilution, but we should be in a position to offset dilution and then some by the end of the year and going into 2014.","With that, thank you for your interest in Eastman Chemical Company, and I'll turn it back over to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay, thanks, Curt. Tiffany, this concludes our prepared remarks and we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The question I had, we've had pretty steep propylene pop in January, and people are thinking there's going to be another move in February. I guess, for you guys, can you talk about the key propylene derivatives and how you think those markets will pass on that price increase? I mean, where you will be able to get it quickest and how long that lag will be?","James P. Rogers","Sure, Duffy, and it's one of those things where, as we move to more of a specialty, I would have thought we'd be spending less and less time on this. On the other hand, I must admit, I'm enjoying the exposure we have at this time because you're right. Fourth quarter, we got helped with propane, particularly, staying down and then this quarter, it looks like we're going to get helped with the other end of the spread, with propylene moving up. And by the way, we're just in January. So I try not to get too carried away about what the spread's going to do this year. One of the key places you see it is in our solvents business, the propylene that shows up in the functional products, the Additives & Functional Products segment. I guess, as I look at it, there's a range. The other place would be in our intermediates business. But as I look at it, it's a range of how far downstream you are, how much transparency the customers have. Certainly, I think we're much better at pricing and moving things along quickly. It'll depend again by how much it's specialty, how much it's commodity, but we'll definitely see the effects of this move in propylene in those 2 segments in the first quarter. And some will then flow over into the second quarter because of the lag. But it's hard to break out, just do -- would you average in 1 month, 2 months, 3 months. In the past, it's been as long as 3 months. I think we're much faster than that now.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the changeover at Kingsport to gas, why half -- I mean, it seems like kind of half pregnant. If it made sense, why not go 100%? Or was it -- that was just enough to get you over the hurdle, what you needed to do, regulatory-wise?","James P. Rogers","So you're one of those poker players who always goes all-in on every hand?","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, unfortunately, sometimes wrongly.","James P. Rogers","No, I mean, we try and be judicious. We -- one of the main drivers was the whole regulatory environment, not only what we're facing with Boiler MACT and something called BART, but just trying to look down the road a few years as to where do we think this country is going. In the past, we've always looked at it, and coal was always so advantaged that you just swallowed hard and paid all the regulatory changes you had to make, paid for all those changes. Now with the outlook for natural gas and as compared to Central Appalachian coal, it's really a push on the economics. So then you go to the capital cost, and Curt gave it to you, $90 million compared to something that was probably a couple of hundred million north of that for getting coal in compliance. So you knew you were going to do something. Then the issue is how much do you do.","This amount allows us to avoid that capital, meets all our regulatory requirements and then some. Plus, frankly, we tend to like the idea of being -- for our energy needs here at our major site, half gas, half coal. We think that kind of plays to what we talk about so many other places, in terms of being diversified and trying to smooth out earnings. So net-net, a good result. It's a shame, in a way, we had to eat, I think, $17 million, but we couldn't just sit on our hands earlier. We had to get going on the engineering to be in compliance to meet the timeline. And then, of course, the world for shale gas just moved, gas prices moved, and we got a much better alternative so we had to scrap the plans to change our boilers over.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us a little more granularity on what's going on in 2 of the key markets from the Solutia acquisition, maybe on a regionalized basis for both auto and tires.","James P. Rogers","We can. Frankly, there's some other players out there who have been out ahead of us who have done a pretty good breakdown, guys who are directly in that market and almost totally dependent on that market, you might say, but I don't think you're going to get any new insights from us. But as we look at tires around the world, obviously, the States is coming back. Europe is still very much down, negative again this year in '13, and Asia seems to be improving. One distinction I'll draw, so that you don't just think about auto builds, is realize we're more dependent on, frankly, commercial activity because of the truck tires being more important to us than the car tires. So that's one comment I can probably make globally, is I think we're still at a lower level of commercial activity. And so when I think about a business like Crystex, to me, it just seems like such a great business, and we're not getting to see it shine. So I was trying to think of an analogy. It's like having this champion surfer, and right now, we just have 2- and 3-foot waves and we keep waiting for the big waves to come so we can see what this businesses can really do. Plus we've got a Kuantan expansion that we'll probably get going on later this year that's going to make some fairly dramatic changes in their cost position in terms of their fixed costs, their variable costs. We'll be able to go back and retrofit existing sites for that. So while I think we've got a fantastic business, the markets are not allowing us to show just how good that is. What was the other -- was there something else besides tires you wanted to hear about?","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just autos generally, but my suspicion is you'll give me the same response. So let me ask a different question, if I might, which is, in the context of your 2% global GDP, can you give us a sense of where you see volume growth across the division?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I mean, what you want to drive is volume growth in everything, except maybe Fibers. You won't see it until they get their JV on because they're running so hard right now. I mean, just volume, in general, Bob. I wish we'd had a little more this past year, frankly, but there was some things that slowed us down. And net-net, I can't complain too much. I mean, I think we had a really good year. We need to get the volume growth going in the future. Most of it will hinge upon capacity additions so getting more hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins, getting that thing going in China will be fairly significant for us, filling out the lines we've already built, like Tritan and CTA, and we'll get volume growth and mix change with the acoustic interlayers, because that's a great product and that ought to be growing nicely. Would you want to add anything, Greg?","Gregory A. Riddle","[indiscernible]","James P. Rogers","Yes, that's -- we've been talking about that. That one, I think I can count on for some time to come is the switch on the plasticizer side. Realize, too, that we got a couple of competitors out there. We didn't put it in our prepared remarks, but SK came on with some copoly volume this past year. Kalama came on with some volume in the benzoate plasticizer arena, and so we're trying to be smart about how we make pricing volume choices this past year to preserve as much shareholder value as they go to fill up some of those expansions. But, for example, I think Specialty Plastics business, which we don't break out anymore, but they came under some pressure this year because of what I just said about SK, and they wanted to work down some inventories at year end. I expect that Specialty Plastics business to have -- get back to setting a record in 2013 again for earnings so -- and that will demand some volume growth, so things like Tritan will have to continue to grow, which it will.","Operator","We'll take our next call from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, the entire -- was the entire guidance increase versus December, was that due -- just due to the propane-propylene spread being wider earlier in the year?","James P. Rogers","It was due to the fact that I didn't think you guys would let me stay where we were. I mean, I'm only 1 month into the year. So I got to tell you, we felt a little sheepish, having just stood in front of all of you in December, and then we come out 6 weeks later or whatever, and we said, \"Hey, we're probably going to do a little better than we told you.\" But yes, that was the major change I could point to is just propylene moving up, and we're going to get it in price. I mean, we deserve it and that's what's going to happen and so...","Curtis E. Espeland","And Jim, if I could add also, we're probably showing a little bit more decline in the corporate other spending because of the Perennial Wood adjustment than we were probably thinking back in December.","James P. Rogers","That's true and -- but a lot of times, people only want to add in the positives, and there's things going the other way. So I got benzene and paraxylene -- the same way propylene is really good, not as big an impact, but benzene and paraxylene hurting us. So we try to pull it all together, and give you our best thoughts just like we did back in December on how we're going to end the year.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jim, what were the Perennial Wood losses or costs in 2012?","James P. Rogers","That was -- I'll let Curt give you the specifics, but just on Perennial Wood, I mean, this is still something I like. We just got to be smart about it, and we said our top priority was hitting the earnings goals, and so I'm not going to do anything that -- or say it another way, I'm going to give myself as many cushions as possible to have as high a probability as possible of hitting the earnings targets all the way out to 2015. So we like the product. We got to work on the economics of the product, which includes more than just decking. It gets to what else can you do with the wood, can you -- how do you approach porch flooring and, potentially, siding, furniture, trim, all the other things you can do with a good product like this, and make sure the economics work. But as for the actual change and write-down, Curt?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, David, if you look at that $126 million of other corporate costs, which, as you know, is corporate R&D, programs, et cetera, Perennial Wood is roughly $50 million of that number.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, Jim, just on Crystex, you mentioned some competitive intensity back in the meeting in December, so maybe some lost share. With the Kuantan expansion and lower variable costs, fixed costs, could you at least maintain, if not grow your share in Crystex this year and going forward?","James P. Rogers","Yes, we'll see. I mean, my top priority is in that business is the value preservation, the setting ourselves up nicely such that when Kuantan comes online and we have that lower cost, we're smart about our position in the marketplace because we're the big guy in the marketplace. And we'll have not only lower cost, but we're probably going to have some additional functionality with our product too, which will be another way of separating our products out from the also-ran guys. So when it comes to share, sometimes you're willing to make trade-offs to make sure you make the right pricing decisions. Long term, I feel like when this industry has to run hard, we'll probably pick up share during that time. So we'll just see. We need a little help though. We need a little help from the marketplace. We need a little more commercial activity, a little more truck tires being sold.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mr. Andrew Cash of SunTrust.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I heard your favorable forecast for Advanced Materials for '13. So I'm just curious, if you look at the PVB business, are contract negotiations complete there for this year? And if so, in what quarter would you expect the PVB volume to start increasing?","James P. Rogers","Yes, it's a good question. I don't know. I mean, you identify the business that has the steepest hill to climb over the next year, as well they should. I was pleased with where we got to on the contracting for the interlayers business, I think Mark Costa and his team did a great job there. They told me upfront it was probably a 2-year process to get back to where you want to be in terms of having the right mix with your customers in regions, et cetera. I do think the acoustic product's going to be a big help in terms of improving the mix, which helps your margins, maybe also get you the -- get you back on the volume growth side. Biggest factor is probably outside of my control, and that probably gets back to just general economic activity. So I don't want to try and pick out a quarter, but I like the direction we're going. As you look at that segment though, don't forget about the copoly business, the Specialty Plastics business, and like I said, they took it in the -- how do I want to say this, they took a P&L hit. They took a bit of a P&L hit last year, purposely working down inventories, the right thing to do. The inventories had gotten a little high, and they did a lot of that in the fourth quarter. That can be a pretty powerful contributor as that business comes back strong this year.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. Just to follow up, going back to the propane, could you just put in ballpark figures for us the increase in Eastman's earnings in 2012 as related to the spread between propane and the price of the derivatives?","James P. Rogers","Yes, and you're picking propane, but I guess you mean propane ethane in general or do -- are you really...","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, the whole complex, yes.","James P. Rogers","Well, we're probably not going to give you the exact number. I can tell you it was significant, and what we say in our statements, Curt, is we try and cap it out for people...","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, it's less than 20% of our total EBIT.","James P. Rogers","EBIT, yes, less than 20% of EBIT, but it was significant. It was a nice move in our direction.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Question on Advanced Materials again. I mean, when you look across the forecast you guys have for 2015 and in margin targets, it's certainly the one that has the longest bridge to get there, the 14%. So what really needs to happen to make sure you can meet this target? And how much relies on macro versus controllable factors and versus your 3 big products: PVB, Tritan and CTA?","James P. Rogers","Yes, so I'll make a couple of comments. Greg may want to chime in, too, because he's sitting over here, looking at me like he's got a better answer than I do. But I mean, like I said on the last question, I mean, they got a steep hill to climb. They're very confident, by the way, though. I mean, when you look at the EBITDA percentage that they have to grow, it's nowhere near the same. Because they got a pretty big installed base and they got capacity they can fill out that we've added. And so you ought to see a faster ramp-up as they fill up something like the CTA line, et cetera, the interlayer capacity we had. And it's also a place where, in particular, the interlayers, where Europe has held them down below what I would say is a normal -- kind of normally how that business should look. So partly, you're looking for Europe to come back out of the doldrums and partly, you're looking to fill up capacity you've already built, and so they should be levered to faster growth in the EBIT line than perhaps some of the other businesses.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And back on the Specialty Plastics, I know that you mentioned the SK expansion, but it seems like there has been lower utilization and weak demand all year. Is there any type of share shifts? I mean, in the past, copolyester was kind of the tween-er between acrylics and polycarbonate. Has any -- has there been any kind of end product share shift between those two that might also be affecting demand on the copolyester side?","James P. Rogers","Well, I'd say -- we said we thought demand was off some. So I had a little bit of double -- really, a triple whammy. I had a competitor filling up some capacity. We had probably soft end-market demand, although I wouldn't say really losing anything to polycarbonate, for sure, because polycarbonate, of course, is struggling with that headwind of high benzene costs. And then we had intentional working down the inventories, which that was not insignificant. That had a pretty good P&L impact. So I think copoly with Tritan, in particular, Tritan's taking share from other competitors, other plastics. I don't know, Greg, what would you -- anything you want to add to that?","Gregory A. Riddle","Nope, nope. I think that's it. I mean, the packaging...","James P. Rogers","Did I scare you off from saying something?","Gregory A. Riddle","I'd say the packaging market has been soft for a while.","James P. Rogers","Yes, that's true.","Gregory A. Riddle","That's affecting, not just copolyester, but a lot of different products.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just finally, is -- acetate yarn has had some issues in the past year. Obviously, your tow is doing fantastic and you've got expansions there. Is there a point when acetate yarn is no longer core for you? Or is there anything there that in terms of the integration of your facilities that even if you might not want to be in the business anymore it's going to be hard to disaggregate it?","James P. Rogers","Well, others have clearly exited. So it's a logical question. I wouldn't necessarily use the word core, but it sure helps us run our stream better. I mean, so could we move from yarn to just tow? Yes, we could. But right now, the economics are in favor of us staying in the yarn market. I mean, it's a positive cash contributor even -- in fact, it's never been a negative cash. It's always been positive cash and absorbs cost, helps us run the lines full, and even when the EFO on that business is negative. The other thing I'd say is it's really just not that big anymore. So if I was sitting outside the company, I wouldn't spend a lot of time on yarn. We feel compelled to talk about it because it can move things at the margins but, of course, the big horse is the tow and then the acetyl intermediates, the flake that we sell.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mr. Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions. First, could you just give us a little bit of update on the contracts with Saflex and Crystex? I know, in particular, you were talking back in December about trying to get some improvements in the structure of that going into '13. So just first on that. And then, secondly -- why don't we go with that first?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Yes, and I'll only give you, oh, so much color other than to say I'm pleased, which hopefully, that carries some weight. It is, I realize, a 2-year process. I would say we've done a better job than has been done in the past of segmenting out the really key customers, the ones that are important to us, working with them, where do they see value added, where should be thinking multi-year, how should we be thinking about pricing structure with those customers, and I can tell you I'm pleased. I mean, Mark Costa has been personally involved out there with some of this, and we're building relationships quickly. We're approaching it differently perhaps than they did in the past in terms of not just working with the purchasing department, but really wanting to be in there with technology and the whole gestalt, if I could, so -- and we try and make smart trade-offs between volume and price, and you don't chase volume in Asia just because you want to say you're growing in Asia. You take volume in Asia when you can make money there. And we respect all our customers, all regions of the world, but we know where our bread is buttered. And that's what this past contracting strategy reflects, and that's true for -- I guess, I mainly had Saflex in mind once I was talking, but Crystex would be something similar.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a sort of separate follow-up, you mentioned SAP integration in the prepared remarks, and you might have talked about this in the past, I just don't remember. But can you remind us, which -- either you had SAP or Solutia had it or neither of you had it or what's the process that you're doing?","James P. Rogers","And I'm going to let Curt comment on that. I just want to make a general comment about integration, and then I'll let Curt talk about it because Curt's one of the guys driving it. I would have guessed that by now, I would have had some kind of disappointment in the integration. I mean, I've been around a while, and to do an acquisition this size, usually something doesn't go the way you want. So I knock on wood as I say it, but it's -- this has been a good one. This one's going the right way. We're hitting our milestones. We're hitting -- we're exceeding our costs and revenue synergy goals, and so I like what we see. On SAP, Curt?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, if you look at just briefly on SAP, they had -- part of their shop was on SAP so we're migrating that over. That would be in Advanced Interlayers. Another part of their portfolio, which are the Tech Specialties was -- Solutia was even under a path of getting ready to convert that over to SAP, and that is one we will continue. Those are the 2 big horses we convert in 2013.","James P. Rogers","And we're an SAP house...","Curtis E. Espeland","And we're an SAP house.","James P. Rogers","Single-instance, global SAP house. Everything's on SAP.","Curtis E. Espeland","A lot of good talent on both sides of the house on SAP, and we know how to get this done.","Operator","We'll take our next call from Mr. Chris Nocella, RBC Capital Markets.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Oxo alcohol prices have been strong in Asia recently, and I saw you guys put an announcement out as well. Is this just a push-through of propylene? Or are you guys seeing particular strength here?","James P. Rogers","No. There is strength in the markets that picked up in the fourth quarter. And of course, we got an operation in Singapore, and that's been doing better. That had one of its better fourth quarters in some time the way I remember it. So there's definitely strength in that market, as well as you have the wind of -- tailwind this time of what's going on with propylene.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and there's also been some talk amongst your peers over the last couple of days about improvement in China. You guys had a nice 6% to 7% growth in that region the last couple of quarters. Are you seeing a pickup kind of as we're sitting here today in that business? Or is it just trending along the same trajectory?","James P. Rogers","No, I think you'd have to say it's picked up. I mean, I don't have January results. What I've got so far, as I've looked at kind of how the year's kicking off with volumes. And one, there's pretty much an uptick everywhere, except maybe the adhesives business; but two, I'd say Asia is definitely picking up.","Operator","We will take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, Curt, your margins in Additives & Functional Products have held up quite well despite the weak tire demand that you talked about. So are Crystex margins holding up? Or are coatings margins coming in to help out with the raw material benefit that they have?","James P. Rogers","Both, but more the latter. This is where we talk about the solvents, as well as some of the old pieces of CASPI, some of the additives from CASPI, and it's quite, quite strong right now. You know our North American presence is good, and what you're going to see more of, not just us, you're going to see more of is with this -- with what's going on with natural gas in this country, you're going to see products being globally competitive that in the past logistics might have held you back, and now you're going to be shipping some of the stuff around the world.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and can you just make a comment on the Crystex margins, please?","James P. Rogers","I guess I would say more holding their own, holding steady is probably the best way to think about that.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then a couple of things on ethylene. You mentioned about the restart of the cracker and the derivative unit at Longview. At today's raw material prices, can you just ballpark the impact?","James P. Rogers","Of if you restarted the cracker?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes.","James P. Rogers","Yes, hard to do because what we're talking to people about is that you wouldn't just the run the cracker and then sell the output. You would probably -- I think I had it in my prepared remarks, you can probably put something additional on our site and take it to a derivative. But look at it this way, we're running now on 3 crackers. Cracker 4 is the larger of the 2. This would be equivalent to 1 of the 2 smaller crackers. I don't know, we can --- you can probably back into the volume impact of a cracker.","Curtis E. Espeland","It's about 300 million pounds.","James P. Rogers","300 million pounds and so then you can do your math, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then, Curt, did you say that you locked in ethylene sales at 2012 margins and the margins...","Curtis E. Espeland","We have. Well, let me just make sure we break it -- if you think about our total ethylene that we produce, about half of which we consume and put down into our derivatives, that remaining half is what we call bulk ethylene, and about 50% of that, we have locked in at 2012 spreads.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, my point was 2012 margins were great, but in 2013 here, margins have gone up even higher, so you wouldn't see that benefit?","Curtis E. Espeland","For that -- well, a couple of comments, first of all, they've been -- they were great in December and early January, they've pulled back a little bit since. But yes, the comment's going to be, of that 50% of bulk ethylene sales, we've locked it in, and we won't see the upside or the downside [indiscernible].","James P. Rogers","And I'll take your guarantee that they're going to stay strong the rest of the year. I really appreciate that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Hey, Jim, I lost some money today. I bet my team that the CEO spotlight was going to feature Greg for running a successful Investor Day, and in fact, you stopped it altogether. Did anybody at Eastman deserve the CEO spotlight?","James P. Rogers","I thought about that, and then what I've been told is our prepared remarks already go long to the point that you guys don't always get all your questions in. So honestly, if I was going to do it today, I would have done it on the integration team. So I'll do a 3-second: Integration team doing an excellent job, by Curt and Mark, and seriously, I am pleased with that. That is just going about as good as you could expect.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, regardless, I lost money anyway since you didn't highlight Greg. Curt, I find it rather curious that you talked about on track to exceed $1 billion in free cash flow, yet, you're going to fall behind in terms of offsetting dilution on the share count and you're going to get to the share buybacks kind of later in the year. Can you expand upon that?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, what I mean by that is just simply with some of the dilution that occurred in the fourth quarter, probably expect some additional dilution the start of the year, the timing is such that our buyback, as you've heard me talk before, is I got to make a little more progress on the deleveraging before we start fully doing all those purchases. So it's just a matter of timing, and how the math works on the '13 calculation. But by the end of the year, we'll be there and then some.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, okay, fine. And then you also talked about you think that there's upside in terms of Solutia revenue synergies. Can you expand upon that?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, if I look at the synergies, the ballpark of $100 million off of their original revenue base is about 5% of revenues -- or 5% of revenue. So when we look at the project listing that this integration team is managing, there's different levels of probability. So when we talk about the 5% of revenue, the $100 million, we're highly confident in that number. As you go down the level of probability of success for the remainder, is it possible we can get to 6% of revenue? Yes. Is there a chance we can get to 7% of revenue? Possibly.","James P. Rogers","He was talking about revenue synergy, too, though.","Curtis E. Espeland","Oh, you're talking about revenue synergy? I'm sorry, I thought he was percentage. The revenue side, I would say we're off to some good start on the commercial practices. I think we need a little more time on the longer-term aspects of the programs that we've talked about, the tires, et cetera. But if I look at commercial activities and practices, I think there's some real benefits we're already starting to see in our numbers and there's more to come.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then can you give us an update on your thinking regarding the photovoltaics business?","James P. Rogers","Yes, honestly, I haven't thought a whole lot about that one lately because, as you know, when we divvied up the businesses, I gave that one to Curt. So Curt, what's your...","Curtis E. Espeland","Right now, photovoltaics is a tough marketplace. We're continuing to evaluate some options, and we're still working through those options, but either way, it's not a material item to Eastman, but we're working through the strategic alternatives.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And any thought on -- as to when we might get a go, no-go, keep or not keep type of decision?","Curtis E. Espeland","I would say within the next quarter or 2, we're going to have some...","James P. Rogers","Yes, we're not going to be talking about this forever, Frank.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a very quick one then, are you seeing any areas or regions where they're -- you're seeing demand destruction in response to attempted price increases?","James P. Rogers","I would say, I review pricing every month, and I would say this is in most areas one of the better pricing environments finally than we've seen in a while. So part of that is just thinking about the things that are propylene-based. Part of it is some areas that are tight such that customers are more concerned about making sure they have surety of supply than they are the last penny. Anything doing with packaging is still tough so some of the adhesives. Parts of the adhesives is still tough. Other parts, the hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins, still a tight market. So if I had to make a general comment, it wouldn't be so much regionally. Europe would probably be the toughest region, and I would guess packaging would be the end market that would be the toughest.","Gregory A.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman\u2019s website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Riddle","Thank you, Cody, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jake LaRoe, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I\u2019ll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company\u2019s third quarter 2018 financial results news release, during this call and in the accompanying slides, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2018 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for the third quarter 2018.","Second, earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core and unusual items and have been adjusted for the forecasted tax rate as of the end of the interim periods. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the third quarter 2018 financial results news release, which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings exclude any non-core unusual items and assume that the adjusted tax rate for first nine months 2018 will be the actual tax rate for the projected periods.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning, everyone. I'll start on page 3. During the first nine months of the year, we delivered a 13% year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS growth and our third quarter was in line with our expectations. We delivered strong volume growth with innovation driven mix improvement across our specialties, advanced materials and additives and functional products. We also delivered sequential earnings stability in fibers and stability in CI.","The portfolio specialty businesses we've built is showing resiliency in the face of global uncertainty and we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings growth. Our innovation programs are the key to our success and we're seeing great progress on a number of fronts. For example, AM delivered 9% volume growth in the quarter and 7% through the first nine months, through attractive premium products like Tritan, Saflex heads up display interlayers and performance films, well above end market growth rates in transportation and consumer durables.","In AFP, despite a tough comp from the large solar fills last year, volume growth increased 1% in the quarter and 6% through the first nine months. We continue to have double digit growth in product lines such as Impera tire resins, animal nutrition, water treatment, olefin polymers and adhesives, crop protection, plant growth regulators among others, which were driven by revenue synergies from our acquisitions.","And in fibers, we're continuing our trend of delivering excellent revenue growth in textiles. Our innovative product offerings in acetated yarn delivered an exceptional revenue growth of 30% this quarter, giving us confidence that the fiber segment is stabilizing and we continue to be on track to deliver more than $350 million of new business closed this year across the company with the greater than 20% increase through the first 9 months.","In a few moments, I\u2019ll highlight a couple of examples of how we're executing our innovation driven growth model. Through relentless engagement in the market, our world class technology platforms and powerful application development, we're creating our own growth and winning with customers. On the cost management front, we remain focused in offsetting inflation with disciplined productivity savings.","Free cash flow also remains a strength for us. Despite headwinds from higher raw materials, we have a path to deliver 1.1 billion in free cash flow this year. And we are allocating our strong free cash flow in a disciplined manner and aligning with our priorities. Through nine months, we've returned $615 million to shareholders, with $375 million of share repurchases and $240 million of dividends and we remain very committed to de-levering $300 million.","Our third quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute on what we can control, namely innovating through our enterprise and allocating our strong free cash flow in a disciplined way. On slide 4, a key driver of success and growing our specialty business is not only creating new product innovation, but improving our commercial execution and driving revenue synergies from our acquisitions.","Our teams continue to make great progress of delivering synergies from the Taminco acquisition. In addition to markets such as animal nutrition or crop protection, which we've highlighted in the past, our chemicals business is delivering strong growth. Authorities around the world including China are in the process of adopting more stringent, environmental laws that require state-of-the-art water treatment solutions for the industrial municipal water treatment applications.","Our unique technology and products allow our customers to manufacture polymers, and enhance purification of water. These widely used products are recognized as the best available technology today due to their remarkable ability to remove dirt particles efficiently at a low dosage in highly demanding water treatment applications. The growth opportunity is further enhanced by the acquisition of the remaining stake in our China JV last year and a subsequent capacity expansion at this site.","So far this year, our water treatment business is up double digits. This growth opportunity coupled with our continued enhancement of commercial execution capabilities continue that trajectory.","Another exciting example is in advanced materials. After ten years of tremendous growth with Tritan copolyesters, we continue to relentlessly engage customers, innovate and win in this market and this is exemplified by our recent success in the medical application. As we outlined at Innovation Day, healthcare associated infections are on the rise. To combat this issue, aggressive cleaning protocols are being used on hospital equipment, which causes the thermal plastics and these devices to fail prematurely, costing the hospitals a lot of money. Tritan has long been an innovative product with consumers for its toughness and BPA free chemistry.","It also has great chemical resistance, which enables it to be the most compelling thermoplastic to hold up under these new hospital cleaning protocols. We continue to build momentum on this program with strong early market adoption in 2018. A great example is the recent win we've had with Mindray, an emerging technology leader in patient monitoring anesthesia and ultrasound. After successful trials, Mindray launched Tritan in all of its North American patient monitors, making them disinfectant ready and more durable over time.","With this success, we are poised to drive additional growth with Mindray to pursue opportunities in other devices as well as other geographies. This combination of market and application development underpinned by world class technology platforms continues to prove to be the model that delivers great results. In 2018, Tritan is on track to deliver another year of double digit growth.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curt Espeland","Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. I know it's been a rough couple of weeks in the market, so hopefully, you will sense that Eastman remains calm and is marching ahead with a compelling growth strategy in the face [indiscernible] global uncertainty.","So with that, I'll start with third quarter results on slide 5. Sales revenue increased led by Advanced Materials delivering double digit revenue growth. Chemical intermediates also continues to do a nice job, raising prices to more than offsetting rising input costs in a challenging raw material environment. EBIT in the quarter declined, as solid earnings growth in advanced materials was offset by other segments.","We\u2019ve continued to make strong progress for the variable margin per unit, which increased in the quarter through mix upgrade and prices mostly keeping up with the increasing raw material costs. This progress was offset by challenging year-over-year volume comparisons in both the fibers and additives and functional products segments as well as we continued to see some investments in growth.","Earnings per share increased both year-over-year and sequentially due to solid opportune results, a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases resulting in lower share count. As always, we focus on driving value through every line of the income statement to deliver earnings per share growth. Overall, a strong third quarter.","Moving next to the segment results and starting with advanced materials on slide 6, which delivered 9% volume growth in the third quarter. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume and continued improvement in product mix across the segment, driven by double digit growth in premium products such as Tritan copolyester, Saflex heads up display and performance films.","EBIT increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix, partially offset by higher raw material cost and increased growth investments. Looking at our expectation for the full year of 2018, we expect EBIT to grow towards the low end of the 7% to 10% range we communicated at our Innovation Day. For the year, this reflects mid to upper single digit volume growth, which is well above their end market growth and reflects the progress we're making on innovation.","In addition, we're implementing price increases in our copolyester products to mostly offset the substantial increases in [indiscernible] costs that occurred through the third quarter. Overall, a solid quarter and advanced materials is positioned for strong earnings growth in 2018.","Now, to additives and functional products on slide 7, which had a solid third quarter. Sales revenue increased, primarily due to higher selling prices across most product lines and modest volume growth due to the tough comp in third quarter of 2017 from large solar fills. EBIT decreased slightly, primarily due to higher raw material and energy cost and increased growth investments, partially offset by higher selling prices and volume growth.","Additives and functional products is doing a good job, managing through a number of headwinds. Raw material and energy costs have increased and we are making progress in catching up with higher prices and we've not had our year-over-year price increases for third, I'm sorry, six consecutive quarters. An exception is that adhesives resins market were an increase in competitive capacity is making it difficult to raise prices to cover rising oil driven raw material costs.","With that said, we continue to expect volume growth for the year will be in the mid-single digits, consistent with 6% growth through nine months. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued strong volume growth in animal nutrition, care chemicals and olefin polymers and we expect some de-stocking from customers in tires and coatings in the fourth quarter. Adding them all together, we expect full year EBIT to grow towards the low end of the 5% to 7% range we communicated at our Innovation Day.","Now, on to chemical intermediates on slide 8, sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices across most product lines, mostly offset by lower sales volume, primarily due to lower merchant ethylene sales. EBIT decreased slightly due to lower sales volume being offset by higher selling prices, more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs. Chemical intermediates has continued to do a nice job raising prices to offset the impact of a challenging raw material environment.","In the fourth quarter, we expect EBIT to be up somewhat year-over-year with higher volume, excluding merchant ethylene and higher selling prices, continuing to offset higher raw material and energy costs.","I\u2019ll finish up the segment reviews with fibers on slide 9, which continues to demonstrate progress toward stabilizing results. Sales revenue was down slightly in the quarter, as selling prices declined in line with previous quarters this year. Sales volume increased as growth in textile and non-woven applications was partially offset by lower acetate tow sales volume, reflecting customer buying patterns.","We are making great progress in the textiles market as yarn volume was up 30% in the quarter, led by our Naia product line. EBIT declined year-over-year as expected and was about flat sequentially, showing stability for the first nine months of 2018. ","In the second half of the year, we've been working to manage through a recent trade situation with China that started in the middle of the third quarter, which is resulting in no new Chinese tow imports from US manufacturing sites. As a result, we now expect total revenue for China for the full year of 2018 will be approximately 3% of towable fibers revenue segment, segment revenue versus the previous expectation of 5%.","We continue to expect acetate tow volume outside of China to be stable for the year. And our productivity gains are continuing to flow through and the progress of our growth initiatives is contributing to earnings stability.","Looking at full year 2018, considering all these factors, we expect EBIT in the segment to be slightly lower compared to the last year. And on the trade issue, we\u2019re working to mitigate the impact for 2019 if it persists. ","One last comment on our asset strategy. Our focus on innovation has resulted in repurposing some of our acetate tow manufacturing lines to textiles and non-wovens, which are no longer needed for tow and which has led to increased capacity utilization that improves our cost position to serve our tow customers. The net result is that our global acetate tow capacity today is approximately 155,000 metric tons, which is 30,000 metric tons or over 15% less than it was compared to a year ago.","We are making progress towards a future where when you look at fibers business, you won't see just an acetate tow business, but rather an innovation driven fibers business, serving diverse and growing end markets. This is yet another reason we are confident in our ability to stabilize the EBIT and cash flows for this segment.","On slide 10, I\u2019ll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for the third quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid year in cash generation and disciplined capital allocation in 2018. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2018 totaled $381 million, excluding insurance proceeds. And we expect full year capital expenditures, excluding insurance proceeds, to come between 525 million, to 550 million somewhat lower than our previous projected, as we manage capital in this uncertain global economy.","On free cash flow, we have a number of factors in the fourth quarter beyond normal seasonality that give us a path to generate approximately $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. First, the fourth quarter will include receipt of the final coal gas insurance payment of $65 million. Second, we expect additions to property and equipment in the fourth quarter will be more than $50 million lower than a year ago period. Third, we have plans in place to aggressively manage our working capital.","Looking at the balance sheet, we remain committed to using $300 million of free cash flow to reduce debt this year. Additionally, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Through the first nine months, we\u2019ve returned $615 million, split between $240 million in dividends and $375 million in share repurchases. We have improved our expected full year effective tax rate to be approximately 17%, below the bottom of our previous range.","Lastly, one more comment on the coal gas incident. We have previously indicated we expect the final net impact of the incident to be between $25 million and $50 million. With the final insurance settlement recorded in the third quarter of 2018, the net impact was approximately $25 million. And the negative cash flow impact in 2018 is expected to be at a similar level. I really appreciate the efforts of the Eastman team to help minimize the financial impact of last year's incident. Well done.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Kurt. On slide 11, I'll discuss our 2018 outlook. For the first nine months of 2018, we delivered strong volume growth and mix improvement in our specialty segments, but were two times the growth in the underlying markets. We're continuing to benefit from innovation driven growth model. We're making great progress on new business revenue closures, which is up 20% through the first nine months and we expect to continue creating our own growth in the many applications across the company through innovation enabling us to grow faster than the underlying markets. ","We\u2019re also on track to offset inflation through productivity. And as I mentioned in my first slide, we returned $615 million to our stockholders through the first nine months, including accelerating our share repurchase program. Lastly, we have improved our effective tax rate. At the same time, while we focus on what we can control, we're managing a number of headwinds. We're seeing some pockets of destocking, but no evidence of a broader slowdown, with the exception of autos in China. ","We've also seen higher raw material and energy prices, although these are volatile as we've seen over the last several days and we have some limited exposure to trade disputes, particularly in fibers. Taking all this together, we expect that the EPS growth will remain at the 10% to 14% range and will likely be towards the bottom of that range. And as Kurt mentioned, we have a path to deliver over $1.1 billion of free cash flow, which is one of the strongest in the industry and reflects our outstanding performance, especially in this inflationary environment.","On slide 12, let me make a few comments about our expectations for 2019 and summarize where we are. As we look at 2019, we have a couple of high level assumptions. Economic growth is similar to \u201918, raw material and energy prices are fairly stable and the US dollar does not strengthen meaningfully from the second half of 2018. In this context, we expect continued growth in volume and mix upgrade, which has been powerful for the last five years. In particular, we'll continue to create our own growth through our innovation driven growth model.","We expect to benefit from the absence of significant operational headwinds, including unplanned vendor outages and higher than normal plant shutdowns. We also don't have another large step-up in growth cost next year. With our expected growth and fixed cost leverage, we will convert our variable margin to the bottom line much more effectively than this year, providing an attractive return on these investments, as we move forward. And we expect to benefit from our GP investment, lowering our merchant sales in ethylene relative to 2018. With more stable raw material prices, we will not be chasing raw materials with price increases through the year in the specialties.","On a segment level, we expect to see sustainable earnings growth in the specialties due to the volume growth and fixed cost leverage, along with stability in fibers and CI, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve shared with you at Innovation Day. And discipline allocation of our strong free cash also contributes to EPS growth. As a result, we expect EPS growth to be in the 8% to 12% long term range we communicated at Innovation Day. We'll talk more about our outlook for 2019 on our call in January when we have more insight into the macroeconomic conditions.","Finally, let me summarize where we are and why I'm so confident about our future. As you think about our portfolio, we're showing progress in our goal of driving from 70% to 80% of our business in specialties, which is especially important in the face of uncertain macroeconomic trends. All this comes together for a terrific bottom line. We can grow faster than the underlying markets and sustain our margin through our unique innovation driven growth model. We also do this through the scale and integration, which gives us a competitive advantage in how we develop new products and bring them to market. And finally through disciplined portfolio management that leads you to one of the strongest free cash flows in the industry, a strong return on invested capital that is growing and compelling compounded EPS growth through 2020 and beyond. When we put it all together, we're well positioned for long term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our shareholders and all of our other stakeholders.","With that, I'll turn it back to Greg.","Greg Riddle","Thanks, Mark. We've got a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to as many of the questions as possible, so I ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, Cody, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Mark, just on 2019 guidance, when do you expect selling prices to catch up the raw materials in the specialty businesses?","Mark Costa","Hi, David. So, we're making great progress on that front already through the third and fourth quarter. AFP has had six consecutive quarters of price increases, making good progress on that and we expect that as we work through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, we should be in a good position to get our prices to catch up. I mean, the fourth quarter includes normal seasonality and destocking as we've mentioned. So, we'll get some of it then, but the remainder in the first quarter.","David Begleiter","Very good. And Curt, just in 2019, how should we think about share buybacks versus debt reduction in terms of the capital deployment for next year?","Curt Espeland","So it starts with, you should assume that our free cash flow will grow, because we're doing a great job, converting net earnings to cash flow. We\u2019ll be assessing how much de-leveraging. I think our de-leveraging will decline, in part, that will determine based on how much EBITDA growth we expect next year. So if you think about cash flow deployment, it's going to be first to pay that nice dividend that we have, which is yielding even better than it was a month ago. Secondly, it will be doing some continuing leveraging, but less than what we did this year and in absence of bolt-ons, it will be deployed for share repurchases.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from Vince Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vince Andrews","Just, you referenced the de-stocking, can you just clarify, are you seeing any destocking outside of something as a derivative of auto production?","Mark Costa","Sure, Vince. So right now, it's always hard to know exactly what's going on, especially at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We certainly see some destocking in coatings and tires as you noted that is associated with the auto industry. We are anticipating that there's some potential de-stocking that could be driven by trade concerns in China about our customers\u2019 ability to export back to the US, which would be more sort of specialty plastics, consumer durable oriented. But I\u2019d tell you right now, orders are holding up relatively well in October across the specialties. So, outside of autos, where we can see some de-stocking, it's more about anticipation of these issues more than things we see at the moment.","Vince Andrews","Okay. That's good to hear. And just as a follow-up, on the cash flow statement, what's the big swing factor in this other items net line?","Curt Espeland","What you see in the other net just in the third quarter is we did our settlement with our insurance provider for the coal gas incident. That created a $65 million receivable at the end of September, which we've not collected in October. Another way to think about it, as you think about our seasonality of cash flows, as I mentioned, the net impact is going to be roughly $25 million on cash this year. So if you assume that $65 million benefit in fourth quarter, that means our cash flows have been hurt mostly this year and a good part of that was in the third quarter. So that's what you're seeing is the seasonality of cash flows, but that specific item that you're seeing in other is a $65 million insurance receivable at the end of September.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.","Frank Mitsch","Following up on the destocking question, I believe you said the pace of business in October was holding up well and kind of your guidance is anticipation of these issues, are you meaning to say that you're leaving yourself some wiggle room in terms of the guidance of the various segments or you have pretty clear line of sight that come November, come December, you're going to be hit with these issues.","Mark Costa","Well, Frank, I think that any fourth quarter is a tough one to predict. There's always a certain amount of seasonal decline due to normal de-stocking and demand trends. Obviously, we're in a much more volatile time right now when you see what everyone else is saying around the industry. I think our guidance is pretty good. It does include some anticipation. When you think about the fourth quarter, you've got a couple of factors. One is the de-stocking issue as we've identified and it's our best estimation. ","You've also got raw materials, prices still chasing raw materials I'd say and AM, we feel good, we've implemented some price increases in October that have gone quite well to start catching up to PX. And so I think we're making really good progress there to get to where we need to be by the first quarter with where we think PX prices are going to sort of trend off. And in AFP, we\u2019re still doing the same thing, which is managing our price relative to rise, with the exception of adhesives, where we have been talking about a known coming challenge for quite some time. ","So when you put those two things together and you've got a bit of a tough comp as well, when you think about the fourth quarter, we have some higher shutdown costs, you have some of those solar fills that were really strong in the third quarter of AFP. It was also about a third of them were in the fourth quarter. So there's a lot of things we're trying to balance in that guidance. But we still feel it's a very good fourth quarter.","Frank Mitsch","And Curt, I couldn't help, but notice a little bit of the [indiscernible] on the dividend yields. To what extent and you outlined what your thoughts were in 2019, but \u2013 and you\u2019ve been accelerating your repurchase here in 2018 versus your original guidance there. What should we be expecting, given the decline here in Q4?","Curt Espeland","Welcome back, Frank. As it relates to the share repurchases, we're going to be disciplined with our capital allocation and we're going to complete utilizing $300 million of free cash flow to de-lever. So, you can do the math off of our 1.1 billion to determine kind of roughly how much share purchases we\u2019ll be doing this quarter and I can assure you what the discipline that our treasury team executes, we've been in the market with 10b5-1 plan. So, we\u2019ve been in the market all year. We\u2019re going to be in the market in the fourth quarter and I can assure you, we\u2019re going to be in market next year as we continue to repurchase share as part of our disciplined capital allocation philosophy.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citi.","PJ Juvekar","Good morning and good quarter in advanced materials. Your volumes have been growing nicely at high single digits for a few quarters, but prices are not following. Is that just a lag or is that a deliberate strategy, so that you can push classics like Tritan into new applications.","Mark Costa","So, there are two different sides of this story as we've discussed in the past. The -- first of all, we're very happy about advanced materials and the strong progress that\u2019s having, delivering very strong growth, relative to the underlying markets across the whole business. So the top line has been great, the mix upgrade has been great. Within the third quarter, PX prices moved up pretty dramatically within the quarter and most of that's clearly pricing. So, you couldn\u2019t really take action on that dynamic until you got to October 1, which we did and we've introduced a price increase that should cover most of that PX increase, as we work through the fourth quarter. ","So if you look at our history on that side of things and all of our copolyester related products, I think we've actually managed price to rise fairly well. As we said in the last call, on the interlayers business, we have had an intentional strategy of sharing some of the scale up of our high end specialties, heads up display, and acoustics. As we ramp those products out, get more cost efficiency in how we make them, we've shared some pricing on that with them to support their growth, which has been exceptionally strong and we have very high double digit growth in heads up display, strong growth continues in acoustics that drives a significant amount of earnings increase on the mix side that is far more valuable than the modest price declines we've been sharing with them, as we gain efficiency on the fixed cost leverage. ","So net, there are two different stories and strategies there, both of them working incredibly well and I think we're on track to deliver good growth. It's important to remember that it's not just price to rise as part of the story in the third quarter and the fourth, is the growth investments we've made in this segment, which in the third quarter was around $10 million higher growth costs than 2017. So when you sort of think about those two factors put together, it was actually very strong results for AM.","PJ Juvekar","And just on strategy front, in last three years, you stayed away from big M&A after acquiring solution Taminco, are there smaller bolt-on deals that you're looking at that you can add to the portfolio and at what point do you feel that you can go back and look for a bigger deal after that you\u2019ve grown this portfolio now in last three years?","Curt Espeland","So, no change in our philosophy, PJ. We've been looking primarily at bolt-on acquisitions. There's things in the pipeline, we're going to continue to be disciplined, as we go through that process, who knows maybe some of this market volatility will create some closure in bid ask spreads that we're encountering in some of our activity out there. So again nothing eminent right now on the bolt-on acquisition front and we're going to remain patient and a disciplined buyer.","Mark Costa","Yeah. I would just add that on the large M&A question, we're actually quite happy with the portfolio we have. I think we're well ahead of the industry in being very disciplined in portfolio management. As you all know, we divested a lot of commodity businesses, 3.5 billion in revenue and we did some substantial acquisitions with solution Taminco and a few bolt-ons that got us over 4 billion in revenue, dramatically improving the structural quality of our EBIT margins as well as improving the stability and ability to create our own growth in times like this where economics -- the macro economy is a little less certain. ","So we feel like we've done what we need to do in improving the quality of our portfolio. We're not looking for large M&A at this stage, because we\u2019ve done the transformation we need, we're not just focused on bolt-on that as Curt said, much more importantly, our growth model is really paying off every day. We're driving a lot of innovation and growth across AM and AFP where we create our own growth and want to make sure we get a good return on investment for these acquisitions, which are a lot of the growth that we're delivering through the revenue synergies with them.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear now from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more detail around the tires margin [indiscernible]. It does seem like maybe some of the tire manufacturers and a few other chemical companies in that space have sounded a little bit more somber. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing on sell-through you think there versus maybe the destocking issue that you talked about?","Mark Costa","Hey, Bob, it\u2019s good to hear from you. So, we see the primary demand situation in tires similar, which is it's relatively slow. It's important to keep in mind that tire sales are also about 75% replacement. So, they\u2019re relatively stable as well when you think about it over time in macroeconomic uncertainty, but that market isn't growing that fast. We've been benefiting from a lot of growth above market on things like our tire resins and making sure we\u2019re aligned with the right customers in China who are doing more of the consolidating of the other tire companies and picking up some growth from that. More importantly, we are in a great position right now with launching our new Cure Pro product from our new Crystex technology into the marketplace. ","It's being very well received and to bring significantly better performance in the products that are currently on the market, including our own by helping tire companies improve mixing efficiency anywhere from 15% to 20 plus percent. So right now, when you're trying to manage costs and be very efficient in our customer base, this is a highly valuable product and we expect to see good growth from leveraging that fixed cost that we have as a headwind this year, turning that into leverage earnings growth next year, but yeah, the overall market is going slow. We don't see it any differently. I would note we're more connected to commercial tires and commercial demand, so that's actually been quite attractive, especially in North America.","Robert Koort","And then shifting over to the [indiscernible] business, have you noticed -- there's been some puts and takes around demand trends I guess in active ingredients and what's going on there. Has that business been relatively stable or what's sort of the outlook in the crop chemical part of that business?","Mark Costa","So, the business has been stable. There's always been continued regulation in Europe around components of crop protection products or products in total and we continue to have some degree of restrictions on some of those products we have had in Europe, but it's just more of the same. That's been going on for several years. I wouldn't call it anything particularly new. I do -- have some upside that I think we didn't have when we bought Taminco as we\u2019ve worked to help them have a more global reach in their commercial execution capabilities, we've been able to help them create a lot more growth from products like their growth regular products in Canada and North America by bringing a better global reach to that business. So while we have these trends in Europe that have been with us for years, we're now accelerating growth in other marketplaces to sort of manage against that and so the business overall net is very stable and very profitable.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet.","Aleksey Yefremov","Your preliminary thoughts on 2019 EPS. Does this growth rate include any buybacks?","Curt Espeland","Yes, growth rate would include the buyback plans we have, yes.","Aleksey Yefremov","And Mark, on Tritan, following the expansion, I guess your growth here is progressing really nicely. Do you have any thoughts on how soon you could sell out this expansion?","Mark Costa","Well, we doubled our capacity. So, the very significant capital investment, which is why the growth headwinds this year are material relative to last year. So in talking to overnight, but with the continued solid and very strong growth we're seeing across the marketplaces in consumer durables, now reading on this medical application environment and a variety of new applications, it's sort of three, four years to fill it out.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","Jim Sheehan","Regarding the trade dispute with China, can you talk about why you're optimistic this issue will be resolved in 2019?","Mark Costa","Well, first of all, we're not trying to predict when the trade issue gets resolved. That's at a better much higher level than my pay grade. But what we're saying is, like all companies, there are mitigating actions you can take to sort of minimize your exposure to some of these trade issues. We\u2019re a multinational company, we have assets around the world, not just in the US. And so, we have options we can work on to mitigate that exposure in fibers and in other products as well.","Jim Sheehan","And can you update us on your access ethylene position?","Mark Costa","Sure. So, we continue to sort of do grade work in mitigating our exposure to the ethylene market. As we mentioned in the last call, there are two different things we're doing. So for the back half of this year, we've significantly reduced the amount of ethylene we\u2019re selling by reconfiguring how we run our crackers, the shutdowns that we had, in particular, the unplanned shutdown that we're forced in to buy our industrial gas supplier in the second quarter allowed us to accumulate quite a bit of propylene in inventory. So that allows us to run our crackers in a different way in the back half of this year, minimizing ethylene production that comes out of bit less propylene and storing a bit of ethylene. ","And so that takes us pretty much out of the ethylene market for the back half of this year. That's not sustainable, which is why we're making the RGP investment to dramatically reconfigure our cracker and give it more flexibility to reduce the amount of ethylene we're producing. So as you look at next year, and how this investment will allow us to operate, we can reduce our ethylene production by about 80%, relative to normal and that allows us to significantly reduce our exposure there. ","The RGP investment also produces more propylene from the production process as well as reducing the ethylene and then the feed slate changes pretty significantly in how we're feeding our crackers. So, our propane purchases drop in half. Our ethane purchases are about 20% less, we\u2019re buying about 150,000 tons of RGP to get this result. And so what we've done is shift significantly our propylene to propane spread volatility towards PGP to RGP, which is much more stable if you look at history and allows us to significantly reduce our olefin volatility exposure in next year and retain flexibility, if it gets very attractive, we can switch back and take advantage of that. And this is $20 million investment with a payback less than -- in less than a year, so it's just a great investment opportunity for us.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Your SG&A costs are now in the mid-170s and in the first half of the year, they were in the mid-180s. Is the decrease a one-off item or is SG&A at a different and lower level?","And then secondly in additives and functional products, if you ex out the solar comparisons, what was the volume growth in the quarter?","Curt Espeland","So Jeff, on the SG&A, I think maybe the way I'd answer that is let me just talk about growth investment. We are seeing growth investments during the course of this year. You see that in SG&A and R&D. That's all a part of our plan of building capabilities, particularly application development activities. So over time, you actually should expect SG&A and R&D to increase kind of throughout the year.","Quarter to quarter, there can be variables that change SG&A, you saw some of that in the third quarter. I'd also say that with the current economic environment, maybe we tightened up our SG&A a little bit more in the third quarter. So you should see SG&A growing over time, third quarter was just some variability and let me just close out with a remainder, so our SG&A and R&D is still one of the lowest in the industry as a percentage of sales.","Mark Costa","Part of what I like about our strategy and our continued discipline about protecting shareholder value is how we make sure we're getting a good return on every dollar, not just in the SG&A, on the R&D. We have made tremendous success in repurposing or refocusing the R&D resources. So within our spend, we've doubled the amount of people working on application development, reducing what we're working on on some process elements that weren't as critical in creating value for shareholders. And so I think, we have a great track record of being disciplined, but overall for the year, you're still going to see about a $50 million headwind in growth costs on a full year basis, 30 plus of that is in the manufacturing cost and about 20 in the SG&A and R&D, but we do have some productivity offsetting the net spend that you're going to see show up on the P&L.","Jeff Zekauskas","What will end on the AFP issue, if you ex out the solar comparison, what would have been your volume growth in that quarter?","Mark Costa","I roughly thought half and half, Jeff. So about half of the 14% volume growth rate last year was the solar performance. So when you think about that and back that out of the results we have this year, you're talking sort of 8% volume growth year-over-year in AFP and everything else. So, it's a strong story of continued growth in that business.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Mike Sison","Mark, when you think about \u201919, I know it\u2019s a little bit early to give specific guidance by segment, but can you maybe gauge how much of the growth will come from your specialty businesses, they were really the key drivers this year and relative to the other segment.","Mark Costa","Yes. Sure, Mike. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, the specialty businesses, which is 70% of earnings and we're driving to be a higher percentage of our earnings will continue to be the horses that drive forward and build our earnings growth next year. So, we will continue to see a good growth in AFP and strong in AM. And, I think fibers will stabilize, CI with the investments we're making RGP, have the opportunity to be a little bit better next year than this year, but I think it's way early to call any of these items. But, I do think overall, we're driving towards a pretty solid growth.","I\u2019d also sort of remind you not to overly focus on the back half of this year on some of the dynamics that sort of feed into how we go towards next year. You've got a lot of de-stocking going on, as we expect some of that in pockets in AFP and maybe a little bit in AM. You've got prices catching up direct, through the back half of this year and some of these isolated trade issues around fibers that on a full year basis next year really isn't much headwind, because now it's China tow is just so small. ","And importantly, tough comp in \u201917 to \u201918 that will now put behind us. So overall, we feel like we're in a really good position to drive volume growth in the specialties, leverage all the fixed cost investments that we've made and generate a lot of free cash flow and even on the price front, to rise if stabilize as I expect they will, given the environment we\u2019re in, that doesn't become the headwind or chasing all year like, we did this year and that's not a drag next year.","Mike Sison","Great. And a quick follow-up on fibers, how big is the specialty fibers business and how much of that segment do you think you can convert over time and maybe remind us what are the end markets that that specialty fibers are penetrating and growing in?","Mark Costa","So, in fibers growth and repurposing this business to become a specialty business again is just a great story and we're really excited about it. The key markets are textiles and non-wovens and we have a real opportunity here with the change in sustainability and environmental trends about products that are certainly more environmentally friendly, so the timing couldn't be better for us to take advantage of that trend. So, Naia, our ester yarns, it's a biopolymer made from sustainable certified force. ","And we've made some investments to materially improve its performance in fashion industry, so you're talking about fast fashion and luxury fashion, women's wear applications, intimate apparel applications is where we're going with those textiles and where we have a product that feels like silk at a much cheaper price has better breathability by far than some of the other alternatives in the marketplace and is a biopolymer that can be biodegradable. So for the fashion history, especially the millennials who are driving a lot of these decisions today, this is very exciting to them and I was just at the largest textile show in Paris a couple of weeks ago in a meeting with both textile mills and brands and it was just amazing to see how excited they were about this story and it all focused on sustainability and how we can sort of help them improve their position in the marketplace with it. ","So that's going great, same story in non-wovens where a lot of non-woven things like facial wipes, baby wipes, things like that are trying to improve their sustainable position as well as biopolymers and biodegradability that we can offer up with our products. So, 30% growth rate, even though it's a small part of the overall fibers business today and we're making great progress. Now, it's up to about 15% of the segment revenue and the margins are good. They're certainly not tow margins, but they're attractive margins and we're excited about where we're going with this business.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","A quick question on Tritan and then on fibers. I've always thought about Tritan\u2019s strength was in the high clarity applications, is it useful to think about Tritan\u2019s sales, how much is high clearly versus how much are other properties that\u2019s driving the use of Tritan?","Mark Costa","Historically, you're absolutely right. I mean, the value proposition we've had historically and continues in consumer durables and some medical applications is high clarity parts very strong, high strength through requirement, chemical resistant requirements, and BPA free and that's been a core part of it. But the story we told you today has actually opened up an entirely new space that is more about compounding Tritan into opaque applications. Obviously, that's not been our historical footprint, but we're now expanding into opening up that entire market to us as well through Tritan and our new Treva, so, those plastic launch. So the housing is replacing all opaque. It's the housings of all these medical devices, you\u2019re typically compounding it with impact modifiers and other performance things or even with ABS or something that adds additional dimensional stability. But it's a whole new addressable market for us going forward.","John Roberts","And then on fibers, margins I think are still higher on [indiscernible] than they are in the new application, so should we expect earnings growth to lag volume growth in the fiber segment?","Mark Costa","Certainly, margins are different, but I'd still say they\u2019re reasonably attractive, more like the company average. And in places, it's better than that. It's a relative growth rate issue, but the reality is to drive overall earnings growth, as we push forward, it's possible because you have, Tel is only going down 2% a year at this stage going forward and you've got 30% growth or 20% growth in certain applications. The math is still going to work to get you sort of net earnings growth on this, which is why we're repurposing this capacity to support this growth as we go forward. But it's still going to take a little bit of time. 2019 is about stability and then moving towards growth, as we go into \u201920.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear now from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Hi. Two quick clarification, you gave in the prepared remarks a little bit of a laundry list of items that helps you on the free cash flow side. As we think about the bridge for next year, do you have similar items to offset or will the free cash flow conversion be a little bit lower.","And secondly, I guess two threats today and I just wondered if you could parse a little bit how you're thinking about them. One seems to be that apart from some soft areas of de-stocking, demand is overall okay and the other part is that the portfolio is more resilient. Are you implying that, even given what we've already seen in terms of -- or what you're seeing with customer conversations, we would have seen in the back half of the year, more lumpiness without the efforts you've made in the last few years or do you think it's more just that demand is actually fairly benign and that we haven't really stress tested the new portfolio mix.","Curt Espeland","Right. So let me just talk to the free cash flow, maybe a way to bring this to life a little bit, let\u2019s just kind of bridge fourth quarter for a little bit. If you remember, fourth quarter of last year, we generated $435 million of free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to have an insurance payment that we've already received as well as we\u2019re going to have $50 million of lower CapEx. So in order to achieve our $1.1 billion of free cash flow, we are only needing some 60 million plus of additional free cash flow generation over last year and those are the types of working capital dynamics that we're working through.","As you think about the conversion next year, I think we'll still have strong conversion of earnings next year. We might have CapEx, maybe a little less than it is this year. We won't have the net $25 million headwind, the insurance and then it's going to come down to how well working capital evolves, if you assume working capital, raw material cost normalize, that means you won't have the working capital challenges that you\u2019ve had this year. So I see a path where we're going to continue to have good conversion. I don't see that conversion rate coming down.","Mark Costa","On the second question, sequentially, I think it\u2019s probably better to go at it, because the \u201917 compares are tough in some of the businesses, especially AFP and fibers. But the trends we see sequentially in demand are relatively stable. So, we continue to see solid growth in the specialties. You're always going to see normal seasonality, as you go into the fourth quarter. And then at the AM level, clearly, we had strong volume growth in AFP when you adjust for the solar fills, you had strong volume growth. I think in chemical intermediates, there's always a certain amount of volatility. We saw some demand come off in the third quarter, some of that, which is seasonal in ag and a few others shut down dynamics of customers. ","Nothing's sort of concerning. But as you sort of go into the fourth quarter, with this inflationary raw material environment that we've been in through the third quarter, it's natural to expect de-stocking, especially in places where demand has moderated a bit like the transportation sector, as we've highlighted in sort of coatings and tires or some trade related caution there. So, I think it's really important we don't overreact to what's going on in the fourth quarter right now. From what we see, it appears to be mostly de-stocking. It's always hard to know exactly what's going on with the primary demand, especially in a fourth quarter when there is normal de-stocking anyway. ","And so, we're not in a position where we're sitting there, saying that we see a primary demand problem out there and the marketplace is outside of the obvious sort of stuff going on in autos. And it's really important to remind you all about autos in Eastman in the way it works. Overall, we've said our exposure in transportation is about half OEM half sort of refinish replacement. But it's important to break that down in a couple of ways. First is, on the AM side, it is much more OEM related, but that is where we have so many innovative products and interlayers like heads-up display and acoustics as well as paint protection films, allowing us to grow much faster than the underlying market, which we demonstrated already in the third quarter and expect that to continue into the fourth. ","And then on the AFP side, about two thirds of that business is more sort of refinish replacement, when you think about tires and where our projects are going into automotive coatings. So, quite a bit of stability in those kind of markets in this kind of timeframe. And even within these markets, we target different applications. So, for example, in China, while the overall auto sales are down, we're actually seeing good growth, because we're more aligned with luxury cars than the smaller cars that don't have the tax incentives anymore and so we're still seeing good growth in our performance films business and some of our high value interlayers that go into the more luxury cars that are actually still growing in China. So, we have to be very careful not to sort of apply a broad brush on some of these things to make sure you understand. I think we're in a pretty solid position.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.","Matthew Blair","Do you have any more color on the 15% effective tax rate in the quarter? It seemed a little low. And then your guidance for full year 2018 I think implies Q4 tax should step up. Could you explain why that is?","Curt Espeland","Sure. That's just the seasonality of the effective tax rate. Earlier this year, we thought we\u2019d be in the 18% to 20% range, due to -- as we continue to evaluate the various moving parts of our effective tax rate, it actually improved to 17% for the year. What you see in the third quarter is just a catch up to that 17% rate on a year-to-date basis. But for the full year of \u201918, it will be around 17% and I can assure you we're working towards that rate next year.","Matthew Blair","And then so if I back out the tax benefit to EPS that you received in 2018, which I think is about 4%, it seems like your 8% to 12% EPS growth target going forward is actually a little bit better than what you're likely to put up this year, which I don't know I guess that's a little surprising, just considering all the talk about the slower growth in the back half of this year. So is that the right interpretation? Is there anything else that we should be taking into account?","Curt Espeland","So, no, when I think about 2018, there are some moving parts between EBIT and tax rate. So some of our year-over-year growth this year is improvement in tax rate, a little bit better than we thought last year. But when you go in to \u201919, the tax rate should not be a headwind or a tailwind and it\u2019s all around underlying performance of the business that Mark already talked about.","I\u2019m sorry, Cody, let\u2019s make the next question the last one please.","Operator","Absolutely. We\u2019ll take our final question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","I just wanted to come back to the capital expenditure profile. It seems to me you've completed quite a few projects over the last 18 months. Tritan most notably, but Crystex and other product lines. As I listen to Curt's comments about CapEx, it seems like you could trend down slightly in 2019. So is it the case that you've got enough capacity across the portfolio at this point or are there other prospective growth projects that you plan to layer in over the next several quarters?","Curt Espeland","I think, Kevin, your intuition is correct. We do expect slightly lower capital expenditures in 2019 versus \u201918. Part of that is, keep in mind, some of the capital expenditures were for the coal gas recovery. So when you think about maintenance CapEx, it\u2019s in that 300 million and 350 million. We showed at the Innovation Day, it could be anywhere from 500 million to 600 million going to \u201919, and probably be more towards that low end of that range.","Mark Costa","Yeah. I think it also connects back to sort of the fixed cost leverage comment. As you think about next year, under the assumption the world's growing, we\u2019ll have continued variable margin growth next year and a very different fixed cost situation where this year if you think about between the 50 million of growth investment costs and if you look at the sort of planned and unplanned operational headwinds we had this year, there's another 50 million. So you've got $100 million of headwind against variable margin and growing EBIT in \u201918 versus \u201917. And if you think about how that translates to \u201919, some of that annualize, so and that is down to sort of $75 million of tailwind, if you will of variable margins growing and how you have much less headwind in \u201919 to \u201918. So, there's considerable leverage here, which feeds into our view about how we can continue growing earnings into \u201919, as we don't have another step up of these costs.","Greg Riddle","Okay.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on Eastman's website, www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are: Mark Costa, CEO; Curtis Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Josh Morgan, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 4 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results news release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for third quarter 2013 and the Form 10-K to be filed for 2013.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain noncore or nonrecurring costs, charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results news release, which can be found at eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the fourth quarter financial results news release.","Third, this presentation includes revenues and operating earnings on a pro forma combined basis, assuming the acquisition of Solutia have been completed January 1, 2012, that compare postacquisition results to preacquisition pro forma combined results. More information on pro forma combined results is in our fourth quarter 2013 financial results news release. And lastly, we have posted slides that accompany our remarks for this morning's call on our website in the Presentations & Events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa","Good morning. Thanks for joining us. I'll start on Slide 3. 2013 was an outstanding year at Eastman as we continue to build on our strengths and navigate through challenges. EPS grew by approximately 20% in 2013 and we have now delivered 4 consecutive years of double-digit earnings growth. The CAGR for EPS over the last 4 years is 34%. We had another year of strong free cash flow in 2013 generating $674 million. And Curt will talk more about that in his comments.","In 2013, we made solid progress in growth initiatives throughout the company. Advanced Materials or Eastman Tritan copolyester volume increased by more than 15% in 2013. And we are currently adding additional capacity to serve continued demand growth. In our plasticizers business, Eastman 168 non-phthalate plasticizers volume grew by approximately 25%. And as with Tritan, we are increasing capacity to serve continued demand growth.","With our joint venture partner, China National Tobacco Corporation, we completed construction of 30,000 metric tons of acetate tow capacity. And that plant is running at commercial levels today. We also began construction of a capacity expansion in Wales for our Therminol heat transfer fluids business, which is expected to be operational later this year.","Moving next to the Solutia integration. We began taking steps to ensure a successful integration before we completed the acquisition in July 2012. We have now brought the majority of Solutia's businesses on the SAP system and expect to complete the SAP migration for the remaining businesses around mid-year. We've captured cost synergies we thought we would and expect to realize more here in 2014. We continue to work on revenue and operational synergies in a number of areas and the outlook for those is good. And we operate today as one effective team.","In addition, we continue to deliver cash to stockholders through both the growing dividend and continued share repurchases. In 2003, our stock repurchases totaled $238 million, including $125 million in the fourth quarter. And we now have increased our dividend 4x in the last 3 years. Overall in 2013, we continued our journey of demonstrating the strength and consistency of our company.","Moving next to our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 4. We had a solid fourth quarter with revenue growth in all but one of our segments, reflecting solid volume growth. Operating earnings are up as strong growth in the Fibers and Advanced Materials segments was offset by declines in Specialty Fluids & Intermediates and the Adhesives & Plasticizers segments. And EPS increased primarily due to solid operating earnings, as well as a lower tax rate.","On Slide 5, our full year earnings. On a corporate basis, revenue increased by 3% in 2013. The primary driver again was volume with increases in all but one segment. Operating earnings increased by over $100 million in 2013, given this higher volume and improved capacity utilization. And operating margin increased by 70 basis points to 17%. This is our highest full year operating margin in the last 5 years, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and end-market diversity.","Now I'll turn it over to Curt, who will take you through our segment results and financial highlights.","Curtis E. Espeland","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Additives & Functional Products on Slide 6. For fourth quarter, sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales. Solvents volume increased strongly as demand strengthened in both the durable goods and the building and construction markets. We also added solvents capacity at our Longview facility at the end of the second quarter to serve the demand growth. In addition, volume increased for cellulosic polymers globally and for Crystex rubber additives, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, both attributed to increased demand in the transportation market.","Operating earnings increased slightly as the higher volume was somewhat offset by higher raw material and energy costs, particularly higher propane. As with the fourth quarter, full year 2013 revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume. Full year operating earnings increased as the higher volume was somewhat offset by spread compression for antidegradants sold in the tires market and continued growth spending in the segment.","For 2014, we expect continued volume growth for solvents and cellulosic polymers as demand continues to strengthen in the transportation and building and construction markets. However, a contracted olefin spread will be a headwind for our solvents business. We also expect the restock cycle for tires in Asia-Pacific to continue in 2014, but we are not yet projecting a restock cycle for tires in North America or Europe in 2014. Putting this together, we expect another year of solid earnings growth in 2014 with earnings between $410 million and $430 million.","Next on Slide 7 is Adhesives & Plasticizers. Starting with the fourth quarter, sales revenue and operating earnings declined primarily due to lower selling prices for adhesive product lines and lower sales volume for plasticizers with operating earnings also being negatively impacted by higher raw material and energy costs. For the full year, revenue and operating earnings declined primarily due to lower prices throughout this segment and lower volume of adhesive resins product lines with operating earnings also negatively impacted by higher raw material and energy costs.","As we finished the year and start 2014, we are seeing early signs that demand has stabilized. For adhesive resins, demand is projected to strengthen as we believe inventory destocking by our customers has concluded. And we are taking actions to reduce costs here, including reducing overhead costs required to support the business and reducing operating costs at our Middelburg facility. In addition, we are moving forward with our joint venture in China to build a low-cost worldscale hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin facility, which we expect will be online by the end of 2015. For plasticizers, we expect better end-use demand with our customers telling us that commercial building and construction market is improving. However, we expect the competitive environment we faced in 2013 to continue in 2014, resulting in continued pressure on pricing. As a result, we expect 2014 earnings to be between $150 million and $175 million.","Advanced Materials is on Slide 8 and they made good progress in 2013. Fourth quarter revenue increased due to higher volume for Tritan and higher volume for other copolyesters sold into the packaging market. Operating earnings increased as capacity utilization improved year-over-year, leading to lower unit costs. You'll also recall that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we were destocking inventory in a few product lines. For the full year, revenue increased due to higher volume for Tritan and for interlayers with acoustic properties. Full year operating earnings increased as capacity utilization was higher for the year and mix improved as we sold more Tritan, the V-Kool window film and interlayers with acoustic properties.","For 2014, we expect volumes to increase and mix to continue to improve as we grow our premium branded products. We expect volume for our specialty plastics products sold into displays market to be flat as demand continues to be soft in the displays market. Taken together, we expect earnings to be between $280 million and $300 million, which would be solid results for the segment.","Fibers is on Slide 9 and they had another exceptional year. 2013 marks their 10th consecutive year of earnings growth. Full year sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs, sales of acetate flake to our China acetate tow joint venture and higher acetate yarn sales volume. And earnings were higher as the higher selling prices more than offset raw material and energy costs. Looking forward to 2014, we expect this streak of consecutive earnings growth will continue. We expect operating earnings to be between $500 million and $520 million.","I'll wrap up the segment discussion with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, sales revenue increased slightly as higher volume, particularly for olefin-based products in North America, more than offset a decline in specialty fluids volume due to the timing of customer project completions. Operating earnings declined as higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for propane, which was up more than 35% year-over-year, more than offset the higher volume for olefin-based products. For full year 2013, both operating earnings and revenue increased slightly. Operating earnings increased as the combination of lower raw material and energy costs, particularly with propane, along with higher volume of olefin-based products more than offset lower selling prices and lower specialty fluids volume.","Looking forward to 2014, we expect operating earnings to be between $330 million and $370 million. The range reflects the volatility of the key raw materials, particularly propane. I'd also remind you that we're expecting revenue from technology licensing in this segment in 2014, which should help negate the impact of raw material volatility. While volumes in specialty fluids are expected to grow, the timing can be impacted quarter-by-quarter by customer sales, especially in the renewable energy market. But all in all, we're expecting solid results from this segment.","On Slide 11, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for 2013. We did an excellent job of generating cash in 2013 with operating cash flow of $1.3 billion. This is a record for cash flow from operations for us. This level of cash generation reflects solid net earnings and discipline on working capital, which was up only slightly year-over-year.","We also utilized just under $300 million of the $1.5 billion of NOLs we acquired as part of the Solutia transaction. Our free cash flow was $674 million for the year. Capital expenditures were $483 million, about in line with the guidance we gave you. And dividends were $140 million for the year. I would just ask you to remember that we only had 3 dividend payments in 2013 since we accelerated the first 2013 dividend payment into the fourth quarter of 2012.","Looking at the balance sheet. We now have repaid the $1.2 billion term loan for the Solutia acquisition. $950 million was repaid in 2013 using a combination of available cash and lower-cost borrowing. Our net debt now stands at approximately $4 billion, a reduction of approximately $500 million for the year. And we are solidly within the metrics for an investment-grade credit rating with a stable outlook.","Fourth quarter results were impacted by a mark-to-market gain of $297 million related to our pension and other postretirement benefits. For the year, the net gain was $380 million -- $383 million, which included an interim remeasurement in the third quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we had asset impairments and restructuring charges of $52 million. This included charges for the decision to discontinue the Perennial Wood growth initiative. Perennial Wood has been a good -- has had a good response in the marketplace, but we could not get the underlying economics to continue to support this investment. We expect spending and other for 2014 will decline slightly as a result of this decision, offset by increases in spending for other growth initiatives.","Finally, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26%. This is lower than our previous expectation, as it reflects the positive impact of integrating the Eastman and Solutia tax structures, as well as a $14 million benefit of favorable foreign tax audit settlements that occurred late in the year. For the full year 2013, the tax rate was approximately 28%. We have sharpened our pencils, given the continued benefits of the Solutia integration and other business changes. And we expect our tax rate for the full year 2014 to be up only slightly to approximately 29% and we're continuing to work hard to improve it even further from there.","So this is just great work by Vince, John and the entire tax team, as well as of those involved with implementing the various initiatives that are required.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa","Thanks, Curt. I'm on Slide 12 to discuss our 2014 outlook. I mentioned earlier that we've grown earnings for 4 consecutive years. We are confident that 2014 will mark the 5th consecutive year of earnings growth for Eastman.","Our confidence begins because of the Eastman-specific actions we are taking, which we expect will contribute between $0.50 to $0.75 in EPS in 2014. The narrowing of the propane-to-propylene spread will be a headwind in 2014, likely in the range of $0.30 to $0.40. Although there is currently economic uncertainty, we are well positioned to benefit from an improving global economy in 2014. And the combination of share repurchases and acquisitions are also expected to contribute to earnings growth. Bringing all this together, we expect EPS to be between $6.70 and $7 a share in 2014.","We expect to start out the year slower than we did in 2013 as we face narrow olefin spreads, continued challenges in Adhesives & Plasticizers and the buying powder that's associated with certain differentiated product lines like specialty fluids. However, we expect to gain momentum in the second quarter as raw material costs decline, particularly for propane, coatings demand picks up in the building, construction and transportation markets and we see normal seasonal improvement in demand across other areas of our business. In addition, the benefit of the Eastman-specific actions we are taking to increase earnings will build during the course of the year.","With the next few slides, I'll give you some additional details on the factors impacting EPS in 2014, beginning with the actions we are taking to grow earnings. We first showed this slide back in October and remain confident in these actions today. Regarding the capacity additions, the acetate tow JV is at commercial quantities today and both the Tritan and Eastman 168 expansions are expected to be operational later this year. On mix improvement, we made good progress with each of these products in 2013 and expect that will accelerate in 2014. On technology licensing, we expect at least 1 license in 2014 and we expect in the years to come, we will consistent revenue from technology licensing with acetyl and the technology for the production of MEG from synthesis-based feedstocks that we announced in October. Lastly, on cost synergies from Solutia acquisition. We ended 2013 at a run rate slightly above $100 million and expect to add another $20 million of synergies by the end of '14. All-in, we remain confident that these Eastman-specific actions will add between $0.50 and $0.75 to EPS in 2014.","On Slide 14 is a discussion of the expected impact of changes in the olefin spread in 2014 earnings. In the table, you can see the average annual prices we have projected for key olefins as we forecast the impact of narrowing spreads. We are taking actions to offset the narrowing of spreads. First, we are adjusting the ratio of propane and ethane we crack to produce propylene and ethylene from 80% propane and 20% ethane we ran in 2013 to something closer to 70% propane and 30% ethane in 2014. And given the respective prices of propane and ethane, this makes economic sense.","As we've indicated previously, we do have an active hedging program and that we do have propane hedges in place for 2014, which will mitigate some of the impact of the higher prices. We're also taking actions with pricing to attempt to offset as much of the higher feedstock costs as we can. Propane prices are expected to increase in 2014 over 2013, helping us raise our prices for our propylene derivatives. Our more substantial challenge is the propane to ethylene. So given the spike in the propane cost here in 2000 -- early 2014 in the large part due to the cold weather much of the country is currently experiencing, the respective prices of other olefins and the other actions we are taking to offset the headwinds we face, we project a negative impact of $0.30 to $0.40 on EPS.","Next, on Slide 15, is our leverage to improvement of the global economy. And while there's uncertainty about the pace of global economic growth in 2014, I remain very confident that we benefit from the diversity of our end markets and our geographic exposure and that we have good leverage to improving growth. On markets, you can see that we do not have any market that represents more than 20% of our total revenue. And as specific markets improve, we are well positioned. So as the transportation market improves, we benefit through our tire additives and coating businesses in the Additives & Functional Products segment and Saflex demand in Advanced Materials. As building and construction market improves, we benefit through the company, including our coatings and plasticizers businesses. And as the consumer markets improve, including consumer durables and packaging generally, we benefit through our adhesives resins and specialty copolyester businesses.","Looking at geographic regions. In 2013, as you can see, the U.S. and Canada represented 46% of our revenue while Asia was our second-largest region at 28% and then Europe was at 21%. As the U.S. continues to strengthen, we expect to benefit in just about all of our segments. We will also benefit as Asia-Pacific and particularly China, continues to transition from an infrastructure-based investment economy to more of a consumer-based economy since many of our products sold into China go into the more premium goods that consumers in China increasingly want. As European economy begins to improve, we are leveraged for that in each of our segments. We aren't leveraged to one specific geographic region or to one specific market. As global economic growth improves, I think the benefit of our diversity would be clear.","Moving to Slide 16. Another factor impacting our 2014 earnings is our cash flow and how we deploy it. We delivered strong free cash flow in 2013 and we expect to do that again in 2014. Operating cash is expected to be a healthy $1.4 billion. Capital expenditures will be up in 2014 compared with '13 by about $100 million and above the top of our normal range as we have increased infrastructure spending in Kingsport, including converting 2 of our boilers to natural gas from coal. And we're spending on growth initiatives such as the expansion of Therminol heat transfer fluids in Wales, as well as our Tritan and Eastman 168 plasticizer expansions. On dividends, we only had 3 dividend payments in 2013 and we'll have the normal 4 payments in 2014. And the net result is projected free cash flow of about $600 million.","Moving to the next slide. We will remain disciplined and balanced on how we deploy the cash. I mentioned capital expenditures on the previous slide. On debt, we will continue to optimize our debt structure within our investment-grade rating. On joint ventures and acquisitions, we continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions. For example, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of an aviation turbine oil business from BP. When combined this with our Skydrol aviation fluid, the product from this acquisition, which has annual revenues of approximately $100 million and margins above our corporate average, will enable us to better meet the needs of the global aviation industry. In addition, an acquisition like this provides an opportunity to access the capital markets to continue to take advantage of the attractive debt market.","And on stock repurchases and dividends, we expect to continue to be active as guided by our board. In the fourth quarter, we spent $125 million of share repurchases and we have continued to make repurchases here in January. For full year 2013, we have purchased 3.2 million shares for $238 million and we expect to continue to repurchase shares to more than offset dilution in 2014. On the dividend, we continue to expect our dividend to increase as our earnings increase.","I conclude on Slide 18 with comments about our strategy for delivering consistent and superior value. As you can see, we believe the combination of growing the existing portfolio greater than GDP growth rates plus growing beyond the existing portfolio and a balanced approach to capital allocation will create value for all of our stakeholders. Key levers as we execute this strategy are winning with the customers through innovation and we will bias our SG&A and R&D spending towards innovation going forward, strengthening our competitive position through productivity and leveraging acquisition to improve the portfolio. We're also working to reduce our olefins exposure as we continue to pursue options for our excess ethylene and as we grow the current portfolio of businesses into other areas.","While we have challenges to overcome, I'm excited about the opportunities of are ahead and the great team we have at Eastman that positions us to succeed.","With that, I'll turn it back to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Thanks, Mark. We have a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. [Operator Instructions] .","With that, Chris, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mark, in your guidance, what are you assuming for share buybacks? And why weren't you more explicit about buybacks, given that the debt, the term loans were paid and I think you had projected that you would be aggressive on buybacks in 2014?","Mark J. Costa","I'm not exactly shocked that, that might be the first question off the gate. A good question and a fair one. We've been very clear that we've always had a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation and we intend to keep it that way. We're prioritizing all of our investments around organic growth opportunities and we're very excited about the strength of our portfolio and we'll continue to make those investments. As we clearly noted, we still have free cash flow available after those organic needs and after being paying the dividend. So the third question to ask, where are we going to go with the capital allocation between sitting on it, which we don't intend to do, we intend to deploy it, or deploying it against M&A and share buybacks. We're going to take a position where we stay flexible on how much of that we're going to do between M&A and buybacks. We think it's a good discipline to look at both the M&A market and the opportunities they present for creating long-term earnings growth, as well as share buybacks. I think it's likely that we're going to buy back shares more than dilution this year. But as always, that's subject to board support.","Curtis E. Espeland","And Mark, if I could just add. David, just to let you know, we started the year with $160 million remaining on our current authorization. As Mark mentioned, we are continuing to repurchased shares to start the year. So we know as part of our normal interactions with our board, we'll be discussing with them the size and timing of our next authorization. You've heard from us in the past, we've had a great relationship with our board and they've been fully supportive of that balanced and disciplined capital allocation strategy that Mark mentioned.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Very good. And Mark, just on Fibers, given lower raws, higher prices and likely higher volumes, is there an upside to your guidance of $5.20 on the top end for Fibers in 2014?","Mark J. Costa","It's a good question, Dave, especially given how we beat our forecast in 2013 from the beginning of the year. We've put a lot of more effort in trying to get that forecast right this year and thinking through all the elements of price, raws and volume. And I think the guidance we've given you is a good one.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark, on Slide 14, you outlined some of your input cost assumptions for the year. It's very helpful. You also indicated, though, that you had some hedges in place. And so if I look at the propane level of $1.18 per gallon, is that on a market price basis? And perhaps you could comment on how hedges helped you or hurt you in the fourth quarter and what your expectations are for 1Q, given some of the distortions related to the so-called polar vortex.","Mark J. Costa","Yes. So I'm going to answer the first half of that question around our view of prices. I'm going to let Curt handle the hedging question. With regards to our view on prices, the $1.18 is based on the forward market curve that we see that's available in the market. So the other prices, like propylene, et cetera and ethylene are based on the IHS. But that's the forward curve for the market as of 2 days ago. In regards to hedging, we do have a very active hedging program, where we try and mitigate a material amount of our exposure on propane. I'll let Curt to add some more comments.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. As Mark mentioned, Kevin, we have an active hedging program across commodities, currencies and even interest rates. On the raw material side, we primarily hedge propane, ethane and natural gas. Traditionally, we have hedged to provide some seasonal spike protection, such as the winter or hurricane season and to provide time for our businesses to kind of respond with the appropriate pricing that is needed with that input cost. Given the trends that we've seen over the last 6 months, we've actually gone -- traditionally, I would say we would've hedged out 6 months. We actually are not going be on that timeframe and we might even find ourselves hedging 1 to 2 years out, given some of the volatilities that's out there. As I look at our fourth quarter, normally, we would have put a healthy level of spike protection in for that. As you know, propane moved quickly in that August-September frame, so I'm probably thinking as much into it as I would've preferred. And some of that has continued in the first quarter. But we do have a healthy level of hedging protection that's helped us in fourth quarter, will continue to help us in the first quarter, but, more importantly, will help us in the year at hitting that guidance that we provided.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then a second question, if I may. Mark, you've put out an Adhesives & Plasticizers earnings range of $150 million to $175 million or so. Can you talk about your level of confidence in that range? If I look back at 2009, a credit crisis year, I think you had a 12.8% margin. Do you think that could prove to be a durable low? Or are there factors you're saying that could create a little bit more risk on the downside?","Mark J. Costa","Great question. And we certainly are paying a lot of attention on the Adhesives & Plasticizers business and doing what we can to improve it, Kevin. Right now, what we'd say is the indications are the business is stabilizing. I think from a volume point of view in adhesives, we were sequentially flat in fourth quarter and actually stronger on a year-over-year basis. And as we look at '14 over '13, we expect demand to improve. The destocking appears to be over, so we don't have that as a headwind in this year. Hydrogenated demand is still quite solid especially with hygiene demand. And I think it's fair to assume, given the worldwide global economy, the packaging demand is going to improve, but it's unclear exactly how much. And that's one of the key issues, is getting that demand to improve to stock up some of the excess capacity in Asia, in particular. The key uncertainty for us is really competitive behavior. So there are 2 elements to that as we explained in past calls. One is the substitute material, which is rosins versus our hydrocarbon resins. The prices had gone up a lot as we talked about in the third quarter call and they have stayed up relatively high. So that is reducing the amount of substitution towards rosins from hydrocarbon resins, which is helpful. And those prices are likely to at least stay high for the first half of the year. There's uncertainty about what the rosin crop will be this year and how that will impact prices in the back half of the year. The more significant issue is just what happens on the like competitors and hydrocarbon capacity. And there's still certainly adequate supply in the market to serve demand, so we don't see a lot spread recovery. But if spreads hold and demand improves, then you can see how this business would start stabilizing. And even if demand improves, we have some room for some spread erosion to hit the low end of the guidance on the adhesive side. The plasticizer is a pretty similar story. We see demand recovering in North America with B&C, especially in flooring, so that's going to help this year, which was certainly not there last year. And the non-phthalate substitution, it was expected to continue. We had very strong growth in our non-phthalate 168 plasticizers, and that volume growth will be there. So I think we feel good about the volume side in the plasticizers, and then you're just back to the same conversations in adhesives, which is what's going to be competitive behavior as excess capacity, in particular in Asia, is chasing demand in Europe and the U.S. because China demand has been relatively slow to grow last year and clearly uncertain this year based on all the press. But again, you've got very strong volume growth to absorb some spread compression if it happens. Or if it doesn't happen, then you go towards the higher end of that range. And Kevin, one thing I'd note is that we're not just sitting here waiting for the world to get better. We are taking a number of actions to improve this business. So we are taking a hard look in reducing some costs in SG&A and R&D. We've got a great project in our Middelburg site that's going to improve the cost position of the plant in the late half of the year. And we're very excited about the plant we're building with our joint venture partner in China, which we expect to be online late '15, which will be, by far, the world-class, low-cost plant in the world to serve the hydrogenated resin market, where we have a more differentiated position. So there are other things that we have going on that improve this business versus just waiting for supply-demand to get better.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. Just back to Slide 14, just as we -- I really appreciate the color on the '14 impact from narrowing olefin spreads. But as we just think about the first quarter impact, just to help us with the modeling, is it -- I think that's where you're going to see the bulk of the impact. Is it going to be about half of that full year number, or anything to kind of figure out the cadence of that $0.30 to $0.40 impact?","Curtis E. Espeland","This is Curt. Yes, our strategy here is to kind of give you inputs on what's coming into our full year guidance. We're not going to sit and try to break down that component quarter-by-quarter. But you can do the math of where that forward curve is and kind of expect a good portion of that headwind is going to be in the first quarter.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And have you already shifted your olefins units to 70% propane today? And if so, does that mean that you have to buy a little bit more propylene from the merchant market?","Mark J. Costa","We have shifted the assets over to that mix and are pushing it as hard as we possibly can. And it doesn't have any material impact on our need to buy propylene.","Operator","And we go next to Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Obviously, very strong volumes in Q4. Can you talk about where you stand on your capacity utilization? Obviously, you've got some expansions going on in the Tritan and the plasticizers, et cetera. Where do you stand there? And what should we expect in terms of overall capacity on a percentage basis additions in 2014 and what your utilization may be?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. I think that the utilization, as we look at '13, was certainly relatively high across the company. And we expect utilization to continue to be high and higher in '14 as demand improves. It's important to keep in mind that looking at absolute utilization is a little deceptive with Eastman because we have a mixture and flexibility of our integrated assets, where we can always run the big engines and the big parts of our capacity quite high and selling off some of the intermediate products. And then what we focus on doing is growing the higher-value specialty products as fast as we can that shifts the utilization towards those higher-value products, improving the mix in our business. And on the specialty products, in a lot of the areas, we still have plenty of capacity and room for growth in that leverage on those assets. So in performance films, we have that. In interlayers, both inside Advanced Materials, we have that leverage. And in copolyesters, we certainly have that leverage as well. Obviously, in some places, we're tight, like Tritan, and that's why we're adding capacity, or in Therminol, where we're adding capacity. So we've got the room to support growth. We've had some great capacity additions that allowed us to grow that we brought online in the fall, like the China JV in tow. The ethylene oxide derivative capacity expansion we did for Additives & Functional Products allowed us to accelerate growth and will support growth this year. So a key part of understanding our earnings is that it's not just about volume growth. You get misled if you just look at the top line revenue. It's about substantial mix improvement, given the high-value products we're growing much faster than some of the intermediates.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is it fair to say that given the volume growth that you are seeing in your businesses that pricing is definitely going to follow?","Mark J. Costa","I think we feel good about our pricing strength in most markets right now. It's always subject to what competitors are doing. Adhesives & Plasticizers is the one place where we obviously have some challenges. But otherwise, we feel pretty good.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Great. And then lastly, speaking of how you're feeling, how you're feeling about $8 in 2015?","Mark J. Costa","I'm surprised it took this long to get to this question. I knew I could count on you, Frank. So $8 a share, we remain committed to driving towards $8 a share in 2015. From an organic perspective, clearly we're going to have some challenges in reaching that number. If you go back to Investor Day guidance and look at the earnings that we provided for each of the segments at that time, our largest problem obviously is Adhesives & Plasticizers and we just had a discussion around some of the challenges there, getting it to stabilize and improve. But that's been a big hit as we've already advised in the past. But the strength of our portfolio also shows up here on why we like the diversity of our portfolio because you can also see that Fibers is significantly outperforming what we would have guided at Investor Day, offsetting a good portion of the hit we've taken in Adhesives & Plasticizers. And that's always part of that diversity. You have a view on things at one point in time, but the world never sort of cooperates. Some things do better, some things do worse. But the value that diversity continued to deliver consistent earnings growth. The second part about our organic challenge obviously is at Investor Day, we assumed about 3.5% global GDP compounded from '12 to '15 and that's certainly not worked out in '13 and '14. I think we see that the world may strengthen here. And hopefully, it will help. But that's a bit of a headwind, especially in Europe, with some of our businesses that are focused on building, construction and transportation. And at a lower level, I would say actually relative to those 2 things is the cracking spreads being a headwind. There's certainly a headwind from a '13 to '14 point of view. But if you go back to our view of the world in '12, we had a bit of a different view. And the propane-to-propylene spreads aren't all that different today than what we would've assumed in '12. The real challenge we have is actually propane to ethylene, where both ethylene and ethane prices today are much lower than where we were in 2012 on our expectations. And that's a bit of the challenge that we feel on that side of it. And we do have hedging and pricing and other things that we follow to address some of those cracking spread challenges. So those are some of the challenges. Now we're not just sitting here with that. We're thinking about how we pull every lever we've got in the company to improve our performance and deliver. As we noted, we have a bunch of specific actions we're taking in 2014 to get to $0.50 to $0.75. In addition, we're also taking a variety of cost actions to improve the Adhesives & Plasticizers business. And we're developing a fairly robust set of ideas for 2015 that we'll do that we'll talk to you about later in the year. The other thing that's important to note that we can go back to what Dave asked about at the beginning of the Q&A is that we do have an extremely strong cash flow and balance sheet and we have one of the highest EBITDA margins of our peer set. And so that gives us strength and flexibility to find additional ways to grow earnings beyond organic growth and we certainly intend to do that. As I said, we're going to be balanced and disciplined in this approach. We're not going to get focused on any one lever as a solution. Our job is to create both short- and long-term value creation and consistent earnings over the years. And so we need to be measured and careful about how we make the decisions between acquisition and M&A -- I mean, acquisitions and repurchase. I think we have demonstrated that we're willing to do that. Even in the last quarter, we started buying back some shares beyond dilution and we did an acquisition as well that's going to be a great addition to our SFI business. So I feel very good that we're in a good position here. We've delivered 4 very strong earnings growth years. I think we're well positioned to deliver other earnings growth this year and next year. And if you look at that and think about how many companies in the S&P have delivered sort of 6 years of continuous growth, I think that we're doing relatively well compared to that group. And it all comes back to the strength of our portfolio. We've got leading positions in many of our businesses. We've got strong diversity in our end markets and geographies. We've got world-class technology platforms. And we have the cash. So we feel good about driving towards that number. We're not letting go of that as our goal.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If we take sort of the hypothetical situation, where you've got your $600 million of free cash flow this year. Now let's say there's an M&A opportunity that comes along that would require the entire use of that $600 million. How will you sort of examine and make the decision between M&A and share repurchases? What things would be important to analyze for you to make the decision to go one way or the other?","Mark J. Costa","That's great question and it's one that we're constantly debating and trying to think about, what are always the best things to do for our shareholders. As I noted in my prepared remarks, there's the debt market out there as well, so it's not just what do we with our free cash flow. So we'll look at using and exploiting the debt market, especially how attractive it is right now, as part of funding M&A as we go forward. But the tradeoffs are trying to think through the timing. We look at a robust portfolio of M&A ideas that we have and we're continuing to revise and look at those. Obviously, valuations are a bit high in a lot of opportunities right now, so we need to make sure that we continue to be disciplined and not overpay in chasing M&A ideas. The accretion is important and it's easy to get with cash today. But we need to make sure there's a good ROC above the cost of capital. So we're not going to let go of our discipline. But there are ideas that we think are important to consider. And that then factors into how much stock you want to repurchase this year and be balanced about that. And I think we've got an authorization that allows us to continue to take out dilution this year and think about doing more than dilution on a limited basis. And we're going to continue to make decisions with ourselves and our board about what we should do going beyond that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. First, on pricing, can you give an update on the pricing negotiations or settlements for Saflex and the acetate tow business? And also just on the volume trends in Q4, were there any areas where you think you might have seen any significant prebuying that also affects the bridge into the first half of 2014?","Mark J. Costa","A great set of questions. First, on the pricing, I think with the Fibers guidance we gave you, we're successful in getting what we wanted on pricing and think we're going to have a good volume year there. And so those contracts discussions were successful. With the Saflex business, I would also say we had a successful contracting season with our glass customers in succeeding and improving our position in the marketplace for price and volumes, so we feel good about that business as well. In regards to prebuying, we didn't see that much of it. I was actually concerned we would see quite a bit of prebuying on the propylene side because propylene prices started moving up ahead of January and December. But it wasn't as much as we expected. And I think we did a pretty good job of controlling that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","There was a lot of discussion on propane. But can you talk about propylene and what specific actions are you taking in pricing on propylene derivatives? I think there was an oxo price increase announced. Are you getting any traction on the pricing side?","Mark J. Costa","The propylene side certainly has gone up, as you know, already in December and in January. And I think the expectation is for modest increase in propylene prices for February, as well. We'll have to see how that plays out. But overall, I'd say, on average, we expect propylene prices to be somewhat higher this year than last year. And there's always the wild card of unplanned outages that have a big impact on that story that, obviously, none of us can predict. In regards to the pricing, we have rolled out multiple price increases here in January and for February and we're getting good traction and getting a good portion of those price increases to stick both from the solvents in Additives & Functional Products and the propylene derivatives in SFI.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned rosin supply earlier. Can you just talk about what are your expectations for rosin supply in China in 2014 because that seems to be impacting and giving, I think, some pricing pressure? And then secondly, just in adhesives, is that a business you want to be in the long term?","Mark J. Costa","In regards to rosin pricing -- you said rosin pricing, I think. In regards to rosin pricing, it went up significantly in the fall and it's staying up and it's expected to come off to some degree when the new crop arrives. The question is, does it go all the way back to 2013 first half levels? Or does it go back to a more normal level, which would have been higher than the beginning half of '13? And most expectations is that middle ground. So the good news about that is, if it stays where it's at and it only comes off a limited amount, the substitution of losing demand from hydrocarbons to rosins is probably mitigated and not as much of a headwind as it was last year. In regards to what the crop will be and how prices will impact the second half of the year, we don't know. When prices are high, more people tend to climb up the hill and seek rosin out of trees in China and it's a bit of a wild card to predict what's going to happen on that front. So we'll just have to see how it plays out. In regards to the business, it's a fair question. I think that if you look at our history, Eastman has always been very disciplined about its portfolio and looking at vesting and grade specialty businesses and continue our journey of being a specialty company and exiting some businesses that we're underperforming in that transition. And we do have a good track record. I wouldn't say Adhesives & Plasticizers is yet in that discussion set. It's a good business. We've had 1 year of tough times and we needed some things play out a little bit here to see how it either recovers or it doesn't. At its current level, though, it's still a very value-creating business. At its current earnings level, even for 2013 or '14, given our guidance, it's still creating value above our cost of capital in a meaningful way. And so we're going to continue to invest in it this year and fixing it and making it more cost-competitive, see how things go and then we'll make the appropriate decisions in the future if necessary.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In that $0.30 to $0.40 compression from commodities, does that include the benefits of your hedges? Or is that exclusive of the benefit of your hedges?","Mark J. Costa","Jeff, it includes the benefit of the hedges.","Curtis E. Espeland","As well of our pricing actions that we might take.","Mark J. Costa","Yes. A lot of people are doing this math, just doing how much propane we buy times the cost of propane. And obviously, it's hard to know exactly what our hedges are. But the hedges are in there. But you also remember, pricing actions are also in there. And we have a lot of good products that use that propane into specialty derivatives, where we have some pricing power. And so we use that to offset headwinds like this.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then you spoke about changing your mix from, I guess, 80% propane to 70% propane. Where are you getting the extra ethane from? Or is your ethane supply now different than it was previously? Because presumably, you could have done this years ago if you chose. What's different?","Curtis E. Espeland","Jeff, what's different is it's not necessarily the supply of propane or ethane, it's more of the front-end part of our cracking operations. And so you had to make modifications to enable that mix change. And I can guarantee the guys are just continuing to look for more ways to have more flexibility with the options of the feedstocks that we crack.","Mark J. Costa","If you go back 2 years ago, propane wasn't a disadvantaged stock relative to ethane. So you had a different mix balance in how you created value between propylene and ethylene. Now we're in this world where ethane is so substantially lower than propane, it's changed how we're think about that and we've been making investments and creating more flexibility in our crackers.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And if I can make a request. In your financial statements, you don't itemize the effect that your pension gains have on your cost of goods sold or R&D on SG&A or at least as I read them. And it makes it very difficult to know what your cost of goods sold or SG&A or R&D actually is and to compare it year-over-year. And if you look at the disclosures of Dow and some of other companies, they itemize that. And so if it's possible, it would be helpful if you guys did that as well.","Curtis E. Espeland","Jeff, thanks for the feedback. And I can guarantee you, our top-notch SEC and reporting group is listening, so they'll come up with good ways to help you out.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Sison of KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Mark, in terms of the tire additives business, with your outlook for '14, particularly in North America and Europe, it sounds like if I did the math, it's going to be several years in a row of that business struggling. Maybe just some top-down thoughts, do you still like the business? Is there potential for this business to grow longer term? Just kind of thought of how that business is coming along for you.","Mark J. Costa","Certainly, the tire business is one we like. It's a great market. It's certainly gone through some very difficult demand challenges at the primary demand level over the last couple of years because I think the tire manufacturers had overproduced and loaded the channel with more inventory than needed and it took a long time to sort of destock it back to demand. When we look at 2014 -- 2013, by the way, was actually a decent improvement in demand for us for both Crystex and antidegradants. And we expect '14 to be another solid volume growth year for us in tires. The Crystex business, which is the majority of earnings, is a very solid business, very attractive margins and we're making a lot of investments to continue to grow and innovate in that space. The biggest headwind we had overall for the entire Additives & Functional Products segment was the antidegradants facing a lot of competitive pressure. That's a small part of the earnings, but it was a material earnings headwind as we continue to struggle with prices in benzene prices or struggled to improve market prices and our raw material costs in benzene went up considerably. So that's one we're taking actions to try and improve. But the overall business, we like. And importantly, it's not just about the products we bought from Solutia. We have some great innovation programs going on, leveraging Eastman asset and technologies into this space. And we're getting great traction with the customers in that space. So we see great growth opportunities for cellulose esters being used in tires to improve traction and wear of the tires and getting great feedback from our customers on that. We're also finding very strong interest in our hydrocarbon resins that we sell through the adhesive segment. We also sell them into the tire segment and see great growth opportunities there. They're moving from using resins as a process aid into a functional additive for the tread and performance for traction in the tire. And there's a lot of innovation going on in that area and we're the leader in providing technical innovation in that area because of the breadth and depth of our technical expertise in hydrocarbon resins. So there's a lot going on there. We like the segment and we're going to continue investing.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And real quick on the heat transfer fluids business, you've added a nice asset there with the BP business. So can you talk a little bit about that? And maybe is this sort of another growth business for you to do more acquisitions? And it's always been a good business for Solutia, could be sort of the next platform for you to continue to grow on.","Mark J. Costa","The BP business is a great, high-margin, attractive, stable business. They've got greater than GDP growth rates to it. And importantly, it's a great fit with our Skydrol hydraulic fluid business. The 2 are often sold as a package by our competitor into the marketplace. And now this significantly improves our competitive positioning and what we can offer to the marketplace as well. So we view this as a great business and a great market. So whether there's additional acquisitions or not, that's something we'll continue looking for. But right now, we're just going to focus on integrating this one well.","Curtis E. Espeland","And Mike, I might also add from a financial perspective, this is the kind of deal we like as well. It's got an attractive ROIC. It's going to be accretive in 2014. It's going to be -- when you include synergies in '15, it's going to be high single-digit kind of accretion. So really nice strategic and financial deal. And we really look forward to working with BP to close this deal up.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Single-digit EPS is what you...","Curtis E. Espeland","Single-digit EPS, just to be clear, yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Are your discussions to sell part of your cracker capacity on hold until after the pipeline issues are resolved?","Curtis E. Espeland","This is Curt. As you recall, we are exploring options for monetizing our excess ethylene position. And we previously stated that there are various contractions and other complexities that are involved in the process. In July of 2012, Eastman initiated a challenge before the Texas Railroad Commission because of the change made by Westlake to the tariff for its Longview, Mont Belvieu common carrier ethylene pipeline. Just to give an update, on January 7, the Texas Railroad Commission actually ruled it had the authority to hear Eastman's entire challenge of the Westlake's July 2013 tariff change to the common carrier pipeline. And if you recall, that was affecting rate, bidirectional flow and swaps. So on the same day, the case hearings officer then put Westlake's July tariff change on hold pending resolution of Eastman's challenge. So we're hoping to have a hearing in the next 2 to 3 months and remain confident our challenge to Westlake's proposed tariff, we feel good with our position. But on the question itself, yes, we're still exploring options with various parties. But until this matter is resolved, it's going to take us a while to get this thing concluded.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And as a follow-up here, Westlake has a project to convert its propane cracker to ethane. Their capital cost, I think, is like $140 million. Could we prorate that across your capacity to get an estimate of what it might cost to convert your facilities?","Curtis E. Espeland","So I think you have to look at different cracker operations, the scale of our operations because there are different type of crackers, quite honestly.","Mark J. Costa","Yes. I wouldn't do that because all these crackers are very different beasts.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I was interested in your choice not to pursue the Perennial Wood initiative. Would you give us some color as to -- I know you said the economics weren't favorable. But would you give us some color as to what you saw specifically? Was the market not as big? Was it too -- did it cost too much to produce? And then given that you're not pursuing it, what type of benefit should we see from the freed-up investment?","Mark J. Costa","Yes. Perennial Wood is probably one of the most frustrating growth platforms I've had to manage in that it was extremely successful from a market point of view but economically not viable. So the market loved the product. We had a great interest and strong adoption-building in the marketplace and it was performing well. But when it really came down to understanding the economics from the price of the raw material to deliver the quality that the market wanted and the yields of the process, the economics were just challenged and it was going to take too long to get to meaningful earnings for our shareholders to continue the venture. So long term, maybe we could have got there, but it just was going to take too long.","Curtis E. Espeland","As it relates to your question around just the impact on that other segment, where it reflects our investments. We -- I think the number is about $74 million investment or loss, however you want to characterize it, in 2013. The impact of this is probably $5 million to $10 million net of some of the other growth investments we're making. And that number will range based on how successful we are with the speed of those other initiatives.","Mark J. Costa","One of the challenges we have is making sure that we always devote our R&D and SG&A efforts to the best growth portfolio. And we have a very robust growth portfolio right now. And so we're shifting a bunch of these resources to higher-value opportunities.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Understood. And then another ethylene question. I believe in 2013, you had locked in maybe 50% of your margins on the ethylene side. Did that hurt you at all this year? And are you going to do the same thing next year or choose to not lock in those margins?","Curtis E. Espeland","So as it relates to 2013, I would say what it did was actually probably a slight hurt. But what it actually did is smooth out the earnings profile associated with that revenue during the course of the year. As it relates to 2014, we do not have that kind of hedge in place.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from James Sheehan of SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you could quantify the impact on 2014 from the technology licensing?","Curtis E. Espeland","We have not had provided that. We're still in negotiations with different parties on different licensings. But it's a component of that $0.50 to $0.75. And we'll let you know more as we're successful with that effort.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks again for joining us this morning.

This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, www.eastman.com. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. ","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory Riddle","Okay. Thank you, Ebony. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jake LaRoe, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's second quarter 2019 financial results news release, during this call and in the accompanying slides, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for 2018, the Form 10-Q for first quarter 2019 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for second quarter 2019.","Second, earnings referenced in this presentation excludes certain non-core and unusual items and interim period earnings using adjusted forecasted tax rate. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the second quarter 2019 financial results news release, which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings exclude any non-core, unusual or non-recurring items","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin on page three. I'll start with the strategic highlights from second quarter. We continued on our path of solid sequential earnings growth after a challenging fourth quarter of 2018 and start to this year.","Adjusted EBIT increased 11% sequentially in the face of continued global uncertainty and weak underlying demand in many of our end markets.","From our perspective, the uncertainty around trade began in the fourth quarter of last year and was escalated in May, and has resulted in a challenging global macroeconomic environment which we're continuing to work through.","Despite these challenges, we're still on track for greater than $400 million in new business revenue closes from renovation in 2019, with a 27% growth in the second quarter year-over-year.","I've been on the road globally with many of our customers recently and their focus on strong engagement with us on innovation has never been higher, especially on sustainability which is encouraging in this environment.","Leading the charge on innovation and market development is Advanced Materials, which posted excellent sequential growth in the second quarter. The sequential growth was delivered by specialty plastics, led by Tritan.","We also offset the underlying decline in the auto market with strong growth in premium products, like our paint protection film, premium auto inner layers as well as strong growth in architectural inner layers. These products, among others, show the resiliency of our innovation model as they offset general macroeconomic weakness.","I should note that we're also making great progress on innovation initiatives in Additives & Functional Products with commercial orders confirming the value in what we do. That said, we're in a much earlier stage of development in AFP than in AM.","As we discussed before, we're aggressively managing costs in this challenging business environment. Overall, we're reducing costs by $120 million. That includes $80 million in offsets of inflation.","In addition, in this environment, we have another $40 million in cost actions that we took in April that will mostly impact the second half of the year, which we're on track to deliver. ","Consistent with our strategy to remain disciplined on capital deployment, we recently completed a small bolt-on acquisition of INACSA, a Spanish cellulosic yarn company that will accelerate the growth of our textiles innovation products like Naia. We're excited to have the INACSA team as part of Eastman and the integration is off to a great start.","Lastly, we returned $423 million to stockholders in the first six months of 2019 through a combination of share repurchases and an increasing dividend. This included $125 million of share repurchases in the second quarter.","Before I turn over to Curt for a review of the corporate and segment performance in the quarter, I'd like to add proud I am of our employees around the world who continue to execute our strategy, while also aggressively managing costs in this challenging environment. Curt?","Curt Espeland ","Thanks, Mark. And good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide four with a review of our corporate results and I'll begin with the sequential comparison where our second quarter revenue declined slightly and adjusted EBIT increased 11%.","The increase in earnings was driven by a strong sequential volume and mix growth in Advanced Materials and continued cost management across the company.","On a corporate basis, EBIT increased 170 basis points sequentially, with the margin increasing in all segments except chemical intermediates.","Turning next to the year-over-year comparison, revenue and earnings decreased as macroeconomic uncertainty and the slower demand in some of our key end markets in China and Europe, both of which we believe are primarily related to global trade issues, negatively impacted volume and mix.","The decrease was also attributed to an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates and a decline in spreads for some chemical intermediate products.","Before I get to the segments, I'll give your macroeconomic assumptions for the remainder of the year, which have changed. We're now expecting current challenging global market conditions to continue, driven by uncertainty around trade issues. ","And just to be clear, we are not expecting underlying macroeconomic conditions to improve or deteriorate from what we experienced in the second quarter. We do believe that inventory destocking is mostly behind us and, therefore, our specialty volumes will grow, but will be modestly offset by higher shutdown schedule in second half of 2019 impacting volumes in chemical intermediates.","And we are expecting oil prices and the related raw materials to remain around current levels, which will be a benefit to second half as those lower costs flow through inventory.","Turning now to slide five and Advance Materials where significant progress on innovation and market development is positioning us to be resilient despite the challenging global economy.","Starting with the sequential comparison, volume and mix increased 7% due to an easing of customer destocking, particularly with specially plastic product lines such as Tritan, and continued great progress on innovation and market development.","Adjusted EBIT increased 42% sequentially, with roughly two-thirds of the increase driven by improved volume and mix and the remainder from a combination of impproved spreads as lower cost paraxylene is beginning to flow through and cost management. And the EBIT margin increased 530 basis points sequentially given these factors plus improved fixed cost leverage.","Turning to the year-over-year comparison, revenue declined due to lower sales volume and the stronger dollar. While we had strong volume growth sequentially as destocking slowed, we still haven't reached our year ago volume levels due to the weakness in global demand related to the trade issues.","One market in particular that has been under pressure is transportation, which represents about a third of the revenue for this segment. ","Despite this exposure, EBIT increased as improved mixed due to strong growth of premium products, including paint protection film and acoustic and architectural inner layers more than offset the lower volume and the impact of the stronger dollar.","Advanced Materials also did a nice job holding on to prices and managing their costs. The EBIT margin year-over-year was 110 basis points.","Looking ahead, we expect earnings in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half for a few reasons. First, lower cost raw materials are set to flow-through in the back half of the year.","Second, while we don't project underlying demand fundamentals to improve in the second half of the year, destocking looks like it is mostly behind us and is therefore no longer expected to be a headwind.","And third, we expect to realize lower costs from the actions we have taken.","When we put it all together, we expect Advanced Materials EBIT to be up mid-single digits for the year, which would be an outstanding result in this environment.","Turning next to Additives & Functional Products on slide six. Adjusted EBIT was a solid \u2013 at $147 million, relatively flat from the first quarter as we saw stability in volume mix with a modest decline in prices, prices offset by cost actions. Year-over-year revenue declined due to lower volume and mix as well as lower selling prices and an unfavorable currency.","The volume and mix decline was about two-thirds unit volume and one-third mix. Volume growth in care chemicals and architectural coatings was more than offset by declines in adhesives and tires and some consumer discretionary markets.","In particular, China and Europe have slowed due to the anxiety caused by global trade issues, particularly the US\/China dispute.","At the same time, we believe destocking that began in the fourth quarter continued through the second quarter. As we look forward, we believe that destocking should mostly be behind us, so volume should improve in second half of 2019.","Mix was unfavorable, primarily due to lower sales of high-value cellulosic additives into the auto OEM markets in China and Europe compared to the prior-year, which quite honestly was a tough comp.","Pricing was somewhat lower, with the largest contributor being cost passed through contracts in care chemicals and a few other products, with the remainder due to competitive rivalry in adhesives and tire additives. ","And the impact of swine fever in China increased competitive rivalry in the animal nutrition business in the second quarter. ","EBIT declined year-over-year due to the lower volume and mix as well as a stronger dollar, partially offset by continued cost management. Spreads were similar to last year as lower raw material costs were offset by price declines. With spreads stable, the entirety of the margin decline in AFP is due to lower asset utilization related to sluggish demand.","Looking forward, given our economic assumptions, we expect EBIT in the second half of the year to increase slightly versus the first half due to higher volume as we believe the destocking is mostly behind us.","On slide seven, I'll move to Chemical Intermediates. Year-over-year revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices for olefins and acetyls products resulting from raw material price declines and increased competitive activity. ","As the trade dispute continues to drag out, competitors in China are getting increasingly aggressive and are starting to try to place volume outside of Asia, particularly in Europe, causing additional competitive rivalry.","In addition, sales revenue was impacted by lower functional needs product sales volume attributed to weakened demand in agricultural end markets due in part to wet weather in North America.","EBIT decreased slightly as lower spreads were mostly offset by lower costs. These lower costs included the supplier operational disruptions in the second quarter of 2018 not recurring this year, lower planned maintenance costs in the quarter and continued cost management.","Looking to the back half of the year, we are seeing spreads in acetyls and glycols stabilizing at second quarter levels and we expect to carry this run rate into the remainder of the year. And consistent with our corporate guidance, we're not projecting an improvement in underlying demand in the back half.","The stabilized, but lower spreads, coupled with higher shutdowns scheduled in the second half of the year compared to the first, led us to expect that EBIT in the second half will be lower than the first half.","Finishing up the segment reviews on slide eight with Fibers. Starting with the sequential comparison, sales revenue was flat, while adjusted EBIT increased $9 million or 21%.","The sequential increase was due primarily to cost management and slightly higher tow sales. And I'd add that the EBIT margin increased 420 basis points sequentially to 24%. ","Year-over-year, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower acetate tow sales volume attributed to weakened market demand resulting from global trade-related pressures and general market decline.","In addition, demand in 2018 was unusually high in the first half of the year due to trade issues and multinational customers' buying patterns.","EBIT decreased due to lower acetate tow sales volume, partially offset by lower raw material costs and continued cost management.","As we move into the second half of the year, we expect earnings improvement compared to the first half for a few reasons. First, we continue to make progress qualifying tow at our Korean facility with CNTC. And as a result, we expect improved Chinese demand for the remainder of the year.","Second, the overall textile market was soft in the first half due to general macro uncertainty resulting in destocking for some of the traditional end market applications. We see signs that the dynamic is improving in the second half and will continue to benefit from greater than 25% growth in our textiles innovation initiatives.","And finally, we continue to aggressively manage costs in this business. ","Putting it altogether, including the promised improvement in the second half, we expect Fibers adjusted EBIT to be in the $200 million to $200 million [ph] range for full year of 2019.","Finally, on slide nine, I'll cover some financial highlights. First of all, let me just correct the EBIT for Fibers will be the $200 million to $210 million range. Thank you.","Finally, on slide nine, I'll cover some financial highlights. We plan to continue our track record of solid free cash flow conversion and expect to generate free cash flow approaching $1.1 billion in 2019.","Despite lower projected net income, we remain confident in our ability to generate solid free cash flow through a variety of levers, including aggressive working capital management.","Consistent with our capital deployment, we have remained disciplined in our allocation of cash, including returning $423 million to stockholders in the first six months of 2019. ","We're excited about the value creation from our recent two bolt-on acquisitions, first in the first quarter and the last one that Mark mentioned here in July, and continue to look forward to value-creating opportunities.","Consistent with previous expectations, we'll delever as needed to keep our solid investment grade credit rating, likely in the $250 million to $300 million range this year. ","For corporate other, consistent with the run rate in the first half, we expect the full year to be around $60 million.","And finally, we continue to expect our full-year projected tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. ","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Costa ","Thanks, Curt. On slide 10, I'll provide an update on our 2019 outlook. In the first half of the year, we've been challenged by a weak macroeconomic environment which began in the fourth quarter of 2018.","We believe it's primarily caused by global trade tensions, including the US and China trades dispute. Dispute was escalated in May and there are no signs of when it will be resolved.","The impact has been significant destocking across supply chains as well as reduced demand and we've seen this most prominently in China and Europe. In particular, we have seen a meaningful impact on consumer discretionary markets like autos and consumer durables, especially in China and Europe.","We've also seen challenges in ag and animal nutrition end markets with weather and the swine flu in China. ","This is all much different than what we had expected in our last call in April. And I would add, this dynamic environment has made order patterns more volatile and the outlook for global demand more opaque. And we expect the lower volume will continue to negatively impact fixed cost leverage in back half of the year. ","With that said, we're taking actions on what we can control to offset the impact of this environment. We continue to make significant progress driving growth in our new business revenue closes from innovation as we leverage our innovation-driven growth model.","You're seeing how this works with the first half results of Advance Materials and our expectations for the year in this business, which reflect a strong contribution for new business revenue closes from motivation to offset weakness in key end markets like autos.","And I'm confident you'll see accelerating new business revenue growth in AFP that will add to their resiliency as we scale up their innovations in the future. ","In addition, we're aggressively managing costs in this business environment by taking out $120 million of cost to deliver a net $40 million reduction in costs.","Finally, we're expecting lower-cost raw materials to flow through into our results in the second half, improving spreads over last year in the specialty businesses.","As we think about Q3, we have an unusually high shutdown schedule, the potential for a limited amount of additional destocking and we can all recognize the exceptionally uncertain environment we live in today. So, expect Q3 will be similar to Q2 in EPS and you will not see the normal drop in Q4. ","When I put this all together, we expect our full-year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.50 to $8 a share. And this includes a headwind of about $0.50 a share from currency and pension.","On cash, we expect our free cash flow to approach $1.1 billion as we take actions to generate cash in this environment.","Given the challenges we're facing, I view these as solid results and, again, a testament to the resiliency of our business model and the execution of our team.","It's this robustness that gives me confidence in our future. Despite the exceptionally challenging environment, we're well-positioned for long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation from our owners and all of our stakeholders.","Our results demonstrate that our innovation-driven growth model is delivering as we create our own growth through innovation and leadership in specialty markets. We continue to win with customers every day. An as I saw on my travels around the world recently, we have unparalleled engagement levels with our customers to innovate, a hallmark of what differentiates us.","Our focus on what we can control is working as we continue to reduce our costs to accelerate topline growth to the bottom line.","And most important, we have the dedication and drive of people of Eastman who rise to the challenge every day and prove that they want to win no matter what the headwinds are. [indiscernible] and the reason we're winning with so many customers today. In the end, it's our collective determination in the face of challenges that make me so confident in our future.","With that, I'll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Riddle ","Thank you, Mark. There a lot of people on the line as usual this morning. And we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. So, I ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, Ebony, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess my question is just \u2013 as we exit 2019 and if we assume there's some trade resolution hypothetically for the start of 2020, should we envision a snapback in earnings, sort of 2019 is a throwaway year and 2020 goes back to the trend rate you were on before then? Or should we think about 2019 being a new base off of there will be some level of growth in 2020?","Mark Costa","So, first of all, I think it's a little hard to predict 2020 at this point. But to answer your question, the challenges that we have predominantly this year, fourth quarter last year as well as this year, are a volume mix based story. And it's important to emphasize the mix part of this too because a lot of the consumer discretionary markets that we sell to are very high value additives.","So, if the trade war gets resolved or stimulus in China works despite a neutral trade situation that starts getting the business confidence and China confidence back up that drives China growth back into gear, which also will improve European economy as well in a substantial way, you would get a snapback. You'll get not just volume recovery in primary demand, but restocking associated with people going back to more normal inventory levels compared to where they are now, which is exceptionally low. And it's a mirror image. The earnings on the volume mix side come back the same way they have dropped this year. So, you would get a very good recovery on that front, on the volume mix side. We, obviously, have taken costs out, and so you get the fixed cost leverage that comes with that as well as you go into next year.","On spreads, though, I would assume spreads stay relatively neutral because, in a recovering economy, raws will go up and we'll increase prices to keep up with raws like we did last year. So, it will still be a volume mix story just on the other side.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And, Curt, if I could just ask you on the cash flow, obviously, very strong performance year-to-date despite the earnings challenges. When you talk about improved working capital performance, should we be thinking that the work you're doing this year is going to lead to sustainably different or better working capital ratios that we can build into next year? Or are these just extraordinary efforts you're making this year given the challenging macro circumstances?","Curt Espeland","Thanks, Vince. What you see right now is our free cash flow has been kind of running similar to last year. And again, we've got a lot of talented people helping us manage cash flow across the company.","What I'd say is, on the working capital side, we'll be aggressive. Normally, we'd see working capital relief second half of the year. In addition, you're getting some benefit to the flow-through of low raw material value. So, that's helping. And then, we are taking some additional steps to address our working capital across different fronts, multiple fronts, quite honestly. And so, yes, I would expect that to improve some of our working capital statistics. And I would say that's not an improvement this year. I think it's a multiyear effort as well that will help contribute to, again, a wonderful free cash flow story with our business. Which, following up on Mark's other question, we'd also expect our free cash flow to improve in that kind of environment as well. And so, I love the free cash flow of this company that reflects the quality of our businesses. And that free cash flow is coming to you [indiscernible] at a free cash flow yield approaching 10%.","Mark Costa","Yeah. I would just add on that, on Curt's comment on the 2020. Not only do you get the earnings back when the demand recovers and the cash comes with it, you also pull inventory down in that environment. So, it can be quite strong.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Your sales were down in the United States in the second quarter year-over-year. Why was that? What's shrinking in the US and what's growing?","Curt Espeland","Sure, Jeff. The principal driver of the drop in revenue in the US is pricing in Chemical Intermediates. You have to remember that, unlike many other companies out there, the predominance of our Chemical Intermediates business is located in North America. And so, the vast majority of the revenue and the price decline is reflected there. The good news is we also don't face the \u2013 much more competitive dynamics in Asia or Europe for those kind of products where the prices are even much lower than where we are today. So, that's part of the story. And then, demand just a bit off with some destocking and careful behavior, as well as things like the wet weather in ag that's driven that revenue down with the planting season being curtailed.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay. And, secondly, perhaps I missed it in your discussion. So, so far Fiber's demand this year is down 11% roughly or 8% in volume terms. What's behind that? And was that your outlook at the beginning of the year?","Mark Costa","The outlook was for the first half to be challenged on volume relative to the second half. So, that was our outlook. This is playing out as we expected. It's really about timing of orders in two fronts, Jeff. So, on the customer buying patterns of the big multinationals, 2018 first half was just exceptionally high relative to second half of last year. There just tends to be chunkiness in how they order and that's what was the pattern last year. Amnd then, on top of that, you had some trade-related issues as well that drove some prebuy in Q2, not in China, but in some other countries worried about trade that pre-bought around trade uncertainty. And then, you had, of course, good orders in China in the first half of the year for tow imports that dropped pretty significantly as we went into the second half. So, it's all a timing issue. So, what you'll see is we had these two \u2013 the first half drop and then the second half will be some improvement over last year.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much. ","Operator","Our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Mark, in AF&P, given the challenged results in the first half of the year and the full year, any concerns that this business may not be as special as perhaps you thought it might be?","Mark Costa","I was guessing that question might come this morning. No, I'm not concerned about this specialty nature of this business. Let's just start off with the fact that, in Q2, which was, obviously, a challenging quarter for us, we had 25% EBITDA margins, which I think demonstrate very high-quality earnings. But much more importantly, you've got to decompose into its components to really understand what's going on.","So, first of all, the price side of the equation, which I think is the bigger test than the volume question, around the specialty nature of business, I think we're actually doing quite well on managing price here. So, when you look at a price decline of 3%, half of that, as we told you, is cost pass-through contracts, predominantly in care chemicals and a few other products. So, the spreads are absolutely stable and we're driving good volume growth in those product areas. But there is so much volatility on the raws on those those specific products. We neutralize that volatility with the CPG.","The other half is competitive pressure. So, we're talking about a 1.5% decline here year-over-year due to some competitive factors. And in that, there is really sort of three stories, but the underlying story is the same at a high level in all three. So, you've got some pressure. And insoluble sulfur in tires, you have some pressure in adhesive resins and a few animal nutrition products.","And if you look at the last decade, we've always had tremendous growth in China leading the world in growth. And as you look at these product areas, we're running out of capacity in all of them because demand was so strong globally that we added capacity to serve growth in these areas and our competitors did too. So, you certainly have this capacity being added in the last year to support growth as the markets were tight. At the same time, for the first time in the last decade, we've had a big drop in demand in China. So, you have a competitive situation.","But the good news about all three of those things is there's strong underlying growth. There's a long-term belief that China is going to grow as a market beyond what's going on here in the short term. And importantly, and key to our strategy, unlike our competitors in these specific areas, is that we have innovation strategies to extend and add more differentiation and growth to these businesses. ","So, in all three, we've launched a new Crystex Cure Pro product that demonstrates far superior mixing efficiency to our competitors. Product trials going on everywhere, getting orders, but it's early. Same thing in adhesives. Very strong underlying market growth in hygiene and other products that will absorb the capacity over time, [indiscernible] packaging, tapes, labels right now, creating some demand space. But, more importantly, we're adding a new no odor, no volatile organic product that is a significant differentiator. There's very high demand. It'll be online by the end of this year. Same thing on animal nutrition. We're moving from just selling to organic acids into formulated products and have tremendous growth there.","So, well, the timing is not great. If this had happened \u2013 this trade war had happened two years from now into the future, it would look more like AM. These products would all be in market, having a lot more traction, helping offset some of the underlying demand problem.","So, net, spreads are flat. We don't have spread compression in this segment. But some of the raw material tailwind has been offset by some of these prices. The key here is the volume mix story. And as Curt mentioned, the volume parts, the unit volumes that are coming off, principally because of demand, and then you've got the mix story with cellulosic additives and few other high margin additives. So, it's a volume mix story. So, negative fixed cost leverage that comes with that. And that's the entirety of the margin percent story. So, we don't think this is commoditizing.","David Begleiter","Very helpful. And, Curt, just on the shutdown costs in Q3, could you qualify those versus Q2?","Curt Espeland","Yeah. What I'd say, just in general, on shutdown costs as a whole, they're only modestly higher year-over-year, but the trend of the shutdown costs are different. Over the last couple of years, we've had the higher shutdown costs in second quarter and fourth quarter. This year, it's more going to be in third quarter and fourth quarter. So, that sequential year-over-year impact on third quarter is going to be just over $30 million higher shutdown costs third quarter of this year compared to third quarter of last year. Now, what that means is you won't have \u2013 last couple of years, you had had more headwind from third quarter going into fourth quarter, but this year the shutdown costs will be roughly the same third quarter and fourth quarter.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. In tire additives market, could you describe what's happening with demand there? And also, could you tell us whether pricing continues to come down or has stabilized after the recent declines?","Mark Costa","So, on the demand side, this actually predates the Trump initiated China-US trade dispute. There was a number of anti-dumping duties put in place by Europe and the US on truck tires that dramatically constrained where the Chinese tire producers could sell their products, backing up a lot of that production into China. Helped the multinationals and we've benefited from that in North America and Europe. But, obviously, China is a huge tire production market and that got very competitive when those companies didn't have any market access.","And the market has been growing really fast. So, not only did tire companies add a lot of capacity to support this growth that they were expecting that did not materialize, we have some competitors who are also adding capacity to sort of serve that growth. So, that really is the story on the demand side. And, overall, market is obviously down. The truck tire market is off with lower commercial activity, the OEM production market is off. But it's important remember that 75% of tires are replacement as opposed to new production. But it's still connected to commercial activity. And we're highly levered to commercial activity. And our product that we sell, our largest product, insoluble sulfur, so when that comes off, you're going to feel that demand hit.","On the price side, I think prices have come off due to the competitive dynamics we've described. It appears to stabilize in the second quarter. From what we can see, demand is going to improve as we work through this destocking as we go into the back half of the year.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you. And as a follow-up, on amines, you mentioned a few challenges with demand. How is your inventory in amines and how is the inventory across the industry?","Mark Costa","Well, I can't speak to the industry. I would say what you have across many of our businesses, whether it's amines or others, we've kind of got our production planning for an improvement for the second half of the year versus the first. And so, now, we're just adjusting operating rates where some areas weren't as strong including amines, where you didn't have that seasonal improvement in demand as much as we had hoped given the weather. But we're managing our inventory and operations as we adjust to demand as we do across all our portfolio.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you.","Operator","Moving next Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning. First question just around the cost cutting program, you had the net $40 million in kind of before things got worse than you expected. Should we expect another major program in the back half of the year or early next year if these conditions continue?","Curt Espeland","So, as we look at our cost structure, obviously, we saw some uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment back in April and we took additional actions to cut costs. $40 million is on top of the $80 million to offset inflation is a pretty aggressive program. We don't think there's another step of additional costs that we're going to take in this current economic environment. That's substantial. We're obviously going to manage costs aggressively wherever we can. But we have a tremendous amount of growth we have in innovation. We have tremendous engagement in customers that we have to serve. We have to maintain and run our plants reliably in this environment. And I think we're getting to that point. And we're one of the lowest cost investigative [ph] R&D as a percentage of sales in the industry for the kind of innovation we are doing. We're in the bottom quartile. So, I think we've always run our company very efficiently.","Now, obviously, if we go into a bigger, more significant drop in demand due to a global recession kind of environment, we will have additional actions we can take in cutting costs because we have a good amount of variable cost in our large integrated plants and how we run them over time and contractors.","Duffy Fischer","Thank you. And then, just on your commentary that Q3 looks like Q2, so right at $2 a share, and then to get to the midpoint of your annual guidance, that would be about $2 a share then in the fourth quarter, which is up almost 45% year-on-year. Can you either walk from Q3 into Q4, how you keep things flat; or Q4 over Q4, how you would improve it 40%? Why does fourth quarter look so much different than it has historically?","Mark Costa","Yeah. It first starts with why is Q3 so different. And then I think it's easier to talk about Q4. So, in Q3, we do expect improvement to be sequentially strong from Q2 to Q3, but it's been offset due to the higher shutdown schedule. Normally, high shutdowns in Q2 and Q4. This year is just different where we have a large cracker that we're taking down and a bunch of other shutdowns that we're doing in Q3. So, you've got this headwind from Q2 to Q3. And on a year-over-year basis, as Curt noted, about $30 million difference versus last year in Q3 due to that shutdown schedule.","Now, we're taking overall costs down just to be clear. It's a timing issue about when costs show up and you have these period of costs with the shutdown in Q3. So, as you go to Q4, you would normally have this headwind. It was roughly $30 million last year from Q3 to Q4 that knocks earnings down sequentially Q3 to Q4. You're not going to have that this year, so that's part of the explanation. You don't have that headwind.","Second, Q4, I think is not going to be your typical Q4. You've got innovation, market development that's continuing to drive growth and create growth, which is great, that will help have volume be better. You have companies that are already destocked to some degree. There still be volume lower in Q4 versus Q3 due to seasonal patterns, but probably not as much destocking as normal.","You've got costs flowing through on raw materials. And because volume hasn't been as strong, taking longer for that to flow through, but it will certainly start showing up in Q4 as we look at it, as well as the manufacturing cost reductions flowing through. And we're a LIFO accounting shop, to keep in mind. So, you had all these dynamics playing on that allowed Q4 to be quite good.","And if you're comparing it specifically to last year, you've got to remember that, last year, it was a really easy comp. It was extremely \u2013 not only did you have the $30 million headwind and shutdowns from Q3 to Q4 last year, you had dramatic reduction in plant rates to adjust to the destocking and volume drops last year and high cost raws flowing through last year versus this year of low cost raws flowing through. So, all that combines together to give us confidence about how we're guiding.","Curt Espeland","And if I could just add, the sequential impact of those shutdown impacts, second quarter to third is roughly $20 million compared to that $30 million year-over-year period [indiscernible].","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jim Sheehan","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, longer term, I think you planned for innovation-led business model to lift your gross margins higher than they are today. Where are your gross margins per unit tracking and how do you plan to improve that metric over the next 12 months?","Curt Espeland","Well, you can see, at our Innovation Day, we talked about a growing EBITDA margin. We're probably a couple percentage points below that. Part of that's going to be that volume mix because we're not getting all these specialty business sales that we premised back [ph] at our Innovation Day. And that's just because of the macroeconomic environment. So, I still believe we can get back to those margins that we talked about at our Innovation Day across our portfolio. Part of that is again getting those specialty sales back to where we think they're going to be, and that was to one of the earlier comments today, getting back to what a more robust economy would support.","And on top of it is the fixed cost leverage you get across the portfolio because, with Mark, we've added some areas of new capacity. We have room to grow into those and then just \u2013 we have an environment where it's kind of sluggish. But once we get back on track in those specialty areas, you're going to love the fixed cost leverage we're going to get in both Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products.","Mark Costa","I just want to add. Mix is an incredibly powerful tool in the center and heart of our strategy. So, as we're growing high margin products through innovation, above segment and company average in AM and AFP, you just get a powerful lift in your margin. And you see that in how AM recovered from Q1 to Q2 and how it's going to deliver earnings growth for the full year. But, unfortunately, if you have a demand contraction like AFP has right now, you're going to feel that mix hit. And, really, in Q2, it was really substantial. The cellulose additives that we sell and a few of these other additives that go into automotive market are very high value, and so we really felt that mix hit to this year and last year \u2013 Curt mentioned there was a tough comp. Last year wasn't just demand that was good. We also had some prebuys associated with sort of trade fear in China and some restocking with the coal gas event in Q2. So, it was really tough comp for that specific area inside AFP versus last year.","Jim Sheehan","Great. And in adhesive resins, you've been talking about competitive pressure in that market for quite some time. When do you expect to see an easing in the general market conditions and also when do you expect your low VOC product to start gaining traction and we start seeing better numbers in that business?","Mark Costa","So, I think 2019 is the year where things are bottoming out. It's really hard to call the quarter on it, but prices have stabilized. The demand situation is great in hygiene, which continues to drive growth and absorb capacity. But a few of the other markets that are more packaging, tapes, labels, things like that, is obviously more caught up in the macro environment and demand is off, which will obviously, I think, stabilize and get better as we move forward. So, I think it's playing out this year.","When it comes to the innovation products, there are two sets of innovation products. Directly in resins, we have this low volatile product that has been verified by our customers to be the best in the market. We're getting all the trials going on now. Pl;ants being modified to be able to make it. The good news is it's just a modification of existing asset. We don't have to build a new plant. So, we'll be online selling that product next year and that will really help.","We also have great success in polyolefin. So, we make some amorphous polyolefins for this market, having great growth. Not a new area for us that we haven't been in and we're really getting a lot of adoption on some new products there that dramatically improve the hot-melt adhesives for hygiene and some other applications. So, several avenues of growth to stabilize and grow that business while we work through this new capacity in the market.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.","PJ Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","PJ Juvekar","So, you mentioned that due to the weakness in China, producers there are getting more aggressive and placing product in Europe. Can you talk about what products or what chains is this occurring in? And is that a long-term trend you see or is this something near term, short term because of weakness in China?","Mark Costa","So, the example I think would be adhesives where you see some of that capacity in Asia getting placed in Europe that was intended to support growth in China. So, that would be an example. Animal nutrition will be the other example where you have a bunch of capacity that was added in China to serve animal nutrition. And then, with the swine population being decimated in China, people are looking for another home for that. None of these actually create long-term concern for us, PJ, because obviously the Chinese have to eat, and so they're going to grow more pigs and absorb that capacity again. And same thing is true about hygiene growth and everything else. Adhesives, as that demand recovers, it'll start absorbing it back into China.","Now, that applies to the rest of the story. We've just never been through \u2013 the industry has never been through a story where China is the problem. They've been the source of growth to absorb capacity being added in Asia as well as other markets, and now they're not, so that just creates a different dynamic.","PJ Juvekar","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. And then, a quick question for Curt. Curt, you talked about doing bolt-on M&A, like you did in the first half. Has there been any change in valuations of deals you're looking at given the downturn? And would you say that \u2013 would you look at deals more abroad given you're more of a heavy footprint in the US? Thank you.","Curt Espeland","Yeah. Thanks for the question. No, we're excited about again the bolt-ons we've completed so far this year. Good businesses. Great people. Nice synergies. All the things we look for in acquisitions. We continue to have an active pipeline. I won't say our activity is increasing because multiple is coming down because we've always been a disciplined party. Maybe it's a contributing factor. We're able to get deals done more. But the businesses we've been talking to have had reasonable valuation expectations. And so, to the extent the market is more conducive to reasonable multiples, we'll continue to increase our activity. When I think about the rest of this year, just to kind of level set that, we're continuing to be active. I've mentioned some amount of acquisitions we can do, roughly $100 million this year. It's possible. But, right now, we have nothing imminent in our portfolio on acquisitions, but we're still actively working our pipeline and we'll continue to be disciplined as you've seen over the years with our acquisition strategy.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","Hi. Good morning, folks. Eastman started to see a return in rush orders in the May and early June timeframe, which kind of indicated that business was getting a bit better and there was no inventory at the customer levels and EPS growth for 2019 was very much still on the table. So, I'm curious what have you specifically seen since the mid-June till today timeframe to take any EPS growth off the table.","Mark Costa ","Sure, Frank. Yes, it's obviously been a pretty dynamic time and predicting demand and orders has been tricky for a while now. In the second quarter, we were on track up through the first week of June with demand, the trends that we saw that we thought were in the range that we gave you in April. And then, in the last two weeks of June, we just saw a dramatic slowdown relative to what should have been a normal order pattern in June leading up to the G20 meeting.","So, from what I can figure out, people got very nervous about what's going to happen in that meeting and they all decided to start managing inventory down and reducing their orders given that risk. And we actually saw the exact same thing in the last two weeks of February, headed up to the March 1 deadline when people were worried about the US tariff.","So, I think there is this sort of push pull kind of thing around economic uncertainty that's driving some behavior. And so, that was part of it. There's no question that we saw \u2013 there was more risk on the table after the May escalation in the trade war. And that risk, as you got through G20, got confirmed that there was no end in sight about this trade war, and now at a higher level of tariffs and more disagreement than less, certainly from where we saw the world in April on how this was going to get settled.","So, as you as you look to that, we had to step back and revise our macroeconomic assumptions. I think everyone in April thought, and through the beginning of May at least, that the economy was going to get better in the back half of the year, trade war was going to sort of settle, certainly not escalate. And now we're in just a very different world. I don't think that's true and I think many of our peers and other people and the macro data support that. There's not a lot of signs of economic recovery coming in the second half. So, we had to revise our assumption down on that. ","And it's not just about China. When you think about that, Europe is highly dependent on trade to China and there's other factors, obviously, going on in Europe. So, that economy has slowed down. That's led to a lot of destocking and expectation of lower demand, automotive and other consumer discretionary markets taking the primary hit as people are cautious. ","Reality is, if you look at the last three quarters, you can say we're in an industrial recession now. Industrial production is down. Even in AFP, as I look at the demand story there, third of it's mix and the other part being unit volume. We're not really losing much share. Maybe 1% of that 8% is about share loss in these competitive stories I was just telling. Demand is down even in AFP. If you look at all of our peers who are industrial exposed, we're in a negative demand situation. So, that's the kind of environment we now have to adjust to. We thought it would stabilize and get better and we've revised our assumption. ","Now, obviously, if the economy gets better, so will our results, but that's what we're operating under and then you've got some additional things like this ag and animal nutrition story as well. So, that's really sort of what drove our reduction, combined with spreads being a little more challenged in CI than we had expected that we'd expect to sort of continue at this level going forward. We don't think it will get worse, but we don't see why it would get better.","Frank Mitsch","That's very helpful, Mark. And, Curt, the company has been doing a nice job in its $125 million per quarter pace on share buybacks. Are there any factors that might influence either up or down or should we really anticipate Eastman continuing on that pace?","Curt Espeland","As we know, capital allocation is dedicated and committed to a lot of different areas. One of those is also debt repaydown, that $215 million to $300 million level. Share repurchases will be pretty disciplined. The only thing that could adjust it, if we do an acquisition, that will come out of that share repurchase bucket. So, you can do the math off that, Frank. We typically do a pretty average \u2013 dollar average growth throughout the year.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thank you. I think I saw some IHS data that said cigarette demand in China was up 6% to 7% year-to-date. I guess people maybe smoke a little bit more in a weaker economic or in a more uncertain environment. So, do you think that's correct? And maybe could you reconcile the outlook for your business?","Mark Costa","Sure. So, as you know, since 2014 and now, there's been a dramatic drop in the amount of imports into China. And we do have a JV in China. It's running full and making good profits, to the story of the demand you're talking about. But total imports into China now are just incredibly low in total compared to where we were. So, the growth that you're talking about is being served by plants owned by CNTC in China.","And then on top of it was the trade war. We're not seeing that benefit in the last three quarters because the CNTC chose not to buy from plants in the US. Now, we'll get some of that demand back and benefit from some of the story you're talking about as we get the Korea plant qualified into the back half of this year, but that's really sort of the difference.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Moving next to Mike Sisson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Mike Sisson","Hi, guys. Mark, if you think about the earnings reduction from April, it's about $1.10 from FX, a little bit from the shutdown. How much volume do you need to get in the businesses to sort of recoup the rest at some point in time?","Mark Costa","Yes. Our current guidance assumes, as Curt indicated, that there's going to be some modest improvement in demand, principally because destocking is not occurring anymore as a way specialties can grow. Obviously, we'll not be selling a bunch of chemical intermediate products that we're just not producing because of the large shutdown. And that's the corporate volume down to being more modest. So, that's embedded in our guidance and what we expect. And that's really by far the largest driver in the change of our guidance from April to now, is this revision on a volume mix expectation going forward combined with bit lower spreads in CI and this currency headwind. ","I would also note that, you're probably not going to get quite as much raw material tailwind out of AFP, but that's a minor part of the story relative to the volume mix part of it. And that's the change in our outlook.","Something I'd emphasize on this and why I'm very confident about us moving forward is we just need the economy to get a bit better and confidence return where people get to normal inventory \u2013 want to go back to normal inventory levels and we can get a strong recovery in earnings at some point, back to comments I made earlier. And that's I think a compelling position to be in why we manage costs very aggressively.","Chemical Intermediates \u2013 that's in the specialties. In Chemical Intermediates, you have to get markets to get really tight again for those spreads to come back because not only is demand off, but supply has been out in a lot of those kind of products. So, I feel really good about how specialty is going to recover. And I feel good about that 70% of our earnings where Chemical Intermediates has now been reduced to a much smaller percentage of our portfolio. And I'm also proud of the actions we've taken to mitigate some of that volatility with the RGP investment. So, I even think Chemical Intermediates is performing relatively well to the market and how we both kept price reductions at a minimal level given our North American position, our great team execution, as well as investments like RGP to reduce volatility. ","Mike Sisson","Right. So, as a quick follow-up then, in AFP and AM, is it fair to say the bulk of the volume that you need in the second half is kind of new products and, to some degree, within your control?","Curt Espeland","It's in our control to some degree which is \u2013 no question, innovation is driving a lot of growth, especially in AM. As I mentioned, the innovation platforms are really exciting in AFP, but just at an earlier stage and that's why you see the difference between AM and AFP on sort of the demand story. But we'll get there over the next couple years. And we are assuming destocking is playing its way out. I think it's a key macroeconomic assumption we're making. We're assuming some residual destock in Q3, but that is a key assumption about why demand gets better in the second half versus the first half.","Mike Sisson","Right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Koort","Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the way you guys buy paraxylene and how that would flow through into the income statement, what the lag is until we actually see it on a cost of good line?","Mark Costa","If I think about the Advanced Material segment, specifically specialty plastics, I think of their inventory turns probably in that of five to six-month range. So, the inventory turns are long just because of the supply chain that we have there. Maybe four to six months is how I'd characterize the inventory turn and how long it takes for that lower paraxylene to show itself.","Robert Koort","Would that imply, Curt, that we'd see this nice decline in the last couple of months will show up probably in the fourth quarter, maybe early next year?","Curt Espeland","I think that would be a good way. The only thing I'd add on top of this, don't forget we're a LIFO shop. But, yeah, I would take that kind of time period to see this kind of paraxyle flow through. And as the business does a nice job getting pricing relative to its performance characteristics, and so that should help the margins of this business second half of this year and definitely going into next year.","Robert Koort","And then, on AM, I haven't heard you guys call out architectural inner layers that often. Could you give us some scale or scope of how big that business is and how those margins might stack up against the segment average? Thanks.","Mark Costa","Yeah, architectural is about half of the inner layer business inside Advanced Materials and it's been great. It's primarily commercial buildings, predominantly in Europe where the code drive's use of laminated glass, and it's just been delivering strong growth last year and this year with the amount of commercial building activity there. And we have a lot of good premium products as well.","Robert Koort","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Good morning. Mark, as you look broadly across the portfolio, are there examples of product lines where your July order books or your visibility into 3Q is materially better or worse than the average 2Q levels? Any outliers on that front?","Curt Espeland","When I look at it, demand in July is holding up quite well across the company on the order books. We're seeing good growth and, I should say, stability relative to June and July. I've also learned my lesson at this point not to predict demand for the quarter based on order books in any one month because there's just too much volatility out there. But what I'd say overall is orders are holding up well.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. And then, second one, if I may on Advanced Materials, just to kind of follow-up on the prior thread of discussion, like you indicated back half better than the front half in terms of the earnings prospects there. If I look at the five years prior, the opposite has been true. And so, I guess, my question is, are there other factors besides the flow through of lower paraxylene costs that are helping you in the back half in that business that you would call out?","Mark Costa","So, a couple of things. One again, what you already mentioned, the flow through of lower raw materials. Also, keep in mind, the fourth quarter last year was a pretty down year for that segment just because of the amount of destocking that occurred in the fourth quarter. And so, that to me is a big factor as well. And then, the cost reduction activities will benefit that business like, well, the rest of the segments.","Curt Espeland","The other key is, there's a lot of destocking in the first half of this year that's not remotely normal. We believe it's played itself out as we go into the back half. And, obviously, that creates the distortion first half, back half.","David Begleiter","Great. Thank you very much. ","Gregory Riddle","Ebony, let's make the next question the last one please.","Operator","Thank you. Every one, we'll take our final question from Lawrence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.","Laurence Alexander","Hi. Just quickly then, can you tie your comments on destocking to how you're thinking about the risk of extended customer shutdowns in either August or into year-end? Can you touch briefly on \u2013 back to the discussion about the snapback scenario, whether your customers are giving feedback that they are concerned about a recurrence of trade wars and therefore tighter inventory policies even if this trade war is resolved?","Mark Costa","Yes. In general, what I'd say is people have taken a very tight inventory strategy for the last three quarters. They've been working things down pretty aggressively, given the level of uncertainty that we face. And there's a limit. Once you get inventories really low, you can't go any further than that unless there's a fundamental step down in demand. So, I think we have customers already living sort of at very short order patterns and very tight inventory management.","To your first question, Laurence, on extended shutdowns, that would be potential risk to our forecast if there was very significant shutdown of the auto industry. That's not in our current forecast. ","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Mark Costa","That would push us to the lower end of our range as opposed to somewhere else.","Gregory Riddle","Okay. Thanks again everyone for joining us this morning. This call will be available on replay on our website this afternoon. We hope you have a great day.","Operator","Again, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for participation. You may now disconnect."],"7786":["Eastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 25, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Gregory A. Riddle - Director of Investor Relations","James P.

Today's call is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on Eastman's website, www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mark Costa, President and CEO designate; and Josh Morgan, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 3 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's third quarter 2013 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2013 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2013.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation excludes certain noncore or nonrecurring costs, charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in our third quarter 2013 financial results news release, which can be found at eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the third quarter financial results news release.","And lastly, we posted the slides accompanying our remarks for this morning's call on our website in the Presentation & Events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 3. And as I always do on these calls, I'll take a moment to provide an update on our most recent outlook statements.","First of all, we have executed very well on the Solutia integration, and we're at the point now where I can say it is largely complete. Curt will provide you with an update and a bit more color on this topic in his section, but let me state again what I've said on several of these calls now. And that is that I'm very pleased with the success of the integration and how well these businesses and cultures have come together to create value for our shareholders.","Next, in July, we raised our full year 2013 EPS expectations to a range of $6.40 to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.40, so we raised $0.10. Today, we are adjusting our guidance back down to those $0.10 to $6.30 and $6.40, and I'll talk more about that in a few minutes. We also said we expected to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow in 2013, and we remain on track to achieve this.","And finally, as always, we committed to remain disciplined in our capital allocation. If you look at how we put our capital to work this quarter and go back to our track record over the past several years, I hope you would agree that we have been very prudent in our choices and focused on creating value over the long term.","Next, on Slide 4, the Eastman corporate results. Operating earnings increased third quarter '13 versus third quarter '12 as higher sales volume in the Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials segments, as well as higher pricing in Fibers more than offset continued challenges in Adhesives & Plasticizers and the impact of higher raw material and energy cost. The operating margin for the quarter was 17%, about the same as it was in third quarter 2012, despite weakness in Adhesives & Plasticizers and higher raw material and energy cost. Third quarter EPS was $1.68 and with this level of earnings, we remain well positioned to achieve our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. And while the global economic environment remains mixed and somewhat unpredictable, our third quarter results reflect the underlying strength of our portfolio of specialty businesses.","Next, on Slide 5, I'll highlight our results by geographic region. And you'll notice we were higher across all regions with our largest, North America, up 3% as we continue to see strength in the transportation and building and construction markets.","We also had another solid quarter of growth in Asia Pacific, up 5% year-over-year, and growing 11% in each of the first 2 quarters -- after growing 11% each of the first 2 quarters. The growth is primarily driven by strength in both our Fibers and Specialty Fluids & Intermediate segments, as well as significant growth in our Tritan copolyester within Advanced Materials. As I mentioned on our last call, we believe a significant factor is China's transition to a consumer economy and their growing middle class. And our portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of this transition and less exposed to the declining infrastructure spending in the region.","We grew revenue 3% in Europe, which was our first positive quarterly comparison this year, and this was driven largely by the Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials segments. In Latin America, revenue was up a couple million dollars at just under 2%. So our geographic diversity continues to be a source of strength for our portfolio and our third quarter results reflect that.","Moving next to the segments in the Slide 6, where I'll begin with Additives & Functional Products. Sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume across several product groups, and this was particularly true for solvents as we continue to benefit from the strengthening U.S. building and construction market supported by recent capacity additions at our Longview, Texas facility for our ethylene oxide derivatives. Higher volume for cellulose and polymers and Crystex insoluble sulfur also contributed to the higher revenue attributed to increased demand in be transportation market. Operating earnings increased largely due to the higher sales volume, partially offset by higher raw material and energy cost, particularly for propane.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect operating earnings to be up year-over-year, but to decline sequentially consistent with our normal seasonality you would expect in this business and higher raw material and energy cost. As a result, we continue to expect full year 2013 operating earnings of approximately $410 million, which would be a solid improvement over 2012.","Moving next to Slide 7 in Adhesives & Plasticizers. Our third quarter result reflects the continued challenges this segment is facing with both the Adhesives and the Plasticizer businesses impacted. Focusing first on adhesive resins, increased competitive supply, primarily due to increased availability of key raw materials, continues to impact the business unfavorably. Additionally, we continue to see demand weakness in consumables, particularly for tapes, labels and packaging. However, we expect solid long-term growth from increased use of hygiene products, such as diapers in fast expanding markets, particularly Asia.","For plasticizers, we continue to face competitive pricing from producers, who, in response to slower growth in Asian and European markets, have increased exports to other regions. At the same time, we also continue to see existing manufacturers of phthalate-based plasticizers trying to defend market share. Taken together, these factors resulted in lower selling prices and, ultimately, lower earnings for this business in the third quarter. On the positive side, we continue to benefit from the substitution of phthalate plasticizers by non-phthalate plasticizers driving demanding growth. Looking at the full year, we expect operating earnings to be approximately $175 million.","Advanced Materials on Slide 8, and they had another strong quarter. Year-over-year sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume from Eastman Tritan copolyester, where volume was higher by greater than 70% year-over-year. We continue to see strong adoption for the brand across multiple applications and geographies. And as previously announced, we are expanding Tritan capacity by approximately 25%, which should be completed by the middle of next year. Interlayers' volume increased year-over-year, mainly due to higher sales of the acoustic product line.","Operating earnings increased primarily as a result of increased demand for specialty plastics products, included both Tritan and copolyesters, resulting in higher sales volume and higher capacity utilization, which led to lower unit cost. The operating margin for the quarter increased year-over-year to just under 12%, an increase of about 160 basis points. For full year 2013, Advanced Materials remains on track for operating earnings of approximately $250 million.","Next is Fibers on Slide 9, and another great quarter for this great business. Revenue increased due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy cost, particularly for wood pulp. Operating earnings were $113 million, a nice increase over last year. For full year 2013, we continue to expect operating earnings of approximately $450 million, about a 16% increase over 2012.","And lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation to expand acetate tow capacity in China. The facility is operating. It's currently in the process of qualifying material. We did recognize a small amount of revenue and earnings from acetate flake sales to the joint venture during the third quarter, and therefore, we are on schedule to recognize further earnings from our acetate flake sales and the earnings from our equity investment in the joint venture in early 2014.","I'll finish out the segments on Slide 10, the Specialty Fluids & Intermediates. Sales revenue increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher sales volume for olefin-based intermediates sold into Asia Pacific, as well as improved pricing in several product lines. Operating earnings were lower year-over-year, primarily due to higher raw material and energy cost more than offsetting higher selling prices. Sequentially, earnings declined primarily due to higher raw material and energy cost, particularly for propane, as well as the timing of project sales in the Specialty Fluids business. Operating margins for the quarter were 14.5%, lower both year-over-year and sequentially but still quite solid. For the full year, we are revising our operating earnings expectations to approximately $380 million, and this would be more than $20 million of earnings growth for the year and would be another solid year for the segment.","The next, on Slide 11, is our outlook for the full year 2013. And my main message here is we're on track for a fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, with our outlook indicating growth in 2013 versus 2012 will approach 20%. This type of consistent earnings growth reflects a few things. First, roughly 2\/3 of our sales revenue is in product lines, where we have a leading market position. Second, the end market and geographic diversity that we have are sources of strength. And we continue to leverage our world-class technology platforms in acetyls, olefins and polyesters.","So looking specifically at the remainder of 2013, we expect fourth quarter to be seasonally slower, the pace of global economic growth remains uncertain, Europe continues to be weak but not really getting worse, and China is slower in certain end markets, including building and construction. We also expect the challenges for the Adhesives & Plasticizers segment to continue, and we expect raw material and energy cost will be higher in the fourth quarter. So as a result, we adjusted our expectations for 2013 EPS to a range of $6.30 to $6.40.","And lastly, we added a page and I thought it would be helpful to give you a view of some of the building block actions we are working on to deliver earnings growth in 2014. So I'm not setting guidance for '14, but I wanted you to have this list. It's not an exhaustive list. It does not reflect our views on economic growth nor in the olefin spread, but these are items that are Eastman-specific.","So the first category is where we are serving growing markets by increasing capacity for our innovative products. And first example listed is our Tritan copolyester, which we expect will grow by about 50% this year-over-year and where, for minimal capital, we are increasing capacity by 25%. It also includes our Eastman 168 non-phthalate plasticizer, which has grown by 30% this year and where, again, for minimal capital, we can increase capacity by 15% and are positioned to increase capacity by another 15% in the near future. And as I've previously mentioned, we're on track with our acetate tow joint venture in China.","Second category is improving mix with premium products, primarily in the Advanced Materials segment. And examples here include our acoustic interlayers and our V-Kool performance films, both of which have made good progress in 2013 and we expect will accelerate in 2014, as well as our Tritan copolyester.","Third category is technology licensing, and it's not really anything new for Eastman. In 2005, we licensed our acetyl technology to Sipchem. And then in 2007, we licensed the -- we licensed acetyl technology to Chang Chun Petrochemical. And you may have seen that earlier this week, we announced we have developed with JM Davy, a proprietary technology for the production of ethylene glycol, which we are bringing to the market for licensing. We are well positioned to generate revenue from licensing in 2014 and believe it will be repeatable in subsequent years.","The last category we have listed on the slide are synergies from the Solutia transaction, including some meaningful commercial and operational synergies. And we are on track here, and Curt's going to give you an update on -- during his section. When we put all the actions we are taking together, we see them contributing somewhere between $0.50 and $0.75 per share in 2014, which keeps us on track for double-digit earnings growth in 2014.","And I'll end by saying how proud I am of what Eastman employees have accomplished over the past 4 or 5 years, and I strongly believe the future is very bright for Eastman, especially with Mark and his team. They are the right leaders for the time. And I'll also just throw in kudos to our Board of Directors. One of the most important things the board has to do is make sure you have a smooth CEO succession. And I can tell you so far, and I think Mark would concur this, this feels about as good as it gets, as seamless as it can be. So very much I appreciate the way the board has handled this process.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","All right. Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 14, I'll review some of our financial highlights for the third quarter. We generated $427 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter, primarily due to strong net earnings. Working capital decreased by $81 million, primarily due to lower receivables. We also made a $75 million contribution to the U.S. defined-benefit pension plans on top of the $24 million we made in the first half of 2013. We continue to expect the full year contribution will be approximately $120 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $255 million, which is net of capital expenditures of $125 million and dividend payments of $47 million. Finally, our cash balance was $2,222 million (sic) [$222 million] at the end of the third quarter.","Third quarter results were impacted by the $86 million benefit due to an interim remeasurement of our Eastman OPEB planned obligation. This remeasurement was triggered by a planned change in life insurance benefits during the quarter. Additionally, we also incurred $9 million in costs related to the Solutia transaction and $3 million in restructuring charges for severance associated with the continued integration of Solutia. Finally, our tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 27%. This is lower than our previous expectation of 31%, primarily attributed to an adjustment to the tax provision to reflect the finalization of the 2012 consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. We expect our tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximate 31%, assuming no dramatic change in foreign earnings mix.","Next, on Slide 15, I'll walk you through our estimate for free cash flow in 2013. Consistent with our previous guidance, we project operating cash of roughly $125 billion (sic) [$1.25 billion]. The full year operating cash estimate includes our projection for continued strength in earnings, as well as those items noted on this slide. We expect 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million, a bit lower than our previous guidance. The fourth quarter will still be our highest quarter for the year due to the normal operating trends, as well as timing for growth projects, including our Specialty Fluids expansion in Wales. So putting this altogether, we continue to expect our 2013 free cash flow expectation to be between $600 million and $650 million with the midpoint of this range representing a growth rate of greater than 30% over the 2012 total.","Next, on Slide 16, I'll provide an update of the Solutia integration. As Jim noted, we continue to make great progress with our integration efforts. Earlier in the year, I highlighted the successful migration of our rubber additives business over to Eastman's SAP system. Today, I'm pleased to say our Interlayers and Specialty Fluids businesses were migrated at the beginning of October. This is another major accomplishment as these migrations are quite complicated and our SAP implementation team, led by Mike Behal, deserves a lot of credit. And we are on track to move over the remaining former business of Solutia early next year. While the Eastman team has more work to complete, our integration efforts are moving towards -- more towards business as usual as one integrated company.","On cost synergies, we remain on track to deliver a greater than $100 million run rate by the end of this year. This is about 5% of the acquired revenues. Additional opportunities are being pursued as part of our ongoing productivity efforts. I expect, by the end of 2014, our run rate will be closer to 6% of acquired revenues.","We are also progressing well with tax synergies. First, we were able to implement some of the -- some tax structure changes in the second half of 2012 that have impacted our effective tax rate, including the return to provision adjustment I mentioned earlier. These, combined with our other continuing actions we are taking, resulted in an expectation that our 2014 effective tax rate will be approximately 30%. Second, we now expect to utilize approximately 2\/3 of the $1.3 billion of NOLs by the end of 2015. All in all, great work by our tax team.","From a business synergy standpoint, our results are benefiting from improved commercial and operational efficiencies and that will continue in 2014. In addition, we remain focused on long-term product development projects that will further add value to this transaction. So our integration efforts are going extremely well. And one final example of that, a comprehensive cultural survey was recently completed by Towers Watson. The results of that survey suggest our 2 strong cultures have effectively been integrated, and our combined Eastman culture going forward is comparable to high-performing companies in their database. So as a result, this acquisition continues to be a value-adding transaction for our stockholders.","To close on Slide 17. We will continue to be disciplined with our approach to capital allocation. As previously mentioned, we expect capital expenditures of $500 million, which is similar to 2012 when you factor in the $51 million Solutia spent in the first half of 2012 prior to the close of the acquisition. This reflects our commitment to pursue organic growth across our portfolio that is aligned with the overall growth in our end markets.","On the debt side, paying down a significant portion of the Solutia acquisition term loan has been a major priority for cash this year. During the third quarter, we reduced our long-term debt by an additional $250 million. The $600 million in total payments we have made since closing the transaction in third quarter 2012, plus the effective use of our strong balance sheet to obtain more attractive funding in the commercial paper and other credit markets, has reduced the original $1.2 billion term loan to just $150 million.","In the other 2 remaining areas on this slide, we will continue to pursue joint ventures and acquisitions and we expect to continue returning cash to our stockholders in form of both dividends and share repurchases. During the third quarter, we repurchased $35 million of Eastman common stock and paid $47 million in dividends to our stockholders. Through the first 9 months of 2013, we have returned over $200 million to our stockholders.","So with that, thank you for your interest in Eastman Chemical, and I'll turn it back to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks, Curt. We have a number of people on the line this morning, and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. [Operator Instructions]","With that, Christie, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, on Plasticizers and Adhesives, when you first came out with the issues first quarter of this year, you gave us a number that was lower, but it kind of said there was more downside to that number than upside until you got a handle on it. Now that we've been dealing with that for a couple or 3 quarters, do you feel good that we've kind of gotten underneath what the pain will be and, going forward, we can actually grow from here? Or is there still more downside than upside as you look at that?","James P. Rogers","So, Duffy, let me make a comment. And then on this call, you'll probably notice that I seem to be doing the shuffle pass quite often because I understand -- my ego accepts the fact that you probably want to hear Mark and Curt talk about a lot of these issues going forward. But just on the -- on this business segment, I do think we're starting to get a handle on what it is. I mean, let's just say we know the problem is. I think you can still get surprised in terms of how competitors act, et cetera. If I can take the longer-term picture, and then maybe Mark will want to comment a little bit about what he's seeing nearer term, but longer term -- so this segment's probably going to be down in the valley and I'm guessing maybe as much as a couple of years. Does it ever get back to the kind of peak margins it had? It's hard to see that it gets back there. But again, we've been surprised before. On the other hand, I can easily see a time when it's performing noticeably better than it is today. I just wanted to take the opportunity to say, when you look about one segment under stress like this, this is, to me, where the strength of the overall portfolio come through. I mean, if you think about it, this segment is definitely underperforming. And yet, we're still going to come in for the year, up 20%-ish, and it's going to be on the strength of all the other segments we have. And we're still going to hit and maybe exceed the kind of original guidance we had for the year. So with that, I don't know, Mark, what more do you want to say, maybe about the 2 pieces of Adhesives, Plasticizers?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. Thanks, Duffy. And I certainly would support all of Jim's comments on this. It's still a good business and still provides a good, attractive return even at these margins. We're certainly not at all happy with the performance and want to find every lever we have available as to improve it. But a lot of the challenge we have right now is supply\/demand imbalance, as Jim noted in his prepared comments. I'm not about to call it bottom. At this point, I don't think we have yet to have enough information. But I certainly now see signs that are both positive and negative about the situation. So on the negative side, we certainly continue to see weak demand and have not seen a recovery in demand. The good news is destocking seems to be behind us, which was an additional demand headwind that we faced through this year, and I think that's going to stabilize and not be a challenge as we move forward. So that's going to help. In regards to the supply side, as Jim noted, the supply is long, but we also see some signs of stabilization there. Raws in prices, which has been the key, low raw -- low-priced raw materials that's put the pressure in this market on adhesives has gone up meaningfully in price. And if it stays at this higher level, it will take some of the pressure of substitution of hydrocarbon resins towards rosins. That will reduce a little bit. So those things will balance things out a little bit. On the Plasticizers side, this is more of a demand-based issue where we just need demand to start recovering. If it does, especially in Asia, it will draw that Asian supply that's putting margin pressure here back into Asia. That will help. But the -- I want to emphasize that the strength of demand on the Plasticizers side is quite good. Our volume is growing quite strongly on the non-phthalates and offsetting some of that price pressure. We don't have as much of that benefit in Adhesives right now.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And one of the businesses that's been a rock star, Fibers. One of your competitor is out with a pretty significant price increase, again, for next year. Price, obviously, the last 3 or 4 years, has been very, very beneficial. When you look out over the next 1 to 3 years in that business, can you continue to get mid-single-digit pricing that's accretive to margins over that period, do you think?","James P. Rogers","Well, this is Jim again. Let me just say, yes, it is a great business. We have a great relationship with our customers and, obviously, one major customer where we got a joint venture that we're filling that plant out. We respect our customers a lot. We don't like to negotiate price with either customers or suppliers on earnings calls. And so we approach it more of a partnership, but I think both sides of the table realized that we both have to create value. And as we look at the negotiations with raw materials and the negotiations that we're having with our customers and what they value, by the way, the service, the reliability, the having the product there, the high quality when they need it, I would expect to -- this business earnings to continue to grow.","Operator","And our next questions comes from Andy Cash with SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This is Jim Sheehan in for Andy. I'm just wondering your thoughts now on long-term growth. And you talked about double-digit growth possible over the next 2 years. And is -- do you still have confidence in that, in the context of continued pressures in Adhesives & Plasticizers or pressures from raw materials?","James P. Rogers","Okay. Well, you just named the 2 headwinds, and we're all -- and we all see them. But yes, I mean, our objective is double-digit earnings growth. We've done that for 4 years. Let me tell you what gives me some of the confidence in this. And you're right, any one business segment can go through a rough patch. We know which one it is this time. We know the raws can move around. But this company has tremendous cash flow. And we've said all along, and I've been saying it back from my CFO days, the way to differentiate yourself in this industry is how you apply your cash. What do you do with it? So yes, we're going to drive organic growth as strong as we can. There'll be some years where that gets us perhaps all the way there. Some years, it's more likely where it gets you most of the way there. And then you have to be smart with what you do with your cash, whether it's acquisitions or buying back stock. But that -- we think what our shareholders want and the best way to create long-term value is the double-digit earnings growth. And that's why we threw that slide in at the end, just to show you that there's chunks of earnings we can be working on. In this case, it's a list '14 over '13. There's other things we do that are going to make '15 better than '14. So we're a fairly conservative bunch. We never make guarantees about the future. Things can always change. But I like the portfolio of businesses we have. You see the strength that we could grow earnings the way we did this year. Even with one of the business segments having weak performance and when I put on top of that that we can use our cash, I feel very good about the next several years in terms of earnings growth.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And a follow-up on non-phthalate plasticizers. When do you think the inflection point is going to be when the tailwind from substitution into non-phthalate plasticizers is greater than the headwind from some of the lower pricing you're seeing from some of the phthalate competitors?","Mark J. Costa","This is Mark. Yes, it's good question. What we seem to see is some indications that demand's going to improve in '14 over '13 from the housing and construction market, the commercial flooring market, the key things that drive our demand. So that's, I would say, encouraging about next year when it comes to phthalates. When it comes to competitive behavior, it's always a bit difficult to predict on when the aggression of some of the competitors will abate. But I'd say on the phthalate side, things feel like they can improve, to some degree, as we look forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Guys, you gave some Eastman-specific actions, and I guess I thought maybe we'd see something around the contract with enterprise on your propane. So can you talk a little bit on it, how much a benefit that could be, what your hedge position might be, and then also, any updates on optionality for your olefins crackers.","James P. Rogers","Let me let Curt start it off.","Curtis E. Espeland","So let me go in reverse order, I think, in your questions. First on the -- where we stand with our efforts in Texas. We've had an initial hearing with the hearings officer for the Railroad Commission to provide clarity on that -- on the process going forward, trying to resolve that dispute we talked about last quarter. And we hope to obtain such clarity fairly soon, and that will help us understand kind of what the next steps are. So we have continued interest in our 700 million pounds of excess ethylene, both on- and off-site. But continued uncertainty around this common carrier access is negatively impacting our ability to get something done. So we'll see how this plays out there. I think, Bob, you've asked about hedging as well. We continue to look at hedging as a viable way for us to reduce volatility. We've had a program in place for a number of years. Given some of the recent volatility in our input cost, we continue to look at what kind of hedging we can provide in '14. We haven't really quantified that for anyone yet. There's -- it's kind of early yet. But we continue to have a good hedging program.","James P. Rogers","And the enterprise contract is really more a 2015 event.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Adhesives & Plasticizers, I think you guys guided to $175 million of operating profit. Can you give us -- are you comfortable giving us any sense of how big the non-phthalate plasticizer chunk of that might be?","James P. Rogers","Of the $175 earnings?","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, sir.","James P. Rogers","Yes, I don't think we've broken it out. Obviously, that's the part that's growing. We talked about how it's growing 30%. I think what you're seeing right now, and I think Mark did a good job explaining it, you're getting the pressure from the phthalate guys, who -- same thing we would be doing, they're being as sticky as possible as they give up share and trying to hold on to as much volume as possible. But eventually, I think that wave's going to crash over. But I don't think we want to go to breaking out the earnings by -- down that low.","Operator","And we'll go next to P.J. Juvekar with Citibank.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on Adhesives & Plasticizers. The pressure point seems to be in Adhesives. The Chinese have added capacity, and they're coming in a big way. I mean, longer term, do you want to keep fighting the Chinese or do you think there is other optionality?","James P. Rogers","I mean, I'm going to let Mark answer this because our plant in China is -- they're -- people are going to be fighting us when it comes to our cost position. But I hope this is kind of the last question on this segment, only because it is our smallest segment. I think we've tried to spell out for you what we see there. But, Mark, you want to talk about the Chinese and...?","Mark J. Costa","Certainly. The challenge comes not just from hydrocarbon resins, P.J., but also the rosins, which is a large percentage of the total supply for adhesives, and there's certainly more rosin supply than anyone expected this year. And that's where the vast majority of the price pressure is coming in the marketplace, it's the rosins, especially with the excess EVA from solar being available that is matched with the rosin to make an adhesive. And those prices, as I noted, improved. If they stay up where they are, that takes some of that pressure off, because it's less competitive than where it's been. On the C5 direct competition, there's certainly some competition there. And if demand growth in packaging, tapes and labels had been what everyone expected, it frankly would've been absorbed pretty readily in Asia Pacific and not created as much challenge as we face. So that amount of supply isn't the big issue if demand returns to what is more of a normal level and, over a period of time, would absorb that supply. So it's certainly an issue, but it's not one that's permanent.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the automotive market seems to be improving. Even in Europe, there are some positive data points. And you've seen an incremental tire demand. Any signs of restocking?","James P. Rogers","The automotive market, I think, was the question, yes.","Mark J. Costa","About automotive demand on the Interlayer side, P.J.?","Gregory A. Riddle","He talked about tires as well.","Mark J. Costa","And tires?","Gregory A. Riddle","Yes.","Mark J. Costa","Certainly, automotive has been a good story in North America this year and Asia has been solid. Europe has obviously not been great with another decline, but I would say we see stabilization in Europe. We've seen an improvement in demand for both our interlayers products as well as our tires products. It's a modest improvement in demand and by no means a restocking event, but at least the sign that the globe's stabilizing and starting to get better. From a primary demand point of view, when it comes to tires, the Michelins, the Goodyears are better to call the restocking of the channel that is likely to happen at some point. It certainly hasn't happened yet. That would be upside for us in the future when that does happen.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to follow-up on the cracker situation. Can you just kind of walk us through the legal process that you're in and give us a sense of what the next steps are? Timing might be uncertain, but what you think it could or might be?","James P. Rogers","Well, I'll take a stab at it. I mean -- and I think we talked more about it in the last quarterly conference call, too. But, as you know, there was a -- the Westlake made a change or attempts to make a change in their common carrier pipeline, and basically, we disagreed that they could do what they wanted to do. And so it's in front of the railroad -- Texas Railroad Commission now. The one hearing, Curt, you mentioned -- it's not like you had a hearing and now you're waiting for an answer, you're just waiting for it -- to hear what the process is. So it may not move. In fact, it does not move as fast as we would like to move. But while you're trying to talk to other parties about what to do with the excess ethylene, they kind of like to know what their access is to that pipeline. So not so much an Eastman issue. We have contractual rights, et cetera. But as you talk about introducing a new party, it's important to them, the use of that pipeline. And so that's an issue that we have to have resolved before we can proceed further with talking to third parties who are interested in those 700 million pounds, but we need to get this resolved. And I wish I knew the timing. I'm almost betting that's going to take longer than either you or I would want it to take. But we'll see how quickly they can get this thing going.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And there's no legal avenue available to you other than the Texas Railroad Commission?","James P. Rogers","Well, I wouldn't say no other one -- no other legal avenue. I'm saying this is the right way to approach this issue. That's where we believe the jurisdiction is, and that's where we should go.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if it's -- just as last point. If it's not resolved in your favor there, what would you do?","James P. Rogers","Then we consider what our options are.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim and Mark, I know in Crystex truck, bus and\/or auto [ph] are bigger impact than auto. Could you comment on any pickup in that market, especially in Asia?","Mark J. Costa","Sure, Dave. The management in -- has been reasonably good in truck and tire, especially in the back half of this year, from what we can see. And so that's been encouraging. As you noted, it's a high leverage of Crystex usage in a commercial tire versus a residential tire. So that's been feeling relatively good.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And -- sorry, but -- if I ask the question about the propane issue. But can you quantify the impact of the higher propane prices on the quarter, perhaps in Q4, and how much that will be recaptured in your index-based pricing mechanisms?","James P. Rogers","Yes. I'll probably not going to get into it penny by penny. But I would say to the extent that we had to come back down on our guidance, that was probably the main driver of that and still the uncertainty on the Adhesives side. It's this catch 22. We move more towards specialties. Specialty is priced less and less off at raws, and so you don't always have that 100% ability to pass-through the higher cost. We have stepped up our hedging, I guess, I would say that, in terms of how far out we go and how much we do, but we're trying to be prudent about that as well. We're not just grabbing any price we see in the marketplace. We're managing at the best we can. It's interesting though when the -- if I could just take a second, thinking about $6.30 to $6.40, $6.40 to $6.50, they're moving around. If at the beginning of the year, I had said earnings were going to be up somewhere between 19% and 21%, everyone would have said that sounds pretty good. But when you go back later and say, \"You know what, earnings is not going to be up 21%, they're going to only be up 20%, I understand the aggravation but I'm just trying to keep it all in perspective that we're moving stuff around 1.5%, at most 2% when you look at it year-over-year. And I'll just pull you back to remember that what we're talking about is driving the machine here that grows earnings double digit year after year.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just for Curt, one last thing, Curt. Is that tax rate for '15 -- 30% stable for '15 as well?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. I would say the actions we're taking contribute to that 30% rate in 2014, and I'll also say we're not standing still. We're taking a harder look at what other things we can do to see if we can better that going into '15.","Operator","And we'll go next to Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And a hell of a run, Jim. It just seem like yesterday that you took over a PET company, and now, you're running a propane-to-propylene-spread company.","James P. Rogers","Frank, I'm going to miss this phone calls. I tell you.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, we can still arrange on a quarterly basis to have a call, and I'll ask for your opinions on what's going on now that you're laying duck, et cetera. During the conversations, I didn't hear a heck of a lot regarding -- when you're talking about the 4 bucket uses of cash, the JV acquisition bucket, can you talk a little bit about how the pipeline's looking and what your appetite is for doing something more in that area over the near and midterm?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I'll make a comment and then Curt may want to add on too. But I'm glad I work for an organization and have a board that doesn't push me to do stuff that's marginal. So if I can just say, we're going to try and be every bit as disciplined as we have been in the past about putting that cash to work on the M&A side. And it -- honestly, I think it's a little bit tougher environment to see good deals. There are things out there that we like. Quite often, the main issue is going to be is it at a price we like. We can be patient. We're not in it quarter-to-quarter. We can be patient. We don't mind sitting on cash. We know it's also a very valid use of cash to buy back stock, and so that's something else we're going to have to look at and weigh that and compare it to what opportunities we see on the M&A side. But I would -- as a shareholder of Eastman, I would fully expect that we are going to grow this company, both organically and we still will do M&A. It may be hotter or cooler, based upon the environment we see out there and where things are getting priced. And we're not afraid to use our cash to buy back stock, and we're not afraid to sit on cash when we think that's the right thing to do.","Curtis E. Espeland","Frank, if I look at our M&A team, it's busy right now. They're not on the beach, I can put it that way. They are probably as busy as they've ever been, because there is activity out there. I would go in to support what Jim said. There is probably a bid-ask spread that's still a challenge out there. Things are -- people got some pretty high expectations, given some of the multiples that are out there. So we're looking at several opportunities. I think some could fit us very well, but we'll see if we can close these bid-ask spreads in this competitive environment.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Terrific. And a question for Mark. How do you think about $8 in 2015 and your confidence in being able to achieve that?","Mark J. Costa","Frank, I've been waiting for that question all day. I'm surprised it took this long. It's a great question. We still feel confident about getting to the $8 a share. Obviously, we have to pull every lever available to us to get it. As Jim noted, we have a number of things that we can do better, in actions we control to improve earnings as we laid out on that slide in his comments. There's, of course, the economy that, to some degree, has to be there and drive demand. And then as Jim just laid out, we have multiple levers available to us with an incredibly strong cash flow available that goes beyond our organic needs, whether it be M&A or buybacks. So when you look at it, I think we're in very good position to continue and deliver that double-digit earnings growth.","James P. Rogers","And, Frank, I'm going to suggest to Mark and team, we put that $8 up there as one -- as a flag, one point in time, rally the troops. That was a while ago. The much bigger driver is just that double-digit earnings growth. So you don't think, oh, I get to 15% and I'm done. And that double-digit earnings growth, whether it's 10% or 15% or you have another 20% year like we had this year, that is really the key to creating long-term value. And I also think that if we can do it consistently, you will eventually see it, see the improvement in the multiple.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of Solutia, with the integration efforts largely complete, can you give us a little bit of color to what's sort of the next step, where your focus is on? I know there's a lot of volume to be had there. Maybe some comments on how to recoup some of that volume in the businesses over the next couple of years.","Mark J. Costa","Sure. In regards to the Solutia businesses, we continue to be excited and impressed by the growing list of both commercial and operational improvements, above and beyond the sort of traditional synergies you get when you combine 2 companies. So I think we're going to see some real benefits and operational improvements in interlayers and performance films, in particular next year over this year. We're seeing significant improvements in how we do contracting and pricing and go to market and the SAP integration that's gone so well this year. It allows us a lot more detail and insight about how to improve our pricing and capture value. And then the long-term innovation product portfolio looks quite robust and things that we can do that's -- even including the crossing of heritage Eastman and Solutia technology streams to create some new-to-world products. So we feel great about this. The obvious big challenge has been European demand, which has been a big part of their demand, both in revenue and higher profitability, in that part of the geographic mix. But with Europe appearing to have bottomed out and stabilized and if that starts to get a little bit better, that's going to help as well.","Curtis E. Espeland","And, Mike, if I could add on top of that, and one of the benefits of the combined enterprises is that continued strong free cash flow generation. So not only can we see the improvement that Mark talked about in the businesses, we also are just generating some significant cash that we can deploy, either through M&A or return it to shareholders. And when I think about the portfolio of businesses we have today, well, there's just more options for us to explore and put that cash to work.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then shifting gears to Additives & Functional Products. Volumes are up pretty nice in the quarter, up 10%. Earnings are up 6%. The fourth quarter looks like earnings growth will be similar. It does look like being squeezed a little bit there. Are you having issues getting pricing? When do you think you can get better leverage there, given the volume growth has been pretty good?","Mark J. Costa","Well, first off, we're incredibly excited about Additives & Functional Products and how well it's performed this year in a record quarter despite having some raw material propane-based headwinds in the third quarter. You certainly always see a seasonal drop-off in demand in this business into the fourth quarter, which is largely what the issue is here. There are a few additional headwinds, as you noted, around propane as that flows into solvents. And with propylene prices coming off in October, it creates a bit of a challenge in the short term on how we can recover some of those propane costs. I think the bigger question will be what happens in the first quarter around propylene. There's some debate out there where the propylene prices might go. And if they go up, that would be a very helpful factor.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So the leverage really isn't on the tire side issues.","Mark J. Costa","No, no. No issues in the tires. In fact, tires is probably doing slightly better than our expectations going into the year. I wouldn't say significantly better on the Crystex side. The big challenge we've had in tires is in the PPDs. That's been a headwind for the overall segment over last year, where price competition stays pretty stiff in that market with a dramatic oversupply and benzene cost being pretty high. I certainly don't expect next year to be worse than this year. So again, that will be not be a headwind in the next year like it's been this year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","One of the things I was surprised that I didn't see in the Eastman-specific ways to drive earnings growth for 2014 is how you're going to invest in your innovation pipeline. So I was wondering if you'd be able to give us an update on what you see or your plan to grow Perennial Wood and surface or cut back on those to generate some better costs.","Mark J. Costa","Yes, great question. And the innovation pipeline we have that spans from things like surface and Perennial to Tritan, where we're certainly seeing -- it delivered great earnings this year. Microfibers would be the one I'd love to highlight, because I think it's got the longest term of significant potential of the ones I just mentioned. I think that portfolio is robust. As many of you know, innovation portfolios don't deliver dramatically out the gate. I mean, so it's not a huge contributor to earnings growth next year. But as you look out how we deliver double-digit earnings growth over the next 5 years, that innovation portfolio is a key driver of our results. But there's no big thing that's about to take off next year in that innovation portfolio.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a little kind of housekeeping. Would you mind explaining the composition of volume growth in Crystex? Was it new tires versus replacement passenger tires versus heavy-duty truck?","Mark J. Costa","I'd love to have that level of insight from our customers about where our Crystex demand is coming from, but unfortunately, they don't break it down like that. We do look at the composition of their demand and try and guess that, how that translates to our direct Crystex demand. But I would say that, as David noted earlier, commercial tires is our bigger deal than passenger tires. Remember that 75% of tire demand for all of us is replacement tires versus OEM. So as the OEM market shows dramatic improvement, that's not a direct impact for overall tire demand as much as some people might think.","Operator","And we'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones. Just the near term, what you're seeing on sequential trends in packaging, particularly any changes or deviations from normal behavior in the consumer products chain. And secondly, as you -- I'm thinking about bridge to 2014, any first read on pension expense? And which of your segments do you feel it's a slam dunk that you can grow earnings or segment profits faster than 10%?","James P. Rogers","So I'm going to let Curt start first on the pension side.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. On the pension side, pension expense really will be flat, if not a slight tailwind.","James P. Rogers","And, Mark?","Mark J. Costa","And then regarding packaging demand, that's been disappointing this year for us. It's been weak. That's one of the biggest drivers of our Adhesives challenge, and it also has led to a little bit softer copolyester demand than we would have liked. I don't think we have any clear indication that there's a upswing in that demand yet, but it would be, I think, reasonable to expect that '14 will be better than '13, assuming the global economy keeps moving forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Nocella with RBC Capital Markets.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Historically, you've done a good job of exiting businesses as they begin to have some more competitive pressures. So have any of your businesses moved into this bucket recently? And on the other side of that, can you unlock value by maybe spinning off or selling some of the higher-margin businesses that maybe aren't fully appreciated, something like Fibers maybe?","James P. Rogers","Yes. You were breaking up just a little bit on that. Did you give an example on...","Gregory A. Riddle","He said -- go ahead, Chris.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, the businesses that have more competitive pressures would be -- maybe Adhesives & Plasticizers, something on that line?","James P. Rogers","Yes. So first of all, I'd take the compliment on the portfolio management. I do feel like the company has done a good job, and I like the portfolio so much better now than what we had 5, 6 years ago. And as you know, a lot of these changes happened before I took the helm. So they were -- we've been at this for a while. And I would expect we'll continue being at it. But the one thing I want people to remember is a lot of the Eastman strength comes from integration. So it's not as -- so we don't have all these just separate little boxes sitting out there where you just take it and you put a bow around it and you send it out to the public. And you can do that. Some of the companies is doing that more recently. Maybe they're getting around to doing what we did a few years ago. But I don't think just seeing a valley for a business like I talked about with Adhesives & Plasticizers is a rationale for oh, well, the first time they have a couple of down years or whatever, they're out of here. That's not the way we think. We really look at the value creation and the long-term path, how well it fits with Eastman, what the integration is. As you know, we make some of the raw materials for those businesses. Having said that, we're going to do what's in the best interest of the shareholders, whether it's looking at underperforming businesses or -- I hadn't thought as much about the flip side where you have a high-performing business and what do you do with that. I can tell you, typically, taxes get in the way, which leads companies to spend, which then leads you to say it's something big enough to be standalone. But the overriding driver I've seen when thinking about Eastman is the level of integration we have and how well things click, both all the way from the technology side to our supply chain side and, in particular, through our manufacturing integration.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It makes sense. And just the $0.50 to $0.75 a share for next year, how much of that is from the capacity expansion's bucket versus the other 3? And do you expect CapEx to be higher or lower next year?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Curt may want to comment on the CapEx. I -- what we did is we put together a list of projects. And we wondered if people are going to say, \"Now put a number next to each one.\" And we don't want to do that. I can tell you, though, I feel pretty good about the -- those big building blocks and then that's not all there is. I mean, we didn't talk about it, about licensing, but I think our licensing stream has improved greatly with this new EG technology. I think you're going to see a more consistent year-in\/year-out income coming from licensing. So it's hard to oversell that, because we haven't sold the first license yet. So -- but we wanted people to be aware that we think we're onto something really good here with that license. But we're probably not going to break out the pennies next to each product. Curt, on CapEx for next year?","Curtis E. Espeland","CapEx, it's a little early. But here's how I normally think about CapEx. CapEx, in normal times, would be $500 million, plus or minus 10%. I think next year, it's probably going to be more on the higher side of that because we have some growth investments we want to make that we'll be talking through. And in addition, there'll be some infrastructure spending next year, because of that natural gas conversion we talked about early in the year. So I'd say capital expenditures are going to be higher next year. We'll probably quantify that for you in January. But even having said that, I'd still expect very good, strong free cash flow generation next year.","Operator","The last question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Would you comment on current global operating rates and oxo alcohols, 2-EH and some of the butanols. Just trying to get a sense -- there's always been a lag on pass-through there. Just trying to get a sense for whether it's becoming any more difficult for you to pass along propylene costs irrespective of lag effects.","Mark J. Costa","Sure. Kevin, in regards to the run rates and propylene cost structures, all of our assets are running relatively well. What we like about our big engine is they good great job of running the intermediates flat out and keeping us well positioned in cost structure. And fortunately, we have a good amount of capacity at some of the specialties to continue growing and selling. I don't think that we've got a utilization headwind or tailwind that's significant in our future around the assets, except for Adhesive & Plasticizers, where demand is off. In Asia, there's no question that the competitive situation is pretty significant, as always, in things like solvents and some of the commodity products out of SFI. And we've seen some headwinds on a price basis in the third quarter and expect some of that in the fourth quarter. Did I answer your question?","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that helps, and maybe I'll follow-up off-line as well. On the -- just to shift gears a bit. On your ethylene glycol, can you speak to the value add of the technology that you've developed? And it sounds like you're getting fairly close on something if you expect some revenue in 2014. Order of magnitude, would it be similar to your acetyl's licensing that you've had in the past? What's the opportunity there?","James P. Rogers","Let me -- Mark may want to add something, too. But when -- the confidence for '14, now -- I feel like we've got 2 horses now. We have the acetyl licensing we can do, and we now have EG licensing we can do. And we assume that demand in China is going to be fairly strong for that EG licensing. We're in this with a partnership with Davy. There's an understanding that we're not going to start talking about the economics around it. I might have gone too far when I just said that I think it's going to be pretty good and it's going to be fairly consistent. But I'm not sure I can add a whole lot more than other than -- I'm going to want the Street to think of us as having a stream of income from licensing, because we're going to be working very hard at making that more consistent, more real.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And if I may squeeze in one final short one for Curt. Just coming back to pension. A number of companies across the space have talked about potential improvement in funded status. Do you have an early read on that, and what could it mean for your cash injections in 2014 versus the $120 million you indicated for this year?","Curtis E. Espeland","Well, as you're seeing, the improved discount rate is resulted in some reduction in liability, and that's going to improve funding status across our plans, both our pension plan and our benefit plans -- or I'm sorry, our OPEB plans. And so I think we quantified in our 10-K a 25 bp change in discount rate is roughly $100 million reduction of our pension liability. So that's going to have a favorable trend, and you already saw that with that remeasurement that was triggered into -- in the third quarter. That's a reflection of that discount rate. On pension funding, what I've talked about is that -- what we're really focused on is what's required under the Pension Protection Act. And so right now, I would still assume that we're going to spend -- contribute about the same amount we did this year over the next couple of years.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, www.eastman.com.","We'll now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle from of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thank you, Silvia, and good morning, everyone, and thanks you for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's third quarter 2017 financial results News Release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q quarter filed for the second quarter 2017 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2017.","Second, earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core items. In addition, third quarter and first nine months 2017 earnings per share using adjusted provision for income taxes. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including the description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the third quarter 2017 financial results News Release, which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investors section.","Projection of future earnings also exclude any non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items and assume that the adjusted tax rate for first nine months 2017 will be the actual rate for the projected period.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3.","We continue to make great progress in executing our strategy with strong third quarter operating results. Our results demonstrate the strength of our specialty portfolio with continued volume growth of premium products in additives and functional products and advanced materials. As I said many times before, we are creating our own growth through innovation and leadership in specialty markets.","For the first nine months we delivered over 7% volume growth in our specialty businesses which is three times the underlying market. In a few moments, I'll share examples of just a few of the ways we're winning with customers through innovation and our enhanced commercial capabilities.","Our key growth metric for new business close continues to improve. We're tracking higher than our 2% target a closer to $300 million, which is incredibly impressive when you think about it being predominantly in AFP and AM.","Capacity expansions for specialty businesses remain on track which will support our continued strong growth moving forward. In addition to this specialty volume growth, we continue to do a great job implementing price increases to offset higher raw material costs. As a result, our corporate operating margin increased both sequentially and year-over-year.","Our cash engine continues to generate impressive free cash flow as we remain on track to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2017, enabling an increasing dividend, deleveraging and accelerating rate of share repurchases.","During the first nine months of 2017, we returned approximately $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. These results are clear proof points that we\u2019re continuing to execute on our strategy for innovating throughout our enterprise, to pricing discipline to returning cash to stockholders.","Moving to Slide4. Hurricane Harvey and Irma had a devastating impact on millions of people including some of our employees in Texas City. I'm very proud of how the Eastman team came together at a personal level to help their fellow employees through voluntary relief efforts, supplies and personal donations. Our impacted employees have a long road to recovery and the generosity showed will go a long way towards helping them get back on their feet.","I\u2019m also proud of our employees for their very hard work to minimize the impact of the hurricanes on our sites and operations in the Gulf region, and most important on our customers. We took the cautionary measures to protect our assets and thankfully our sites do not sustain significant impact.","As the hurricanes have severely disrupted the supply chains across the South, our biggest challenges been working to procure raw materials and getting products to our customers. Where we were backward integrated to readily available raw materials such as propane, ethane we remain reliable. In the intermediate such as paraxylene and had to rely on others we faced some challenges.","Our ability to avoid disruption and supply our customers is a testament to our competitive advantage through scale and vertical integration. Overall we anticipate the net impact of these events to be relatively neutral. The headwinds in AM from paraxylene challenges and performance films, regional sales in Florida and Texas are largely offset by third quarter tailwinds in our intermediates.","On Slide 5 we continue to drive growth from heritage Eastman and from our acquisitions. Non-revenue synergy story from our Taminco acquisition is our accelerated growth in animal nutrition.","We've delivered double-digit growth in this space from three lovers. The combined offer of Eastman and Taminco products in the space is more compelling. We've increased our collective commercial execution capability. And we're winning due to our superior reliability compared our competitors.","Another innovation success that we have that's very encouraging in our coatings business with Tetrashield for can packaging. The transition away from BPA containing can coatings for food and beverages is accelerating due to combination of new regulations such as Pop 65 in California and evolving consumer demands.","Eastman has leverage technology originally developed for Trident polyesters into the Tetrashield brand of BPA-free metal packaging coatings and recent line for us as our customers, Eastman Solutions provide a superior combination of corrosion production and flexibility, critical to this application.","The products have recently received regulatory approvals and are qualified by our first customers who expect food protected by Tetrashield-based coatings to be on the store shelves in 2018.","Finally, an update regarding our Performance Films platform, we launched some very creative and successful channel strategy in China and North America, which are the two largest markets for performance films. The result is double-digit growth for other dealers and our aftermarket stores.","We're winning on how we take the products to market and our value proposition, which is more compelling than our competitors. This is a great illustration of how we dramatically improved and acquired business and commercial execution and delivered additional growth synergies with another acquisition and common oil.","These are just three examples of how we're winning through product innovation, commercial execution and integrated technology, proof for our ability to drive synergies and organic growth from acquisitions.","With that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curt Espeland","Thanks Mark and good morning, everyone. Before I begin I'll mention that all of our segment guidance provided today excludes the financial impact of the recent coal gasification incident as we're still working through the expected impact of the event.","With that, I'll start with our third quarter corporate results on Slide 6. Sales revenue grew as increases in additives and functional products, advanced materials and chemical intermediates more than offset a decline in fibers. We continue to do a nice job of driving volume growth in our more specialty product line and we executed well on the pricing front as we realized further positive pricing momentum in the quarter.","Excluding fibers, third quarter volume growth was 6% while pricing was up 3%. Operating earnings grew as increases in additives and functional product and chemical intermediates more than offset a decline in fibers. Our operating margin expanded both sequentially and year-over-year as we made good progress offsetting a substantial headwind from higher raw material costs, a very impressive result when you consider the headwinds in fibers.","Overall, earnings per share increased year-over-year by 18% reflecting solid operating earnings, as well as actions we've taken to deliver earnings per share growth. These positive results reflect our continued focus on executing our strategy and taking actions to deliver earnings per share growth and what remains a slow growth environment.","Moving next to segment results and starting with advanced materials on Slide 7. We delivered approximately 5% earnings growth through the first nine months of the year. For the quarter, sales revenue increased due to improved product mix from higher sales volume of premium products, which was somewhat offset by the hurricane and capacity constraints.","Operating earnings were unchanged compared to record earnings achieved in the year ago period. Sequentially our operating margin expanded 100 basis points to approximately 22%. We're pleased with our third quarter 2017 performance especially given the tough year-over-year comp.","Overall, these solid results continue advanced materials track record of success and demonstrate the strength of this business in an environment of volatile raw materials and reflects a higher level of returns given the investments that we have made.","Our full year outlook has not changed and we continue to expect strong business performance as advanced materials execute its strategy of mid-single digit volume growth, mix improvement of fixed cost leverage. We continue to deliver compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in an slow growth macro environment.","Now to additives and function products on Slide 8 which had an outstanding quarter. Sales revenue increased 18% primarily due to higher sales volume throughout the segment. For example, this impressive growth came from multiple sources.","Our improved commercial execution and heat transfer fluids led to a number of wins in the solar our energy market and the timing of these orders landed mostly in the third quarter. There were strong growth in animal nutrition as Mark already discussed, and strong in tire additives due to innovation in our tire resins and superior operational reliability. We also made progress in improving our pricing and the strength of our value proposition to our customers.","Operating earnings increased both year-over-year and sequentially primarily due to higher sales volume. Sequentially we expanded our operating margin 100 basis points to 21%. Looking at full year 2017 we now expect greater than mid-single digit sales volume growth which would be about three or four times end market goal.","These volume growth represents innovation and market development initiatives in this segment including fluid solar projects, tire chemicals and tire resin. And we made great progress in offsetting input cost increases with higher selling prices. All in additives and function products is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth for the year.","Now to chemical intermediates on Slide 9, sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices but attributed to higher raw material prices and continued improvement in competitive conditions. Operating earnings increased primarily due to higher selling prices, lower commodity hedge levels and lower operating costs partially offset by higher raw material and energy cost.","Looking at the full year of 2017, chemical intermediates team continues to do a good job of recovering from a trough in 2016 as we continue to increase prices to offset higher raw material costs, benefit from lower commodity hedge costs, and reduced manufacturing costs which chemical intermediates receives the largest share. These actions will help to mitigate the anticipated headwind from higher input costs and weakness in ethylene margins during the fourth quarter. Sequentially we expect a decline in earnings due to normal seasonality including lower volumes, higher shut down costs and higher raw material cost.","I\u2019ll finish up the segment review with fibers on Slide 10, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices particularly for acetate tow due to lower industry capacity utilization. Additionally, acetate tow sales volume for the third quarter was flat year-over-year with some anticipated for fourth quarter was realized in the third quarter due to timing of customer shipments.","We continue to make great progress in growing our acetate yarn business with double-digit growth in third quarter. Operating earnings declined due to lower selling prices partially offset by lower operating costs.","Internationally, in the quarter we benefited from increased intermediates capacity utilization. Looking forward we continue to expect that acetate turbine outside of China will be about flat for the full year relative to last year and our earnings for the segment will be down a little more than 25%.","As previously discussed this includes an expectation for second half earnings to be stronger than first half. We are taking all actions within our control to provide stability for this business moving forward and believe we're on track.","On Slide 11, I\u2019ll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with operating cash flow over $1 billion. Capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $438 million. We now expect our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million slightly higher than our previous projection.","I would note that our strong revenue growth in the second half of the year and the operational incident induce several variables that will have an impact on free cash. Having said that, we're working hard to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the year.","Looking at the balance sheet, we continue to expect to use $350 million of our free cash flow to reduce debt this year which will mostly occur in the fourth quarter. Additionally we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. To the first nine months we returned $498 million to $223 million in dividends and $275 million in share repurchases.","Our third quarter effective tax rate was 20%, consistent with our expectation that our full year effective tax rate will also be approximately 20%. As a whole, I am pleased with our earnings and cash flow performance so far this year.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks Curt.","On Slide 12, I'll discuss our outlook for 2017. We continue to benefit from our specialty businesses, which we expect will deliver mid-single-digit volume growth, which is about three times the growth rate of the underlying markets.","To deliver this we are leveraging innovation and market development initiatives to drive growth in attractive end markets and we're delivering revenue synergies through launching new products and improvements in the commercial business execution capabilities of our acquired businesses.","We're also benefiting from our specialty position across the entire mix of M&A and we're realizing a lot of benefits from the superior reliability we're providing to our customers, especially as competitors in China are being shutdown with Chinese enforcing environmental law.","We've also taken actions to reduce our cost in a disciplined way, which has allowed us to strategically invest in the long-term growth and further improve our cost structure and we're benefiting from a reduction in commodity hedge costs.","We've improved the quality of our balance sheet reducing interest cost and have made further progress in optimizing our business structures so that our effective tax rate this year is expected to be slightly lower than last year.","Finally, disciplined capital allocation continues to contribute to growth, including accelerating our share repurchases in 2017 compared to '16. All these actions are helping offset the challenges we continue to face including uncertain global GDP, more than normal volatility and raw material prices and ethylene prices and the challenges we face in fibers.","Putting this all together, our expectations for 2017 EPS growth have improved and we are increasing our full year guidance to be solidly at the high end of the 10% to 12% range, excluding the financial impact of the coal gasification incident and we remain committed to over $1 billion of free cash flow, which is one of the most compelling in the industry, especially when you considering we are investing in long-term growth at the same time.","Next on Slide 13, as you know in early October we had an operational incident in the coal gasification area for Kingsport Site. First, I want to complement the extraordinary professionalism and safety first focus of operations team. There were no serious injuries and no impact to the environment. This was a significant event and we are very proud of the actions of our team.","Second our responses is a superb example of how we both delivered superior reliability for our customers and work to minimize the financial impact that this incident had on earnings. Our terms have worked tirelessly and we've made excellent progress repairing the facility and implementing alternate processes to maintain operations of downstream derivative facilities of coal gasification. We also noted -- we expect the coal gasification area to be operable by the end of the fourth quarter.","This along with our mitigating actions is expected to enable full production of our industrial chemicals and derivatives and we expect normal operations of the coal gasification area to resume in early 2018.","Third, time an impressive timeline to get back up and it's due to the significant advantages we have in scale and integration at our Tennessee site, which is one of the largest integrated chemical facilities in the United States. For example our integrated production systems across the four segments are enabling complex choices we made across the site, which was essential in avoiding a site wide shutdown at the time of the disruption and running all of the operations after it.","Our significant scale enables us to have dedicated experts and large-scale fabrication and engineering resources to repair the facility rapidly. These resources are also enabling us to bring online backup capacity at the site and from sources around the world. Our scale and supply chain and procurement is also playing a critical role in servicing material and balancing the needs with customers.","We also deeply appreciate the support from skilled colleagues outside of Tennessee and many contractors who are helping accomplish repairs in three months who might take other companies 12 months. While the company continues to assess the financial impact of this incident, the net impact is expected to reduce operating earnings between $50 million and $100 million with approximately $100 million in costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by the insurance recovery expected in the first half of 2018.","Regarding how the financial impact will flow across the segments, our cellulosic stream is complicated in how it's intertwined across the segments and will take us some time to work through the flows across the segments. Directionally we should expect the impact to be greater in fibers in CI than in AFP and AM.","On Slide 14 let me summarize where we are. We have a strong portfolio specialty businesses from which we expect to deliver approximately 70% of our earnings. We are continuing to create our own growth to excelling innovation, improving commercial execution across our businesses and improving our product mix. We are committed to using every lever we have in this uncertain environment and we're returning a very strong free cash to stockholders.","I also want to take another moment to say how proud I am of all the Eastman employees. We are building a long-term innovation driven growth company is extremely hard to cut cost aggressively at the same time. I deeply appreciate how everyone is driving for cost improvements, and fighting for each and every revenue dollar. If those challenges were not enough, our teams are doing a brilliant job of managing through the significant challenges of coal gas incident and hurricanes to keep us on track to deliver compelling top and bottom-line growth.","Also Eastman are committed to delivering both short term earnings growth and building a company that will also deliver growth in the long-term. We\u2019ll talk more about our outlook for 2018 on our fourth quarter call in January. But I believe it\u2019s important now for you to understand where we're confident about delivering stronger earnings growth and strong free cash in 2018.","Last since morning we are announcing that will host an Investor Day in New York, the morning of Tuesday, February 6. During this day we will discuss how innovation and market development initiatives have contributed to our growth and as we've been investing in these areas will continue to do so. How we generate significant organic growth volume and earning over the last several years and then how we've added to this with attractive acquisitions.","Our integration skills critical in driving the topline growth and superior margins for the company. And then how we expect to continue to add to our EPS growth to allocation of a very strong free cash flow. we will be sending out more detail shortly. I hope you will be a over joyous.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Greg.","Greg Riddle","Thanks Mark.","We've got a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that Silvia, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the queue. Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Vincent Andrews","Mark as we look into '18, there is a lot of sentiment out there in a broader investment community at least that - the macro economy is improving and underlying markets had some momentum and then going into '18, I recognize your points about this but you\u2019re growing well in excess of the market.","So I am just wondering as you look across your various segments may be excluding fibers and to lesser extent. Are you seeing underlying trends improve and do you think - I know you have macro sort of as a headwind in the slide deck but do you think we\u2019re getting to point where maybe it's not going to be headwind anymore?","Mark Costa","Certainly we are proud of how we are creating our growth and growing much faster than the underlying markets and especially in businesses this year and we would certainly expect to do the same next year.","As far as improving macro economic conditions, I can\u2019t say we are seeing much of that yet. Europe I would describe as solid but not exactly exciting growth. Europe is showing some signs of recovery. Asia is growing a bit faster than the rest of the world and we are seeing some benefits beyond innovation growth which we\u2019ve been very focused on to benefiting from supply disruptions that\u2019s given some additional volume growth especially as the Chinese have enforced environmental law that impacted the competitors that we faced there proving the value of our reliability to our customers, and we're picking up some shares as a result of that. But I wouldn\u2019t call that macro.","Vincent Andrews","And then just a question in AM, I know you got 3% price in AFP and then price was flat in AM, is there a reason why you would do better on pricing in one of the segments versus the other.","Mark Costa","First of all the raw material dynamics are quite different in two different segments and the strategies are also a little bit different. So in AFP you've seen a much bigger increase in raw materials that go into that segment and the pricing has been more aggressive in covering those increases. So that's part of the dynamic where the raw materials have been more flattish, with just a slight increase in AM.","So we feel good about the pricing that we're getting in AFP. We feel that we're making good progress in covering a raw material costs. We're extremely excited about the volume growth that we saw in that segment in the third quarter building to a strong second half of the year as we had forecasted earlier in the year.","Curt Espeland","And 180 basis points of margin improvement sequentially there is testament of how we're driving the business forward. In AM we had 100 basis point improvement in margins as we went sequentially from second to third quarters. So we feel good about how we're managing our margins.","You have to remember that the interlayer business has annual contracts. So there is no pricing changes in that business once you set those contracts in place from last fall and so we're getting some price up in the poly business as we would expect with the market and making some other choices and some other businesses. So overall we feel good about it and it's on track.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from the queue Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Gavin Trebilcock","Hi. This is Gavin on for Bob. Congratulations on the quarter and I was wondering if you could drill down a little deeper on the point for your Chinese production curtailment and if you've any sustainability of that trend? And then for the follow-up can you give us any more color on your expectation for the propane hedged roll out for 2018 can you quantify that?","Mark Costa","So on the Chinese front, the Chinese Government has had environmental laws in the books for a long time and we're very encouraged to see that they're enforcing these laws and improving the quality of operations in China for the benefit of the environment of China and planet as well as creating more level competitive playing field.","And so there is a number of companies that are not in chemical parks who are facing stricter enforcement and they have a choice to either shut down in many cases or move to chemical parks. So as we're seeing it in a number of companies are being curtailed in production or being totally shut down, some of which will move to chemical park at some point and some may not.","There is no way to predict that, but we certainly see there is benefit continuing into 2018 as it's played out so far this year.","Curt Espeland","Yes. Good morning. This is Curt. On the hedge, let me just cover '17 and we'll talk about '18 impact. Year to date, the benefit of the commodity hedges rolling off is about $90 million year-over-year that was $30 million in the third quarter. Now keep in mind that benefit is still being offset by a lower commodity -- lower currency hedges not roughly year-to-date $20 million.","So propane stays where it is today. The impact for 2017 over '16 being in that $0.50 to $0.60 set range, but the offsetting impact of lower currency hedges is also little different that's probably now more like $0.15 to $0.20. So the net impact is going to be roughly $0.40 to $0.45 on a year-over-year basis, pretty similar to what we've talked before.","As you go on to 2018, if propane end of the year will stay where they are today, the impact of hedging is no longer going to be a material part of our story. Going into 2018 when you're analyzing our year-over-year operating results.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from the queue P. J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Eric Petrie","This is Eric for P.J. And is that materials you talked about strong double-digit growth in performance films, what other volume trends are you seeing in specialty plastics and in interlayers business growth overall growth slowed to 1%.","Mark Costa","So we continue to see very strong volume growth in our premium products. So in acoustics and heads up display interlayers, we're also seeing double-digit growth. The trading growth is still solid, but constrained a little bit by capacity constraints. That's why we're building this new Triton expansion is to position ourselves for growth.","And last year was an incredibly strong quarter in Triton for a year-over-year comp. So overall, we see the things have been driving. The mix upgrade and the growth in the segment continuing. We saw some slower growth, some of our tradition co-polyesters, which is of no concern. We see it improving as we go into the fourth quarter.","And we also took an impact on some of our sales and performance films in Florida and Texas with hurricanes and impact and those are two largest states in the U.S. for these out. So overall we feel great feel about the quarter and the improvement in the earnings. And we feel very much on track for stronger via earnings growth in the fourth quarter.","Eric Petrie","And as follow-up and is AFP draw volumes up strongly 14% is that sustainable going forward or did you see some customers building inventories and then any outliers in terms of product line like coatings or at least the present?","Mark Costa","So we\u2019re very excited about very strong 14% volume growth in the quarter and it really came through a number of factors. First of all, we are seeing good strong volume growth across the segment. I wouldn't call it inventory building at all it just good strong growth.","There are a few areas where we had exceptionally high growth. As Curt mentioned we had a number of our wins in the solar fills so these are in projects you win two to three years ago in the engineering construction phase of the big so we\u2019re concentrating facility.","And when they finally brings the facility online you get a big order to fill that plant with the heat transfer fluid. And we worked hard to call the timing of those fills and we thought it would be spread more between third and fourth quarter and a lot of that really came into the third quarter that's part of the story.","Another part of the story is just great commercial execution in a revenue synergy with Taminco combining our products with their products improving the commercial team there really driving hard for results and seeing very strong growth in our nutrition and I would also mention personal care as well has benefited from those activities.","And the third is tire resins where innovations driving a lot of growth for their customers and this environmental enforcement in China has also benefited us and some share relative to competitors there.","So those three were big drivers. We still expect pretty strong volume growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we go to 2018 number of those drivers were moderate that we're driving a lot of the exceptional growth, but we still see a way to deliver mid-single digit volume growth next year as we sort of concentrate and consolidate some of these wins we have this year.","Operator","And now we will take our next question from the queue, Aleksey Yefremov from Numora Eastman. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Aleksey Yefremov","Curt, the guidance that you are now currently solidly at the high end of the range at about 12%, does this leave room to exceed that that high end at this appear or EBIT to a fairly optimistic but it could be above the high-end?","Curt Espeland","No, we solidly that\u2019s on purpose but we think we\u2019re solidly at the high end of that range for 2017 and that's kind of where we\u2019re expecting and recall that\u2019s before the impact of the operational.","Mark Costa","The other thing I\u2019ll notice we\u2019ll do our best now as well as in the fourth quarter call to make sure you understand how we've delivered attractive earnings growth consistent with our guidance pre-event and then with the event caused and so you can really see the strength of what we\u2019re doing that of this sort of one-time event.","Aleksey Yefremov","I guess as follow up to this, could you help us the build the bridge from third quarter to the fourth quarter what are the biggest areas where things are decelerating in terms of margin or volume and may be some are improving?","Mark Costa","Yes, first of all I want to emphasize that we just raised our guidance. That we're feeling better on the full year basis obviously we had an extraordinary third quarter we still expect a very good fourth quarter.","When we think about third to fourth quarter sequentially there's always normal seasonality where volumes drop off across most of our businesses, that happens every year. So there is that we should all have in your forecast as normal.","As we look at the dynamics across the four segments, we expect earnings growth in three of the four segments and we expect strong earnings growth in AM and AFP with fibers having sort of meaningful drop from third quarter fourth quarter as Curt mentioned in our prepared remarks., the fibers business is a bit chunky in how customers orders can come in sometimes, we also had some exceptional high asset utilization in the third quarter on our asset yields that benefited fibers that won\u2019t repeat in the fourth quarter.","And so when you see that come off that you should really be thinking about fibers on a second half basis for the quality of their earnings of this business, which is going to be better than the first half and a testament to an improvement and stabilization of this business.","So overall I think when you do that math, you can walk through how the quarter comes out, but strong growth year-over-year and volumes for AFP is expected in the first quarter, chemical intermediates will come off as Curt noted in his remarks. But it will still be year-over-year","Operator","Thank you. And now we take our next question from the queue, Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Daniel Rizzo","Its Daniel Rizzo how are you? You mentioned some different new products like Tetrashield and animal nutrition segment doing well and growing at double-digit. I was just wondering if you could quantify what that means in terms of revenue? Is it very meaningful yet or is it still in the early stages?","Mark Costa","Well Tetrashield is in the early stages. It's a great story of how we take complex technologies, Tritan and Tetrashield are an integration of polyester acetyl and olefin chemistry to create a very unique product and as Trident and it turns out incredible performance in the coatings market relative to what's available out there.","We've talked a lot about automotive where we've already had some wins and momentum but it's still low volumes. The can packaging area is just going commercial as I mentioned. It has to do -- it have much faster volume growth rate given the pressures for getting BPA coatings out of the cans and we believe our solution with Tetrashield is superior to all the other non-BPA solutions in the market.","So we could actually see some meaningful growth over next couple years but it takes a while to get to that did and build that volume growth.","Curt Espeland","And these are just components across all the different innovation programs that are contributing to our business clauses and that's why we think we're going to be adding 2% to our company revenue off these innovation programs and I can tell you I am excited about as telling that story on February 5.","Daniel Rizzo","And then just in terms of the stuff innovation, I think in the past we've talked about just different uses for fiber and innovation there. I was just wondering if you could provide color on where we are with that program or cost base.","Curt Espeland","Great progress on that front as well. We're already seeing strong growth in our in our acetate yarn business with double-digit growth this year versus last year. Our latest acetate yarn, Naia, which is an improved version of what we have in the market for a while is getting great interest.","We're getting commercial orders and very excited about building in that space and those are in that businesses have decent margins. We also are making some great progress in a few other applications that we're very close to getting the commercial orders on and should have them done by Investor Day and we'll tell you more about those applications when we get there.","I think we're making great progress on getting the assets. Now I would note that this is a great example of the strength of our diversity and scale, with the great specialty capability we have in application development and fundamental work we're always doing in cellulosics in AM and AFP, we're able to shift those resources on to this project a couple years ago, few years ago I guess now with the priority to find new applications accelerate growth and it's just amazing to see the progress and a real testament to the strength of having a diverse portfolio.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from the queue Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Jeff Zekauskas","I am interested in how you calculate the $50 million to $100 million hit from the coal gasification incident? Is it the case that this is a nonrecurring item from management compensation or is it a recurring item? And so if it's a recurring item, are there reversals of management compensation in the fourth quarter that have to do with your actual earnings being diminished?","How much is maintenance cost? Is all of this factored in and are there extra capital costs outside of the $50 million $100 million that you're speaking of?","Curt Espeland","Well Jeff there is a variety of questions in there, but let me try to address of that as best I can. First of all when we think about the nature of the operating costs you need to really think about this kind of three areas of impact. First is just higher operating costs being offset by our business interruption insurance.","So we do anticipate higher operating cost which is due to a lower utilization rate higher raw material cost et cetera we will be working with our insurance partner but these costs should be generally covered with our business interruption policy after we meet our $75 million deductible. The second bucket of cost is the cost to repair and replace the damage property plant equipment which is going to be also will be working with our insurance partner but should be generally covered by our property insurance after a $5 million deductible.","And then finally in the fourth quarter we had to be mindful on the accounting nuances that could be triggered because of this event and some of the impact of utilization rates and reduction of inventories. And so as an example and I kind of kid myself actually to say this but we might have life of decrement because of this event and that may because we\u2019re not going to charge in the fourth quarter.","So again when we put all these various complexities together from a timing standpoint we\u2019re still analyzing what\u2019s going to get hung up on the balance sheet what close to the income statement et cetera. But our best estimate right now is that will have roughly $100 million cost impact on the fourth quarter and then that we will see that partially offset with an insurance recovery in 2018. And when I think about 2018 I know it will probably be a net positive insurance recovery over cost it's as hard to say whether that will be material number or not as we look at it.","Mark Costa","Jeff when it comes to impact on compensation you know as management team we will take the hit for these costs it will be included in our calculations. The thing I would like to focus though and just go back to sort of the story of this event its obviously very serious we take it very seriously and we\u2019re going to learn from it but I am just incredibly proud about how the teams have come together to sort of bring this plant back up and incredibly short time frame and make sure that customers are being protected as best we possible can through all this where we\u2019re going to have a very limited sales impact.","When I talked about complex collaboration across the four segments I just want to share a few examples around sort of what we've been doing. The truth is that we have to make her incredibly complicated you can imagine the Atlanta air traffic control systems managing all the needs of all the different airlines we\u2019re making in complex our choice is daily and how to balance production and steam and power across 80 operating units that are associated acetyls at our Tennessee site out of the 120 units we have at the site and normal times we are in the site greater than 95% utilization there is just no room for error.","And when you have a massive disruption at the front of the system like a massive storm you need incredible collaboration and unlike the airlines fortunately we\u2019re not canceling flights downstream or progress operations it\u2019s just a true testament of how we run a complex integrated site. And when we talk about scale and expertise in engineering and construction I want to also highlight a couple examples.","At this time we have such scale we can afford to have a state-of-the-art large fabrication facility it\u2019s what we call big shop. We lost pipe version in this explosion we built on-site and commission the replacement of it has over a mile of pipe in five days which is just incredible we've drones flying in the damaged facility the day after the incident identifying the damage to equipment within two days of the event we were fabricating in the big shop replacement parts. And we couldn\u2019t even get into the building for another week and a half.","So on top of it moving quickly we have over 500 employees and contractors working on repairing facility looks like an anthill over there. And we can only that because the scale of our site with the flex we can do with resources. We got busloads of mechanics even driving up from Texas pitching and to help on this situation. The other companies just couldn\u2019t this they would have go outside engineering support or other people fabrication shops unless they had our scale.","The bottom line the point of all this is we review the liability as exceptionally important for our customers where we\u2019re someone we can always count on. And in addition of those repairs you know we have backup facilities and hydrate where we bringing those up in record time. We set new production records on our largest and hydrate side that\u2019s 20% above that historical performance and brought that site from what was already operating at a low level to running 360% faster in two weeks.","So great set of examples I could go on for another hour and I am going to cut myself off, but we do take this seriously we\u2019re not happy about it but I'm really proud of what we've done and it's a real testament to the value scale and integration.","Jeff Zekauskas","So it sounds like that free cash flow then for the year will be somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion depending on the cost of all of this. It also sounds like that when you start 2018, you're not going to be fully up and running. That is it will be some penalty in the first quarter I want to know if those are true and can you say what actually happened like what caused the explosion?","Curt Espeland","So let me talk about the cash flows Jeff. It's still lot of moving parts. So it's tough to call the exact timing of cash flow at this point on the operational incident, but for fourth quarter we're assuming to be that it will be somewhat neutral as the cash impact of higher operating cost is being offset by further declines in the inventory beyond what we normally do.","So again while there is these various moving parts, we're working hard to still deliver $1 billion in free cash flow and I think it will be more towards that billion quite honestly Jeff the $900 million you threw out there.","And even if we're going to need to rebuild that inventory in 2018 I'm also confident we're going to grow free cash flow in 2018 given the quality of our portfolio and the discipline of our cash by the Eastman team.","On the first quarter again it's hard to predict the earnings impact again at some cost that will continue in '18 versus the insurance recovery, but when I look at it today, it still will be -- the insurance recovery will exceed the additional operating cost that we still may have lingering in the next year in that first half of year. So I still see this as a net positive impact on '18 versus the negative impact you're seeing in the fourth quarter.","Mark Costa","Two things I want to emphasize on this question Jeff is one, we are done extraordinary efforts in preventing any disruption to customer's downstream of the coal gasification operations. So with the back-up facilities we have with their sources alternative raw materials we can access around the planet, we brought those assets back up and operating combined with the inventory we had in hand to make sure we're serving all of our customers from the event through the fourth quarter and into next year.","So the sales disruption is going to be primarily related to asset deals which is very small percentage of our revenue inside TI. So that's point one.","Point two is we're still in the process of investigating and understanding the incident that caused it and how we make sure it doesn't happen again. So we're not going to comment about at this point, but you can rest assured that we're doing it.","Operator","Thank you. And then we'll take our next question from the queue Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Frank Mitsch","Curt when you mentioned, when you were asked the question about solidly at the high end of the 10% to 12% obviously in my opinion you're not going to use that comment but to me that was a euphemism that you're going to neither exceed that 12%.","Regardless you're going to be down about $50 million to $100 million because of Kingsport, which begs the question Mark, you said during the call that you expect strong EPS growth in 2018 and given the fact that you're going to be negatively impacted by $50 million to $100 million in Q4, which will regard the actual EPS growth in 2017.","What basis were you using that strong EPS growth off of the basis of Kingsport didn't happen and you would be comping strong EPS off of a 12% plus EPS growth or a lower level. I was just trying to understand that?","Mark Costa","Yes Frank, that goes back to a comment I made a moment ago. We make sure we're really clear about the strength and value we're creating in earnings growth and cash flow this year as well as how we're building on that for next year. So my outlook comments are pre-event.","So like you just noted our guidance suggest around 12% growth this year and our earnings growth being strong is on top of that number. It is not taking the event as a special benefit to get to that number.","So we're still on track as we look at next year and consistent with the outlook we've had in the past, nothing has changed about delivering that 8% to 12% growth in what we've been talking about for the year.","It comes from strong growth in the specialties through continuing to have that mid-single-digit growth rate 2X the underlying markets mix upgrade within it driving a lot of growth. Next year we expect fibers to be stable to this year. So not having that headwind. Maybe we'll have a little upside in fibers with all the new application growth that we're pursuing.","As always we're going to continue to manage cost aggressively and continue to be focused on capital allocation for our shareholders. So continuing an increasing dividend and share repurchases that should accelerate as we go into next year and so all are good drivers for growth pre-event on top of what we do this year.","It will be offset by some higher costs but we have a very large shutdown coming in Texas next year. We have the growth investments for making we have so many - innovation platforms taking off right now. We\u2019re ramping up resources to support that growth in the customer trials and sales efforts to go with it.","And of course we\u2019re going to have the fixed costs associated with the three large special capacity additions we've done in the PVD, Crystex and Tritan. And then we\u2019re assuming on the macro uncertainties. We\u2019re assuming sort of stable oil and the raw material that go with it stable currency to where we are now. And we\u2019re assuming GDP sort of growth around this year's level in a bit those are all sort of assumptions and we know there is a lot of uncertainty.","And so that's all sort of before the incident and then we\u2019ll work through the math to make sure it clarity about the impact that we still had on earnings this fourth quarter as well it will have an impact next year.","Curt Espeland","And Frank just to make that we clarify anything in the marketplace. The impact of the event on operating costs and the recovery of insurance will be included in our published result. What we\u2019re going to do as you would expect these are going to do we\u2019re going to be as transparent as we can so that you can actually see what the impact of the underlying business is doing despite those costs and insurance recoveries. And you\u2019ll see that growth rate that Mark\u2019s talking about.","Frank Mitsch","I thought you proved a little bit the business in Europe, sales in Europe were up I think 21% year-over-year some of that is going to be currency but can you talk a little bit about the space of business that you're seeing over in that part of the world and how sustainable that might be?","Mark Costa","Yes to be clear I was just commenting of what I think is the macroeconomic conditions Europe we are actually driving a lot of growth in Europe well above the macro and it was that\u2019s the only performance for the region.","Most of the solar fills that I talked about occurred in the Middle East. So that was part of the driver we say Europe, Middle East and Africa is our region so you have to remember it\u2019s all of that.","And so part of the solar fills, part of what is that great commercial execution I talked about Taminco and driving personal care and nutrition growth lot of that occurred in Europe, as well as a lot of the share growth we had in tires was also occurring in Europe.","And we had a mix benefit until favor Europe as well where we had more there and some less still in other places. So all that sort of came together to give you a lot of strength. The macro is fine there and automotive growth has been reasonably good as a tailwind in Europe for us but I wouldn\u2019t say we see a very strong improvement yet.","Operator","And now we will take our next question from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","John Roberts","I assume you\u2019re keeping the derivative units running in Kingsport by importing acetyl acid into the facility. Do you pay market price for that or are you able to swap to be able to get that and you\u2019ll return the swaps later on?","Curt Espeland","First of all most of our derivatives units are running on silicon hydride. So acid is something we can\u2019t convert into the hydride with some of facilities. So we are bringing a lot of acid into the side to make silicon hydride. And so we are doing everything we can to sort of keep all downstream derivative unit running which we will be able to do and meet customer needs.","Mark Costa","And the cost is going to be what the market will bear, I mean those things we\u2019re having to do with those logistics starts we\u2019re bringing in and that\u2019s all been factored into the estimates I provided.","John Roberts","And I apologize I jumped on a little bit late, but did anyone ask the obligatory question for an update on the Longview monetization strategy?","Mark Costa","John you\u2019re the lucky winner today. So just to give you an update, divesting our excess ethylene position as I said before is still one of the main priorities for us as well as potentially some of our commodity ethylene product lines.","Again as we talked before the vast majority of olefins volatility is from this ethylene position. So we are really working hard to try to get something done. We continue to have a number of engaged parties and we are working diligently to see if we can get a transaction completed.","As I also mentioned before we\u2019re exploring different options which could include sales, joint venture or other type of structures. So this combined with kind of the continued challenging market conditions has made this process take much longer than I would prefer.","Curt Espeland","And to be clear though, we are committed to getting this ethylene volatility out of the portfolio and so we're going to get this done.","Operator","Thank you. So now we'll take our next question from the queue, David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now.","David Begleiter","Mark on your 2018 guidance, when you say strong earnings growth, is that similar to what we did in '17 i.e. up roughly 10% to 12%?","Mark Costa","It's a little early to get into the specifics on the bridge of '17 to '18 and where we would be in that range, 12% is phenomenal growth this year. Some of it is being driven by some exceptional volume like solar fluid sales for example that what will repeat in that '18 but won't repeat in '19. We have another big slog coming in '19.","So there is certain dynamics on that side. The upper half of the range I don't know if that's likely at this stage from what we know. We'll have to see how it all comes together and we'll give you lot more detail in January, but you have to give us a bit of a break on this one, where we have so much going on right now. We're spending most of our time making sure we do with the event deliver great results and cash flow in the fourth quarter and position ourselves well for growth next year.","David Begleiter","Very good and Curt just on the Q4 free cash to make it $1 billion target you need to have a pretty big Q4, is that just from a release of working capital from the finished goods and do you have enough visibility to say where they\u2019ll come from specifically?","Mark Costa","Sure, again in the fourth quarter, is typically our large cash generating quarter as we do release working capital due to seasonality in the businesses. I also mentioned that the operations incident we actually think it will be cash neutral. We'll actually be reducing inventory that will offset some of the operating costs.","Maybe another way to look at it is may be this is compared to fourth quarter '16 to what we're kind of expecting now. If you look at fourth quarter of '16 we generated $289 million of free cash flow if you adjust for that $150 million of pension.","If you also look at our CapEx, it's roughly going to be $600 million. if you look at that seasonally compared to '16, we're actually expecting $90 million roughly or lower capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of '17. So when you do that math, all we need to generate free cash flow above last year's fourth quarter, either in working capital or other operating cash flows is about $50 million to achieve that $1 billion cash flow.","So that's how I look at it. We do have good visibility. There is some sensitivities that we're managing through but our goal is to work towards that billion dollars of free cash flow and grow up further 2019.","Greg Riddle","Let's make the next question the last one please.","Operator","Thank you, Sir. So the last question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Kevin McCarthy","Have you begun to receive propylene from enterprises PDH unit or when would you expect that to happen and given the surge in propylene, is there perhaps a greater benefit than we might've thought earlier this year?","Mark Costa","Kevin, we're not exactly sure when the enterprise will come up and be effective. You would have to ask them. But we certainly are expecting to have that asset supplying us as we go into next year at some point.","The benefits to us are going to be somewhat limited in the current conditions where propane price are at this time point relative to where we were originally.","Kevin McCarthy","And then as a follow-up can you comment on your utilization levels in Triton and your plans to expand capacity in 2018 and can we assume for example that the incident at Kingsport has no bearing on that timeline?","Mark Costa","Yes, the incident at Kingsport has no impact on bringing the Trident capacity up online, which we expect to do as we move finish the fourth quarter and the first quarter and the utilization at the moment is very high. We have tremendous growth and interest in that product. We're trying to support all of our customers and their desire to growth with us and that's why we make such a significant investment in doubling their capacity. So we're feeling good about that business.","Mark Costa","Just to wrap up as we close the call out, just want to put in a little bit of a commercial break for Investor Day. We're really excited about the track record we've been building and excited about what we can offer as we go forward in growing the company. And we think we've actually set up a great track record and we'll share a lot more of this with you as we get to the Investor Day.","But if you look at the past three years or back to 2014, we delivered tremendous organic growth and value from our acquisition. If you back out sort of the macro headwinds of oil currency and fibers, you\u2019d see that would be about $10 a share this year which should be 16% CAGR versus 2010 when we started this transformation, as well as 12% CAGR again 2013.","So we\u2019ll share a lot more with how that works. How you can see the organic growth and the value of the acquisitions in our portfolio, and we are really proud of how we\u2019ve managed our portfolio aggressively well ahead of the current trend divesting about 3.5 billion of revenue, almost half of it when you go back to - so when we did it and adding some great specialty businesses.","And I will work you through how we developed a very compelling organic growth engine that has three components to it around deep market connect, world class technology platforms and application development capability that bodes it together and the role of scale and integration plays and making it all that happen.","So, I think it's going to be an existing day. We\u2019re really looking forward just working through our details so you can really better understand the growth we\u2019ve delivered in the past and to be clear, I was also - the only reason I bring out this macro adjustment is, so that you're going to understand all these headwinds stabilize going forward our ability to drive growth as we move forward. But we are looking forward for it. Thank you.","Greg Riddle","Silvia, that concludes our remarks.","Operator","Thank you.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman\u2019s website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Riddle","Thanks, Margaret, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jake LaRoe, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I\u2019ll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the Company\u2019s second quarter 2018 financial results news release, during this call and in the accompanying slides, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for first quarter 2018 and the Form 10-K to be filed for second quarter 2018.","Second, earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core and unusual items and has been adjusted for the forecasted tax rate as of the end of the interim period. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the second quarter 2018 financial results news release, which can be found on our website, at www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings exclude any non-core unusual items and assume that the adjusted tax rate for first six months 2018 will be the actual tax rate for the projected periods.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning and thanks for joining us.","I\u2019ll start on slide three. We continue to make great progress in executing our strategy with strong second quarter operating results, consistent with our expectations. Our results demonstrate the strength of our specialty portfolio with 8% volume growth in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products, combined, during the quarter.","As I said many times before, we are creating our own growth through innovation and leadership in specialty markets. We\u2019re seeing excellent progress in converting our top innovation programs into commercial orders across AM and AFP. In a few moments, I\u2019ll share a couple of examples of the ways we\u2019re winning the customers through innovation and our enhanced commercial capabilities.","In addition to this especially volume growth, we are making good progress stabilizing our Fibers business, as results during the quarter and in the first half of the year demonstrate. In particular, we\u2019re making excellent progress in accelerating growth with our textiles innovation platform, leveraging our total assets into new market applications.","During the quarter, acetate yarn volumes increased by about 30%. We are expecting continued growth in the back half for the year. We continue to be disciplined in our cost management with productivity offsetting inflation, while we ramp up our investment and growth programs which are delivering above market growth.","Cash flow remains the strength as we remain on track to generate $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. And we allocated our strong free cash flow in a disciplined manner and in line with our priorities during the first half of the year. We returned $410 million to shareholders with $250 million of share repurchases and $160 of dividends. And we remain committed to make progress improving our ratio of net debt to EBITDA.","Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute what we can control. Namely, innovating through our enterprise and allocating our strong free cash flow in a disciplined manner.","On slide four, a key driver of success in growing our specialty businesses is our continued upgrade of our product mix. We are driving double-digit growth in our high-margin specialty products through execution of our innovation-driven growth model. Our top innovation programs in AM and AFP are accelerating as more customers validate our innovative, differentiated products, which is driving growth today and into the future, and improving the quality of earnings through the higher percentage coming from our specialty products.","We continue to be on track to deliver more than $350 million in new business closes this year. In fact, we saw a 25% increase in the new business close rate during the first half of 2018 and year-over-year, so off to a very strong start. Here too, the many ways we\u2019re creating our own growth, improving the quality of earnings and wining the customers.","We have talked in the past about how we leverage our diverse footprint, identify disruptive macro trends that will drive growth of 2 to 3 times the underlying market growth rates. We also talked about how we spend a lot of time to segment the market and carefully select the right partners to drive innovation and change. As a result of that, many of our core and premium products are growing faster than the market. One example that brings this approach to life in a relatively new category is our paint protection film in Advanced Materials.","We combined the technology platform from our Commonwealth acquisition with Eastman\u2019s deep capabilities in polyester and coatings, and our in-depth experience in adhesives and functional films to deliver the best product in the market. We launched the next-generation paint protection film that delivers the superior protective surface, which can virtual repair itself when scratched because of its product self-healing properties. Plus, it helps consumers\u2019 car stay cleaner longer. The market response has been tremendous. Consumers love the added functionality and channel partners appreciate the opportunity to grow their business.","And to accelerate growth on the commercial front, we\u2019ve expanded our LLumar and SunTek dealer network by 15% in the U.S., creating elite dealers who provide differentiated service to consumers.","We also increased our focus on activating a new channel, car dealerships, sell and install paint protection films as part of the car buying process, increasing distribution points by 30% in the U.S. Globally, the overall paint protection film category grew greater than 10% last year. And in 2018, we are on track to grow that business more than three times that underlying market rate.","Another example I would highlight is crop protection as part of the Taminco acquisition. In the crop protection sector, farmers want to maximize yields, which means reducing the number of plants that have fallen over, making crops difficult to harvest and producing lower yields. Eastman has introduced a premium version of the growth regulator product which was pioneered in Europe and has recently been launched in Canada. Our first year sales have exceeded our expectations. We are confident doubling those sales in Canada in 2019.","This innovative specialty product, called Adjust] which will soon be introduced in the U.S., shortens that plant and strengthens the stems, and allows for improved and earlier harvesting that maximizes yield. The product also allows for much broader application window compared to other products in the market today. This allows farmers supply Adjust throughout the year and harvest in a timely way, especially as they focus on dual cropping system such as winter and summer weed.","Both of these product launches are great examples of creating revenue synergies from our acquisitions, as we build capability in a market with compelling growth drivers where we are winning with innovation. ","With that, I will turn it over to Curt. ","Curt Espeland","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","I\u2019ll start with our second quarter corporate results on slide five. Sales revenue grew across all segments as we did a nice job driving volume growth in our more specialty product lines. This continues to demonstrate the power of our innovation-driven growth model, enabling us to deliver 2 to 3 times underlying growth in the market, and demonstrating we can grow around the globe with our specialties.","EBIT increased as higher EBIT in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products more than offset a decline in Chemical Intermediates. We are continuing to invest in growth across most of our portfolio and seeing the positive impact of those investments.","Solid earnings performance during the quarter was partially offset by $20 million of planned maintenance in our Longview site as well as $25 million impact of industrial gas supplier disruptions at both our Texas City and Longview, Texas sites.","Overall, we remain on track for strong EPS growth in 2018, reflecting the growth in our specialty businesses, stabilization of Fibers and the impact of our compelling free cash flow.","Moving next to the segment results and starting Advanced Materials on slide six, which delivered strong 10% EBIT growth in the first half of the year. For the quarter, sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume across the segment, including premium products such as Tritan copolyester, Saflex heads-up display and performance films, as well as a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. EBIT increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix as well as a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased investment in growth in higher raw material energy costs.","We continue to invest in this business, accelerating our growth spend in premium product lines like Tritan copolyester and PVB resin for Saflex heads-up display and acoustics.","For the back half of the year, we expect underlying business performance to remain strong as Advanced Materials executes its strategy of driving mid single digit volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage.","With our strong first half results and our expectations for the back half of the year, we continue to expect earnings growth to be approaching the top end of the 7% to 10% range we communicated at our Investor Day, earlier this year.","Now, to Additives & Functional Products on slide seven which had a strong second quarter and an outstanding first half of the year. Sales revenue increased, primarily due to higher sales volume across the segment, a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates, and higher selling prices more than catching to raws. Volume growth was strong in particular for animal nutrition and coatings and inks, attributed to both improved commercial execution and improving end markets. EBIT increased due to the higher sales volume and a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increased investment in growth.","Looking at full-year 2018, our expectations remain the same as the guidance on our first quarter call. Strong volume growth across the segment, well above underlying markets, driven by great commercial execution ability, and innovation. However, the second half will not be quite as strong as the first to a few factors.","In the first half of the year, a tough comp, particularly in the third quarter due to strong solar fills for heat transfer fluids in a year ago period; increased investment and growth, both new assets and growth resources; and lastly, lower industry operating rates for hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins due to a competitor capacity addition. All-in, we expect AFP\u2019s EBIT growth to be in the top-end of the 5 to 7% range we communicated at our Innovation Day.","Now to Chemical Intermediates on slide eight. Sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices attributed to higher raw material costs and continued improvement in competitive conditions. Sales volume was driven by improvement in asset yields across a range of markets and the means in agriculture and energy were more than offset by lower volume due to both planned and unplanned outages. Regarding the unplanned outages, these were supply disruptions from our industrial gas suppliers at our Texas sites. Unfortunately, the length of time required to return to normal operations was longer than committed to by our suppliers. And therefore, the magnitude of the impact, approximately $25 million, was larger than we expected earlier in the quarter. We are now back at normal operations and happy to see these unfortunate events behind us.","EBIT decreased in the quarter, primarily due to higher scheduled maintenance shutdown costs and the supplier disruptions, partially offset by higher selling prices and stronger volume in some derivatives.","Lastly, I\u2019d like to take a moment to address our excess ethylene position. We have taken steps to significantly reduce the amount of excess ethylene we produced for both this year and next. Looking to the back half of the year, we are configuring to run our crackers at reduced rates with purchased propylene only incrementally higher to support downstream derivatives. We are maximizing the propane feed in the crackers to maximize propylene production. I\u2019ll remind you that our crackers are unique in their design to make as much propylene as possible. This configuration includes leveraging a higher level of propylene inventory accumulated through the second quarter. We are also leveraging our storage capability for ethylene. As a result, our ethylene spot sales will be limited in the second half of the year.","In 2019, we are making a modest investment in our cracker flexibility to include refinery grade propylene in our feedstock slate. This enhancement will enable us to ramp up our polymer grade propylene production while dramatically reducing both our ethylene production as well as our propane purchases which minimizes Eastman\u2019s exposure to spot ethylene sales. I would also note that this project retains the flexibility to operate under normal operating conditions when market conditions improve. For the remainder of this year and next, spot ethylene price risk is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings.","So, now, looking at full-year for the segment. We expect EBIT in the second half to be similar to the first half as the costs from outages do not repeat in the second half, partially offset by normal seasonality, particularly in the fourth quarter and then less ethylene volume being sold.","I\u2019ll finish up the segment review of Fibers on slide nine, where results were in line with our expectations. Sales revenue increased due to the sale of nonwoven products, previously reported in other; higher sales volume for acetate tow, primarily attributed to customer buying patterns; and to continued growth in our textiles innovation platform.","EBIT increased slightly due to higher sales volume and earnings from nonwoven innovation platform products, mostly offset by lower selling prices, particularly for acetate tow, and an increased investment in growth including costs previously reported in other.","As was mentioned earlier, we are making excellent progress on our growth initiatives, which is a significant contributor to stabilizing this business.","Looking at the full-year, we expect EBIT to be stable compared to last year. Acetate tow volume is expected to be stable for the year. The impact of our productivity gains will continue to flow through. And the progress of our growth initiatives will contribute to earnings stability. Of course, we had a tough comp in the third quarter due to customer buying patterns last year. But sequentially, we expect third quarter to be about the same as second; and the full-year, we expect EBIT to be about the same as the prior year.","On slide 10, I\u2019ll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for second quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with first six months operating cash flow of $408 million. Capital expenditures for the first half of 2018 totaled $244 million. We continue to expect our full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million. And we remain confident in our ability to generate $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year.","Looking at the balance sheet. We continue to expect to use $300 million of our free cash flow to reduce debt this year, which we expect will occur in the second half of the year. Additionally, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Through the first six months, we returned $410 million through a $160 million in dividends and $250 million in share repurchases.","We expect our full-year tax rate to be approximately 18% at the bottom of our previous range, reflecting the continued benefits of our improved business operations and resulting impact of expected tax events. As a whole, our first half results gives us confidence that we are on track with our strategy.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks Curt.","On slide 11, I\u2019ll discuss our 2018 outlook, which is consistent with what we told you before. As you\u2019ve seen from the strong volume growth in our specialty segments in the first half of the year, we continue benefit from the high-value innovative products with leading positions in attractive niche markets. We are also delivering revenue synergies of our acquired businesses, through improvements in our commercial execution capabilities and leveraging our combined technical capabilities to accelerate new product introductions.","Our continued aggressive productivity is expected to more than offset inflation, and we\u2019re investing a portion of that savings in our growth initiatives. Our refinery grade propylene investment to improve our cracker flexibility significantly reduces our exposure to ethylene price risk, while keeping the upside available. And the improvement in our tax rate is also contributing to growth.","Finally, disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to accelerate our share repurchase program in 2018 compared with 2017.","Putting this all together, our expectations for EPS growth remain the same at 10% to 14% compared with 2017 and will likely be in the middle of this range. Our underlying performance is strong as we focus on the things that we can control. And as Curt noted, third quarter is a tough comp to last year.","One sensitivity is trade and the tariffs that could be implemented by the U.S. and China in the coming months. At this point, we see no exposure to any of the U.S. tariffs that have been implemented or proposed, which highlights another benefit of our vertical integration for most of our raw materials. Regarding the proposed tariffs, we see some modest but manageable exposure with our mitigating actions. When we consider this potential impact, we expect to be safely in the range of our guidance.","Last, we remain committed to our $1.1 billion of free cash flow target, which is one of the strongest in the industry.","On slide 12, I will summarize where we are. As you think about our portfolio, we continue to march down the path to make two specialties businesses a much bigger percentage of the total with our goal of driving from 70% towards 80%, and are making great progress in stabilizing Fibers and reducing volatility in CI. This all comes together for a terrific bottom-line. We can grow faster than the underlying market.","We can sustain and improve our margins through mix upgrade. We view this through our unique innovation-driven growth model which is at the heart of how we win. We also view this through scale and integration, and investing in the unique capabilities we have in place to drive it; and finally, through our disciplined portfolio management. That leads you to one of the strongest free cash flows in the industry. Our strong return on invested capital is growing, and a compelling compounded EPS growth rates for 2020 and beyond. When you put this all together, we are well-positioned for long-term attractive earnings growth, sustainable value creation for our owners.","With that, I will turn it back to Greg.","Greg Riddle","Thank you, Mark. As usual, we\u2019ve got a number of people on the line this morning. And we\u2019d really like to get to as many questions as possible. So, I ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And Margaret, with that, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We can now take our first question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning everyone. So, just curious on the adhesives competitive activity, just if you have any more visibility into that yet. I know, these plant start-ups can move around and what you have. But, is it proceeding as anticipated?","Mark Costa","We -- the plant that was completed by our competitor, effectively came on line towards the end of the second half -- first half of the year, so sort of recently. So, we are expecting some impact there as they bring that capacity on line. But, I would remind you that while they added a lot of capacity, demand growth has been incredibly strong in this business, underlying market is 5% to 7%. There is a lot of pent-up demand because the market was -- capacity wasn\u2019t available. So, we are seeing sort of leap in demand just because there was a need to use this product. And then, rosin to resin conversion is accelerating as the market is looking for an odor-free water-white kind of adhesive which you can\u2019t get with rosins. So, it\u2019s important to keep in mind, the rosin market is as big as the resin market. So, all those things combined together to give us confidence that demand will fill this point out relatively quickly. But, there are some limitations on how we can manage price upward right now relative to an increasing raw material environment with oil increasing. But overall, it\u2019s actually playing out as we expected.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, great. And then, Curt, if I could just ask you on the free cash flow, just looking at the cash flow statement, I cannot recall this either happened last year or 2016, I can\u2019t remember. But your cash flow from operations is actually a bit lower this year versus last year, and it looks like from working capital, receivables, inventories, but what -- sort of one, sort of why is that happening? And then, two, remind us of the mechanism of how you make that up in the second half of the year? Is it just seasonality or what\u2019s going on?","Curt Espeland","Sure, Vince. No problem. Yes, it\u2019s normal for our seasonal increase in working capital the first half of \u201818; it\u2019s probably little more dramatic this year than last year just because of the rising raw material environment, as well as stronger sales, which is a good problem to have, by the way. So, as you think about those stronger sales and higher input costs flowing to the system, that did have a kind of a net negative impact on free cash flow first half of the year as well as some lingering negative impact from the coal operational incident in the first half of this year.","So, if you think about the trend in the second half of the year, cash flows will be expected to improve. One, as you expect, working capital needs will reverse, especially in the fourth quarter. The net proceeds from the insurance, from the operational incident, we do expect some of that more in the second half or as the costs are pretty much now behind us. And also don\u2019t forget, we expect a reduction of capital expenditures of a $100 million for the year. You only saw $30 million of that in the first half of the year. So, you will see a $70 million impact of reduced capital expenditures in the second half of the year, on a year-over-year basis.","So, again, we remain on track to generate $1 billion of free cash flow in 2018, continuing to demonstrate the quality of the portfolio and our capabilities. There has been no material change in our free cash flow goals, and we\u2019re excited about what we can deliver.","Vincent Andrews","And just to be clear, that was $1.1 billion?","Mark Costa","I\u2019m sorry. Yes. To be clear, $1.1 billion is free cash flow. ","Operator","We can now take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Mark, since you last gave guidance back in April, FX, and spot ethylene margins have gotten worse. So, could you tell us, in terms of your second half guidance expectations, what\u2019s the negative impact -- or the impact of the deterioration, both those metrics since your last guidance?","Mark Costa","Well, thanks, David. So, first of all, I think we\u2019re on track for tremendous earnings growth for the year, 10 to 14%, middle of that range is great results, improvement in tax to help a bit as well in the back half. So, we feel great about what we\u2019re doing on earnings growth. And the second half is a bit different than the first half. As you noted, with ethylene, the prices of ethylene are quite low right now. And we\u2019ve made all these investments and changes to avoid basically participating on spot market and not incur those negative margins. So that\u2019s actually quite helpful, but of course you have less volume we\u2019re selling relative to last year. So, that\u2019s a change from where we were in April.","When you think about the specialty businesses, very much on track, consistent with everything we said. We see strong volume and variable margin growth. Some of that\u2019s tamped down a bit by the growth investments we\u2019re making, and that are accelerating as we go through the year. So, that weighs a bit more on margins in the back half versus the first half. So, you see a bit of that dynamic going on. But, overall, it feels like we\u2019re much on track and that ethylene headwind is not as material on that.","Curt Espeland","And David on the currency, you think about that, that\u2019s predominantly the euro. The currency was a tailwind for us first half year-over-year. But we see rates -- if they stand where they are now, it\u2019s neither a headwind or a tailwind for the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis.","David Begleiter","Understood. And Mark, just on Advanced Materials, you didn\u2019t get any pricing any Q2. So, where do you stand in that segment price versus raws?","Mark Costa","First of all, Advanced Materials had a great first half of the year with 10% earnings growth and very much of strategy. We\u2019ve told you all along that our focus in this business is driving volume and mix upgrade every year, consistently for many years now, and we demonstrated another strong performance on that front.","So, as you look at the margins in AM, you have margins actually improving as that mix upgrade delivers value year-over-year and sequentially. That\u2019s then been offset by the increased gross spend. And just to step back to corporate level for a second, we\u2019ve told you that we are increasing our growth spend between the new operating assets we\u2019re bringing on line like Tritan and PVB assets in AM as well as Crystex plant and ketones expansion in AFP. So, overall, we\u2019re at the high end of that range of about $50 million of growth spend for the Company, on an annual basis.","That actually divides out across the segments, roughly $25 million in AM, $20 million in AFP, and about $5 million in Fibers of additional spend. So, when you take that sort of $25 million and realize it\u2019s ramping up, so not much of that was in the first quarter, but it\u2019s ramping up in the third through fourth.","The margins of mix improvement that we delivered year-over-year and sequentially, were offset by about a 100 basis points of higher gross spend in the second quarter. So, that sort of nets each other out. And the great thing about that is the trends in the fixed cost leverage as we forward. So, we don\u2019t expect the same step up in investment -- growth investments next year across the Company that you are seeing this year. There\u2019ll be some carryover from this year of course, but there is no big next step in terms of gross margin lever. So that sort of deals with some of the margin story.","On the actual pricing side of the equation, David. We had great success in increasing prices with raw materials on the polyester side of the equation and they are doing just fine. The spreads are holding in quite well.","The place where we offset that is as we discussed at Innovation Day, we intentionally had some price concessions in the interlayer business in the annual contract negotiations last fall to achieve significantly improved mix on our heads-up display and acoustic sales that are much higher margins than our standard. So, while we gave up some price, we gained significantly on the mix and earnings as a result of that, which is consistent with our strategy. So, everything in AM is playing out exactly as we intended, driving a lot of earnings growth. And from both the first half of the year or on a full year basis being at the high end of our guidance range is very attractive growth.","Operator","We can now take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. In your commentary, I think, you said that because of some supplier difficulties that cost you $25 million and maybe there is some another 25 from turnaround. So, basically, are you saying that you would have earned $50 million more in the second quarter, if you hadn\u2019t had these events? And maybe you can place that in context. In other words, what\u2019s the normal maintenance spending or the normal outage costs, such that we can gauge whether this is a normal event for Eastman or this is above average?","Mark Costa","Sure. So, to answer your question, if we take second quarter by itself that the supplier disruption was -- cost us about $25 million and the maintenance spend would have been -- was 20. So, if you didn\u2019t have both of those events, yes. Our earnings would have been up 45. But normally, if you look at total maintenance for the year, for this year compared to last year, it\u2019s about the same. So, this is more about timing within a year. And so, that\u2019s why it was more $20 million in the second quarter. Greg, do you want to add something?","Greg Riddle","Just from a planned maintenance standpoint, it was about the same, the supplier prior disruption was certainly in addition to what would be normal for the year.","Jeff Zekauskas","So, for my follow-up, the conceptualization of Eastman by management is that the quality of the business is getting better. But, there really hasn\u2019t been any material change in the overall gross margin of Eastman. Is your idea that the quality of the business is going to be better and that your gross margins are going to rise to -- I don\u2019t know, 30%, instead of 25, or is the idea that the natural rate of volume growth will be faster because of new initiatives you have, so there isn\u2019t really much margin difference? ","Curt Espeland","So, Jeff, no, the idea is very much that the gross margins are going to get better. And certainly, if you exclude the operational outages, we are -- I am just going to make this on a full year basis, Jeff. When you exclude the operational outages that we\u2019ve incurred and think about that $50 million of gross spend that we are investing for future growth this year, the gross margins this year are quite better. And so, as you move into next year, you are going to see that happen because obviously we don\u2019t intend to have the same operational problems as well as the fixed costs are going step up again next year. So, the variable margin grows, creates leverage, fixed gross margins will improve. So, there is every intention that those gross margins are getting better as we move forward.","Mark Costa","And if I could add, Jeff, two things. Yes, we do expect that volume better than market because of innovation program. I would also remind you, because it works the opposite way as input costs came down, so did revenue. In the future, revenue is going to up and thus by nature even as we grow gross margin dollars, the fixed percentage could move around a little bit on it just because of that inflationary pressure. We really look at it as a gross margin as a per unit basis, and we are seeing good growth in that per unit basis.","Operator","We can now take our next question from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov","Could you give us an update on your Crystex technology project, where does it stand currently?","Mark Costa","Sure. So, Crystex is on line, producing inspect material with our new Cure and Cure Pro products that provide far superior performance to what\u2019s available in the marketplace from any one, including our own historical technology, much better thermal stability, much better dispersion. Customers are verifying and validating significant improvement in their manufacturing efficiency using the product. So, we feel great about the program.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you, Mark. And then, just to follow-up on comments on refinery-grade propylene. Are you -- what are you actually doing there? Are you adding capacity to convert refinery-grade to chemical-grade, is it some new capability that you are adding? And could you just explain what\u2019s happening there?","Mark Costa","Sure. So, it\u2019s been enabled by the shutdown we just completed. So, we are modifying the front end of our cracker and refining capability on the front end to be able to add RGP to the mix instead of just using ethane and propane. And the great thing about this story is we had to make some large capital investments as all of you know in our two smaller crackers for safety reasons. And this was the second cracker that we just finished modifying. It made available equipment that was being used historically, now not needed. And we can modify that equipment to now be the refining capability for RGP to include in the mix. So, it\u2019s a modest capital investment that normally would have cost significantly more amount of capital, taking a lot longer time to do. But now, we can do it quickly and have it on line by the end of the year. And so, it\u2019s a great flexibility.","So, now, we can move some of our exposure to an RGP, PGP spread, which is much more stable than where olefin prices and propane have been, reduce the ethylene dramatically that we produce which we\u2019ve never wanted to make. You have to remember, our entire strategy is based on making propylene and specialty propylene derivates. So, it sort of gives us the flexibility to be out of that market. But, it\u2019s very flexible to switch back. So, we can move back towards ethylene, if the prices get attractive. And as you look at it, when the ethylene export capacity comes on line in 2020, it probably will be attractive again.","Operator","Next question comes from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.","PJ Juvekar","Mark, as ethylene prices fell, you\u2019re taking some downtime at the crackers, you\u2019re investing in CapEx to change your feedstocks. How does it impact your sale process of the crackers? And have you thought about shutting down the smallest cracker?","Curt Espeland","I\u2019ll start with the sale process, PJ, this is Curt. Just a reminder, again, I want to reemphasize what Mark\u2019s already said. Our crackers are still good, reliable assets that have created that competitive advantage for our high-value propylene derivates by leveraging shale gas. And so, the primary objective of our recent efforts was to monetize our excess ethylene position and then potentially certain ethylene derivates to eliminate their earnings volatility that came from those products. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve engaged with multiple parties on a variety of options to sell or otherwise monetize this excess ethylene. However, current marketing conditions, combined with the current geopolitical environment on trade have made it very difficult to move forward at this time. Until conditions improve, we have taken these steps then to such that spot ethylene prices will not have a material impact on the earnings the remainder of this year and going into 2019.","Mark Costa","And then, for your question on the crackers, we are shifting the mix hard, we are going to reduce rates on the crackers. And until this investment is in place for next year, because we accumulated so much propylene inventory and have some storage available for ethylene, we\u2019re able to mitigate the need to buy much additional propylene than normal, which is great, even though we\u2019re reducing the cracker run rates and avoid selling ethylene in the market at these prices.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you. And just as a follow-up, in Advanced Materials, you had 9% volume growth, but pricing seem to have lagged for last couple of quarters. You talked about price introduction in heads-up display products. What\u2019s going on with pricing in Tritan and Saflex and other products in that segment? Thank you.","Mark Costa","Yes. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re managing a complex mix there, right. So, mix improved dramatically, as it has for years now, improving margins in that segment. We have offset that with about 100 basis points increase in growth investments. So, those sort of net out and prices didn\u2019t increase. What I said is, they increased across the polyester spectrum. So, we are increasing prices there and keeping up with raws, no issue there, doing a great job by the commercial teams there. But, we did intentionally reduce prices on the interlayer products. So, that sort of netted out.","Operator","We can now take our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Just curious on the outlook here, you have a slightly lower tax rate. I guess, that\u2019s on our math around $0.03 to $0.05 or so. You\u2019re still guiding to the midpoint of the range. So, I guess, would you characterize potentially some of the swing factors may be for us? I guess, is it mainly FX and then I guess some raw material headwinds or how do you kind of look at that?","Mark Costa","So, just to clarify, you\u2019re asking about the outlook for the second half of the year and those factors and how it impacts it?","Arun Viswanathan","Yes. Thank you.","Mark Costa","So, from a second half, your point of view, first of all, it starts with the tough comp. So, last year, we had incredibly strong volume in some areas of the Company. So, the solar fills that we mentioned to you in the higher -- the share gain we got in the last, the second half of last year due to environmental enforcement in AFP. As well as we noted, the customer buying patterns being a bit high in the third quarter last year in tow, which won\u2019t repeat this year. And then, of course, we\u2019re not selling ethylene. We sold a bunch of ethylene last year at some margin and this year we\u2019re not selling it. So, those all create a tough comp relative to last year. So, that\u2019s the largest difference year-over-year.","Second is you\u2019ve got the higher gross spend this year that\u2019s been accelerating through the first half of the year and continues into next -- into the second half. And then, you have some margin coming off in adhesives, as we\u2019ve discussed a few moments ago. So, those all sort of play into why the second half doesn\u2019t grow as fast as the first half. And as Curt noted, currency isn\u2019t the tailwind. So, they\u2019re all dynamics, they don\u2019t give us any concerns. We still feel we are on track to deliver very strong growth this year and well-positioned to grow into next year. You got to remember the operational problems, unplanned and the growth investments are all fixed cost leverage next year as we continue to grow variable margin.","Curt Espeland","And if I could add on top of it. When I think about the second half of the year, Arun, the way I look at that is that some moving parts that Mark described, but generally speaking, our outlook for the second half of the year hasn\u2019t changed. And then, on top of that, you have about $0.05 benefit from tax. So, that\u2019s how I look at the outlook for the second half of the year.","Mark Costa","Yes. We think we\u2019ll hold on to that benefit on the tax side.","Arun Viswanathan","And then, just wanted to get your thoughts, I guess longer term. Would you consider something potentially more creative on the ethylene side, either an asset swap or something, or would you even consider maybe down the line at some point, looking into constructing a PDH unit?","Mark Costa","Well, if we look at -- the good thing is that I would argue we\u2019ve come up with a pretty creative option to deal with ethylene right now. And so, that kind of takes care of that ethylene volatility risk, which as a reminder is the primary driver of volatility within the Chemical Intermediates group. So, we\u2019ve done a pretty creative thing now. That buys us time to see how market conditions improve and see whether the sell option goes back to life or other options maybe available to us. But right now, I think we\u2019ve been pretty creative in dealing with our excess ethylene issue.","Arun Viswanathan","No. I understand. I just wondered if you\u2019d potentially consider constructing a PDH unit. Thanks.","Mark Costa","We are not looking at capital deployment on the Chemical Intermediates side. We always develop [ph] that construction capacity but no Greenfield expansions. Our strategy is growing, investing in specialty businesses. We are delivering tremendous volume and mix improvement across AM and AFP and accelerating growth in Fibers. So, that\u2019s where our capital is focused, plus bolt-on M&A, if it\u2019s not share repurchases.","Operator","We can now take our next question from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Bob Koort","One of the giant guys over in Germany had some comments today that I thought were kind of interesting. I am curious about the Eastman philosophy. And the question or the comment was basically, there are some specialty markets where if you react too aggressively to raw material inflation, it sort of comprises or could compromise the value-add approach to a product line. And therefore, when the raws go the other way, you start get back some relief. Just curious when you think about your portfolio, how do you differentiate across that portfolio and the ability to get price to recover some of these raw materials?","Mark Costa","So, Bob, it\u2019s a great question and a really important one when we really get into the nuances of running a great specialty business which I think we\u2019ve built. You have to be very thoughtful about how you manage prices with your customers because you want to capture the value for the products that you have, you want to treat your customers with respect because they are aware of how raw materials change both up and down. But most importantly, you want to keep them highly engaged to continue to working with you on innovation, right? The vast majority of innovation isn\u2019t with new customers, it\u2019s with existing customers helping bring them additional new products. So, you have to -- in the tires business, the coatings business, the glass business, you got the same set of customers of a very long time. So, that has to be a very collaborative relationship that includes working on innovation.","So, yes, you are careful about how you manage price, and you want to provide price stability to them. So, when raws go up, you increase prices but you do it carefully and you don\u2019t be abusive about it. And when raws go down, you hold on to some of the value but ultimately you have to share some of it. And if you go back to our transcripts over the last three years, I think I\u2019ve been pretty consistent in talking about that and how we\u2019ve managed it, both in \u201815 and \u201816 and how we\u2019ve managed it over the last couple of years. But, what I would highlight is we have done a great job in managing price relative to raws. Especially in CI and AFP right now, we\u2019ve done a -- we\u2019ve been able to keep pace with raws and distribution costs. And I think, I fairly covered the AM discussion on that topic where we are doing great in polyesters and made some intentional choices to improve mix with our customers. So, yes, you got to think about that and be very careful in what you do.","Bob Koort","And then, you acknowledged that there has been some price down on your auto interlayer business. Is that a one-time event, is that something that we should expect to continue and then you offset it as you are saying by seeking out mix benefit? Is this one-time correction, because they\u2019re under a little bit of pressure? Can you give us some help there?","Mark Costa","Sure. So, the nature of that business is, as we shared with you at Innovation Day, the price difference between our premium products and our sort of standard products in that segment are quite different. So, as you gain scale and efficiency in making these premium products, you tend to give back a little bit of price on those premium products as they are buying significantly more volume, and your cost efficiency is also higher from a fixed cost leverage point of view as they grow. So, from a margin point of view, you are not taking much of a hit, but you do have to share some of that -- sort of value created by them, buying a lot more with some price reduction. So, there is always a natural amount of that that occurs, happened last year, happened this year. There will be a little bit of it next year. The tricky part is, if you put these annual contracts in place and if you go back to what we were negotiating in the fall, raws of our -- come in a bit higher than we expected this year. The key drivers of raw material prices for interlayers is international ethylene prices, not local, and acetic acid prices, because we\u2019re buying them and PVOH. So, you can imagine that\u2019s created some pressure relative to where we thought we were last year. That part of the story that it\u2019s -- the key thing is focus on the 9% volume and mix that is a significant upgrade in margins. And when you back out the gross investments, the margins are great.","Operator","Next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead. ","John Roberts","Thank you. Good morning. In Chemical Intermediates, you noted higher pricing in acetyl derivatives. Celanese has this initiative in their acetyls business to connect producers and customers, which they talk about in network terms like activating nodes. Are you participating in something similar and is that contributing to the higher pricing that you\u2019re talking about?","Mark Costa","So, first, acetic acid is not a priority business for us. We have a huge acetyl stream that is focused on producing acid anhydride. Acetic acid is a co-product of our downstream derivative operations that we have to sell to sort of clear the system. So, we\u2019re not in the global acetyl business like some other people are. We\u2019re really in a sort of North American centric acetic acid business where we\u2019re clearing up the co-product in our operations. So, just entirely different business model relative to what Celanese referred to. The reality is just prices are higher in acetic acid right now due to decent demand growth in that business as well as a number of supplier outages, both here including us for a while and BP and people in China. So, that\u2019s really driven the improvement in acetyl pricing for us versus the very different business model that Celanese has here, because our acidic anhydride isn\u2019t about selling it, right, it\u2019s about converting it, all the specialties downstream and we sell what\u2019s left over. So, it\u2019s just entirely different business model.","John Roberts","And then, secondly, do you need to make bolt-on acquisition at some point in specialty ag chemicals? Today, you highlighted the growth stimulation, growth regulation products; earlier you highlighted the animal nutrition additives you have. But, it doesn\u2019t seem like you have critical mass and it\u2019s much smaller than many of the other Eastman businesses?","Mark Costa","Yes. It\u2019s a great business, and it was under invested in, especially in the animal nutrition side. So, we\u2019ve been able to add a lot or organic capability and commercially taking it from a European to more of a global business and accelerating product development by combining our technology people with theirs. So, we feel good about what we\u2019re getting done in organic. You\u2019re right. We\u2019re not a big player in that space. This is an area where we\u2019d be open to sort of bolt-on M&A. But we\u2019re very-disciplined. So, we\u2019ll have to see if there is M&A out there in the marketplace here and other places that we\u2019re looking that meet our financial criteria, not just our strategic one. And we continue to look for those opportunities, but we\u2019re going to be careful we don\u2019t overpay.","Operator","Next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jim Sheehan","Good morning. Can you talk about the tone of business so far in third quarter? Are there any changes, positive or negative?","Mark Costa","Business is continuing as expected. So, demand -- primary demand is -- in the marketplace continues to be solid around the world. Obviously, things like tax reform and less regulation here, recovering Europe helps. Tax -- concerns around trade are creating some caution, but overall that\u2019s good. Most importantly, we\u2019re focused on creating our own growth and have demonstrated our ability to grow sort of two to three times the underlying industrial production rates. And so, we feel great about how we are continuing to create our own growth and drive growth and how that continues into 2019. That\u2019s been the center of our strategy. I think, our growth model is alive and well and demonstrating value every day.","Jim Sheehan","And can you talk about the BP distribution agreement that was announced? What was the strategic rationale for that and how do you expect it to impact your business?","Mark Costa","As I mentioned, acetic acid is not a on-purpose business, it\u2019s a co-product, and we already relationship with BP at our Texas City site, and we\u2019re able to find way to work with them to sort represent and sell our non-specialty acetic acid in a more efficient manner, it gives us some earnings upside relative to what we could do with our position in the market. So, it just made sense.","Operator","Next question comes from Lawrence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Alexander","Good morning. Two questions. One, can you quantify the spread between price in raws, excluding Chemical Intermediates or in aggregate? And secondly, do you see any signs of an inventory overhang in either crop chemicals or automotive and I guess on automotive particularly in Europe, but I guess any perspective on those two markets? ","Mark Costa","I\u2019ll answer your second question first and then ask for clarification on the first. So, on your second question, Lawrence, we don\u2019t see any inventory overhang in the marketplace that we are aware of. I am not sure I understood your first question. Could you repeat it?","Lawrence Alexander","I might have missed it earlier. Did you -- have quantified the spread between your realized pricing in your raw material cost inflation in Q2?","Mark Costa","No, we don\u2019t provide that kind of detail. What I can tell you is AFP and CI they\u2019ve done a great job of managing price relative to raws and distribution costs. In fact, their margins per KG are up a little bit. To remind you, as Curt noted, when raw materials go up and you hold your spreads constant, your margin percentage goes down because just of the math. But, we\u2019re doing a great job in those two areas. And as -- and I think we have fairly discussed the AM topic and how we\u2019re managing the total margin there.","So, overall, I feel like we\u2019re in better shape than we ever have been on how we\u2019re managing price relative to raws.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good morning. So, Mark, you\u2019ve got a lot going on at Longview. You mentioned throttling back on the cracker, operating rates changing the feedstock mix to be increasingly geared to propane feed, and then the RGP investment. If we were to boil all that down, what is the net impact on your net short position in propylene going forward?","Mark Costa","So, for this year, it has no impact. We have to incrementally increase our propylene purchases relative to last year with all the actions that we are taking. So, even though we\u2019re obviously reducing our cracker run rate to some degree and not selling ethylene through the combination actions we\u2019ve taken, we\u2019re not incurring a material increase in purchase propylene costs, which is great.","And second, with the RGP investment next year, we would buy less propylene than this year because of leveraging the RGP to make propylene. So, it mitigates some of that exposure for us, improves our spread exposure by getting into the RGP, PGP game versus propane to propylene and reduces ethylene production. So, it\u2019s a win on all fronts.","Curt Espeland","And Kevin, if I could add, just, as you think about that change of mix, most of the benefit of that change is going to felt in Chemical Intermediates. There will be a little hurt moving to AFP as we see some of the additional costs from the crackers running at reduced rates. But generally good, positive, mostly in CI, a little hurt in AFP going forward.","Kevin McCarthy","That\u2019s helpful. And then, as a follow-up, I think, you mentioned that you anticipate operating earnings in CI in the second half to be roughly equal to the first half. Can you help us out a little bit with the expected quarterly cadence? For example, was there any spillover in July from the various supplier disruptions that you indicated and the actions you are taking in Longview? How should we think about kind of 3Q versus 4Q there?","Mark Costa","Yes. I think, if you look at the seasonal trend, Kevin, yes, there is some spillover, but we are expecting some of that to moderate. And you will see most of that seasonal impact in the fourth quarter.","Greg Riddle","I think the last question or the next question -- excuse me, the last one, please?","Operator","Last question from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Matthew Blair","I am not sure if I heard this correctly. But, was there a comment that you are looking to accelerate share repurchases in 2018? And if so, could you share your target here? I know, you have the $2 billion share repurchase target for 2018 through 2020. And then, may be related to that. In our slides, you mentioned a $300 million debt reduction target for this year. I want to say that that used to be more like $350 million. So, is this just a case of a little bit less debt reduction this year, a little bit more repurchases?","Curt Espeland","Yes, Matt. So, first of all, it starts with $1.1 billion of free cash flow. But, what Mark was talking about acceleration was we\u2019re doing more share repurchases in 2018 than we did in 2017. Part of that is less de-leveraging. So, we are targeting $300 million this year versus we did $350 million last year. So, you\u2019ve got the combination of growth in free cash flow, little less de-leveraging, and attractive dividends, that leaves a lot of free cash flow available to do share repurchases in absence of a bolt-on acquisition.","Mark Costa","I would just emphasize the $1.1 billion of free cash flow, as we wrap things up. But, no, we feel great about strategy, we feel great about the progress we\u2019re making on the volume and mix improvement driving earnings growth this year and positioning us really well for growth next year, and obviously cash has been great and we will continue on the track that we committed to at the beginning of the year.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. There will be a replay online this afternoon. Thanks again.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay, thank you, Michael. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Josh Morgan, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 4 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are, or will be, detailed in the company's first quarter 2013 financial results news release and in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-K filed for 2012 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for first quarter 2013.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation include Solutia acquisition-related costs and charges. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in our first quarter financial results news release, which can be found at eastman.com in the Investors section.","Projections of future earnings in the presentation exclude mark-to-market pension and OPEB losses and gains, Solutia integration costs and any asset impairments and restructuring charges.","Third, this presentation includes revenues and operating earnings on a pro forma combined basis, assuming the acquisition of Solutia had been completed prior to first quarter 2012 that compare post-acquisition results to pre-acquisition pro forma combined results. More information on pro forma combined results is in our first quarter 2013 financial results news release.","And lastly, we've posted slides that accompany our remarks for this morning's call on our website in the Presentations and Events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. Let's go over to Slide 3. As is my normal practice on these calls, I'll take just a moment upfront to provide an update on our most recent outlook statements.","First of all, we continue to make good progress on the Solutia integration. Curt will provide you with more color in his section, but I just want to reiterate how pleased I am with how the integration is going and how well these businesses and our cultures are coming together to create value.","Next, in February, we raised our full year 2013 EPS expectation to a range of $6.30 to $6.40, which would be a 17% and 19% growth rate over 2012. And today we're reaffirming that guidance as, on balance, our portfolio of businesses continues to perform well despite an uncertain economic environment.","We also said we expected to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow in 2013 and we're right on track to achieve that target.","Finally, we committed to remain disciplined in our capital allocation. And if you look at how we've put capital to work this quarter and really look at our track record over the last few years, I hope you would agree that we have remained disciplined and focused on the returns.","On Slide 4, I'm reviewing the Eastman corporate results. Operating earnings increased first quarter 2013 versus first quarter 2012 with lower raw material and energy costs more than offset lower selling prices. For example, propane prices declined over 30% year-over-year, while on a corporate basis, total corporate selling prices declined by 1%. Almost all segments had higher year-over-year earnings with the largest increases being in Specialty Fluids & Intermediates and Fibers. And our operating margin increased to 17.5% almost a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. So first quarter EPS was $1.62, an increase of almost 1\/3 compared with the year-ago quarter. First quarter earnings were a strong start to the year in what remains a difficult and unpredictable global economic environment.","On Slide 5, I'll highlight our results by geographic region. As you can see the U.S. and Canada remains our largest region on a percent of revenue basis with Asia Pac, a strong second, and then Europe and Latin America. Revenue in North America was down about 5%, but this was a typical price\/raw story. As I mentioned earlier, propane down over 30% year-over-year in the quarter and this resulted in some lower prices for derivatives in the U.S. Asia Pacific revenue was up 11% and the increase was a combination of both volume and price. There was particular strength in our Fibers, Advanced Materials and Specialty Fluids & Intermediates segments, with the SFI improvement coming against an easier comp in first quarter 2012.","Revenue in Europe was down 3%, and given the state of their economy, this was solid performance, in my opinion. And Latin America revenue was down $4 million or about 3% as well. We continue to see our geographic diversity as a source of strength for our portfolio and our first quarter results are indicative of that.","Moving next to the segments in the Slide 6, where I'll begin with Additives & Functional Products. Sales revenue increased, primarily due to higher sales volume. This was particularly true for solvents as we are benefiting from a strengthening U.S. building and construction market. For tire additives, both in soluble sulfurs and anti-degradants, volume was relatively flat. And given our estimate that global tire market demand was about flat year-over-year in the first quarter, we feel good about holding our share here. And this positions us well for when the market inevitably begins to restock inventories as tires need to be replaced. I'd also add for the anti-degradants business that we are in the process of implementing a price increase to try and recover some of the margin loss to significantly higher benzene costs.","Operating earnings for the segment increased slightly as lower raw material and energy costs and the higher sales volume were partially offset by lower selling prices. We also had lower capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2013 for rubber additives as back in the first quarter of 2012 the business was preparing for expected outages and increases in demand. So it was a tough comp for rubber additives.","The operating margin for the quarter remained at just under 24%. And looking at the full year, we continue to expect operating earnings of approximately $410 million, which would be a strong result in a challenging economic environment. So overall, I'd say Bradwick [ph] and his team are doing an excellent job with this segment.","Moving next to Slide 7 in Adhesives & Plasticizers. First quarter results were disappointing in this segment due to several factors. For adhesive resin product lines, unfavorable trends in both demand and supply impacted our results. On the demand side, the consumables market, particularly packaging, continues to be soft. And on the supply side, greater availability of key raw materials helped to loosen the non-hydrogenated market while lower-priced competitive material was also a headwind.","For plasticizers, we are facing aggressive, competitive pricing from both manufacturers of phthalate-based plasticizers trying to defend market share, as well Asian producers who, in response to slower growth at home, have increased exports to Europe and the U.S.","While we expect operating earnings to -- operating earnings to increase sequentially in the second quarter and for first quarter results to be the lowest quarter of the year in 2013, we are reducing our full year operating earnings guidance for this segment to approximately $225 million. With that said, we remain confident in 2 secular trends that will continue to drive growth for this business. First, solid growth from increased use of hygiene products, such as diapers, in fast expending markets, particularly Asia. And increased usage of hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins in case and carton packaging adhesives. And second, substitution of phthalate plasticizers with non-phthalate plasticizers in Europe and the U.S. But to get back to the kind of earnings we expect from this segment, we're also going to need stronger global economic growth to help as well.","Advanced Materials is on Slide 8. And it bounced back from a tough fourth quarter to report solid first quarter results. Year-over-year, sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume particularly for interlayer product lines and Tritan copolyester. And to give you an example, Tritan volume was up about 40% year-over-year, mainly in the durable goods market.","Operating earnings increased due to the higher volume and improved product mix. We're selling more premium products in this segment, acoustic interlayers, Tritan copolyester, V-Kool-branded window films and this is driving mix improvement and earnings growth. The operating margin for the quarter improved year-over-year to just over 11%.","For full year 2013, the Advanced Materials segment continues to be faced with a challenging business climate, including weakness in Europe and lower demand for packaging. Despite that, we expect operating earnings will approach $250 million for the year driven by the improving product mix and higher asset utilization.","Next is Fibers on Slide 9. And it seems each quarter the results set the bar even higher. Revenue increased with both volume and price up. Earnings were a quarterly record at $114 million. In addition, the higher volume in prices, operational performance has been excellent with our asset tail stream running at a very high-level and benefiting from the de-bottlenecks we completed last year, which are resulting in lower unit cost.","For full year 2013, we are raising our earnings expectation to approximately $430 million and we expect earnings to be slightly higher in the first half of the year compared with second half based on how price and raw material and energy costs flow through our accounting system.","Lastly, to update our progress on our joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation to expand acetate tow capacity in China. I can report that we're on track for the facility to come online during the third quarter. We expect qualification of material will take place through the end of this year. And therefore, we expect to begin seeing earnings through our equity investment in the joint venture in early 2014.","I'll finish up the segments on Slide 10 with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates. Operating earnings increased significantly year-over-year due to lower raw material and energy costs primarily for propane, which were partially offset by lower selling prices. The operating margin for the quarter was just under 16%, an increase of about 400 basis points over the prior year quarter. Sequentially, operating earnings increased slightly going from $93 million in fourth quarter '12 to $95 million in the first quarter this year. You'll recall that we had an operational issue at one of our olefin cracking units in the fourth quarter that had a slight negative impact in those results. Well, we also had a separate issue with one of our crackers in the first quarter that had a slightly larger negative impact on results than in the fourth quarter of last year.","I know this is disappointing, but frankly, I see these types of issues as common across our industry. In addition to the cracker issues, I would add that a lot of the benefit of lower propane costs was already in our numbers in the fourth quarter partly due to LIFO. So although we did benefit from an improvement in the propane and propylene spread in the first quarter, a significant portion of that was already in our fourth quarter numbers.","In 2013, we will also benefit from an additional furnace on our type 4 cracker providing an additional 100 million pounds of ethylene on an annual basis.","Looking at the full year, we continue expect operating earnings will approximate  $380 million, which would be very strong performance.","I will end on Slide 11 with an update on our 2013 outlook. We started the year with very solid results from our portfolio of specialty businesses, and we continue to benefit from our leadership position in attractive end markets, from the diversity of the end markets we serve and from our broad geographic footprint. However, global economic uncertainty continues with particular weakness in Europe. And raw material and energy costs continue to be volatile, including for propylene, paraxylene and benzene. And taken all of this together, we are maintaining our full year expectations, which we had increased in January for 2013 EPS of between $6.30 and $6.40. This would be our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth if we achieve this. And I remain confident we are well-positioned to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next 2 years and beyond.","With that, let me turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 13 by reviewing some of the financial highlights for the first quarter.","We generated $5 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter. Net earnings were solid. Working capital increased for normal seasonal requirements. And we made an $11 million contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.","Moving to free cash flow for the quarter. You see it was a negative $83 million, a good result in what is typically our seasonally lowest quarter for free cash flow. Also keep in mind there was no dividend payment in the first quarter as we elected to pay the dividend to our shareholders in December of last year.","Finally, our cash balance, which includes cash equivalents, was $178 million at the end of first quarter.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was 28.7% reflecting the $10 million benefit we noted in our February guidance resulting from the extension of the R&D tax credit and allowance for the tax retransfer of offshore dividends. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 31.5%.","On Slide 13, I'll walk you through our current estimate for free cash flow in 2013.","Consistent with our previous guidance, we project operating cash flow of roughly $1.3 billion. The full year operating cash flow estimate includes our projection for continued strength in earnings, as well as the following items: slightly higher working capital as a result of increased revenue and our broader geographical footprint, with the working capital we built in the first quarter working down through the remainder of the year. Funding the balance sheet accruals, such as the annual environmental funding of approximately $35 million primarily for legacy Solutia sites and restructuring accruals for site closure in Brazil. Any additional restructuring and integration costs are excluded from our earnings projections. And finally, we anticipate contributing approximately $120 million to our U.S. defined benefit plan this year.","Also consistent with our prior guidance, we expect 2013 capital expenditures to total approximately $525 million. This capital spending will be more in the second half of the year due to the normal operational trends, as well as the timing for key growth projects, including our specialty fluids expansion in Wales.","So putting this altogether, we reaffirm our 2013 free cash flow expectation to be between $600 million and $650 million with the midpoint of this range representing a growth rate of greater than 30% over the 2012 total.","Next on Slide 15, I will provide an update on the integration of Solutia. As the slide indicates, we remain well on track to achieve the synergies we expect -- expected when we acquired these businesses last year. We are also on track with the retention of key talent, which is at 93% of what we identified.","We recently achieved one of our key integration milestones with the successful system migration of the rubber additives product lines, which is a part of our Additives & Functional Products segment, over to our SAP system. For those of you familiar with SAP migrations, you know this is a very complicated process. To give you a sense, this migration itself impacted 1,300 people at 19 different sites and locations in 12 countries. The implementation went as well as we could have expected and these businesses are now fully operational in our SAP system with seamless impact to our customers. I just want to recognize all those involved in achieving this outstanding result and milestone. And we are on track to migrate over to the remaining former Solutia businesses into our SAP system later this year or early 2014 time frame. All in all, we continue to make great progress with our integration efforts and our synergy targets.","To closeout on Slide 16, I'll remind you of our disciplined approach to capital allocation. As previously mentioned, we expect capital expenditures of $525 million, which reflects our commitment to pursue organic growth across our portfolio. On the debt side, paying down a significant portion of the Solutia acquisition term loan will continue to be a priority for cash throughout 2013. During the first quarter, we did reduce the term loan balance by $200 million using our strong balance sheet to access attractive funding in the commercial paper market.","Moving next to joint ventures and acquisitions, we will continue to progress with our 2 announced joint ventures, the acetate tow joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation, expected to be online on the third quarter of this year and our Regalite adhesives project joint venture with Sinopec, expected online in 2014. And we will also continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic bolt-ons.","Lastly, we expect to continue returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, we repurchased $32 million of Eastman common stock.","With that, thank you for your interest in Eastman Chemical. And I'll turn it back over to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks, Curt. This concludes our prepared remarks. Michael, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, in Adhesives, I think you mentioned a couple of issues. It sounded like you're experiencing some market-related weakness on the packaging adhesives side. And then I heard you mention an issue on hydrogenated hydrocarbons related to some meaningful cost dynamics. So I'm wondering if you could flesh those out a little bit more and comment on the expected duration of these issues and whether or not there's anything company-specific at work in either category?","James P. Rogers","And Kevin, how did I know the first question might just be on adhesives? Guess what, when we had our business reviewed, guess where we spent some time. Look, long term, I like our position. There's nothing company-specific negative to Eastman, but you do have softness in the packaging market, which is part of it. I think one of the reasons the results were worse than most all of us expected was it wasn't just demand, it was also on the supply side. And the best I can understand it, speaking somewhat generally, if you had probably several years now, tight raw materials where customers can quite often worry about whether they're going to get the supplies, some of your competitors couldn't have certainly make all they wanted to make. And then if those raws loosen up, you have more of availability of supply, customers don't need to keep their safety stocks and inventory. And so, you had a bit of a double whammy. You had soft demand and then you also had more supplier, or at least a comfort level, with customers on supply. That second thing doesn't last forever, so they go ahead and take their inventories down skinnier. They're more comfortable doing that, knowing that they're likely to be able to get product. The overall demand issue is one that you're going to be able to watch as easy as me in terms of when general level of economic activity picks up and packaging in particular picks up again. So it was a disappointment. I think we still like the hydrogenated hydrocarbon outlook. We like the outlook for diapers in the emerging markets, et cetera. And that trend's not going away anytime soon. So long-term, feel fine, short-term, we got caught on both demand and supply.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then second question if I may, Jim, on Specialty Fluids & Intermediates. You referenced the operational issue at Longview. Can you give as a sense of, I guess, the absolute impact to that in the first quarter and remind us of what it was in the fourth quarter? Just trying to get a sense of what the sequential delta might have been in that segment related to the operations side?","James P. Rogers","And I'll probably let Curt chime in on this, too. But I thought you might be the one to ask this question, Kevin, since you're high man on the numbers. And it, obviously, without the upset, we wouldn't have gone all the way to your number, let me just say it that way, but we would have been between your number and our number.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, I'd say the impact on the first quarter is roughly $10 million and the fourth quarter's a little less than that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you update us on your cost-reduction initiatives and what you think the ultimate savings will be from the integration of Solutia?","James P. Rogers","Let me let Curt pick that up, because he's the lead man on that.","Curtis E. Espeland","Well, what we've mentioned in the past, Jeff, and this still holds true. Our target is over a run rate of greater than $100 million by the end of this year on those integration savings. We did talk about there's different levels of probability of other projects we've identified, so that $100 million target we talked about was roughly 5% of the acquired revenues. There is a possibility that could be a 6% number, which would be another roughly $25 million and there's a remote chance that it could be 7%, another $25 million. So it's just a range of probability we're working on. And some of that you won't see until 2015 if it were to come to fruition. In addition, we continue to make good progress on the operational commercial side of Solutia and I think you're starting to see that in the benefits. And then lastly, it's within our culture, we have a culture of continuing to focus on productivity and trying to drive unit costs down and you heard some of that -- Jim talked about today in our asset deal stream to some de-bottlenecks, et cetera. So part of it's still synergies, part of it's just operational excellence we expect and have been able to achieve.","James P. Rogers","And, Jeff, if I could just tag on, I mean a lot of times people look at spread and spread widens out and they say they just got more price so the raws went down. We don't talk a lot about it but we still got all the basic programs going on part of our culture in terms of Six Sigma and cost monitoring the headcount, labor cost, et cetera. So we're trying to fight it on all angles and that's about the only way you can deliver these kind of results.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, you had such a nice price raw material margin in your Fibers business. Now selling these shutdowns Spondon [ph] facility late last year, did that tighten up the global supply demand balances efficiently to sort of allow for greater industry pricing? Is that the reason why it widened out so much?","James P. Rogers","I would not point to that because they also added capacity and of course, we're both adding capacity in China. But no denying, we're running at very high utilization rates. The whole industry is. Part of our benefit is, and again we don't always talk a lot about it, but we just operationally ran very well in terms of cost. And then there's also a benefit that comes from in the first quarter, how the pricing flow through versus the cost flow through. So usually, your first quarter, you're getting a little tailwind, if I can, that maybe all of your cost, say higher wood pulp, et cetera, haven't flown through for full 3 months or you've probably gotten more of your pricing. And that's way we tried to guide that for Fibers, the first half of the year is probably going to look better than the second half the year, and not because of any change in the marketplace, simply because of how those costs flow through.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, I think you also called out some weakness in plasticizers in the quarter. Is that weakness, do you think, permanent structurally? Or is it -- was it temporary going forward?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so how temporary is temporary? I mean, you've got some plasticizers guys who've been losing the share who are reacting trying to use price. We also had, if I remember correctly, kind of soft market in Asia. So they ship more of the stuff to maybe higher-priced markets, Europe and the States. Long term, the non-phthalate trend, it's not going to change, it's not going to go away. It's -- we're not going to see high single-digit growth rates in the non-phthalate plasticizer side. So I still expect growth good growth there. The real weakness came more on the adhesives side this quarter than the plasticizers side, so that's really where more of our focus is right now.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just in SFI, Jim, how should we think about a narrowing of the propane propylene spread in Q2 versus Q1 and how would it impact your numbers?","James P. Rogers","Well, it does it like it's going to narrow, and that's what drives me nuts. When it's widening out, everything thinks I should be raising guidance, et cetera. And we're trying to say, \"Guys, it's only 1 or 2 months.\" and then -- so it's going to come to go back the other way. I try not to look, honestly. I try not to look quarter-to-quarter. I try and think for the year. I think overall, for the next several years, we still got a tailwind here. Let me just point out one other thing though, when you look at that segment, it's not just that spread propane, propylene, I also got a really nice fluids business in there. And the fluids business didn't quite do what we would have hoped in the first quarter and that is more as I'm learning because again, those shipments, when they have major fills, et cetera, can kind of move from one quarter to another. So they should -- the fluids business should do noticeably better next quarter over first quarter. But yes, I would think the spread will come in some. But overall, I think that this segment's going to have a great year.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, any update on the fourth ethylene cracker at Longview?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I mean, I said last time, I have little chagrin. I don't have more to tell you. All I can tell you now is we got site visits going on, we've narrowed the list down to a few parties. Midyear is probably when we'd hope to be out with something. I can honestly say that I worry a little bit that guys are spending too much time or they're building the anticipation up too much on this one. I mean, we're a pretty good-sized company and restarting another cracker or doing something with the excess ethylene that would probably take 2 or 3 years to get in place anyway. I hope they're not buying our stock on that, waiting for that shoe to drop and for us to tell them what to do because we think we got a great portfolio of businesses. But yes, hopefully midyear, we can kind of spell out who we're going to work with and what it's going to look like.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, you mentioned more aggressive competition from Asia in the adhesives business. Is this a function of the weak economy over there and you think this sort of ebbs and flows as their own home cooking improves and they won't have to seek out other markets, or is this just sort of a standard product cycle issue where it's becoming more intense?","James P. Rogers","I think I was mainly talking about plasticizers on that. Yes, that's okay. But let me just talk about Asia in general. And basically, we had pretty much all the segments, but Adhesives & Plasticizers had pretty good results in Asia. And it seemed like we were seeing something a little different, than a lot of the guys were talking as we were going around beginning of the year, our last conference call, et cetera. I don't know that we're that exceptional, except I like our portfolio of products in Asia. So filter tow being such a major product for us in Asia gives us pretty good Asian numbers usually, quarter-in and quarter-out. I know that in -- as I look forward, just to give you some little anecdotal stuff, I think on the oxos, it's going to get fairly competitive there. I think, butanol, for example, under price pressure in Asia right now. So yes, we had a good first quarter in Asia. I would think I'm pleased that it's our second largest region, let me say it that way. But we take nothing for granted in Asia, and I think the hardest thing is figuring out segment-by-segment what's going in with inventory levels in Asia, because I just think they're masters at moving those inventories around when they think it's to their advantage.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And could I ask a separate question on Crystex? It seemed like there was some consternation among investors that, that such a great ride that had to end at some point. I didn't get that sense from your comments, so could you talk a little bit about what's going on in the market there and, in particular, pricing?","James P. Rogers","Yes. I disagree that it's something that has to end. I mean, we have the best product in the marketplace. We have the best cost position. The way I look at this -- in fact I went through a few of the Solutia businesses, if you want. But the way I look at this, and this is a great business, and you're seeing it probably at its weakest because of what's going on in the general tire marketplace. So we held volumes in Crystex, which, I think, is a good thing. A year ago, they were running their utilization rates a little harder so the comp was going to be tough for us. They had all kinds of rational why they ran harder a year ago, but let's just say we think we're running it very prudently today in terms of how we're running our plants. When the tire market comes back, I think that's -- we're going to get to see how good this business really is, and also when we pull the trigger and do our Kuantan expansion and get some further cost reductions because of process improvements, I think that's also going to be quite a positive. So people, they should not judge the tire additives business by the way it looks right now. This is fairly tough marketplace for them. I'll just say, similar thing with interlayers where you got Europe so soft. I mean, I just know that's a better business than you're seeing today. But you're seeing it down because of Europe. If I look at the fluids business, sold out, fantastic business. We're going to have the wherewithal to add capacity, and so that's going to meet or exceed our expectations. The films business is probably the highlight. That's one that's doing the highest above our expectations. And we'll -- I think maybe next call or so, we'll try and focus -- and I'm looking over at Greg. I think we'll try and focus in a little more on films to give you some more color. Because I don't want you to ignore that. Some of our best growth rates and great products and some real opportunity, we see there. So I mean -- so you got 2 of the muscle players from Solutia that, I think, you're seeing at low points and the other businesses are performing very well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to go back to PVB interlayers, at the Investor Day, you made a comment, you thought the old management had made an error around kind of a price volume decision about a year ago. So as that anniversary-s this year, where you guys or are you guys able to get back the volume you think they lost?","James P. Rogers","Yes, that's a good question. And I think, if I remember correctly, we talked, we kind of had a 2-year game plan for doing that. We've got a long ways in the first year so we're pleased with the contracting strategy we did. We got more price in Asia, we got more volume in Europe and that's exactly what we wanted. So yes, overall, I think we're getting the right response from the major customers. They want a long-term player, somebody's going to work with them. And we've had to accommodate customers where necessary to make sure that we had the market position we wanted with the key players in that industry. But yes, overall I'm pleased with what we've been able to accomplish in 1 year.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then another comment from the Investor Day. I thought you guys had forecast you would grow about half the market in Crystex because you needed to make room for kind of the #2 and #3 player that brought on some capacity, but it seems like you're holding volume. Has their capacity rolled into the market and is it just going smoother than you thought? Or are we still waiting for that capacity to come online?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I'm pleased to what we've been able to do in the Crystex market but let me -- Greg, you want to add some color?","Gregory A. Riddle","I was just going to add that when we talked in Investor Day, we were talking about growth rate that might be in the 5% range for tires. And what we're seeing right now is flat. So when we're talking about growing half of what the market's growing, the market has to be growing and we're not seeing that right now.","James P. Rogers","But we held. I'm pleased with how we did, share-wise, in Crystex.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But did the capacity from those competitors come online? Or -- because the growth rate will be where it'll be, but if people bring on capacity and they're willing to use price to get into the market, I thought that's why you guys were going to back off and basically just make way for them so that it didn't hit pricing. But that's what I'm trying to figure out. Did they come online or did they not come online?","James P. Rogers","Yes. I understand your question, and I can't remember specifically. I know that the kind of capacity adds we had were small from numerous players, and so I just assumed, honestly, they were coming on...","Gregory A. Riddle","I've not heard any discussion amongst our business about any change in outlook of how that capacity is coming on.","James P. Rogers","So I wasn't aware. It's not like there was one big step function coming on. But I can't give you anymore color than that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andy Cash with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on the acetate tow, there's some raw material pressure coming from the cellulose side. Could you give us your index? What you think raw material costs will do for acetate tow over the course of the year. And also, what sort of volume change year-over-year, do you expect for the business, full year?","James P. Rogers","Yes, let me hit the raw materials side and just remind folks on the major wood pulp we do in annual contracts. So we know what the cost is there. I don't see that moving around. What we were trying to say is we didn't get a full 3 month's worth of that cost in the first quarter -- the increase in the first quarter. You also don't get quite a full 3 months of the pricing in the  first quarter either, but it slanted a little more to where you get less of the raw material cost. So I don't want to  mislead anybody. Obviously, business doing great. We're covering our raw material costs, outperforming due partly to that spread, also partly to just great operational excellence. Fibers is pretty tight right now. So I don't know -- Greg, were we seeing much more volume this year versus last year?","Gregory A. Riddle","Low-single digits, which is pretty consistent with where we were in the first quarter.","James P. Rogers","Okay. By the way the, other piece that moves around there is -- it's small is yarn, but yarn is not causing any swings. It's pretty much steady.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then some of -- if I could ask one other question about some of your growth businesses. You alluded to V-Kool doing well. Could you talk about -- just give us a ballpark of the range of growth you're seeing for V-Kool films on acoustics and also Tritan side?","James P. Rogers","Yes. They're good numbers. Why don't I let my CFO -- you want to say the percentage increase? Tritan was 40%, V-Kool, I think, was a strong double-digit on. It was at 20% or something like that. I don't -- when we were -- the acoustics, I think, was 30%. I mean, these things, I just wish they were bigger so that these percentages would be off a bigger basis. But yes, it's pretty good growth on that. And that -- but it brings up the bigger point, is that stuff that's growing fast is your higher margin. So you're getting the nice mix improvement like when you sell more acoustics in the interlayers, the same thing with Tritan, same thing with V-Kool. I mean, those are all good trends. And so, if I got a disappointment, I wish we'd had more volume growth this quarter. But I'm very pleased with the mix changes that we're seeing in our businesses.","Gregory A. Riddle","And if I could add Jim, on top of it, what you're getting with those growth rates is we already have the investments made so you're getting the leverage off that.","James P. Rogers","Yes, that's true. That's true.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just if I could go back to what Duffy was talking about earlier about the PVB. In the auto area, I mean, shouldn't your business see a better comps going forward if the auto pundits arrive and the European business is less onerous on a year-to-year basis going forward?","James P. Rogers","Yes, that would be -- that would definitely be a help. Remember, the interlayer business is not just the autos. You've also got the building and construction commercial buildings, particularly in Europe. And so that's quite soft and I don't think that's forecast to turnaround any time soon. But you're right on the auto side.","Operator","And we'll go next to Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","On the adhesives business, I know you've got some expansions in Longview and then YPC over the next couple of years. Is there any way, if the market continues to be weak, that you might dial back some of those expansions to keep -- prevent operating rates from declining too significantly?","James P. Rogers","Yes, well for -- the big one would be the one in China. And frankly, I'm not too concerned about the hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins. That's -- we're going to need that volume. And I think we said when we announced it that we also had quite a bit of the output under contract already from that plant. So not going to be a major risk. I don't see it screwing up the market because of the segment it's in, let\u2019s say it that way.","Curtis E. Espeland","And the hygiene market is growing stronger for the hydrogenated. So that trend is still there, Nils.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then on the interlayers business, again. I mean, I think you -- at Investor Day you said that, that business was about 50% Europe and yet, obviously, Asia contributed. So I was just curious as how much of a drag Europe was because of autos and construction?","James P. Rogers","Yes. I don't know how to quantify it for you without trying to get in number by number. I can just tell you that the thing for me on that business was the tough comparison in the last year as well in terms of how they ran the business last year. But Europe's the one we need to turn. When Europe turns, we're going to feel really good because it is the major impact on this segment.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just finally, if I may I think sort of year-to-date charges and whatever, from Solutia integration. Or somewhere in the $80 million range, excluding inventory step-ups and everything else, how do you -- how does that compare to what you were expecting and how many more charges do you think you might have to take from Solutia?","James P. Rogers","Well I think when you look at what happened in the first quarter, we had about $10 million of integration costs from restructuring costs. Those will kind of continue at that level through the course of the rest of this year. We'll start to unwind as we finish those major SAP implementations. So it will be pretty much behind us as we finish the year. And it's pretty much in line with what we expected when we announced the deal.","Operator","And we'll go next to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jim, in your prepared remarks you said it's a difficult and unpredictable environment out there. So, of course, that begs the question I would like you to do some forecasting here. You did a nice job of talking about the geographies, the Q1 results for the various geographies and the sales movements; this, that and other things. [ph]. Can you give us the state of the -- the current state of affairs whipping around North America, Europe, Asia, what you're seeing there?","James P. Rogers","Yes, thanks Frank. I would say first of all, as we give our guidance. We're not -- we're expecting things to kind of trek along the way it is right now. So if we had a nice surprise, the upside, where somehow, Europe pulls a rabbit out of a hat, we could do better. But odds are, it's going to play out, in our opinion, kind of the way we're seeing it now. So you had, North America, and it's probably the same thing everyone else is in. North America, pretty good, Europe frankly, still just down and don't really see what the light is at the end of the tunnel for Europe. I mean, I guess in a year or 2 they got to come out of it. But in general, our best play there is to keep an improving mix within that region. I'd say Latin America, just not that big for us. But when you look at how we were down a little bit volume-wise, I think Brazil is probably tougher times than Mexico is. And then you get to Asia. And Asia's the one that could make a difference, but harder -- I'd say, the hardest to call. I've pretty good idea where Europe is going to next year, so pretty good idea the States is going to stay good the next year. So Asia is a little bit tougher to see. And there, you have to start getting into the segments. But by and large, I think it kind of keeps trekking along the way it is. So we may have had a little more of a tailwind first quarter, and maybe tougher for Asia to keep up at that level. I don't know, I hope that's helpful.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So how would you describe the April pace of business versus the Q1 pace of business in Asia overall?","James P. Rogers","Let me ask Curt because he probably looks at that as well.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, I think when we look at the order trends, April, even early part of May, we're seeing that same trend of strength in most of our businesses within Asia. We haven't seen any dramatic upcrease or downwind.","James P. Rogers","The only -- I just said the antidote of some of the oxos  pricing pressure there like butanol, et cetera. But that's about the only negative I've heard, change from first to second.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Alright. Terrific. And then Curt, you described use of cash on the shareholder bullet. Continued share repurchases to offset dilution, yet I noticed that your share count ticked in, in Q1. Can you expand upon the potential that we might see more of that happen as we go forward?","Curtis E. Espeland","Well, I'm glad you noted that, Frank. If you look at our fully diluted share count, you're right, it did tick down a little bit as we implemented share repurchases. I'd actually point out on an actual share count base, it increased.","James P. Rogers","It's had more to do with the pricing options...","Curtis E. Espeland","Right. Options exercise then we had a few shares issued under the old Solutia warrants. So right now, our strategy continues to be repurchase shares to offset dilution as we make progress on our debt pay down as you've heard before. We'll look at how we deploy that cash further whether we do more share repurchases beyond dilution.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Alright, terrific. And then if I could just come back to the Tritan volumes, up 40% year-over-year, which is obviously an eye-popping number. Any color around that? I mean, operating rates for that unit, how is that trending? Do you expect more of that to continue?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I think it's perhaps unrealistic to think it's going to have 40% up comps from here on out. It's had a bang up quarter where market acceptance for the product is just fantastic, which not only gives us the volume, but allows us to concentrate on the segments of the market as I think, things like medical versus some of the other packaging applications that would be less attractive. It's still going to take a little while to fill up the capacity we got, so we're not worried about running out of capacity soon. We've talked in the past about how you add a monomer plant and then you add lines, et cetera. So I think we're still looking at Tritan, not filling up until what? End of next year maybe, something like that? But it's -- that's a good part of what's going on within Eastman right now, it's how Tritan's -- how the market's responding to Tritan.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on the acetate tow business. I know Asia, from a cigarette perspective, is I don't know, almost 60% of your volume. But in the rest of the world, how -- what level of concern do you have over sort of medium or long-term about when President Obama announces the potential for Federal excise tax pretty substantial in the U.S. or you see Philip Morris International's volume down mid-single digits in the quarter, I mean. And the potential for further excise tax increases in Europe or in other places. What level of concern at all is that to you?","James P. Rogers","Well, we're not naive about it. I mean, we can see what part of the world we live in and what the smoking trends are here. We know one is the biggest impacts in the past on smoking has been tax increases. So you're right to focus on one of the levers that can have a almost immediate impact. Interestingly enough a year or 2 later, you lose some of that impact, again. In other words it goes back up. But long term, I think we all know the trend outside of Asia. And it'll be a slow decline. What you're going to want is you're going to want to have the best cost position and you're going to want to have a nice base in Asia, and that's what we're building long-term.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Curtis, if I could just ask you on the free cash flow. Can you just sort of remind me sort of how it sequenced through the year and just let me know if there's any impact from the sort of maybe in the inventory from the weakness in adhesives and sort of how you see that playing out through the year.","Curtis E. Espeland","So let me -- first of all, on the inventory, I can assure that our business and our supply chain guys are keenly aware of kind of our order trends and makes sure we operate consistent with those trends. So that wasn't a factor. And as we look at free cash flow, as we'd expect, we're kind of negative in the first quarter and it starts building through the end of the year. I don't know, maybe our third or fourth quarter will be one of our strongest, the second half of the year is where we'll see a significant generation of our free cash flow.","Operator","And we'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones. On the tire side, are your customers giving any sense of having a sense for when the market actually turns, or are they still waiting on pins and needles? And on the Fibers business, is there a point -- I mean, how many years can you sort of maintain a good pricing cycle? Or is there a threshold that we should be thinking about where you actually run the risk of creating your own demand destruction separate from tax increases or other government interventions?","James P. Rogers","Yes. So let me start with the tires. We just happened to ask that same question when we were having our review. What are the customers telling you? What can you see? The destocking has been going on in that industry for a while now. More than a quarter or 2, to the best of our knowledge. And we also, by the way, we're humble enough to admit there's other companies who've been dealing with the tire industry a lot longer than us and it's a lot bigger percent of their business. So trust me, there's guys out there who can speak much more intelligently than me about it. But we haven't seen the turn yet in where people have gone the other way and started to feel like they need to build inventories again. And I don't think we're getting a lot of feedback on how soon that's going to be. So, it's just one of those where I'm thankful we got such a diversified portfolio of businesses that one business is soft like adhesives, something else can kick in. On the Fibers business, I don't really worry about things we would do as a supplier that would cause demand destruction. I mean, the filter's actually the cheaper part of the cigarette. So to the extent they lengthen the filters and call it a premium cigarette, their cost goes down and therefore, their margin goes up and we sell more products. So I think it's what we talked about earlier. You can just see the long-term trends in terms of developed world smoking on a very slow decline is still growing though in the developing world. And that -- those are going to be the dominant trends. And taxes, country-by-country, can move things around and in particular, can cause upset, say, in a particular quarter for 1 year, but then the world seems to adjust. So the other thing, I think the industry has been fairly disciplined about looking at their high cost production facilities, and over the years, have gravitated to lower cost and to Asia from higher cost and places like Western Europe.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of Crystex, I just wanted to -- maybe help us visualize, where are your operating rates now? And once they do sort of recover, is the leverage higher than what we might have seen in the years passed and maybe give us a feel for how that can shape up?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I got plenty of capacity right now. If that's your question. And I think there's a track record -- it was a leader, by far, in this industry, the capacity  utilization, Solutia, and now us. We're more likely to move utilization rates around and -- than the small competitors are. But so I'm not going to give you a percentage number on utilization rate, but let's just say I've got capacity. One of the key things to watch for though, and you'll get a signal as soon as anybody when we announce we're going forward with the Kuantan expansion and a newer technology and lowering our cost position. That's going to be a very good sign. And that is the kind of thing that can give you more leverage than you've had in the past that you got a lower cost process that's actually retrofitable. So we'll see. I mean, I never take anything for granted. Don't give you any guarantees. But I think we got some much better times ahead of us for Crystex.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just curious, I know it's still early, but there are some companies, when you look at the economic backdrop, particularly in Europe over the next couple of years, sort of the long-term goals seem more difficult and Advanced Materials is one where we needed a pretty big ramp over the next couple of years. Can you sort give us an update of how you think about that business given some of the commentary that Europe could be weaker?","James P. Rogers","Yes, it did have probably the steepest incline in the climb. Maybe now Adhesives & Plasticizers does. But I feel better than I did 6 months ago about them being able to hit their targets. And partly -- remember, I got 3 businesses in there, so I got the specialty plastics business like I think I said on the last call, was going to have a very good year, probably the best year ever. That still seems to be intact. They had a very strong first quarter. Performance films is outperforming our expectations. It has nice growth rates and is becoming a more significant part of that segment, although admittedly, still the smallest. And then the interlayer business is where the upside is. And we do need some improvement in Europe and we do need some global improvement to hit those numbers. We said that back then, so I don't want to pretend like Europe can just stay where it is forever and we're going to be happy. We do need a pickup in the global economic activity, in particular Europe.","Operator","And we'll go next to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I got 2 questions. One on Kingsport and one in Longview. At Kingsport, I think you were working on this project to convert your coal feedstock into partly, a natural gas. Where do you stand on that? And then on Longview, for your fourth cracker startup, do you need a long-term off peak [indiscernible] contract agreement?","James P. Rogers","Let me hit Kingsport. It's not the feedstock. It is for energy, converting our major powerhouse from coal to gas. And so we're going to -- for energy purposes, we're going to be about half coal, half gas. That's proceeding on pace. We haven't started fooling around with steel and concrete, et cetera, but that's going to go in-line with what we would want to have done for regulatory reasons anyway. But remember, the feedstocks coal, we gasify coal, that's always going to stay that way. In Longview, on the -- you were breaking up a little bit, P.J., so I didn't quite understand what you were asking about the fourth cracker.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, do you need a long-term customer agreement for off peak?","James P. Rogers","Yes, let me say it this way, we're not looking to be a bigger merchant player in ethylene. So when you say do we need a long-term agreement, whatever we do with a partner is going to be a long-term -- it's going to be a long-term arrangement, whether we continue to own that cracker and operate it or we sell the cracker or what we do with our excess ethylene. But whatever we do is going to be a long-term solution that's not going to be spot market exposure.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And there was a lot of discussion on the tire market. Can you just breakdown for us your tire exposure to commercial trucks versus passenger cars?","James P. Rogers","Yes, commercial is larger than passenger. I don't remember it. What do we -- do we use to say 60-40 or something? I mean, obviously, more than that?","Gregory A. Riddle","Yes. It's more than that.","James P. Rogers","More than that, okay. So yes, it's more commercial. But thanks for your question, P.J.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from John Roberts [ph] with UBS.","Unknown Analyst","You've got a core group of people who's doing a great job on the integration activities. Do you disband them back into the organization as you work through that or does this sort of set up a challenge for you to try to find some other things to keep these people active on integrating?","James P. Rogers","Let me just say you guys on that side of the call, you actually do know something about how to run businesses. A lot of the questions you've been asking is exactly the kind of conversations we have had internally and that is -- that's another one where you got some synergy having a group together and then the issue is: Do you think you can keep them fully occupied? Curt -- and this is really Curt's baby, so let me have Curt on the line.","Curtis E. Espeland","What we're thinking through is just different scenarios by which you don't know how your M&A pipeline is going to play out so how do you keep that capability within your house. And there's different ways you can deploy them to keep them busy and if a project comes along, you can put them to work on integration. And I'd have to say, our people are just excited about the integration efforts. They're demonstrating their capabilities and I think we'll keep that talent available should we need it.","Unknown Analyst","And then just as a follow-up, it sounds like you're completely dismissing the e-cigarette phenomena. Which may be correct, but I've got some friends and family who really love the product. And sometimes, electronic devices come down in price really fast because of the learning curve and scale, they go up. And so I just wanted to do a gut check  that, that's something that you really don't think is on the horizon anytime soon?","James P. Rogers","Yes. I wouldn't use the word dismissing. We probably look at things at a depth and sooner than just about anybody else would when it comes to our Fibers business. But I would say that there is a comfort level that, in the near to intermediate term, we can pretty much see how demand and supply is going to flow. It's probably the most predictable market we're in. And so again, I never take anything for granted, I don't dismiss it. But I think we're fairly comfortable we're going to need that capacity that we're adding in China.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay, thanks again for joining us this morning. A web replay and a replay in downloadable MP3 format will be available on our website beginning approximately 11:00 a.m. Thanks again and have a great day.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thank you, Jenny, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and CFO; Ron Lindsay, Executive Vice President, PCI Fibers; and Fernando Subijana, Manager, Investor Relations. ","Before we begin, I'll cover 2 items. First, during this call, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations for full year 2012 and 2013, as well as the acquisition of Solutia. Actual results could differ materially from our plans and expectations. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's first quarter 2012 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for full year 2011 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for first quarter 2012.","Second, certain Eastman financial measures referenced in this presentation are non-GAAP financial measures, such as earnings per share and operating earnings, that exclude transaction and financing costs related to the pending acquisition of Solutia and another postretirement plan gain. Also referenced are cash from operations excluding capital expenditures and dividend. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the transaction and financing cost related to the pending acquisition of Solutia and other postretirement plan gain, are available on our first quarter financial results news release and the tables accompanying the news release available at www.investors.eastman.com","Lastly, we have posted slides that accompany our remarks for this morning's call on our website, again at www.investors.eastman.com, and they're located in the Presentations and Events section. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. And you'd hopefully noticed Greg mentioned that Ron Lindsay is on the call with us this morning. Ron is one of 2 EVPs here along with Mark Costa. Ron has Fibers and PCI, and I imagine many of you have met Ron, and I'm pleased to have him on the call. Just to show that I'm a very generous CEO, he has a bit of good news, and rather than me saying it, I'm going to let Ron say it because it was his team that worked on it. Plus I'm guessing there may just be 1 or 2 questions on cracker spreads, et cetera, so Ron's probably the right man to have with us here on the call. ","As I normally do, I'll start with an update on our most recent outlook statements. Back in January, we said we expected first quarter 2012 earnings per share to be between $1.05 and $1.15. This guidance was given prior to the implementation of a pension accounting change we announced in March, and Curt will have more on that in his remarks. With the pension accounting change, we reported first quarter EPS of $1.22, which is on a comparable basis. It's near the top of our range. We also said that we expect to make progress this year on a number of organic growth initiatives, and you will hear this morning that we have completed several capacity expansions recently, and our Perennial Wood product is on the shelves in 50 Lowe's stores. ","In addition, we said we expected to close the Solutia acquisition by midyear 2012, and we remain on track to do just that. And we guided full year 2012 EPS to be approximately $5 and that the pension accounting change would add approximately $0.30 per share, so we are confirming our full year EPS guidance, and I'll talk more about that in a few minutes.","Moving to Slide 4. As I mentioned, last night we reported EPS of $1.22. Revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher selling prices. Operating earnings declined year-over-year in each of the segments, except Fibers, and we increased our spending in Other as we continue to fund organic growth initiatives such as Perennial Wood. Sequentially, operating earnings increased by almost $100 million, reflecting a nice bounce back from the challenging fourth quarter business environment and seasonally stronger sales volume, which increased 8% sequentially. ","Now to the segments, starting with CASPI on Slide 5. CASPI began 2012 with a strong quarter. Operating earnings were $98 million, down somewhat from first quarter '11 as there were some pre-buying in the polymers product lines in the year ago quarter, but up about $40 million from the fourth quarter, helped by seasonally higher sales volume, which increased 12% sequentially. Looking at our expectations for full year 2012, all of CASPI's main product lines are operating at high levels. They're also benefiting from the Regalite hydrocarbon resin expansion completed during fourth quarter 2011. ","This facility, located in the Netherlands, has been expanded 3x since 2006, effectively doubling the capacity and after each capacity expansion has been sold out, and we are sold out once again. In addition, we have recently completed a hydrocarbon resins debottlenecking project at our Jefferson facility in Pennsylvania, and we continue to pursue opportunities to increase our hydrocarbon resin capacity outside the U.S. Full year 2012 CASPI operating earnings are expected to be approximately $390 million, which would be the fourth consecutive year of record earnings. ","Speaking of record earnings, Fibers is up next on Slide 6. First quarter operating earnings were a quarterly record at $101 million, helped by higher selling prices and a favorable shift in product mix. Looking at full year 2012, we expect another record year. Acetate tow sales globally and particularly in Asia Pacific remain strong. We did have some volume in Asia pulled forward from second quarter into this first quarter, and therefore, sequentially, volume may decline, but we expect volume for the full year to show growth. In our acetate yarn product line, we are seeing some weakness, particularly for the textile market in Asia-Pacific and Europe. ","Taking these factors into consideration, we expect full year 2012 operating earnings to be approximately $380 million. This would be the ninth consecutive year of record earnings, which is indicative of the strength and consistency of earnings in the Fiber segment. Finally, our acetate tow joint venture manufacturing facility with China National Tobacco Corporation remains on schedule to come online mid-2013.","More solid results are on Slide 7 with PCI. Operating earnings were $77 million in the first quarter, down from a very strong first quarter 2011. The decline was primarily in Asia-Pacific as growth in the region has slowed, negatively impacting margins. In addition, we have solid results in North America, reflecting continued strong earnings from our plasticizers product lines, as well as the benefit from producing versus purchasing olefins, offset by a decline in Europe due to weakened market demand. ","Despite the challenges, PCI's operating margin was above 10%, and our operating earnings increased $28 million sequentially. Looking at the full year, we expect slower growth in the Asia -- Asian building and construction market to continue for the balance of the year, particularly for commodity products such as oxo alcohols. However, PCI also has a number of tailwinds, including strong results from the plasticizers product lines, which we expect will be about 1\/3 of operating earnings for PCI in 2012 with above segment average operating margins. ","This level of performance is a result of growing demand and many of the actions we have taken such as the positive impact of the Sterling acquisition, including the first phase of the startup of plasticizer assets producing primarily Eastman 168 non-phthalate plasticizers; as well as the benefit of the acquired acetic acid business; the acquisition of Scandiflex, a non-phthalate plasticizer producer located in Brazil; and the benefit from the 2-EH expansion completed earlier this month, which increased our capacity by 37,000 met tons or about 15% significantly integrating our plasticizer production. Lastly, we also expect the benefit of producing versus purchasing olefins for the year to be a tailwind, and PCI gets about 60% of this benefit. ","Taking all these factors together, we expect full year 2012 operating earnings for PCI will be approximately $325 million, which would be a record year for them, slightly higher than 2011.","And now I'll let Ron share the good news that I mentioned earlier. Ron?","Ronald C. Lindsay","Thank you, Jim. On Slide 8 is an update on our thinking about options to further leverage Eastman's exposure to the propane propylene spread. Back in December 2010, when we restarted our third olefin cracking unit that had been idled, we were a little ahead of the market in recognizing that the cost position of our crackers had improved dramatically with the shale gas boom, and restarting that cracker was a winner on day 1. ","In the middle of 2011, as we were considering all of our options, we said we are going forward with a number of incremental debottlenecks at our Longview facility and we expect those to come online in 2012 and 2013. In January this year, we said we were considering an olefins conversion unit or OCU in Longview. The OCU investment has a very strong return profile, well above the cost of capital and would allow us to take advantage of the attractive propylene market in the U.S. But we've continued to explore all of our options and have identified another attractive alternative, a propylene purchase agreement with a third party that will allow us to participate in their planned propane dehydrogenation unit with cost base pricing and capital recovery spread out over the term of the agreement. ","And while the OCU option remains a strong alternative for us, we are far enough along that we've signed a contract for our portion of the capacity from the planned PDH unit. This agreement will give us similar propylene economics to the OCU and preserves our capital for other uses. The project owner is working on finalizing agreements with enough customers to proceed with the PDH unit. And assuming they're successful, we would expect an announcement to be likely in the next few weeks. I'll also be speaking at an investor conference in the second half of May. At that time, I'll be able to update investors on where things stand.","Jim, back to you.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Ron. Nice job by Ron and his team. So I'll continue on Slide 9, Specialty Plastics, which as expected, improved substantially from the fourth quarter. Sequentially, earnings increased by $16 million as raw material and energy cost declined and volume increased to 9%. Year-over-year operating earnings declined as a combination of lower volumes, lower capacity utilization and higher raw material and energy costs were partially offset by higher selling prices. Looking at the full year, Specialty Plastics will begin to benefit from a number of capacity additions, including a second Tritan copolyester resin line, which came online during the first quarter and the expansion of our cellulose triacetate or CTA capacity, used in the LCD market, expected online midyear. ","The key variable for Specialty Plastics continues to be sales volume and while we have seen it improved from fourth quarter levels, it is not yet back to where it was in first half of 2011 due to weakened demand. Paraxylene recently has been less volatile but remains slightly disadvantaged compared to raw materials for competing products. Considering all of these factors, we expect Specialty Plastics operating earnings to be approximately $130 million, which would also be record performance.","So have I mentioned we're expecting record operating earnings for all of our segments in 2012 after record performance in 2011? Seriously, developing a track record of consistent year-over-year earnings growth is a top priority for us. And that's a good segue into our guidance for full year 2012 on Slide 10. ","We do expect slow economic growth globally but with the U.S. remaining solid. We anticipate that Europe will remain weak but not deteriorate from current levels. Asia, and particularly China, is the region with the most uncertainty as the growth rate has been slowing, and we are seeing the impact most significantly in PCI's commodity product lines. Raw material and energy cost are expected to be less volatile for the balance of the year, with the benefit from producing versus purchasing olefins expected to be a tailwind in 2012 compared with 2011. ","We also expect to continue to benefit from acquisitions we made last year from the Solutia acquisition we expect to close in the middle of this year and from the number of incremental capacity additions we have throughout the company, which I've highlighted during the segment reviews. As a result, we expect our full year EPS to be approximately $5.30, which would be an increase of about 10% compared with 2011. And we expect earnings in the second half to be higher than those in the first due to expected accretion from the acquired Solutia businesses. But otherwise, this year, the first half and second year would be similar in earnings. And lastly, we continue to expect 2013 EPS of greater than $6, which again would be solid double-digit earnings growth. ","I'll conclude this morning on Slide 11, and you'll see that while I gave Ron one nugget of good news, I did save one for myself. We talked about Perennial Wood at our Investor Day last year, and those of you that attended in person may recall the Perennial Wood display, which highlighted potential applications such as decking, siding and trim, indoor flooring, windows, outdoor furniture. Since then we've completed our initial production facility in Kingsport. ","In February, we launched the Perennial Wood brand showcasing the decking product line at the International Builders' Show in Orlando. Today, Perennial Wood decking is on the shelves in over 50 Lowe\u2019s stores in the Northeast U.S. For the trade professional, Perennial Wood decking is also being distributed through Boston Cedar and their network of specialized independent retailers, and we expect the availability of Perennial Wood to expand over time into other regions and other product categories. Pricing for Perennial Wood decking is comparable to what you would pay for a premium wood plastic composite or PVC decking product. And I got to say, the initial response has been terrific, exceeding our expectations. And I'd remind you we estimate that the addressable market for Perennial Wood is around $2 billion. And while it is less capital-intensive than most products in our industry, it is higher than our average operating margins. ","Going forward, we will continue to monitor market acceptance for Perennial Wood, and we will determine our next steps likely towards the end of 2012. Of course, Perennial Wood is not the only organic growth initiatives that we are working on. When you look at our spending in Other, it is for a number of initiatives that we expect will meaningfully contribute to growth over the next 5 years and then beyond that. ","Our Chief Technology Officer, Greg Nelson, will highlight a few of these growth initiatives as well as our expected earnings impact at an investor conference in early May, so you don't have long to wait there. These projects are consistent with our primary focus, which is earnings growth. And as we make progress on organic growth initiatives, capacity expansions and acquisitions, such as Solutia, we are prudently utilizing capital to deliver growth and high returns, building the path to higher earnings brick by brick. With that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I just have a few slides this morning, and I'll begin with our financial highlights on Slide 13. We generated $19 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter. This really starts with, first and foremost, net earnings remained solid across all of our businesses. In working capital, receivables increased, as expected, due to higher sales revenue. ","Additionally, our business and supply chain teams are doing a great job managing inventory quantities, which, combined with moderated raw material cost as a whole, provided operating cash flows of $14 million in the quarter. We also made a $25 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and continue to expect the full year contributions will be approximately $100 million.","Looking at free cash flow in the quarter, it was a negative $107 million, which is a good result in what is typically our weakest quarter for free cash flow generation due to seasonal working capital requirements. ","Next on Slide 14 is a review of our pension accounting change. You may recall we announced this in early March. We believe the change improves transparency, enabling investors to more clearly evaluate our operating performance. At a high level, actuarial gains and losses for the pension and OPEB plans are now recognized in operating results in the year they occur, rather than being amortized over future periods, as they were previously. ","The mark-to-market gains and losses are recognized annually in the fourth quarter and can be found in corporate expense rather than being allocated to the segments. An interim remeasurement triggered by curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes will be recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which the triggering event occurs. An example of that is what we recognized in first quarter of 2011 as described in the news release.","The service costs and amortization of prior service credits continue to be allocated to the segments. Excluding the fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustment, we expect this change will result in approximately $0.30 increase to full year 2012 earnings per share, and $0.08 of this roughly was recognized in the first quarter this year.","Moving next to an update on our acquisition of Solutia, beginning with financing. In March, the term and bridge loans were put in place. The term loan is $1.2 billion, and it will be amortized over 5 years. The bridge loan is $2.3 billion, and it expires one year after the transaction closes. The rate for both of these is LIBOR plus 150 basis points, and this is a great rate, and it reflects the solid investment credit rating of Eastman. We are not expecting to use the bridge loan but rather anticipate issuing public debt over the course of the next few months. ","Moving next to Solutia stockholder vote, we filed the preliminary proxy and prospectus or S4 with the SEC on March 7. We filed an amended S4 last Friday on April 20. The Solutia stockholder vote on the transaction will be scheduled after the S4 is finalized and cleared and has been declared effective by the SEC. ","Finally, on the regulatory approval front, we are making good progress. The Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired in March without comment. We have received approval from China, South Korea and the Ukraine. And we expect a regulatory approval in the EU to be completed prior to the end of May. Given everything that we see today, we remain on track for a mid-2012 close consistent with our guidance to you back in January. ","And of course, as we get to closing and beyond, we will have more to say about integration, cost synergies, cash generation and the significant positive impact we expect Solutia will have on our earnings going forward.","I'll conclude this morning on Slide 16 with a few comments about our capital allocation. We continue to implement a balanced approach across the areas you see on the slide, with a focus on funding and earnings growth. Starting with capital expenditures, we have organic growth initiatives throughout the company that we will continue to fund and expect CapEx before Solutia of approximately $400 million for full year 2012. ","We expect the incremental expansions we have discussed to contribute to earnings in 2012 and then to result in approximately $300 million of revenue in 2013, with operating margins above the corporate average. And we have a number of other organic growth initiatives, including Perennial Wood, which Jim mentioned, that we expect will contribute further to earnings growth longer term. ","Next on the dividend, we raised it twice over the last 1.5 years, and of course, it continues to be reasonable for investors to expect that as we increase earnings, we will also increase the dividend. Of course, I remind you that it's ultimately a board decision. Regarding equity in 2010 and 2011, we repurchased approximately $600 million of our stock or approximately 15 million shares at an average price of $40 per share. And we expect to issue approximately 15 million shares for the Solutia acquisition.","Moving next to joint ventures and acquisitions, we have been active over the last few years with the largest being the pending Solutia acquisition, and these are expected to significantly contribute to our earnings growth over the next several years. And on joint ventures, as Jim mentioned earlier, our acetate tow manufacturing joint venture is scheduled to come online mid-2013. ","Lastly, on debt and pension. We expect to issue between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion of new public debt securities for the Solutia acquisition and which is a favorable rate environment. And on pension, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to contribute approximately $100 million to the U.S. defined-benefit plans in the U.S. in 2012. ","And now I\u2019ll conclude by reaffirming our expectation to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow over the next couple of years and that, while the main use for free cash flow will be deleveraging, we expect to also meaningfully fund each of the other areas with a priority on generating consistent earnings growth. With that, I'll turn it back over to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay, thanks, Curt. Jenny, this concludes our prepared remarks. We are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And so we will go to our first question from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess this is a question for Ron. There were some discussion about restarting the fourth cracker, and then this morning, you're talking about investing in a PDH unit. Does that preclude restarting the fourth cracker? Where do you stand on that decision-making process?","Ronald C. Lindsay","Frank, let me go back to what was driving a lot of our assessment of our options here. We buy a substantial amount of propylene still. Even though we make it, we're net short. We're net long on ethylene, and so we've been looking at how to address, in particular, that position on propylene and effectively fully backwards integrate our propylene derivatives out of Longview. And so we looked at a variety of options there. Starting the cracker was certainly one that we've gone through carefully. It did not meet all of our propylene needs to fully backwards integrate, and unlike when we did restart it, it was quite a bit more expensive. It was in a poorer condition, needs a lot more work, so the capital requirement there was much higher, and that really drove us to look at is that really the right approach to proceed. And that led to these other options being surfaced. And we believe this one is the best one of the bunch because of the impact it's going to have on us, as well as the fact that we can take that capital we would've gone to rebuild something and to get the same position and take that capital elsewhere.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then you expect this PDH unit to be fully constructed by 2015? And am I correct that this project has not been announced yet publicly?","Ronald C. Lindsay","You're right on both fronts there.","James P. Rogers","Frank, this is Jim. We're just a little ahead of the game on this one, but we thought it was important. We know, for a few calls now, people have been looking at so what's Eastman going to do down there in Texas. And let me just say, this is a good, good outcome. We're getting the economics of the olefin conversion unit, close to it, and saving our capital. And as we look at doing acquisitions and the other kind of growth initiatives we've got, we've got to do some more smart moves like this, where you get the economics but don't spend your capital. So I just want to make sure people understand how happy we are with this contract. They still got to sign up a couple more folks. I don't think you have long to wait. Right, Ron?","Ronald C. Lindsay","That's right.","James P. Rogers","I mean, this one looks like this is a good project. They're being smart. The people building it are being smart about how they're managing their risk and pretty much locking up the output of this thing. That makes a lot of sense to me. So this is a win-win for the guys building it and for us as well.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, I must say I do admire the way that you keep us sitting on the edge of our seats. You have Ron giving some news next month. You've got Greg Nelson giving some news next month, so I just can't wait for the next piece of news out of EMN, I've got to tell you.","James P. Rogers","Hey, we're trying to look down the road. You might have noticed, we're trying to be a little more long-term focused. For example on this Perennial Wood, if this thing -- if this hits the way we got a shot of it hitting, you're not going to feel it in this first thing we built because it's smaller and it's really just to tease the market out. But when we go to a commercial scale on Perennial, it should look very good.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well I was going to ask a different question, but why don't we stay with Eastman -- I mean, Perennial Wood? You said the initial response has been quite favorable. Can you give us some color around that, any sort of metrics in terms of why you're feeling better about that today than you did perhaps a couple of months ago?","James P. Rogers","Yes, and I'm not going to steal Greg's thunder. I will say the response, I mean, there's different metrics you get in terms of response to ads, response to turning, I can't remember what you call it, but when people first call in, that initial lead, turning it into an actual sale. I mean all those kind of numbers are good. I guess while I'm here feeling good, I want to make sure I caveat it a little bit because this is still pretty early on. We're still getting the bugs out of a few things in the chain. But in general, the reception we get from people who know what they're talking about like the folks within Lowe's or the folks within Boston Cedar, I think this one can be pretty good. But Greg will talk some more about it when he gets up in front of people in a couple of weeks.","Operator","And we'll hear next from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just on your coal gasification facility in Kingsport, I think you said in the past it was advantaged up until nat gas got low at $2.50 per MMBtu, I might be wrong in that, but given where gas is, is that facility, is that still to [ph] change, still advantaged given low-priced nat gas in U.S.?","James P. Rogers","Yes, it is. I mean we went back and looked at the history. We could not find a time when we were not advantaged being on coal here in Kingsport. And of course, there's 2 moving parts. There's the price of coal and what we pay for it. There\u2019s the efficiency of how we run our operations. There's more than 2 moving parts, and then there's the price of natural gas. The other thing I would ask you to remember is you're not necessarily competing with those products. You're not necessarily competing against other people who are natural-gas-based. So when we think globally with where we take those products, a lot of people are competing where they\u2019re naphtha-based or natural-gas-based in other regions of the world. But yes, we're still pretty pleased with the economics of our gasification facility here in Kingsport.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on the PDH [indiscernible], you will not be making any capital investment, correct?","James P. Rogers","That's correct.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Did you consider making one or taking ownership interest in the facility?","James P. Rogers","Well, this is Jim again, we anticipated the question, why not do 2 or 3 things, why not restart the cracker, why not do the OCU, why not take a chunk of this PDH. We're really trying to think about our long-term strategy, how we deploy our cash, our resources. And we don't necessarily just want to be a bigger ethylene producer. And if we did, it wouldn't be with the size crackers that we have in Texas. So we were more than willing to go ahead with the OCU. That made a lot of sense. But this was a very elegant solution in terms of saving our capital and getting what we need. By the way, the economics look different when you're talking about replacing or backing out your propylene purchases versus just being a merchant ethylene or propylene producer. So we really like where we're ending up. I hope they go ahead and wrap up their project and get it announced publicly so that we can talk more about it.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jim lastly, can you comment on the propane propylene spread in Q1? And can you quantify the benefit to you guys?","James P. Rogers","Yes. We did it once last year to kind of lay it out for people. We said that wasn't the emphasis we wanted people to think about. We didn't want them just focusing on propane and propylene. I can tell you, it was good again in the first quarter. Of course, the ethylene was what was really good in the first quarter if we\u2019re showing you everything. You've got to think more than just the propane\/propylene. It's also how the ethylene did. Year-over-year, it's going to be -- the whole cracker spreads are going to be pretty good for us compared to last year. I was sitting here thinking as much I don't want to talk about it, it's nice to have these spreads, nice to have these spreads this year. The other thing I'll say on it is there's some chatter about whether or not propane is going to come off in the middle of the year, maybe go a little long. And that very well could be. One of the things I thought about is you're perhaps more likely to hold on to spread if propane is what comes off. Just propylene going up sometimes, the way we move so much propylene through derivatives, you don't -- you can't always get the pricing and the derivatives that equates to what the propylene went up. And we talked about that last year in the second quarter when people were thinking we're going to do better than we did. So propane coming off, you may be more likely to keep some of that spread, but as we looked forward in the year and looked at our numbers, we just kind of assumed it was steady-state where it is now.","Operator","And moving on, we have a question from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, just a couple of clarifications on the new PDH contract. On a pro forma basis for that contract, does it move your long, short position to 0 or exactly 100% integrated? Or would it be more or less than that? And then second, am I correct in understanding it's a propane-plus deal rather than a market-minus deal?","James P. Rogers","I'll let Ron answer that.","Ronald C. Lindsay","On the balance -- this will effectively make us balanced on propylene. So between this contract and what we make, we'll be covered for our needs. And it is a cost-based off propane formula.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. Then a couple of questions on CASPI. I guess I was a little surprised -- maybe I shouldn't be surprised that you've sold out your Regalite capacity so quickly. It seems like you had 20% every so often and whereas most units take a year or 2 to load, this thing is sold out in a quarter or 2. Can you help us understand why that is the case? And if it keeps happening, why you might not just double capacity or get more aggressive on increases there?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Well, thanks for noticing, by the way, that we have done a good job. We've got, again, some wind at our back in this marketplace. I mean, very strong growth if you think about all the personal hygiene, adhesives on diapers, et cetera, in the emerging markets. It's a pretty strong driver. Of course, we're not the only player in this marketplace. So other people tend to want to expand their capacity too. We're being very disciplined in how we approach it. I can say, though, that we think there's a great opportunity to do something perhaps a little larger in Asia in this marketplace. But I don't have anything to talk about or announce yet. But it would be logical that people would be looking for capacity in Asia, and we would be a logical player to do that. So but we'll just have to put a placeholder there and see what we can make happen.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Then also on CASPI, Jim, as I think about it broadly, solvents and various specialties that you sell, what percentage of CASPI sales would you say goes into architectural coatings? Is that meaningful? And related to that, might there have been any benefit related to favorable weather through the spring?","James P. Rogers","Yes, that's a good question. We showed building and construction at about 17% of CASPI sales. And when we say favorable weather, we've got our little North American hats on, and so we think about North America had favorable weather. Of course, the way I think I've heard Eastern Europe, et cetera, had very extreme cold weather. So it's a global business. I would guess there was some benefit from that, but it's hard to pin down. Basically, CASPI's just firing on all the cylinders. A little sloppiness in solvents, particularly in Asia, but in general, firing on all cylinders.","Operator","And we will hear next from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, you referred to something in one of your remarks about propylene prices don't really affect your revenue line because you've got to convert that into propylene derivative price hikes. And then you mentioned also maybe propane gets soft in the summer. Can you just talk a little bit about what you expect on your propylene derivative pricing and what the usual lag might be in the marketplace between olefin changes and your product price changes?","James P. Rogers","Yes. If I implied that it didn't have an impact to something, that was wrong. I was just saying it's not a one-for-one relationship. So propylene can move, but a number of our derivatives are considered more specialty, and so you don't just jerk those around each week as propylene\u2019s -- you get the last spot price on propylene. That's more what I was saying. So it's not quite the same as being a merchant seller of propylene. We take it through other products. So I wasn't even talking so much about a lag, although there would obviously be a lag as you process it further. I was just meaning we're trying to be more disciplined in our pricing when it comes to our end products, priced more off of value where we can. But without a doubt, higher propylene prices aids our pricing. Now I can also tell you that pricing in general, not just in this area, but I'd say pricing in general is a little sloppier in the marketplace than it was a year ago. So I've got Ron sitting next to me, and I think he would say the same thing within PCI and CASPI. Last year, the demand was so strong that you pretty much got the price you wanted or you could sell it somewhere else in the world. And with Asia and Europe being fairly loose right now, you don't quite have that pricing power that you had a year ago, and that's not so much an Eastman comment as it is a market comment in general.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on your PDH unit, obviously, you're reluctant to name the counter-party until they talk about it. But the one PDH unit out there had a few growing pains, and so there appears to be some magic to the art of PDH. Are you concerned at all about start-up date, timing and the technology necessary here? Or are you pretty confident it will come on and start providing some help in 2015?","James P. Rogers","Ron?","Ronald C. Lindsay","Yes. We certainly are aware of some of the history here, and that was part of our due diligence as we went through this. I would say that we went in with that cautionary view and got ourselves comfortable that the technology is very viable that some of the -- we understand some of the reasons for prior concerns with another plan out there and feel like those are not things that are going to translate to this project. So the long short of it is we feel good about it from a technical and operational standpoint, as well as obviously the deal.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. And one last one if I might, it seemed like one benefit of turning your fourth cracker maybe into some sort of metathesis-type unit is you could consume ethylene, and while producing ethylene is wonderful for the next 3 or 4 years, then maybe you go through the typical down cycle. Have you ever considered maybe getting a pass-through ethylene price with somebody if they'd be willing to take the other side of that? Or how do you think about your ethylene price and getting it to market from Longview versus if you were down in the Gulf Coast?","James P. Rogers","I'll get Ron to answer this again. But we do have a contract with Westlake right now, which affects the pricing we get for ethylene. But Ron?","Ronald C. Lindsay","That's right. Certainly, as we look ahead, we haven't excluded the capability of doing the OCU with this other deal. So if we judge later that, that was attractive, something we wanted to do, we\u2019ve still got that option. So we've kept some optionality there. But we\u2019ve got our immediate concern dealt with, with the PDH deal that we've got.","James P. Rogers","Bob, I think we size this for people before that we said in OCU or in this case a contract, probably gives us slightly more benefit than we got opening up the last cracker we did. So you put that on an annual basis, that's fairly significant. And we can go to the next question.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You spoke of your earnings in the first half this year being roughly flat with your earnings last year. What were your earnings last year in the first half?","James P. Rogers","Jeff, again, I think if you look at our comments, I said that first half this year would be roughly equivalent to the second half of this year. I mean, I don't want to beat around the bush. We're trying to get away from quarterly guidance. We're trying to get people to think about us longer term. A lot of the things we're spending money on are projects that have long-term payback like Perennial Wood and microfibers, et cetera. So excuse me for taking your question to make this little point. But so while we gave some guidance about first half this year to second half next year, and a lot of that is just based on the thought that maybe the economy is not going to slow down and so maybe we'll get a little bit of a pickup in the second half, maybe fourth quarter won't be the typical down -- such a down quarter for us like it is so many other years. But again, it's pretty early in the year to try and be making these calls.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Will you generate much free cash flow this year?","Curtis E. Espeland","When I look at free cash flow expectations with our operating cash flow, we have some working capital programs we're trying to actually implement to actually improve our cash flow that reduce capital expenditure. On legacy Eastman, the way I look at it right now, we\u2019ll probably generate in excess of $300 million in free cash flow.","James P. Rogers","And that's after your dividend.","Curtis E. Espeland","And that's after CapEx and dividend.","Operator","And we will move on to our next question from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","On CASPI, you noted some weakness -- some volume weakness in polymers. Was that mainly in the auto side or in the packaging side? Just a little bit more color on that would be helpful.","James P. Rogers","Yes. When we think polymers, I think the weakness we're talking about as compared to last year, last year we had price increases going up on April 1. And so we got some nice buying going on in March, as you might imagine, last year. So year-over-year comparison, tough comparison for our polymers there. In general, all of CASPI seems to be doing quite well here. I would say auto, if you look specifically to autos, where some of our polymers go and CASPI some of the higher-margin stuff goes, North America looking pretty good, but Asia and Europe in particular are soft. Longer term, again though, I mean, what do you think, more cars being produced 5 years from now or fewer than this year?","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, I think I can answer that one. In terms of Fibers, obviously, price increases because of cost, but pulp -- there's some expectation that pulp has sort of hit a bottom here and is likely to go up. How do you feel about your cost position in Fibers and whether you're going to -- how much you're going to be able to raise price further this year to offset the rise in pulp?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Just a little bit on the Fibers market. Much of the marketplace is annual contracts. And so we buy our Fibers on a fix priced for a year -- buy our pulp on a fixed price for a year. But we also commit to a price for most of our large customers per year, not completely, but in general that's the way that market is priced. So typically, you have this big round of annual pricing in the winter, and at that time, you usually have a good idea what your costs are. So you try and line those up. And what's Fibers got -- is this the ninth year of earnings, record earnings? So, so far, we've been doing a pretty good job of lining those up.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just finally on PCI, obviously, you noted some weakness in Asia-Pacific. Would you give us a little bit more color? I mean, I know 2-EH has been coming down there, and certainly, you're facing a tough comparison year-over-year. Is that where you're seeing some of the weakness? Or is it broad-based? Just a little bit more color around -- on APAC for -- and PCI, please.","James P. Rogers","Ron?","Ronald C. Lindsay","Yes. This is Ron. It is in our oxo alcohols primarily. And keep in mind, we are comparing on a year-over-year basis against a pretty strong market environment in 2011. So there's some contrast there that's part of the issue. But there is -- we saw weakening late last year. There was quite a bit of destocking, a good bit of inventory coming in the year over there and looking for a home, and then we have not seen the rebound quite as robustly as we had hoped, and that is just not an Eastman comment. I think that's generally being seen across a lot of businesses. And so that's just turned into a weaker demand environment over there, and that's depressed margins.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Jeffrey Stafford with Morningstar.","Jeffrey Stafford - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","We've heard commentary from a few other companies that, in terms of demand, January and February were pretty weak and then March was very strong. Did your business progress this way through the first quarter?","James P. Rogers","It did, but I don't know how much weight to put on that, honestly. That's such a pretty typical pattern in a first quarter for our industry. So I personally am not going to play that up too much, but I know others have.","Jeffrey Stafford - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify, does the $5.30 EPS estimate, does that include Solutia or not?","Ronald C. Lindsay","Yes, it does. So if you build up, I mean, we're basically reaffirming guidance, and that's $0.30 from the pension change and about $0.30 from Solutia.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us this morning. A web replay and a replay in downloadable MP3 format will be available on our website beginning at 9 AM on Monday.

First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's third quarter 2015 financial results news release, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2015 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2015.","Second, earnings per share, operating earnings and EBITDA referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core costs, charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluding items, are available in the third quarter 2015 financial results news release and the Appendix to the slides that accompany our remarks this morning, both of which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com. Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the second quarter financial results news release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone, I'll start my comments on slide three. We had a solid third quarter in line with our expectations delivering strong earnings and cash flow and improving EBITDA margins to about 24% in a tough environment. We are continuing to benefit from the improvements we've made to the company, resulting in a more specialty portfolio. And we continue to show the benefits of a robust and diverse portfolio in both the breadth of our end market positions and geographic diversity .","Most importantly, our specialties are driving our growth: Advanced Materials, Adhesives & Plasticizers, and Additives & Functional Products lead our earnings growth this quarter and for the year. We are seeing some great innovation driven growth across the portfolio. For example, in window interlayers within Advanced Materials we are delivering very strong volume growth and we expect to set a record in overall volume with significant mix improvement.","As our premium acoustic and heads-up display products, volumes grow more than 20% year-over-year. With acoustics, we continue to see strong macro trends to reduce noise in the cabin and overall weight leading to greater penetration to a wide range of auto models.","In Advanced Materials, our recently launched displays product use for polarizer film in high-end mobile devices is delivering very strong earnings growth this year. This great innovation enables dramatically improved optical properties when viewing mobile devices at an angle and contributes to thinner devices by enabling more than a 50% reduction in film thickness.","In Additives & Functional Products, we are realizing a compelling synergy as Solutia's market connect in tires has enabled double-digit growth in our tackifying resins as a performance additive for traction eco-efficient tires. We are becoming the preferred innovative partner in the industry given Eastman has the most diverse set of technology platforms and deep application development capability relative to its competitors.","What I like about all of these examples is that we're delivering earnings growth through volume and mix upgrade in a tough environment. In addition, our acquisitions continue to deliver in this challenging environment. We're on track for $0.50 accretion. Taminco results remained solid due to the diversity of its portfolio and strong market positions. We just completed our SAP cutover in nine months with no customer disruptions, which is a great accomplishment and lets us ramp up our efforts on some of the cost and operational synergies.","Commonwealth has been an outstanding acquisition for Advanced Materials, expanding our films product portfolio into paint protection films which we are growing rapidly through our own distributor network. And the aviation turbine oil business we acquired from BP has integrated nicely with our existing aviation fluids. We are also doing outstanding job on the cost management, keeping cost relatively flat with strong productivity gains.","And within this, we continue to shift our resource mix towards our growth programs. Our strong performance was able to offset some increasing headwinds in declining olefin prices and a strengthening dollar, particularly in some emerging markets. And we continue to deliver strong free cash flow, $208 million in the third quarter and over $600 million through nine months. And we continue to expect free cash flow of $900 million for the year. None of this would be possible without the strong commitment of the talented Eastman employees throughout the world. Together, all this puts us on track for a sixth consecutive year of earnings growth.","Now I'll turn over to Curt to talk about corporate and segment results.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third quarter corporate results on slide four. Overall, sales revenue increased primarily due to revenue from the businesses we acquired in 2014, along with increased volume and mix improvement in our specialty businesses.","This was mostly offset by two factors. First, lower selling prices, particularly in Specialty Fluids and Intermediates and Additives & Functional Products, which largely reflected lower raw material energy costs. And second, the negative impact of foreign currency.","Our operating earnings increased primarily due to earnings from acquired businesses and strong performance in Advanced Materials and Adhesives & Plasticizers.","With our heritage businesses, there were two key drivers of this performance: Volume and mix improvement especially in Advanced Materials and our value-based pricing relative to raw materials reflecting the specialty and special position nature of a significant portion of our product portfolio.","These were partially offset by propane hedges and the unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating margin increased by 100 basis points to almost 19%. Earnings per share was $1.84 for the quarter, primarily reflecting higher operating earnings.","Year-over-year, earnings per share declined slightly as higher operating earnings was offset by higher interest expense and also other charges of $13 million, primarily reflecting volatile emerging market currencies negatively impacting our foreign denominated balance sheet transactions in the quarter.","On a year-over-year basis, these other charges were about a $0.09 headwind for the quarter and we do not expect this kind of magnitude in the fourth quarter. Overall, a strong quarter with particularly solid results in our specialty businesses.","Moving next to the segment results and starting with Additives & Functional Products on slide five. Revenue increased due to the sales of acquired Taminco businesses. This was partially offset by lower coatings and other formulated products selling prices which reflected lower raw material and energy costs.","An unfavorable shift in foreign exchange rates was also a headwind. Operating earnings increased year-over-year primarily due to earnings from the acquired businesses offset by lower propane hedges. We continue to expect strong full year earnings growth for this segment due to earnings from acquired businesses.","We expect earnings in the heritage Eastman businesses will be similar to the previous year as solid volume growth continues to offset the effects of propane hedges and currency.","Next is Adhesives & Plasticizers on slide nine. I'm sorry, slide six. Sales revenue declined 12%, primarily due to lower selling prices, reflecting low raw material and energy costs and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. We continue to see a favorable shift in product mix due to strong volume growth, particularly for our non-phthalate plasticizers due to substitution in North America. This was offset by a decrease in non-hydrogenated resin volume due to operational constraints. Operating earnings increased in the third quarter as improved spread for both Adhesives & Plasticizers was partially offset by currency and propane hedges.","For full year 2015, we expect to continue to improve our product mix with strong growth in hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins and non-phthalate plasticizers. We expect this will be partially offset by impact of currency. Taken together, we continue to expect, Adhesives & Plasticizers will deliver strong earnings growth for the year.","Now to Advanced Materials on slide seven, which continues to deliver on the elements on the strategy, volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage. Sales revenue increased primarily due to sales of products of the acquired performance films business. Higher sales volumes, as well as mix improvement especially for inner layers. This strong volume growth was partially offset by currency and lower selling prices primary for copolyesters due to lower raw material and energy costs.","Operating earnings increased primarily due to increased volume and improved product mix, lower raw material costs, the benefits of fixed cost leverage and earnings from the acquired business offset by lower selling prices and currency. These are just outstanding results for the first nine months.","On the full year outlook for Advanced Materials, we expect to continue to have year-over-year volume growth and mix improvement, however, it is typical for volumes to be seasonally lower in the fourth quarter, and we expect this again this year, and we also expect some inventory management in the quarter.","With all that said, Advanced Materials is positioned for very strong earnings growth in 2015, which should give them momentum heading into 2016.","Now to Fibers on slide 8. Revenue declined 8% mainly due t o lower volume, primarily driven by acetyl chemical volume. Lower acetyl chemical volume was due to decreased sales to the acetate flake joint venture in Kingsport. While acetyl volume was down slightly year-over-year, it was up about 20% sequentially and is on track to be about 20% higher in the second half of 2015 compared to the first half. This total increase reflects both slowing inventory destocking and customer buying patterns.","Operating earnings were about as expected down year-over-year due to the lower volume, but up sequentially as total volume increased to slightly below the previous year's level. Operating margin was at 32%.","On our full year outlook, we continue to expect second half earnings will be better than the first half, with increased total volumes, but full year earnings will be somewhat below what we expected in July primarily due to the lower acetyl chemical volumes.","I'll finish the segment review with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on slide nine. Sales revenue decreased as lower selling prices particularly for olefin-based intermediates and lower chemical and other intermediates sales volumes more than offset sales of products of the acquired business. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to the propane hedges and lower volumes in chemical and other intermediates more than offsetting earnings from the acquired business.","Looking at the full year, we now expect a number of factors impacting results. We expect to continue from the benefit from volume growth and earnings from acquired businesses. Sales for the heritage Eastman businesses is expected to be above flat as solid end market demand is offset by increasing internal use of intermediates for both the Taminco business and the growth in heritage Eastman businesses as well as lower polymer intermediates volumes.","Propylene and ethylene prices declined further than expected during the third quarter. We anticipate prices to remain low for the fourth quarter negatively impacting olefin margins. We continue to expect the impact of the propane hedges to negatively impact this segment for the fourth quarter as the cost of the hedges flow through inventories.","From a corporate perspective, we now expect the year-over-year headwind of producing versus purchasing olefins including the propane hedge to increase to about $0.80 per share for the full year versus our previous expectation of $0.60.","The increase in the negative impact will be predominantly reflected in Specialty Fluids & Intermediates in the fourth quarter. We will offset some of this headwind with pricing actions for our derivatives but not all of it. As a result, we expect Specialty Fluids & Intermediates earnings in 2015 will be lower than 2014 earnings.","On slide 10, I'll transition to an overview of our cash and other financial highlights for the quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with our third quarter operating cash flow of $368 million. Net earnings were solid and we continue to be disciplined with working capital. We contributed $90 million to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter and expect to contribute an additional $10 million in the fourth quarter.","Capital expenditures totaled $160 million and we anticipate full year capital expenditures to be around $675 million as our underlying capital schedules are weighted to the second half of the year.","We generated $208 million of free cash flow for the quarter, and we continue to expect our full year 2015 free cash flow will be around $900 million. Our third quarter dividend was $60 million, reflecting a yield of 2%, and our effective tax rate for the third quarter was just over 27%.","We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 26% and 27%, reflecting the continued benefits of improvement in our business operations, as well as reflecting our expectation that Congress will sign the tax extenders, including the R&D tax credit, into law before the end of the year. If these tax extenders are not passed, this would be about a $0.10 per share headwind to our fourth quarter earnings per share expectations.","Given our strong first nine months, we are on track for an excellent financial performance in 2015. And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Curt. We've talked a lot about the benefits of our portfolio transformation and how that contributes to our consistent earnings growth and strong cash generation. On slide 11, we're giving you another way to look at it. Portfolio transformation has been a key element to delivering strong earnings growth for quite some time, on both organic growth as well as through aggressive actions to change our portfolio. We divested roughly $3.5 billion of revenue with EBITDA margins below 10%, we've acquired over $4 billion of EBITDA margins greater than 25%, significantly upgrading the quality of our portfolio and our end market exposure.","Organically, we've also grown our volume and most importantly, upgraded our mix. This is our both within our heritage businesses, and within the acquired businesses through great efforts in innovation programs and commercial excellence, to focus our growth in the most attractive products, markets and geographies.","As a result of these efforts, you can see that a very different story has emerged from five years ago. We've strengthened the company; we're also growing the overall earnings by 70%. So when you look at 2010, you can see corporate earnings were about $1 billion and Fibers and SFI was around 50%, just over 50% of where our earnings came from.","And a significant story has evolved and changed as you look at the trailing 12 months of our earnings. Not only is it 70% higher, it is significantly higher quality. So the AAA segments, Advanced Materials, Additives & Functional Products and Adhesives & Plasticizers, grew 115%, dramatically increasing growth and quality of earnings for shareholders and presenting a much more sustainable mix in how we're going to deliver earnings growth. And obviously now, Fibers and SFI being a smaller percentage of that total.","So it's a great story of the AAA segments delivering earnings growth which we can sustain going forward as well as Fibers being a foundational part of our story, delivering stable earnings, and SFI being the engine that delivers the intermediates to support the growth in the specialties. So that portfolio, I think, is really demonstrating and creating a lot of value for us this year and showing how we can continue creating value for shareholders going forward.","And I think that's a good transition to our full year 2015 outlook on slide 12. We've had a strong first nine months of the year with record EPS and cash flow. Our specialty businesses are leading the way with growth in innovative product lines resulting in improved mix and overall doing a great job of holding on to value.","We've also done a great job remaining disciplined in cost management. And as I mentioned previously, our specialty acquisitions are delivering for us this year and we expect they will contribute meaningfully to our growth going forward.","Of course, challenges remain and in some places they are intensifying. Most notably, olefin prices, which started to move against us in the third quarter, and we expect this challenge will continue into the fourth quarter.","We expect ethylene prices will recover in the early part of next year given the high industry cracker shutdown schedule planned for the spring. Overall, we continue to focus on the things that we can control, most notably executing our strategy to deliver results. When you net all the things that we're doing well against the challenges we face, we continue to expect we will deliver our sixth consecutive year of earnings growth in 2015, something only a select few S&P 500 companies have ever done in the last 10 years. And that is something we expect to build on going forward.","I'll close on slide 13 with how we are doing so far in the key themes for 2015. These are the same that we shared with you in January, and we've emphasized each throughout the presentation today. We'll continue to make great progress in transformation towards the specialty portfolio. We are driving growth in our specialty businesses based on our world-class technology platforms that enable us to have strong leadership positions in an attractive set of niche markets. We're accelerating earnings growth by improving our product mix with high growth of innovative high-margin products.","We're achieving attractive earnings accretion from high-quality specialty acquisitions and creating value by adding attractive end markets and products to our portfolio. And we're generating industry-leading free cash flow based on our attractive market positions and advantaged cost positions.","We remain committed to fully deploying our strong balance sheet in a disciplined and balanced manner. Our first priority for capital allocation is completing our repayment of approximately $1 billion of debt associated with the Taminco acquisition and we are on track. Investors should continue to expect an increasing dividend which we have done for the last four years, providing a greater than S&P 500 average yield. And after delevering, we will repurchase shares in the back half of next year. Of course, we remain open to bolt-on acquisitions if they are very attractive and have a strong fit with our existing businesses.","Our performance through the nine months is outstanding despite the challenging business environment. We are confident in our six consecutive years of earnings growth and on track for $900 million of free cash flow providing roughly an 8% yield. We've got a great strategy, a great portfolio of businesses and simply outstanding group of employees who continue to execute. I'm very confident in our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders.","Thank you for joining us this morning. I look forward to your questions.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Okay. Thanks, Mark. We've got a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. So I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, Nikki, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Mark, I know it's early, but looking to 2016, can you grow earnings next year? And if so, what are the key drivers, headwinds as well as tailwinds, do you think?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Dave. I would have never guessed that question coming from you. So, happy to talk about it. First, and to keep it simple, we're confident we can grow earnings in 2016 relative to 2015. We have several tailwinds that I think are important. The most important by far is that continued growth in our specialty segments, the AAA segments, I think, are all well-positioned to deliver earnings growth. And the key drivers of it will be the volume and mix that they have, continuing to leverage the acquisitions that they've done as well to deliver that growth.","The second will be a net tailwind from the hedges coming off, so you've got the propane hedge coming off. you also have some of the currency hedge coming off, the net that provides that provides a tailwind. I think it's reasonable to expect that olefin prices next year relative to this year are likely to be higher especially given how low they've gone in the back half of this year with sort of supply gluts in ethylene and propylene. So that will certainly be helpful.","Of course, there are the synergies that we have around the acquisitions, the cost synergies and even some commercial synergies. And I would note that we're also planning on aggressively managing our costs across the entire company. We've done a great job in productivity this year and we're going to ramp up our efforts for more aggressive actions next year to improve our cost position in the marketplace.","And lastly, there's the strength of our free cash flow. So we'll create value for shareholders in paying down our debt and then getting access to that free cash with repurchased shares. So you add all those together and it's a nice set of tailwinds. There is one headwind I think that applies to every chemical company that has raw materials derived from oil. So we've been benefiting this year as raw material prices have dropped pretty rapidly, and we've held on the prices in a number of our businesses expanding our margins. And of course, as you go through the year, you give some of that back with price and so that's great this year. Obviously, if raws are flat next year that becomes a bit of a headwind.","I don't think that it's significant for us relative to some others because of the propane hedge and so much of our earnings are coming from cellulosics that didn't have spread expansion. But there'll be some of that headwind that nets against those tailwinds. And then it comes down to the big uncertainties around the global economic factors around overall market growth and currencies. But assuming those are stable, I think we're very well-positioned to deliver earnings growth because the tailwinds are quite significant.","So I think we're just well-positioned for some our seventh year of earnings growth and I think it's a great opportunity, especially when you think about what we're delivering for shareholders and earnings growth, strong EBITDA margins, our cash flow yield, it's a great valuation upside.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. Very helpful. Thank you. And just on acetate tow destocking, Mark, where are we in that process?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we're quite encouraged and happy to see demand come back exactly as we expected from the beginning of the year in tow, 20% improvement sequentially into the third quarter was great. And we expect volumes to continue to be solid into the fourth quarter. So I think that when you look outside of China, destocking, I think, has run its course. And when you look inside China, I think that you've got some risk of destocking continuing into next year.","They certainly have made progress in destocking from what we can see in the wholesale inventories. But it's a little hard to know if they've gone all the way to achieving their objective. But I think that overall, what I would say is that expects sort of flat demand for us next year. So outside China, you have destocking ending, but the normal macro declines of cigarette consumption, netting against each other. Inside of China, you've got some expected growth in cigarette production as the Chinese National Tobacco Company continues to drive to meet its tax revenue growth targets.","You've got some filter lengthening that's going on still, and you've got this question around destocking and chance of it being some, but maybe not as much as this year, offset by the Daiso joint venture which started up in the middle of next year, obviously continuing into next year. So all those net against each other, and it also feels sort of flattish. So global flattish situation when we look at demand for next year versus this year.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And the next question will come from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. Just a follow-up on Fibers, Mark. Do you think you can earnings in Fibers if demand is flat next year?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've been saying this all year. I would expect earnings from Fibers to be stable, but I'm not going to call it as growth or down. I think it's going to be relatively stable. There's a lot of moving parts. We're in the beginning of our contract discussions with all of our customers on volume and price. And so we'll comment more about that next year. But I think it's stable which, back to the 2016 earnings question, it's stable. It's not a headwind against the growth in the AAA segments.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","In the AAA segments, if we look short term in the fourth quarter, do you think the raw material margin spreads can hold or do you expect to give back some of the pricing gains that you had so far?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As you look at the AAA segment, I think each segment has a different story. And it's important to start by thinking about it from a stream point of view. So cellulosics, which drives a lot of earnings obviously in Fibers, but also in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. There's been no spread expansion. That business, based on value, our raw materials or coal, that's not a spread expansion story, so that's quite stable.","And then you've got sort of olefin versus paraxylene as the other components within those AAA segments. And on the olefin side, while both olefin prices and ethane and propane have dropped, given our propane hedge, we haven't had a lot of margin expansion in olefins, anywhere in the portfolio when you look at it on a four-year basis. And so I don't think you've got a huge margin expansion problem in olefins.","So, you're then down to paraxylene and I think you've got some tailwind in Advanced Materials associated with paraxylene for our co-polyesters and that certainly been helpful. But I'd put that in the order, the third place of how we've driven earnings growth in Advanced Materials this year, volume and mix being the number one driver, the acquisition being number two and then that being number three. So it will certainly mitigate how we can grow earnings next year, but I still think we'll grow earnings.","And then Adhesives & Plasticizers, the one place where we probably also have some margin expansion especially in adhesives where the industry has been really tight, and we've seen great margins in that business. And we expect those margins to come off a little bit as we go into next year.","We also expect that to be balanced against volume growth in adhesives as we've been able to get more access to raw materials and address some operational limitations that we had this year. And so that margin coming off versus volume growth will net against each other. It's a little hard to call how that will play out. But overall, we look at the AAA segments and see earnings growth coming from those three segments delivering growth for shareholders next year.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from John Roberts, UBS.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Morning.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, John.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","What will be your propane strategy in the future as the hedges roll off?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think right now, we'll continue to evaluate kind of where we think propane is going as well as just what is the pricing of our propylene derivatives and ethylene derivatives. Our hedging for this year, next year are virtually down. So there won't be any more hedging done at this point. Beyond that we'll continue to evaluate as the market dictates.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So it sounds like you'll be opportunistic in fact rather than having some sort of programmatic strategy?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We will always have a programmatic strategy. I'm just saying as it relates for the next couple of years that strategy has already been executed.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then Indorama recently acquired an idled ethylene Gulf Coast cracker for restart. Any opportunities for your idled assets especially given the drop in propane?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, if you're talking about our \u2013 we have one cracker that's been idle and that has always been an asset we're always looking at ways to maybe create value. But predominantly, at this point, our focus has been on our derivatives. When you look at our crackers itself, I don't see bringing that cracker up at this point, unless there's another party that feels they can use that excess ethylene that comes from that.","What we're continuing to look for is just how do we deal with our excess ethylene, still some good options out there, some things we have to work through as you know. But our focus is just how do we potentially get rid of that excess ethylene from our portfolio.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Frank Mitsch, Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. And nice job with the specialties this quarter gentlemen.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. How are you?","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm doing fine. Hey. Mark, quick question. I know you're Northern California based or from 49ers or Raiders?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Raiders. Grew up on the Raiders.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Awesome. We'll set-up a bet later on today for Sunday's game. In the discussion regarding Advanced Materials, you talked a lot about the acoustic interlayers and the fact that that's been growing, I guess, 20% was the comment made. I'm just curious as to where we are in the spectrum of types of cars that the special product is going in, and how much more penetration we might have? So how much longer can we expect to see double-digit type growth out of that? What's the penetration like there?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Frank. The acoustic interlayers are just a fantastic product and it was greater than 20% volume growth this year, it's just been tremendous. And we really started with luxury cars, and we're just in the process of moving into the mid-tier cars with the acoustics and the windshield which both quiets the cabin and now they're doing trade-offs between do I acquire the cabin or do I take glass out to hit better fuel efficiency. So it's opening up a wide range of choices.","But I think that we're going to see \u2013 we're still just in the beginning of penetrating the overall market. And I also see growth beyond just the windshield. So we're seeing people start moving to laminated glass on the side windows as well, for both safety reasons as well as acoustic reasons. So we're getting more real estate per car, more cars. We have several years ahead of us in growth from a penetration point of view, and we have a next-generation acoustic product that significantly improves performance over this one that's going to give us a whole another leg of innovation and growth on top of it. So a lot of room to grow there.","And I'd also note that heads-up display has got a huge potential market in front of us relative to its current penetration. We're seeing a lot of growth there as people are trying to work on better mobility and safety for information provision to drivers in the car. So I think \u2013 and we're making significant improvements not just with the current product, but a whole another next-generation product to allow a much bigger screen, much better clarity in the windshields. So this area is just on fire with innovation. It's an exciting space for us.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Terrific. I'll wait on buying a new car so I can get all these neat little things. Curt, when you talked about the $0.80 negative headwind on SFI for the balance of the year due to the decline in olefins and hedges, I guess you were expecting that to be a negative $0.60 at the end of Q2, now you're expecting it to be a negative $0.80. How much of that $0.20 delta was realized in Q3 versus Q4?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I'd say, Frank, the $0.80 per share headwind is for the whole company, and that is a $0.20 impact. I would say some of that showed up in third quarter, but a predominant piece of it's going to be showing up in the fourth quarter.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then lastly, Curt, you also mentioned that if the tax extender, your anticipation is that the tax extenders will be passed by Congress before the end of the year, and that $0.10 is embedded in your expectations for Q4. I'm not sure I actually caught what your expectations were for Q4. Can you clarify that?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me clarify my expectation on the tax rate, Frank. What I would indicate is that if the tax extenders are passed, our tax rate for the year will be closer to 26%. If they're not passed, they'll be closer to 27%.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan, RBC Capital Markets.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess I had a couple questions on Taminco, maybe if you can just help us understand if this is tracking according to your expectations on the accretion, and what your expectations are for next year. Obviously, there's been some changes on the ag side. Are those any concerns for you guys? Thanks.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So Taminco is definitely on track with our expectations except for currency. So as we look at the overall business, we certainly did feel like everyone else, some pressure on the row crop-related ag part of Taminco's business. It's important to remember that row crops are only about 10% of Taminco's business or just over 1% of Eastman's revenue. So it's not a significant factor for us, but certainly, we're tracking with what you're reading in the press of the big ag companies on row crops, and that being off a bit.","That has been offset largely by a strong performance in our crop protection business where we sell a great set of fungicides and soil fumigants and other products into perishable products that have done well this year, and aren't caught up in this oversupply of corn and soybeans.","So that part is sort of hanging in there together on a net basis; obviously, the oil and gas business didn't grow as much as we expected upstream, but we've actually seen good downstream growth offsetting some of that where we sell products into cleaning up the gas. And then, water treatment and personal care doing quite well.","So overall, I think the revenue side of the equation is hanging in relatively well. They're doing a very good job of managing their cost like all of Eastman and providing good earnings accretion for the shareholders, synergies coming in as we expected. But we did take a hit on currency that certainly wasn't in our plans when I looked at this acquisition 12 months ago.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And then I don't know if you talked about this, but on the propane hedge, is there any way you can help us quantify like the year-on-year change that you expect and now that your programs are complete for 2016 versus 2015? I mean, you have like a $0.40 to $0.60 hit this year, probably at the higher end of that. Obviously, it's likely to be less next year given the comps but how do you see it playing out?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, Arun, first \u2013 this is Curt, and by the way, welcome to our call. I appreciate you coming.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Let me just clarify two things. First of all, as it relates to our expectations, there's about an $0.80 headwind now for 2015. And that changes \u2013 not because of the hedges, it's predominantly because of selling prices with ethylene. But if you think about our hedge, we're about two-thirds hedged in 2015 and we've said that'll just be about 50% in 2016. So that'll give you some magnitude of the shift that will occur, that will have a tailwind for us as it relates to lower propane hedge costs.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just lastly on SFI, I mean, obviously the business is challenged on the ethylene side. Is there kind of a long-term view on where this fits into the portfolio? You've been decreasing your commodity exposure over the last several years, is that still kind of the objective or is this kind of a permanent member? And I'll turn it over. Thanks.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly, the Texas integrated site that produces the ethylene and propylene, and we translate that into all of our specialties that we sell out of that site, is a permanent member of the company and one that we're focused on keeping.","As we've said since the summer of 2013, we've been looking to sell our small crackers that produce the excess ethylene, which is the real volatility you're seeing today in earnings, started in third quarter, and you're going to see more of it in the fourth quarter. We've wanted to get rid of that since 2013, but our sales process got disrupted by Westlake.","So we're still focused on doing that, but the big cracker at the site produces all the hydrogen and steam for the site that runs all of our specialty businesses. You have to run that at an extremely high reliability rate because we are making products where, in some cases, we're the only manufacturer in the world in the specialties and so controlling and maintaining that integrated site is essential for our specialty business.","And so we're going to continue to focus on doing that. We're quite proud of the fact that we haven't had a force majeure in 20 years across our sites, and our customers put a lot of value on that because they know that they can count on us as being a reliable supplier. And in specialties, when there's very few alternative suppliers, it's a very significant part of our value proposition.","But we're going to always get out of every bit of commodity we can. We've been doing it for the last seven years in the $3.5 billion of revenue we sold off. So, I think we're doing all we can. We'll continue looking for those opportunities.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Mark, when you think about \u2013 you talked about the headwinds this year from Fibers and Specialty Fluids becoming bigger. Clearly, it's the specialty business is doing better. So if you total it up, how much better are the specialty businesses coming in this year than you thought at the beginning of the year? And is there a way for you to maybe just help us understand the growth that they're generating in total for you this year to offset some of those bigger headwinds?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Mike. I'll try that at a high level. The specialty businesses that have the growth, the AAA segments, they certainly are exceeding our expectations, they're delivering more volume and mix upgrade than we expected at the beginning of the year in a tough economic environment, and obviously doing a great job of holding onto value in our pricing where it's appropriate as raws come off.","So I'd say they're certainly ahead of our expectations. And I think Fibers came out more or less where we expected this year, so that's not been a surprise. And I do think it will stabilize out as we go into next year. And then unfortunately offsetting some of the great performance that we've seen in the specialties has been the significant drop in olefin prices that have gone well past the value of oil in the middle of the quarter, in the third quarter and into the fourth. That sort of offsets some of that great performance.","But the good news about the olefin price headwinds is I think they're relatively temporary because it is more of a supply-driven thing, and I think will go to a more balanced situation next year from what all the experts seem to be saying. So if that's true then that pressure will come off and not be offsetting the growth in the specialties.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And if you thought about 2016 from the growth perspective from your specialty businesses, any reason why the growth wouldn't be similar 2015 versus 2014 that you could get a 2016 versus 2015?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's not going to be \u2013 I'd love to be able to tell you it was going to be that great. But it's not going to be that strong when you look at the AAA segment on a 2014 to 2015 basis, principally because one factor is not there which is the acquisitions have added a lot of earning from 2014 to 2015. In addition, I mentioned that some of the spread expansion that every chemical company in this industry has this year associated with oil on prices versus raws is not really expected next year as I'm thinking of raws being sort of flattish with oil being flattish into next year.","And if that's the case, you'll focus on the volume and mix component of delivering earnings growth. So it will certainly be a moderated growth in 2016 versus 2015, but still growth and I think that's going to show up as very good performance as we all get into next year.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How do you calculate your hedge cost? That is, is it simply the difference between the price you've paid because you've hedged versus the price of propane that you would have bought in the market or is it more complicated than that?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, Jeff, that's generally the case. We do have some options around our hedging strategy. But to a greater extent, they're forward contracts and with forward contracts, it's just simply the price of that forward contract relative to the price. And as we talked about before, a lot of that forward contract was just around the dollar.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So what changed so that you thought it was $0.60 and now you think it was $0.80?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jeff, that delta is not in \u2013 the propane impact hasn't changed. That is just a reflection of pricing of olefins, but predominantly the collapse in ethylene.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Jeff, for example, in ethylene prices, we started the quarter out when we were still in the sort of $0.34 range in the third quarter. We saw spot dropped all the way down to $0.18 at one point. We're in the sort of low-to-mid-20%s now. So ethylene has just come off tremendously and the propylene has come off as well. So this is purely a ethylene\/propylene related issue, especially ethylene relative to what we had originally expected.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Jeff, I just want to remind everyone. This is our estimated benefit of producing versus purchasing olefins, it's a theoretical calculation we try to provide, which is influenced by the propane hedge, but that is something we tried to provide to give some sense. You still have the pricing dynamics above and beyond it.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's important to keep in mind, when we put out that $0.60 to $0.80 change, that $0.20 is not what we're going to actually feel, right? We're taking pricing actions to mitigate some of that pressure as we did already in the third quarter and we'll continue to try and do in the fourth quarter. But it's certainly more pressure than we expected three months ago.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm still puzzled. If the cost of the hedge is simply the difference between the propane price and your hedged propane price, the price of ethylene or propylene shouldn't enter into that.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let me try and clarify, Jeff. When we talk about cracking spread headwind, it is not a hedge comment. It is an overall cracking spread comment. So we're looking at the cracking spreads that we have, ethylene and propylene prices minus the cost to produce those products of ethane and propane and the hedge all rolled in was a $0.60 headwind relative to 2014 when we started the year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And so, when you go to where we are today, nothing has changed on the hedge. But what has changed is ethylene and propylene prices for the cracking spread calculation have come down significantly from where we were three months ago and creating some compression. But it's important to keep in mind that we don't sell propylene in the marketplace, we sell derivatives. So each product, the specialty products, obviously, we're going to do a better job on holding on the value versus some of the commodities in SFI as propylene comes down, same story with ethylene, which is predominantly sitting in SFI.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So \u2013 I mean if you weren't hedged, would your spreads have contracted as well? Because propylene has come down really, really fast and so I would imagine that propylene derivative prices would have come down at a slower rate. That is, is squeeze the function of your hedge or it's the function of the relationship between propylene and its derivatives?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's both. If you think about \u2013 ignore the hedge for a second. Cracking spreads have compressed this year versus last year, right? And on top of that, we have an additional cost headwind associated with the propane hedge. So both of those contribute to the 14% to 15% cracking spread calculation.","But you're right. In the specialty businesses like Additives & Functional Products, we've done a great job of holding on the value and price relative to how propylene prices have dropped, but even there you start giving it back over time.","In SFI, a lot of those products in the price moves pretty fast with propylene and ethylene, so the drop in those prices drop revenue pretty quickly with the drop in ethylene and propylene. And then you've got the cost structure on the other side.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just two more quickly.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Jeff, how about one more quickly, please?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Then we'll try one more quickly. Were your volumes affected by your hedged position? In other words, if your cost of propane were lower, would you have sold more tons of stuff? And so, you were limited because of your cost structure or did it not affect your volumes?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The hedge had zero effect on volumes. We price based on value in the marketplace. It has nothing to do with volumes.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bob.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Curt, I think you said something about next year it's going to be more about volume unless maybe about some spreads to drive earnings. I guess I was just hoping you could give us some sense of what you expect overall in volumes? It seems like this year \u2013 and the globe has grown some, but the volumes haven't been very powerful. Would you expect there to be improvement next year? Obviously, the specialty side doing well, but do you think the broad portfolio can get GDP-type volume growth next year? And why would you not think so?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that we'll certainly see volume growth in the AAA specialty businesses consistent with GDP and then levered up by some of our innovative high margin products growing much faster than GDP. So I think that when you look at Advanced Materials, the end markets that we're serving there from consumer durables to transportation and medical, all those markets are, I think, expected to grow well next year and we feel good about growth next year over this year.","Additives & Functional Products, same thing. I think coatings will continue to grow and there's probably upside in residential housing in North America when you look at the housing start rates. So that should be relatively good.","Tires has been a really tough year this year where we've been sort of flat in volume as China has come off with a lot of destocking and slowdown in their economic situation, and that's been offset fortunately by North America and Europe.","But again, tire volumes sort of flattish this year globally for Crystex and PPDs and then of course strong tire resin growth on top of that, giving us overall growth. And I would actually expect tire growth in China to be better, and the rest of globe continue growing. So, again, feel good about growth in tires next year because I think some of the destocking will be done in China.","And then Adhesives & Plasticizers, great underlying market trends in hygiene and packaging for the adhesives as well as the non-phthalate conversions in North America driving a lot of volume growth. So over that, I think it's all good. As I mentioned already, we expect volume and earnings to be relatively flattish in Fibers. And then SFI is just the engine that makes everything else run. So those kgs are a little deceptive because if we do shutdowns more in one year versus another, for example, all of that volume variance for the total company shows up in SFI as we have just \u2013 the run rates of what we can sell, that's left over in SFI after we've done all the specialty growth for those intermediates.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And could you tell me what would you root for from an energy or oil price standpoint? Do you like what's optimal? A little inflation? a little deflation? Flat? In terms of how you respond to the market and what it does to your cost structure? And maybe your customer behavior? Thanks.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that like probably most chemical companies, we all favor a steadily increasing raw material environment and a steadily increasing growth environment. So oil going up on a steady basis is probably the best scenario you can hope for. The worst thing for chemical companies is extreme volatility where the price of oil and raw is flying up and down.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Thanks very much. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander, Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just a quick one. If the ag market stabilized and oil extraction industries return to sort of a mid-cycle level, what would your operating leverage to that be?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as I just mentioned, a steadily increasing oil price would certainly be good for the overall company. When it comes to products going into ag and oil and gas specifically, obviously, that would be volume upside for us relative to where we are today and give us a nice earnings growth especially through some of the Taminco businesses.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Do you have a sense for how much you're under earning in those businesses currently?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as I said, in ag I don't think we're really under earning because while we took a hit on volume coming off a bit in corn and soybean crops, we benefited from crop protection having a good seasonal year. So I don't think there was a overall big hit this year for us compared to some of the ag-focused companies. But I think there'll be modest improvement for us. So I'm not going to call out this specific earnings gain.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Nils Wallin, CLSA Brokerage.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. First one on Advanced Materials. If acoustics is growing greater than 20%, it's something like 30% or 40% of the business, that would imply a higher volume growth year-on-year in Advanced Materials, but I think you came at around 5%. So is there something that's actually declining in volume or is it just the Tritan in the other performance films or just not growing as fast as acoustics?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So acoustics is a great product, but it's only part of overall Advanced Materials which is a very big segment. So what we love about the overall Advanced Materials business is it's having a great year across a wide range of specialty products. But some of the bigger volume products like copolyesters have a certain amount of limitation on how much they're going to grow that factors into that weighted average number that you're looking at. And I'd also note that we had some offsets in performance films in emerging markets. So you're selling films that go on to cars that are being sold.","And so places like Brazil, Southeast Asia and even, to some extent, China have not been great for us for some of the performance films. And so that's not been growing as much in some of those isolated markets. I would note that performance films is growing incredibly well in North America and in some of our distribution channels in China. But overall, it nets out that way.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. Thanks. And then I believe in one of the questions or in your commentary, you said that there had been no spread benefit in cellulosics and you called out coal. But my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe specialty pulp did come down in price, so did your tow prices follow that or am I incorrect about the raw materials on the acetate tow?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, as we've talked about before, the cost of our inputs for Fibers is pretty well known a year in advance, as well as the contract negotiations we have. And so some of that cellulosics impact on Fibers has already been reflected and you see the pricing behavior of Fibers in our numbers.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you. And just one last, one if I may...","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Nils, I'm sorry, but we've got...","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","No problem. Okay.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","people in the queue.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll go to the next. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","Eric B. Petrie - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Good morning. This is Eric Petrie standing in for P.J. Your Adhesives & Plasticizers margins have increased nicely over the last couple of years at 24%, and I think that compares against the range of 17% to 20% that you gave at your Investor Day in 2013. So is this expansion more or less a function of lower raw materials or are we setting a new range going forward?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a mix of everything. So when you \u2013 two stories in Adhesives & Plasticizers. On the Adhesives side, the industry has been tight, giving us pricing power. And obviously, we've enjoyed that and improved our margins from that. But it's also important to note that we're also upgrading the mix within that volume that you don't quite see. So we're selling \u2013 having nice growth in our differentiated hydrogenated resins that are going into packaging and diapers and other products like that that are going quite well. And we've had a bit of a decline in volume in our non-hydrogenated resins, which are a lower margin that have been restricted because of raw material availability and some operational issues. So net, you've had a mix upgrade and some margin expansion in that story.","On the Plasticizers side, you've had great volume growth offset by margin compression as the Asian competitors have been trying to sell their non-phthalate plasticizers in Europe and North America with the lower oil price and, of course, we're shale gas-based in those products, so we've been feeling some compression there.","So as you look at next year, which I think is the key to this question, is you'll see some margins come off in Adhesives because there is some more raw materials being made available that cause it to be tight. But we'll have more volume growth next year than this year in Adhesives, offsetting that to some degree, and we'll see how that plays out as we get into January. And then on the Plasticizers side, we should have good volume growth again next year and hope that the spreads stabilize, and that should be a source of earnings growth.","So, overall, I think that the margin percentage will come down, but we'll still be in a good position to deliver good earnings out of this segment.","Eric B. Petrie - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then my second question, can you just update us on your market share of non-phthalate plasticizers in the U.S.? What kind of utilization rates are you running at and do you have any expansion opportunities, I believe, with sterling, to expand capacity?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Taking it in reverse order. We have plenty of capacity to grow in non-phthalate plasticizers and there's plenty of opportunity in this market to continue to grow. We're just beginning the full conversion of this market to non-phthalate, so we have several years to run.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Could we have the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I'll keep it to one question. Your foreign exchange rate impact year-to-date is minus 3%. Can you just remind us of what type of FX hedges you had on this year? And how much of them extend into next year, so we can think about that?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. If I could break it down, if you think about the economic exposure we have with currency, we're predominantly long in euro. And we've talked about that being roughly a $0.30 per share headwind, 2015 over 2014. That has benefited, about a 50% hedge (57:42) a little bit in 2016 the amount of hedge we have in place there. But we'll still have a nice hedge to help mitigate some of that exposure.","And then on top of it, we have some other foreign currencies we have exposure to on a smaller scale, like the yen and others. And so if I think about this year, that's probably another $0.10 per share headwind. And so when I look at currency for the full year, about 40% headwind mitigated partially because of the euro hedge and we'll have a good euro hedge going into next year still, but just to a smaller degree.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And just the euro hedge for next year, it's a smaller percentage but at the same rate as 2015?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","We'll make the next question the last one please.","Operator","And the final question comes from Duffy Fischer, Barclays Capital.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, fellows. A question back on interlayers. One of your big competitors was sold a little over a year ago. Is there any chance that that transition is part of the benefit that you're seeing today and may end up kind of being a little bit transitory then?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We certainly saw that the industry consolidated with Kuraray buying DuPont's business. But I wouldn't say that we are seeing growth this year because of that consolidation. I think that everyone's out there trying to compete as best as they possibly can. We're just enjoying a lot of growth because of our products and our value proposition to our customers.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just last one, on the outlook, you're running about $0.20 ahead year-to-date on EPS. So if you took the very low end, you could say Q4 could be down $0.20 year-on-year and still kind of make that up for the year. Can you just talk a little bit more about how we should think about Q4 relative to that?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So when you think about Q4, I would expect year-over-year earnings growth in the AAA segments, the specialty businesses are all focused in and positioned to deliver year-over-year earnings growth. And then obviously with Fibers, if volumes stay similar to the third quarter into the fourth quarter, that's going to be a little bit less than the volume we had in tow last year, so you're going to have a bit of an earnings headwind there.","And then it's just down to SFI where you have the impact of the lower ethylene prices and the lower propylene prices showing up most significantly. And that's going to bring your earnings down sequentially from third to fourth quarter.","So when you net it all together, we've picked up some headwind relative to where we were at the beginning of the third quarter. But I still feel very good about earnings in total for the year.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I just want to make a quick summary's comment and we'll wrap it up. So overall, we feel great. We've been working on this strategy for a long time to deliver and change our portfolio to being more specialty-oriented. You can now see how the power of that strategy is working and delivering growth through the specialty AAA segments, working hard to keep the Fibers business stable, and believe we can do that. And that, I think, is a compelling story of how we can continue to deliver our seventh consecutive earnings growth next year, with great margins, great free cash flow that gives additional upside to shareholders beyond the earnings growth and how we delever as well as repurchase shares next year.","So I just wanted to sort of really thank the Eastman employees as well for doing such a great job in delivering these results in a very difficult environment and showing what we can do with our portfolio. And with that I'll wrap it up.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Okay. So, thanks again for joining us this morning.

I'll start begin on Page 3. We're off to compelling start to the year with strong first quarter results, which include revenue up over 13% and adjusted EPS up 22% year-over-year. Our results demonstrate the strength of our specialty portfolio as we delivered over 15% revenue growth combined in our two specialty segments, Advanced Materials and Additives and Functional Products.","We continue to deliver strong volume growth of high margin specialty product lines through execution of our innovation-driven growth model, particularly in AM and AFP. During the quarter AM and AFP delivered greater than 7% volume growth combined year-over-year, with earnings growth of more than 15%.","Through innovation, leadership and specialty markets, we continue to create our own growth. In a moment I'll share two examples of what's fueling our progress and driving a significant increase in new business closes. I'm particularly proud of the quality of this corporate earnings growth coming primarily from our specialty businesses, which is sustainable overtime.","Moving next to the cost management front, we remain well on track with our corporate cost reduction efforts without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. Our cash from the quarter was consistent with our expectations and we remain on track to deliver over $1.1billion of free cash flow in 2018, enabling an increasing dividend, deleveraging an increasing rate of share repurchases.","Beyond these great results, we've also been the recipient of numerous awards over the past several months, which highlight many of the qualities our stakeholders have come to expect from Eastman. We were named one of the World's Most Ethical Company for the fifth consecutive year by Ethisphere for outstanding corporate ethics and corporate responsibility characteristics highly valued by our employees, shareholders, communities and customers.","We also earned the Military Friendly Employer designation by Victory Media for the second straight year, which recognizes exceptional hiring programs toward transitioning service members, veterans and spouses. Finally, we were recognized by the EPA as ENERGY STAR Partner of the year, becoming the only chemical company to have achieved this recognition consecutively for seven years, a win both for the environment and our cost structure.","Our first quarter results and the continued recognition we're receiving are direct result of the great work being done by Eastman employees around the world and I want to thank them for their outstanding contributions. These results also demonstrate that we can execute on the things we can control from cost reductions to returning cash to stockholders to innovating throughout our enterprise.","On Slide 4, we continue to upgrade the quality of our product mix by increasing revenue of high margin specialty products through execution of our innovation driven growth model. Our top innovation programs in AM and AFP are accelerating as more customers validate our innovative differentiated products, which is driving growth today and into the future.","I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver more than $350 million in new business closes this year, which will be a record for the company and is more than 15% over the last year's rate. Here are two of the many ways we're creating our own growth and winning with customers and we're also expanding beyond AM and AFP to include fibers in how we drive innovation throughout the enterprise.","So our first example is about Naia cellulosic yarn program. As we discussed in innovation day, we're purposing our total assets into a growth market as a top priority for us. Through the first quarter we've seen great progress from wins with the leader in the fast fashion industry in Asia to several high-end luxury brands. The sustainability driving the fashion industry is strong and designers want a product that has a better environmental footprint and better performance. Naia delivers on this mandate on both fronts.","As a biopolymer made from pulp from sustainable forests and manufactured in a responsible manner, we can make a significant improvement relative viscose, which is unmatched by other products and the softness what they call hand of the product is outstanding relative to anything else on the market. As a result we were recently recognized as one of the Top 10 Textile Innovations by FabricLink and our business gross revenue here is accelerating through the first quarter and looks great going forward through the rest of this year.","It's incredible to see our textile team leverage our new application development capability to relentlessly engage the market. The team is doing an outstanding job demonstrating our value proposition to the brands, enabling the mills to convert to our product.","Another great example where we leverage a world class technology platform through application development is our Aerafin and Amorphous polyolefins. The hygienic packing [ph] markets are demanding lower odor adhesives due to consumer health sensitivity and are in desperate need of productivity in their competitive markets. Our Aerafin product is delivering on both fronts and we've realized several wins across the globe.","We have leveraged our application development capability we built for tackifying resins to design a suite of differentiated Aerafin polyolefins. They deliver superior performance in odor and enable broader operation window for the OEMs in applying their thesis in their product relative to the current metallocene polymers.","Growth across this Amorphous polyolefin business has exceeded our expectations as we expect to double our Aerafin volume in 2018 relative to 2017. And as a result our expanding - we are expanding our capacity in Longview, Texas. These two successes among many are testament to our ability to leverage our innovation driven growth model.","A world-class technology platform provide the foundation for competitive advantage and sustainable growth. We are relentlessly engaging the market to create a real growth. Then we bring both elements together with our differentiated application development which turns market complexity into sustainable value.","Overall I'm incredibly excited and proud. Our teams are driving innovation winning with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curt Espeland","Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. I'll start with our corporate results on Slide 5. Sales revenue grew to increases in all four business segments. We continue to do a nice job of driving growth in our more specialty businesses which accounted for more than 70% of our top line growth in the quarter. And we executed well on the pricing front as we've realized further positive pricing momentum in the quarter to offset the impact of higher raw material costs.","Adjusted EBIT grew due to increases in all four business segments with our specialty businesses accounting for more than 70% of our earnings growth in the quarter. And we are growing earnings while we are continuing to invest in growth for both the near-term and long-term. EBIT margins improved 20 basis points as we improved the quality of earnings through mix improvement with our double-digit growth in many of our innovative specialty products.","Overall earnings per share increased year-over-year by 22% with EBIT contributing about 17% of the growth. Moving next to the segment results and starting with advance materials on Slide 6 which delivered another impressive quarter driven by our innovation initiatives. Sales increased due to improved product mix resulting from double-digit growth of high margin innovative products and a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates.","In particular, we saw an acceleration in volume growth towards the end of the quarter. EBIT increased due to higher sales volume, improved product mix, and a favorable shift in exchange rates partially offset by higher costs associated with growth initiatives. Year-over-year we expanded our EBIT margin 80 basis points to 20%.","Looking at the full year, we expect to drive revenue growth from volume and mix in the mid-single digits and continue to get a further lift from price and currency. This robust revenue growth will enable us to deliver earnings growth near the upper hand of our range of 7% to 10% provided at our recent Innovation Day.","Overall these results continue advance materials track record of delivering strong performance by executing strategy of volume growth, mix of improvement, and fixed cost leverage. Now to additives and function of products on Slide 7 which had another outstanding quarter. Sales revenue increased 21% primarily due to higher sales volume throughout the segment.","This impressive growth came from multiple sources. For example, improved market conditions and enhanced commercial execution in animal nutrition and care chemical products was driving growth above market growth rates and the strong growth in tire additives due to innovation in our tire resins and superior operational reliability.","We also made great progress in improving our pricing on the strengths of our value proposition to our customers and a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates were also a benefit for the quarter. As mentioned in our press release, certain products previously reported in the chemical intermediate segment are now reported in additives and functional products due to alignment of production and growth strategies.","For the first quarter of 2018, these product lines generated approximately $18 million in revenue with EBIT margin slightly above the segment average. And we'll have similar impact expected with the remaining quarters of 2018. EBIT in the quarter increased due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices partially offset by higher costs associated with growth initiatives.","Looking at full year 2018 consistent with our guidance for additives and functional products at Innovation Day, we continue to expect mid-single digit volume growth to translate earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range with earnings likely toward the upper hand of this range this year. I would remind you that second half will have a more challenging comp due to the various strong solar fill volume in the back half of last year and some expected competitive pressure in adhesives.","All in, additives and functional products is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth for the year. Now to chemical intermediates on Slide 8, sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices attributed to higher raw material costs and continued improvement in market conditions. One example is functional means where sales volume increased due to a recovery in the energy and agricultural markets and they also benefit from higher methanol prices.","Overall higher segment sales revenue was partially offset by lower volume and lower merchant ethylene selling prices. Earnings increased primarily due to higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs. Looking at full year 2018, we are off to a good start with strong results in the first quarter.","The chemical intermediates team continues to do an impressive job offsetting higher raw material and energy costs with higher selling prices. These actions will help to mitigate anticipated headwind from continued weakness in ethylene margins and higher scheduled maintenance costs during the year particularly in the second quarter.","Overall chemical intermediates is set up for 2018 earnings to be somewhat below 2017 which would be a good result given various moving parts. I'll finish up the segment review with fibers on Slide 9. In our news release tables, you see that revenue increased by 15% year-over-year which is really due to two factors.","First is the different seasonal trends we expect in this business in 2018 under the new revenue recognition standard. Similar to the overall company, the change is not expected to materially impact full year 2018 versus 2017, but will impact quarterly trends. And second we are very encouraged by the acceleration we saw in the textiles through the quarter setting this product up for a nice strong double-digit growth this year.","As a result, we moved the textiles and nonwovens innovation platform from other to the fiber segment. In first quarter 2018 this program had revenue of approximately $13 million and the EBIT is about $1 million which includes a substantial increase in growth resources to drive commercialization of this platform.","Looking at the full year consistent with Innovation Day guidance, we expect earnings in this segment will be up between 1% and 3% beyond the impact of this product moves. And we expect solid earnings growth in the second quarter versus the first for fibers. We remain on track to stabilize this business. We expect our total volume for the year to be about flat compared with last year.","We are making continued progress on productivity including raw material costs and the impact of these initiatives will start to flow through in the second quarter. And as mentioned, we expect the progress we are making on innovation initiatives in the segment to contribute to earnings growth.","On Slide 10, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights. We used $35 million in cash for operating activities during the first quarter of 2018 in line with our normal seasonality of cash flow generation. Operating cash reflects our normal beginning of the year working capital build in addition to an increase in credit receivables attributed to higher sales revenue and the timing of the collections.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $128 million. We continue to expect our full year capital expenditures will be approximately $550 million. We remain very confident in our ability to generate over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. Looking at the balance sheet, we continue to expect to use greater than $300 million of free cash flow to reduce debt this year. Additionally we remain committed to returning cash to our stockholders.","In the first quarter we returned a $180 million through our first quarter dividend of $80 million and $100 million in share repurchases. For full year we continue to expect to increase share repurchases compared to 2017 in the absence of bolt-on acquisitions. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be between 18% or 20% reflecting the continued benefits of our improved business operations and resulting the impact of recent tax events. Sitting here today it feels like 19% would be - which would be a modest improvement compared to last year and is reflected in our results for the first quarter, a strong start to the year for our earnings and cash flow performance.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Curt. On Slide 11 I will discuss our 2018 outlook. We continue to benefit from the strong growth of high value innovative products with leading positions in attractive niche markets. We are also delivering revenue synergies through launching new products and improvements in commercial execution capabilities of our acquired businesses.","We are seeing the benefits of scaling integration translating this attractive growth in the earnings. And our continued aggressive productivity is expected to offset inflation and some of our growth investments. In addition, a modest improvement in our tax rate is expected to contribute to growth. Finally, discipline allocation of our strong free cash flow continued to contribute to our growth, including planned increases in our share repurchases in '18 compared to '17.","To accelerate our momentum in the coming years, we are also continuing to invest in innovation and product development and capacity expansions to support our growth programs. We expect higher scheduled maintenance costs in the year as we have a significant turnaround here in the second quarter for one of our crackers in Longview, Texas.","And lastly we expect pressure in the ethylene spreads impact earnings especially in the second half. Putting this altogether our expectations for 2018 EPS growth have improved to be 10% to 14% compared to 2017. When it comes to the tailwinds and headwinds at this time, I would expect to be in the middle of this range.","And when you think about the shape of the year, you should expect first half EPS to be modestly higher than the second half due to our new revenue recognition method, ethylene, and a tough 2018 comp in AFP. And on free cash flow we continue to expect at least a 10% increase which is one of the most compelling in the industry, especially when you consider we are investing in long term growth at the same time.","On Slide 12 I will summarize where we are. As you think about our portfolio, we continue to march down the path to make two specialty businesses a much bigger percentage of the total with our goal of driving from 70% to 80%. This all comes together for a terrific bottom line. We can grow faster than the underlying market. We can sustain and improve our margins through mix upgrade.","We do this for a unique innovation driven growth model which is the heart of how we win. We also do scaling integration and investing in the unique capabilities we have in place to drive it and finally through disciplined portfolio management. That leads you to one of the strongest free cash flows in the industry, strong return on invested capital that is growing, and a compelling compounded EPS for 2020 and beyond. When you put this altogether, we are well positioned for long-term attractive earnings growth, a sustainable value creation for others.","Greg Riddle","Thanks, Mark. We've got a lot of people on the line this morning and like to get to as many questions as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, Lauren, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter with","Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","David Begleiter","Mark, in AFP you got 6% pricing in the quarter. What do you say on a segment in recapturing offsetting raw material costs?","Mark Costa","Good morning, David. We are proud of our discipline in driving price improvements throughout last year and into the first quarter which we are seeing as the accumulation of that action over that period of time. And at this stage our prices have caught up to raw materials. In fact our spreads are a little bit better in the first quarter.","David Begleiter","Very good. And also you mentioned enhanced commercial execution in AFP in Q1. Could you give us some concrete examples of that execution?","Mark Costa","Sure. It's a great story of creating value through synergies in the acquisitions. We have been building, as we have talked to you about on the Innovation Day, a very powerful growth model that combines how we engage the market, how we leverage our technology and bring it together the application development capability. And you are seeing that right now. One of the strongest drivers of growth that we had in AFP with our animal nutrition and care chemical business and there is a place where we've combined the products of Eastman and Taminco where we have a broader portfolio of organic acids making us much more relevant to the market. Taminco team was somewhat geographically limited in their commercial execution capabilities. So we've now built the broader global capability. We've added application development capability of that, so we can be much more of a formulation expert and enhance what we are offering to the marketplace.","And that's all combined to drive significant growth, incredible growth in fact for that combined sort of portfolio to the marketplace. So it's a great example. Same thing is true in tires. We've built integrated capability now where we started with what Solutia had which was somewhat limited in what they had to offer to the market, expanded it with our resin portfolios and other products that we are developing for the innovation side. So now we are not just Crystex and PPDs, but have innovative resins that can improve the performance of tires, built strong application development capability where we are insightful and now we design those products and it can be a true advising consultant in formulating the tire and we've gone for debating the price of Crystex in 2012 to being an innovation partner with all the top MNCs in this space as well as some of the key leading agent players. So these examples of the growth model bringing capability together is driving double-digit growth in tires across that portfolio, strong double-digit growth in animal nutrition and we are doing this in a bunch of other places.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fisher with Barclays.","Duffy Fisher","Yes, good morning guys.","Mark Costa","Hey, Duffy.","Duffy Fisher","A question around the contract with enterprise and PDH, is there ramping? Was that material in the first quarter? And then going forward, now that you have both that contract and your own crackers, kind of what your balance on propylene and where are we trying to get to over the next year or two with that?","Mark Costa","So first on the question on the enterprise contract, that has not had a material impact on our first quarter input costs or performance. On the balance of propylene remember and consumer propylene we produce - I think we are pretty balanced on what we produce now, what we need for derivatives, including that enterprise contract.","Duffy Fisher","And then could you quantify the accounting change? You said it won't impact the year. But when we think through quarter-to-quarter, kind of how big of a number are we talking about between quarters and can you help size that throughout the year?","Mark Costa","Sure. So let me just recap the change in revenue recognition hopefully just this one time. In 2007 let me remind you revenue was recorded based on confirmed delivery dates. In 2018 revenue we recorded based on goods shipped which will accelerate when revenue is recognized compared to previous years. So we believe this method is more consistent with industry practice. To transition to this new method, let me also remind you we've recorded an increase to return earnings for $53 million, what this really relates to is the net earnings of approximately $200 million of revenue for product that had shipped and now you delivered at the end of 2017. So this transitional revenue will be recognized in revenue or EBIT in 2018. There is a new method. So this ensures both 2017 and 2018 only have 52 weeks of revenue in each period. So, as such again as you mentioned this change is not expected to have a material impact on revenue or EBIT for 2018 taken as a whole when compared to previous years.","However, as you have seen in the first quarter, this impacts seasonal trends of revenue and EBIT within the year. So looking specifically at first quarter, the first quarter revenue impact under the new standard in 2018 was driven mostly by fibers as mentioned in my prepared comments. We had a similar but smaller revenue impact on advance materials offset by similar change in chemical intermediates. So when you put it altogether, the company probably accelerated $30 million of revenue and roughly $18 million of EBIT or $0.10 a share in the first quarter of '18 that would otherwise be recognized later in 2018 if we are under the old method. So again this change has not impacted our expectation of strong revenue and EBIT growth for the company or any segments when comparing 2008 versus 2007 full year.","Duffy Fisher","Great, thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","John Campbell","Hi, good morning. This is John Campbell on for Bob. For advanced materials you just caught out a stronger sales mix for the premium products, can you provide an update on the percent of the current mix that comes from these premium products?","Mark Costa","So we don't provide specific breakup. What I can tell you and we said in the past is Tritan as an example is around $300 million double-digit growth, very powerful story there where we continued to be the most unique offering of clarity chemical resistance and toughness in that marketplace and extending into a lot of new applications and that's just one third if you will of the premium products, so the heads of display [indiscernible] is of similar size, also growing double digits and very attractive margins to the segment and the company and performance films also similar size to Tritan growing at double digits with very attractive margin. So it's a pretty big percentage of the overall total, but it's still got a ton of room to grow double digits for quite some time because these markets are quite a bit bigger than where we are today.","John Campbell","Got it, thank you. And with the increased EPS growth expectations in 2018, do you see a risk to the upside for your longer term 8% to 12% growth or does this kind of create a higher bar to cost for 2018 and 2020?","Mark Costa","So first of all we're incredibly excited about 10% to 14% range this year and love to see it being driven by the specialties and stability with some earnings growth in fibers which is a very nice change in stability in CI, so I think its powerful story. As you think about the long term, we still view the long term in the 8% to 12% range, there are some unique advantages we have this year in currency for example that you don't plan on repeating in the future years, but we think that's a very compelling range for us to grow sustainably and consistently every year as we go forward and with an increasing free cash flow to go with it, I think it's a very powerful story for the market.","John Campbell","Got it, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jim Sheen [ph] with SunTrust.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Could you update us on your plans to - on your strategic options for the long view ethylene excess capacity?","Curt Espeland","Sure, we remain committed to address our excess ethylene position as we've mentioned in the past. We remain engaged with multiple parties with a long term view who are interested in leveraging our integrated ethylene position in the United States as well as there's parties interested in our land utilities and other infrastructure to build a derivative project at the Longview site. So we're working diligently to see what we can get done within these current market dynamics and will update you as we make any progress on.","Unidentified Analyst","And on adhesive resins, could you give us more color on the competitive pressure you're seeing there, is it all hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated type of resins?","Curt Espeland","So the specific change in the marketplace is Exxon's bringing on some capacity in Asia this year and we expect that to have some impact on margins. It has not yet had an impact on margins, they're still in the process of starting up and qualifying that product to the marketplace, so it's really more of a back half of your risk at this point. To keep in mind of the amount of capacity outings is around 90,000 tons, the market's growing around 25,000 to 30,000 tons a year because it has this incredible underlying market growth of 5% to 7% hygiene. Also the markets are incredibly tight right now, so there's a lot of pent up demand for hydrogenated resins that we expect to help fill out that asset and accelerate fill out rate. And another thing to keep in mind is their market trend's now driving rosins to be converted to resins, rosins is about the same size as the resin market - overall resin market. And there's a lot of pressure on that there's a very strong order to raw [ph] and not great color and so the market has become very sensitive to order in adhesives especially in Asia, so a lot of people are looking to sort of convert from one to the other, so that's another way of demand sort of filling up this asset. Overall, we feel comfortable that this is a great attractive business long term. Obviously we'll see some short term pressure here as that capacity comes to the marketplace, but there's such strong demand potential we see the long term margins being quite attractive.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to P. J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar","Yes, hi good morning.","Curt Espeland","Good morning P.J.","P. J. Juvekar","Mark you shifted some products from intermediates AFP, I think that's small about $18 million, but that's about 2% growth in AFP, so what are these products in our big two specialty in terms of margins?","Mark Costa","Yeah, it's a great question and it goes back to something I talked about in the first question. As we have built this growth model and seeing the power of how application development connects sort of markets and technology together, we launched a program last year not just to build this capability but to reexamine how our business teams are structured and making sure that we have the right products aligned to take advantage of that capability. And we realize that there are some products that were still being sold in CI that would be much more effectively sold in AFP by bringing our better market connect and our application development capability to bear in these products we could accelerated growth sustain those margins. And these products are actually pretty attractive margins to start off with and some of them are already being sold partially by AFP and we're just consolidating all the product into one place to be more efficient in how we manage the assets. So it just made sense, so animal nutrition was one of those places where we saw that opportunity, with the success we're now seeing in that marketplace and we're cleaning that up and there are also some products in coatings that made sense to sort of have all sold in one place with that greater commercial and technical capability. So the natural thing you do is you're still revolving your strategy and see what you can do and want to maximize your growth.","P. J. Juvekar","Okay, thank you and then you got strong double digit volume growth in tow after several years of declines, do you believe that we've ended destocking cycle or was there any other factors like your repositioning into textiles that caused the volume growth?","Mark Costa","So as Curt mentioned around revenue recognition, the principal driver of the revenue looking higher on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter was actually revenue recognition method being different this year versus last year, it's a very long supply chain for a lot of that tow to go from Kingsport, Tennessee to markets around the world. And as a result of the coal gas incident we weren't shipping as much in the beginning of the quarter as we normally do as we were bringing out asset back up and then ramping up the production of the downstream tow product. So a lot of that product shipped in March that would have shipped earlier and so we have these two different methods it just gets caught up as recognized revenue this year, but would've not shown up in the same way last year, so that's part of it P.J. The other part was obviously some of the revenue being transferred, the 30 million revenue from other two - the fiber segment, so we actually sort of put it on an apples to apples basis from a revenue recognition basis. The two volumes within this story are about flat year-over-year, so it isn't a story of growth or decline in tow. It's stable as we said last year, we expected to volume to be stable this year to last year and that's what we expect and you'll see on a full year basis that will be stable.","P. J. Juvekar","That's helpful, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Can you remind us how much of the chemical intermediates volume, as a percentage goes for internal purposes versus external purposes?","Greg Riddle","It's about a fifty-fifty split Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, so if it turns out that your operating income in chemical intermediates was up about 7 million, is it fair to say that there's a 7 million benefit that filters through your other segments as they capture the same margin differential and since for the year you guys think that you'll be down a little bit does that mean that the overall margin benefits the other segments will also be down a little bit?","Curt Espeland","Jeff, you can't translate that in that direct way. You've got different set of products you're selling in specialties with different supply demand dynamics and selling on values, the price of those olefin derivatives are going to be determined by those market conditions and even within CI, in the market prices and the value captured isn't directly correlated to ethylene and propylene. I know that everyone sort of tends to make that simplistic assumption that there's all going up and down with propylene and ethylene prices, but it doesn't work that way. We don't sell propylene at all, right. We sell derivatives and specialties and chemical intermediates and the value in the pricing of that's actually holding up quite well through the first quarter as well as into the second including ethylene. Of course some of that is being offset by the bulk ethylene that we're selling into the marketplace at much lower prices, so you can't sort of do that translation one for one like that.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much","Operator","We'll go next to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet.","Aleksey Yefremov","Good morning everyone, thank you. With regards to Aerafin capacity expansion are you currently sold out in these types of adhesives and what percent of your capacity does this represent in terms of percent or killer times and when will this project be finished.","Mark Costa","So Aerafin has been a product we've had in the marketplace for over a year and the growth rate in interest of it has been quite strong fifty some a component over all of overall more polyolefin program which in total is showing very strong double digit growth but in this particular area we're seeing a strong uptake and we had some capacity limits or expect to I should say as we go into this year. And we're right and expand capacity going seeing any risk of missing orders but we're rushing to get this capacity online to continue supporting the strong interest but we're not going to provide the detail breakout on a quantitative basis.","Aleksey Yefremov","Okay, thank you. But you also mentioned animal nutrition and care chemicals as the source of offset in the first quarter was it pricing or volume of both and is there something that's sustainable going forward?","Mark Costa","So animal nutrition has been tremendous volume growth as well as improvement in pricing as a markets become tighter for two factors. The first would be the answer to David's question around how we build a better commercial technical capability the second factor driving it is China environmental enforcement has shut down some of our competitors in this space as well as competitors in the tire space and some of the coatings sourcing benefits across the segment AFP as well as CI. And that's helped on the pricing front as well as the volume growth from a sustainability point of view the innovation the commercial executions all very much sustainable it's just growing in the marketplace in China environmental force and part of that question I think is we'll have to see oil plays out. I mean these are players that have been shut down for environmental violations they have to either rebuild in a chemical park and operate a higher cost structure under better environmental standard if they can get the financing or they will come back. And so in a few places you can see people trying to build and that and they will come back bench a little higher cost structure and in some places we don't expect that they will so that we'll have to just see how it plays out over time but for this year we expected to be to be very attractive. Both pricing and volume growth I would emphasize that there's a sustainable advantage that we get out of all this and that many of our customers both the big MNC around the world as well as many of our Chinese customers have learned a painful lesson about how much they want to depend on a small private single plant in China supplying their needs on critical products so pretty much apartments are having to revaluate how much of that risk they want to take going forward. And I think it really emphasizes the value that we provide as assists and sustainable supplier on a global basis.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Good morning Mark back at the Investor Day and I think on various earnings calls you've alluded to the concept of upgrading your mix across a variety of specialty products is there a way to quantify the benefit from that either or either retrospectively or prospected Lee in terms of margin uplift you've got a lot going on across a lot of different products just wondering if you have in your mind any sort of path or rule to help us understand better the benefits associated with those efforts on the margin line.","Mark Costa","Yes So one this is the heart of our story and our strategy it's a great question we've got double digit growth in a wide range of products across AM and AFP from Triton to heads up display could secure layers, to performance films to some display products that the resins in tires touch or shield and they in AFP, the list goes on. So all these are above segment average margins as well as above company average margins and so as they grow the weighted average mix on the variable margin of the corporate line is going up so it's attractive from a specific point of view we actually provided several slides that innovation day that actually give you sort quantitative look about how we've dramatically improve the margins from 2010 to '17 and our outlook for how those margins will continue to improve at the corporate level and as well as an example in that in advance materials from 2018 to '20, so I think those slides will be helpful for you.","Kevin McCarthy","All right and then second, how would you describe your strategic playbook in the event that China proceeds with tariffs on cellulose acetate flake?","Mark Costa","Yeah, so the tariff question is a good one on that acetate flake side. It's unclear - first of all it's unclear what projects will finally be implemented versus what's on a preliminary list, they often change. Second, it's unclear when they might implement this if ever and in this case it's unclear how the tariff would be applied seen to she's a government entity so you're sort of just moving tax revenue from one pocket to another pocket, so we'll just have to see how that all plays out.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you just a question on the tow volume. Mark, you referenced a very long supply chain and I've noticed that two of the larger tobacco companies reported already and they've got volume down about 6%, 7%. So I'm just wondering you're expecting to be flat for the year and cigarette volumes move around all the time, so I don't read too much into to one quarter of their results, but when would we expect to see that type of a down quarter flow through your tow volume?","Mark Costa","Good question, Vincent and you said the key thing in the beginning or at the end or your comments, which is one quarter is not something we're active by a couple of companies, I think we need to see how they all report, you share ships around a lot between these guys on a quarter-to-quarter basis and what the overall market trends are. We're not seeing anything that says that there's certainly been an acceleration or the downturn of cigarette demand from what our customers are telling us. So at this stage we're not expecting a change in tow demand in a material way. I think we're just have to see how this plays out. There's been a lot of very consistent steady sort of 2% or 3% decline in this business for a very long time and I think we need to give it a little more time before we start to sort of reacting to sort of that one quarter benefit.","Vincent Andrews","Okay and just is there sort of a wisdom on sort of how long supply chain or so?","Mark Costa","On the supply chain side, in this case, it's probably six months.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael Sison","Hey guys, nice start to the year. In terms of - you talked about $350 million of new business in 2018 and if I combine AFP and AM together, it's about 6% growth, and you got pricing as a tailwind, so I'm just curious in terms of your outlook for revenue for AM and AFP, it seems a little bit conservative. Can you maybe walk us through any negatives that were missing?","Curt Espeland","No, negatives in AM, I think we're just going to see a strong high single digit revenue growth for the year driven by the things you just mentioned, volume, significant mix of grades that we've consistently done for several years now, some pricing improvement, FX tailwind all sort of come together to sort of deliver that. On the AFP side, it's obviously been incredibly strong in the first quarter, we expect to continue the strength in the second quarter and by the way AM and AFP we do expect seasonal improvement in revenue and earnings from first and second quarter. But there is a tougher comp in the back half of the year AFP. You have to remember last year we had very high solar fill volume for a couple of huge projects come in, in the third and the fourth quarter. That won't repeat this year, we do see fills coming in '19 and '20, so it's just sort of chunkiness issue in this year versus last year and the future. There's also the other dynamic. This environmental China enforcement drove constant and meaningful share improvement for us through last year, so you saw the benefit of that really in the third and fourth quarter. There is an additional environmental enforcement on top of what we benefited from, so we're holding our share this year but obviously that's a tougher comp to last year in the back half. And then the third thing is some price pressure in adhesives as I already mentioned. All those sort of make the comp tougher. We do expect earnings growth year-over-year in the back half of the year and just to be clear and we actually expect margins to sequentially improve from first quarter to second and third as the mix continues to improve the specialty innovation products, but will just be a tougher comp to '17.","Michael Sison","Okay, great and a quick follow up in terms of tire business continues to see good momentum, a lot of tire companies look sluggish this quarter, any thoughts there in terms of underlying demand and is it really just your new products that are driving the growth.","Curt Espeland","It is not a primary demand story, we go to extensive effort in our market segmentation and targeting where we have the best value proposition and aligning ourselves with the customers who we believe are going to have the highest growth, so we have really seen benefits in Asia in particular of aligning with the winners in that market and seeing the benefit as they're taking share and consolidating frankly failing Chinese tire companies into themselves and so we're benefiting from that. On top of that you have the share gains as I mentioned from environmental enforcement, on top of that you have the innovation growth that's happening where we have double digit growth and things like our tire resins, it all combines together to a story of where we're creating our own growth in a market where the underlying primary demand as you noted is not that strong.","Michael Sison","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch","Hey good morning gentlemen.","Mark Costa","Good morning Frank.","Frank Mitsch","Apologies, I'm feeling pretty good after last night's drift. And so celebratory environment kind of like you guys are celebrating a nice start to the year and speaking on the nice start, you reiterated that you expect to get a greater than 1.1 billion in free cash flow this year, was there a thought to raise that metric as you raise the EPS guidance?","Curt Espeland","While the delivering greater than 1.1 by itself is a pretty remarkable effort Frank and let us deliver on that this year, if we do a little bit better will celebrate with you in the fall with some maybe some victories.","Frank Mitsch","Terrific, something for me to look forward to. Mark you just indicated that to you do expect a seasonal improvement in some of your businesses in Q2, can you talk about the pace of business so far in Q2 on a geographic basis that you're seeing out there?","Mark Costa","So as you saw in the first quarter tremendous growth in Europe and Asia and we'll continue to see strong growth in those regions as the economies are improving in Europe, Asia still may not be the growth of old days in China, it's still very attractive growth compared to the rest the world and we're benefiting from our positions in there as well throughout Asia. And their overall sort of automotive market is going a little stronger than people expected at the beginning the year, so that's great for us of course. So I'd say it feels good everywhere. To be clear forecast isn't forecasting improved economy, so if that does happen that would be upside to our forecast. We believe in sort of realizing the growth that we're having. It's also important to member that revenue growth doesn't just include volume, it includes FX and price improvements et cetera.","Frank Mitsch","Terrific, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Thank you. The zinc tow industry was still declining gradually over time and eventually need more consolidation in rationalization, do you see the block of the merger of cigarettes and Blackstone business a problem down the road if the industry can't consolidate and how do you see things planning out longer term?","Mark Costa","So let me sort of take that in two parts, first is sort of our overall view of demand in the world and then I'll get to sort of the second part of the question. Overall, demand as I mentioned, we don't see a significant change in the overall demand of cigarettes, we expect sort of slow decline outside of China. If you look at Chinaman at primary level, I think it's actually been a lot more stable than any of us thought, there was a overbuilding of inventory that was occurring in '11m '12 and '13 and then there was a destocking in that backward integration that they had with JV's with us and others that created a huge serve up and then down in tow in that marketplace. But underlying it I think it's stable. I'd also note that at this stage the exposure to imports into China with tow is down to about 5% of our revenue in the segment or half of 1% at the company level, so the exposure we have to that question right now has been dramatically reduced on what happens inside China.","The key element of how we think about this business stays the same as it always has been. We're focused on running our business the best we possibly can and I think we're doing a good job of that. So we've secured a lot of our volume outside of China, two thirds of it in these long term agreement to provide stability and volume and pricing for our customers and for us. We're obviously pursuing productivity aggressively this year in amount of cost we think we can improve including our raw materials and that's going to help offset - will offset the price declines that we expect this year. But most importantly to our story is on the asset side when we added capacity in China we took out capacity in UK and now we're down to our last asset in flake largest lowest cost asset back with integrated coal and our tow capacity that we have left matches that flake. So we're focused on how we fill that remaining capacity, that excess capacity including what declines may come with their innovation, so as I just told you in the beginning of this call we're seeing tremendous success in textiles, we're also seeing success in the non-olefins where we're going to get strong double digit growth this year over last year in this space. And while the margins on tow, they're decent attractive margins somewhere to sort of company average. And that's how we feel these assets and driver - earnings growth net for this business. And so we're going to repurpose those assets - this excess capacity to markets where we see attractive growth, the ability to value them up over time and where markets actually grow and that's what we've done for 90 years in cellulosic and we'll keep doing it.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from a Lawrence Alexander with Jefferies.","Dan Rizzo","Hi, it's Dan Rizzo on for Lawrence. How are you doing guys?","Mark Costa","Doing good.","Dan Rizzo","You mentioned mix \u2013we've talked a lot about mix improvement and how that can help drive - help support growth, I was wondering if the productivity efforts and cost controls can also add to margin improvement over the next two to three years.","Curt Espeland","Well, over the next two to three years what we've been talking about is we do have cost productivity goals. To some degree those are being used to help offset some of the increase in manufacturing costs, some of the turnaround cost et cetera. So our productivity is helping us grow in the right places, but you all will see some growth in some of the SG&A and R&D areas. Manufacturing does an outstanding job offsetting inflation and trying to give us a little bit more than that, but again those investments what we call cost increases they are investments and you need to see those in great increases because that's what drives the future growth profile of this company.","Dan Rizzo","Okay, thanks. And then with the solar fill volumes should we think about the cadence going forward that they'll be like a very strong period of say one to two quarters followed by some weakness, is that how it kind of plays out like over a period of quarters and years?","Curt Espeland","Yeah, these are these huge concentrated solar power arrays, these mirrors that are out and [indiscernible], so they're massive projects and once they finish the construction a couple weeks they fill the plane up with fluid, so you will literally build this inventory over like a year, year and a half and then you fill it, so it comes in chunky bits in quarters and across years. It's very attractive business, we love it, but it has a tendency to be a little chunky. The good news is the new revenue recognition method will smooth out all of that better because it will be more based on issue goods issue rather than delivered.","Dan Rizzo","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering & Holt.","Matthew Blair","Good morning Mark and Curt. I want to go back to the accounting impact Curt, I think you said that it provided about it $0.10 EPS boost in Q1, but would not affect really to the full year number. Could you talk about when that $0.10 benefit would roll off as we progress through the rest of the year?","Curt Espeland","Sure, if I think about recognition of the new method compared to 2017 what you're going to see is you'll see a little bit of this same impact in the second quarter, but on a smaller degree it will start reversing in third quarter and you'll really feel the reversal in fourth.","Matthew Blair","Got it, thanks and then we've also seen some price increases come through from Eastman that were attributable to free surcharges, did you have any volume impact in the quarter due to logistics restrictions and what percent of your product is moved by truck?","Curt Espeland","So we first of all we haven't seen any impact on volume due to sort of logistical constraints, so we're meeting every customer need in order across the planet. Our supply chain does sort of miraculous things every day. When you think about how we didn't miss an order through the hurricanes last year, when you think about the phenomenal things we did of bringing acetic acid into the site during the coal gas interruption and then also managing a very complex inventory supply chain problem to serve all of our customers last year and not miss any orders through that recovery effort and we're really good at this. And so we've got it covered on the logistical front we are seeing higher cost like everyone else for the cost of trucking which isn't a huge portion of our cost structure I want to come to logistics. And we're pricing to recover it like everyone else is doing.","Matthew Blair","Thank you.","Greg Riddle","Let's make the next question the last one please.","Operator","Our final question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","Hi, there is a lot of volatility in Q1 on propylene and ethylene, I guess going forward, would you expect your propylene based products to increase given recent inflation or would that be a headwind? Thank you.","Mark Costa","On the propylene side I think we - what I would say is, we expect some stability. It's been good pricing improvements through the first quarter, we expect those mostly to hold into the second and that business to be stable through the year. I think it's obviously a different story, but even on there the out lenders are pretty stable, so just down to the ball cap win where obviously prices were lower, which is really a second half impact. If you remember the second quarter has our shut down in it with one of our crackers, so we just are producing much excess ethylene in the second quarter. So this is really more about the second half when you think about that.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","Greg Riddle","Okay, thanks again everyone for joining us this morning. A replay of this call will be available on our website later this morning. Thanks again.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman\u2019s website at www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thank you, Ebony and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I will cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q filed for third quarter 2016 and the Form 10-K to be filed for 2016. Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core costs, charges and gains, adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow exclude acceleration pension payments. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items are available in the fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results news release, which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings also exclude any non-core, unusual or non-recurring items.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 3. 2016 was a solid year for Eastman as we made great progress on our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. Our innovative specialty businesses continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth. Strong contributors included many of our premium products, such as Tritan, Saflex acoustics and heads-up display inter-layers, Crystex tire additives, tire resins and performance films. In particular, growth in the premium products has been a key driver for the Advanced Materials segment, which has grown operating earnings for four consecutive years, with a compound annual growth rate of over 20%. On cost management, we did an outstanding job in 2016, reflecting very strong productivity gains.","Overall, we were able to offset cost inflation by about $100 million with the actions we took at the beginning of the year. And we will deliver another $100 million to the bottom line in 2017 from the actions we took in the fourth quarter. All of this was achieved without sacrificing our investments in our long-term growth initiatives. We also continued to generate strong cash flow in 2016, with adjusted free cash flow of over $900 million. We increased our dividend by over 10% in 2016, the seventh straight year of increases. Over that time, we have more than doubled our dividend, providing attractive yield to investors. And we improved our debt profile by taking advantage of the European debt market twice, which further strengthened our balance sheet.","Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to our stockholders, with over $400 million returned in the combination of dividends and share repurchases. This performance reflects the strength of Eastman\u2019s portfolio, the integration and scale that has been built over decades and our strong team of employees who consistently deliver results for our stakeholders. It also demonstrates that we can execute on things that we can control, from cost reductions to returning cash to our shareholders to innovating throughout our enterprise, and now I will talk more about that.","Moving next to Slide 4, we had an outstanding series of successes with our innovation portfolio in 2016. As I have mentioned in previous calls, we are not waiting around for market growth, we are focused on creating our own growth. Throughout last year, we have told you success stories on Tritan, Tetrashield, Saflex, tire resins among other innovations. These programs are continuing to accelerate with more customer validation of these innovative differentiated products, which will enable strong growth in the future. Through this year, you will also hear about other programs that are starting to gain traction, such as next generation Crystex, Aerafin polymers for hot melt adhesives, microfibers and textiles and non-wovens and new cellulose ester applications, with many more to come in the pipeline. These successes are a testament to our ability to leverage our expertise in key world class technology platforms, both where Eastman has been a leader for decades in the platforms that we have acquired.","We are realizing compelling benefits from our significant investment or our application development capabilities, which has been critical to our successful launches into these new market applications. We will continue to accelerate our innovation in market development initiatives. In 2016, we delivered more than $200 million of new business closes. And as we look into 2017, we are confident that our rate of commercialized new innovation programs will accelerate. I have increasing confidence in the breadth and depth of our innovation portfolio, which is significantly more compelling today than it was 3 years ago. We are building the foundation for the future and we increased \u2013 and we will increase our investment in our innovation efforts, which are a key to the long-term success of Eastman. And I have a lot more to say about the progress we are making with our portfolio throughout the year.","Now, I will hand over the call to Curt to cover the financial details for 2016 and then I will come back to talk about 2017.","Curt Espeland","Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. Since we have a lot to cover today, I will try to be brief as possible with my comments. Starting with our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 5, we delivered solid earnings despite the challenges we faced during the quarter. The decline in revenue largely reflected lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material and energy costs and lower fiber sales volumes, more than offsetting the higher sale volume in each of our other segments and mix improvement from strong growth in high-margin innovation products. Operating earnings were down slightly. Headwinds include lower selling prices and lower fiber sales volume. Positives included strong volume growth in all other segments and the positive impact from cost reduction actions taken throughout the year. Operating margins for the quarter were flat against the year ago quarter.","Next to Slide 6, looking at the full year, we delivered solid results despite significant headwinds reflecting the strength and robustness of our strategy to transform to a specialty portfolio. Overall, sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower fiber sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in the other segments and mix improvement from strong growth in high-margin innovative products. Our operating earnings declined as an increase in Advanced Materials was more than offset by declines in the other segment. Operating earnings also benefited from cost reduction actions. Our operating margin for the year was 17%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was over 23%, which is one of the most attractive in our industry. Overall, good results in a challenging business climate.","Moving next to the segment results beginning on Slide 7 and starting with Advanced Materials, which had another exceptional year as they continued to deliver impressive growth driven by our innovation platforms. Fourth quarter earnings increased year-over-year due to higher sales volume, particularly from double-digit growth of high-margin innovative products, was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for core co-polyesters attributed to lower raw material and energy costs. Sequentially, volume in operating earnings declined due to normal seasonality as well as higher operating costs.","Fourth quarter was also a tough comparison versus our record third quarter results on a sequential basis. For the year, sales revenue increased due to double-digit volume growth of premium products, including Eastman Tritan co-polyester, Saflex acoustic inter-layers and performance films. The volume and mix improvement was partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for co-polyesters attributed to lower raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings were up 15% for the year primarily driven by higher sales volume, improved product mix and lower unit costs due to higher capacity utilization. The operating margin increased more than 200 basis points to over 19% from just under 17% in 2015. These results reflect execution of a multiyear strategy to deliver strong earnings growth and we expect to build on this success going forward, including another year of double-digit volume growth for Tritan and acoustics and heads-up display inter-layers in 2017. Overall, outstanding results for 2016 which continues Advanced Materials track record of success.","And on Slide 8, as you think about Advanced Materials going forward, we are well positioned for another year of solid growth. Specifically, I would like to highlight the following growth drivers for 2017. Strong volume growth above global GDP, driven by favorable trends such as the continued shift to higher quality plastics in medical applications and vehicle light weighting. Continued growth from higher margin innovative product lines, driving mix improvement and additional fixed cost leverage as we fill out assets. We do anticipate some incremental earnings pressure from higher raw material and energy costs as there is typically a lag in pricing relative to raw material costs for our specialty product line. And with almost 60% of their revenue outside of North America, this segment is impacted by the strengthening dollar. But overall, despite these raw material and currency headwinds, we expect another year of solid earnings growth in Advanced Materials.","Moving next to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 9, fourth quarter sales revenue and operating earnings declined as 3% higher sales volume across the segment was more than offset by lower selling prices, primarily due to lower methanol costs. Sequentially, sales revenue and operating earnings declined as volume was lower attributed to normal seasonality demand while pricing stabilized compared to the third quarter. For the full year 2016, sales revenue declined primarily due to lower selling prices, attributed to lower raw material and energy costs, partially offset by higher sales volume across the segment. Operating earnings decreased, primarily due to lower selling prices, more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs and higher sales volume. And the operating margin remained strong at 21%. One other item to remind you, we have been operating under a new organizational structure for a few quarters now, which resulted in some major product moves between Additives & Functional Products and Chemical Intermediates. As you consider the year-over-year comps, about $20 million or more of cost flowed through Additives & Functional Products in 2016 than was reflected in the $660 million recast view for their 2015 earnings, while approximately $20 million less flowed to Chemical Intermediates.","Looking forward to 2017, Additives & Functional Products on Slide 10. Key growth drivers for this segment include solid GDP plus volume growth, a diversified application portfolio, which is well aligned with macro trends, a portfolio of growth platforms that we expect will accelerate product mix improvement. We expect these growth drivers will partially be offset by higher raw material and energy costs and the stronger dollar. Similar to our specialty product lines in Advanced Materials, there is normally a six-month lag for pricing to catch up to rising raw materials in this segment. And given that 35% of that as a functional products revenue is in Europe, plus partially offset by our local manufacturing, they are exposed to a strengthening dollar against the euro. Overall, we expect solid earnings growth in 2017, driven by a combination of strong volume growth and continued contributions from our innovation initiatives.","Now to Chemical Intermediates on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales revenue increased, primarily due to the higher sales volume of olefin-based and functional amines product. Operating earnings increased, primarily due to higher sales volume, stable margins and the reduced impact of commodity hedge losses on raw material costs. Full year sales revenue decreased due to the lower selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volume of olefin-based and functional amines products. The lower selling prices were primarily attributed to lower raw material and energy costs, as well as competitive pressures due to lower oil prices for most of the year. Operating earnings increased due to lower selling prices, which more than offset lower raw material and energy costs, higher sales volumes and a reduced impact to commodity hedge losses on raw material costs. On Slide 12, for Chemical Intermediates in 2017, we anticipate strong earnings improvement, driven by solid end market demand. We are assuming full year olefin spreads in 2017 will be similar to 2016. We expect to realize the benefits of commodity hedges continue to roll off and we expect operational excellence. Overall, 2017 should be a very strong recovery year for Chemical Intermediates.","I will finish the segment review with Fibers on Slide 13. Full year revenue declined, primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices for acetate tow. As expected, acetate tow volumes were down approximately 10% for the year. Operating earnings were down year-over-year due to lower sales volume. Lower selling prices were offset by lower operating costs, resulting from recent actions and lower raw material and energy costs. Despite the challenge from lower volume and lower selling prices, the operating margin for this segment remained at 31%. Looking forward, we continue to work through customer negotiations for 2017 and anticipate earnings for this segment could be down up to 25% for the year versus our previous guidance of 20% down. This change is due to uncertainty in China demand. Our expectation is outside of China has not changed as we expect tow volume outside China to be roughly flat relative to last year. We expect to have more clarity around imports into China by our first quarter call. I will also mention that approximately two-thirds of our tow business is now under multi-year customer agreements, which should help stabilize both the volume and pricing moving forward. We remain confident in our long-term position and strongly believe that Fibers will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman.","On Slide 14, I will transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for 2016. We did an excellent job of generating cash in 2016 with adjusted operating cash flow of just over $1.5 billion. In line with our expectations, capital expenditures totaled $626 million, as we maintained our growth investments while managing the pace of spend with the economic environment. Looking forward, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $575 million in 2017, although we may moderately adjust this number up or down, depending on the economic environment we see this year as well as we go into 2018. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $909 million, excluding an additional $150 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the fourth quarter, rather than what we would have contributed over the next 2 years to 3 years. This investment is not only in accretive, it is in the tax efficient use of cash, but also brought our funding status globally to approximately 90%.","Looking at the balance sheet, net debt stands at approximately $6.4 billion as of the end of the year reflecting our over $400 million in debt reduction for the year. We delivered on our commitment to reduce net debt by $1 billion over the last 2 years, reducing debt by a total of $955 million and $159 million in debt like obligations in the fourth quarter with that accelerated pension contribution. Our impressive cash flow, strong balance sheet and liquidity keep Eastman in a position of strength in an uncertain economy. Additionally, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Our full year dividend was $272 million and this included an increase in the fourth quarter of over 10%. And we had $145 million in share repurchases through the year, including $25 million in the fourth quarter. The combination of regular increases in our dividend and share repurchases reflect our continued confidence in our future earnings and cash flows. And finally, our effective tax rate for the year was approximately 21%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations and other positive tax attributes. We expect the effective tax rate for 2017 will be approximately 23%, although we will continue to pursue opportunities to reduce this rate further during the course of the year, overall a strong year of financial results.","Next on Slide 15, during the quarter, we opportunistically refinanced borrowings with longer term European debt and a term loan with very attractive rate. The restructuring is focused on extinguishing maturities for the next 2 years by repurchasing our 2017 and 2018 debt securities and retiring higher interest rate debt as you can see on the chart, all while ensuring we maintain healthy levels of pre-payable debt to achieve any de-leveraging goals that we need to pursue. This initiative reduces Eastman\u2019s weighted average cost of fixed debt from 4% to 3.7% and increases the weighted average maturity from 10 years to 11 years. Additionally, this transaction will result in an estimated net interest expense savings of approximately $25 million \u2013 $20 million for the year, with further savings in the following years. Overall, a great value creating transaction for Eastman, especially with the recent increases in rates, so I really appreciate the leadership of our Treasurer, Keith Jennings and the Eastman team and our advisors, who are helping us to improve an already attractive debt profile.","On Slide 16, we have recognized the current economic environment we faced requires aggressive cost management above and beyond our annual productivity initiatives to offset inflation. We are very confident that we will hit our 2017 cost reduction target, which we expect will contribute approximately $0.50 of earnings per share in 2017. As you think about the cost reductions a large portion are on manufacturing and the supply chain areas. And given the nature of these cost reductions, the larger share will be realized in Chemical Intermediates as they manage the big engine manufacturing engines. I want to emphasize that we are achieving these cost reductions without sacrificing investment in innovation and market development initiatives and these cost reductions are well in hand.","So with that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Curt. On Slide 17, I will discuss our 2017 outlook. We are doing a great job of executing our strategy in a challenging global business climate. Strong growth of high-value innovative products continues as we benefit from leading positions in attractive niche markets. We are increasing our investment in innovation and product development so we can accelerate around them in the coming years. And we are seeing the benefits of scale and integration, translating this attractive growth into earnings.","Additionally, our growth in innovation has leveraged to attractive disruptive macro trends in areas such us health and wellness, energy efficiency and the emerging middle class. This enables us to grow faster than the underlying markets with our new innovative products. At the same time, we are achieving our cost reduction goals. And I can\u2019t say enough about our employees around the world who make this possible. We also benefit this year from the net of propane and currency hedges continuing to roll off and we continue to use all lines in the income statement to support our EPS growth. All of these actions are helping to offset the challenges we continue to face, including sluggish global GDP growth, a stronger dollar, volatile raw material and energy prices and the challenges we face in fibers. Putting all this together, we maintained our prior guidance of 8% to 12% EPS growth.","We continue to expect earnings per share to increase at least 8%. Depending how the variables I mentioned play out, EPS could be as high as 12%. We also expect strong free cash flow this year of approximately $1 billion, which is one of the strongest yields in the industry. And we are creating value for our stakeholders with our balanced and disciplined allocation of this cash. You should expect an acceleration of share repurchases continue de-levering at an increasing dividend.","In summary, on Slide 18, we have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses. We will continue to drive organic growth, accelerate innovation and improve our product mix. We are committed to using every lever we have in this challenging environment and we will return our strong free cash flow to stockholders. I am confident that 2017 will be a strong year for Eastman with increasing earnings and a record free cash flow. Most importantly, I believe that we are building one of the world\u2019s leading specialty companies to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Thanks for joining us this morning, and I look forward to your questions.","Greg Riddle","Thanks Mark. We have a lot of people on the line this morning and we\u2019d like to get to as many questions as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, Ebony, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first caller, David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thanks. Good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning, Dave.","David Begleiter","Mark, you referenced the lag in catching up to the higher propane and propylene prices, can you discuss the impact or how that flows through Q1 versus Q2? I assumed Q1 might be a little bit weaker, but you should catch up in Q2 and Q3?","Mark Costa","Hi, David. I think you sort of summarized it well. With the Chemical Intermediates business, we are already seeing prices go up now as we keep track with the way our raw material prices are moving in the marketplace. But when you think about the specialties, whether it\u2019s Advanced Materials or Additives & Functional Products, there is always a bit of lag in how your prices adjust. And it\u2019s usually a 3 to 6-month lag from when Ross moved to when you see prices go up. We are moving aggressively on how we try and do that. But a lot of places, the specialty businesses have quarterly prices. So we feel good about our ability to get the prices up, it just takes a little time. And it\u2019s the same on the downside we benefit a lot when Ross came up for the same reason.","David Begleiter","And Mark, just on the free cash, ex the dividends you need to pay, should \u2013 most of that cash go to share buybacks?","Mark Costa","All the cash will not go to share buybacks. We are extremely happy to set a record in free cash flow this year and looking forward to that number. But you got to remember that a portion of it goes to dividends, which would be about $300 million. And then you have got the remainder being split between share repurchases and de-levering.","David Begleiter","And how much de-leveraging do you think you will do in 2017?","Curt Espeland","David, this is Curt. What Mark is saying is about half of that remaining $700 million roughly free cash flow will be split between share repurchases and de-leveraging.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Thank you. With regard to Advanced Materials, Mark, would you comment on your expected margin trajectory, 2017 versus 2016? Would you expect that to be flat, up or down?","Mark Costa","We think that the Advanced Materials margins will be relatively flat. I mean, Advanced Materials has had a phenomenal run. They have had 4 years of compounded growth to 20%, all driven by volume and mix and fixed cost leverage, very little of it has been raw material tailwinds. And so it\u2019s been just a great story. As you look at \u201817, we continue to expect very strong volume and mix growth. We have got so many great things happening on the innovation front there. We expect another year of double-digit growth and Tritan and Saflex acoustics inter-layer products as well as heads up display and performance films, so growing a lot faster in those key products than high margins improving mix. But at the same time, as I just I said to David\u2019s question, you do have raw materials moving up and there is a little bit of lag, prices catch up to Ross just like it would happen in Additives & Functional products, you have also got currency as a headwind and some startup costs around our two growth investments in PVB and Tritan, which are going to be great to support our growth long-term. So when you net it altogether, it moderates the rate of earnings growth and we will expect this year from the prior years, but still a solid year of earnings growth and the way that margins sort of works out with all those moving parts is margins stay about flat.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. And then a follow-up for Curt if I may, on pension. It looks like you injected $150 million in the quarter, making $200 million for 2016. What is your expectation for pension contributions in 2017 please?","Curt Espeland","That would be \u2013 that $150 million was accelerating contributions we would have made in \u201817 and \u201818, maybe a little into \u201819. So we will not be making any pension contributions in the U.S. in 2017.","Kevin McCarthy","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thank you. There is another ethylene asset being sold, do you think we will have to wait for that to be agreed to as a deal before we can get a deal for your Longview operations?","Mark Costa","Well, first of all, John, I think it has some impact on our process, but we will continue to have a number of parties actively engaged in our process. And maybe just to recap that, we are continuing to work a variety of options from outright sale partnership and commercial options. Each negotiation has its own scope, structure and timeline. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2013 as I think about those negotiations, I don\u2019t think they are dramatically impacted by what\u2019s going on with the competing asset, but we will see. But it\u2019s just not your typical divesture process. So we are going to continue to be a patient seller. We will see how these things play out in the marketplace as we try to create some value with this transaction. So, it\u2019s just going to take some time.","John Roberts","And then in cigarette filter tow, you are going to have a new owner of a competitor do you consider that good, bad or neutral to the competitive dynamics?","Mark Costa","Blackstone is a company who has owned us as a tow business before and understands the industry and I think has been a very rational player back in their history, where they saw the value of rationalizing high cost assets to be better positioned to serve their customers. So I think that as a new owner in this industry, I would expect that\u2019s a good thing and more continued rational behavior. I assume they are going to have a decent amount of debt on that deal and be very focused on cash flow generation, which is I think senseful.","John Roberts","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","James Sheehan","Good morning. Could you elaborate further on what you are seeing in China in terms of filter tow demand being a little weaker than you expected? What are the dynamics there?","Mark Costa","Sure. Before I get to that, I just want to be clear and emphasize something Curt said, nothing has changed outside of China. So we have held our market share and expect volume to be flat. Prices will come off as we defend our market share. So I think that that\u2019s played out. The incremental 5% change in our guidance is really about demand in China. And it really is still more of a de-stocking story more than anything else that we can sort out at this stage. The Chinese National Tobacco Company is extremely focused on destocking, at all levels, whether it\u2019s retail, wholesale or tow and are continuing to that. They intend to hold production rates basically flat to last year of cigarettes. But want to continue pulling down some tow inventory from what we can tell on that gets us to that potential 5% down. I would be clear that, that is not yet finalized. And so we will have to wait and see how those contract negotiations complete. But it seems about the right direction. I would note there is a couple of other things around this business. One is for the first time CNTC has actually published data about the retail inventory level and suggests that it\u2019s declined 30% from where they were a few years ago, which is actually quite good news, assuming the data is accurate. Because if you think about cigarette production, it\u2019s only declined about 5% in that same timeframe, it would suggest that retail demand out there is still healthy sort of for the reinforcing the de-stocking theory about what\u2019s going on in China. Looking forward though, as we look at all of this, we are doing everything we can to stabilize this business. So we are now in a position where we got about two-thirds of our tow demand in long-term agreements for both supply as well as price. We are obviously, taking out a lot of costs across the company, over $100 million of cost reduction and bottom line to offset this headwind and others. And we are hopeful that the industry will continue to rationalize high cost assets. There is a number of them out there, it\u2019s really for our competitors to decide what to do because we are down to our largest integrated position with the best cost position in flake and the tow capacity that matches with it. And we are also not waiting around for demand to get better. We have some great innovation efforts going on in this business around leveraging these assets into new market applications outside of cigarettes and making tremendous progress. I am hoping I will be able to tell you some of those successes this year as we are getting pretty close. So a lot of things we are doing to sort of stabilize the business, grow in other direction to improve asset utilization, but it still looks like there is some de-stocking to be done and we will walk our way through.","James Sheehan","Terrific. And following upon this question before on the Longview cracker, are you still focusing on the first half of 2017 of having sort of a permanent arrangement settled for that and also can you update us on the pipeline dispute please?","Curt Espeland","Sure. I will do that in reverse order. On the pipeline dispute, we continue to win on all fronts, including a favorable ruling we have had on the tariff dispute as well. So the bottom line, the pipeline dispute really doesn\u2019t concern me and there is no longer a rate limiting factor around our efforts to sell this, exit that plant and commodity derivatives. From the timeline, the assets, we are still trying to target something by mid-year. But as I mentioned, these are all unique negotiations going on. Some could be longer or shorter and we will just see how those play out over the next several months.","James Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Berney","Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","Ryan Berney","The Additives & Functional Products volumes ticked up decently this quarter and look like it was your best quarter of the year, so I was hoping you could maybe give a little color around the underlying components there around the businesses and individual volume numbers and then maybe how those have trended so far in the first quarter?","Mark Costa","Sure. We are quite excited about seeing the improvement in volumes and it really was across many fronts in the fourth quarter. So we saw strength in coatings, saw strength in adhesives and care chemicals. We even had some de-stocking go on in tires, so the growth rate was even better in those other segments when you factor that in and that de-stocking seems to have cleared. So as we look at that momentum going into the first quarter in the year, we continue to expect strong growth. We see very solid orders, actually strong orders in January. And we think that the underlying markets, whenever you think about the key markets we are leveraged to transportation, building construction, and consumables, care chemicals within that, there is a lot of great trends going on, a lot of optimism on the consumer side and you are seeing it from a number of companies where demand is holding up quite well there. So we expect good underlying market growth as we go into this year. On top of that, we are creating our own growth. We have some great innovation happening across AFP and getting traction. We already have double-digit growth happening in tire resins and that will continue. We have other new innovation projects starting to gain traction and we will put some volume points on the board this year in our Tetrashield polyester coatings and our new Aerafin polymers for adhesives. So you have got a number of places where innovation is going to drive more growth like we do in Advanced Materials on top of the market. And in addition to that, we have got specialty fluid having some very large solar fills. They have done some great jobs and winning some of the big projects and those fills are going to happen this year. So we feel really good about growth on the volumes side and AFP this year.","Ryan Berney","Great. Thank you. And then I also want to follow-up on the comment you had made a little earlier on the call around $20 million in costs between the Additives & Functional Products and Chemical Intermediates business, just I wasn\u2019t sure I heard it right, so I wanted to get more clarity on what exactly that was?","Curt Espeland","So if you just think about looking at 2016, if that exact cost structure we experienced in 2016 had been reflected in the 2015 recast, there would have been $20 million more costs in 2015 in AFP and thus lowering their 6.60 to 6.40, and the offsetting would have been in Chemical Intermediates, so just a way to think about the year-over-year comp between the 2 years.","Ryan Berney","Understand. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","Curt Espeland","Good morning Frank.","Frank Mitsch","Hey. One of your Board member\u2019s companies is noted for saying that their EPS growth forecasts are, \u201ccommitments not aspirations\u201d and I guess I was a little surprised pleasantly to see that you are reiterating your 8% to 12% growth, especially as you talk about a challenging business climate out there, so I was just curious, what sort of GDP expectations do you have, what are your expectations regionally in terms of growth and how confident are you in that 8% to 12%?","Mark Costa","Thanks Frank for the question and obviously, very important one. We feel great about everything that we are doing that\u2019s in our control. So we are delivering and holding on to our core growth in our end markets and those end markets look like they are pretty good. We are delivering a lot of innovation. It\u2019s really starting to happen all over the place in Advanced Materials, AFP and even some in Fibers that gives you some additional growth as well as more importantly, the mix upgrade, because a lot of times, we are shifting asset from a standard product like a core copolyester to Tritan or standard interlayer to heads-up display interlayer, getting more capital efficiency and earnings lift of the same asset, so all that\u2019s going well. The cost management is in there, aggressively reducing cost, the hedges rolling off, as I said. So a lot of those things that you give you tailwind. As we look at the current market conditions, which I will explain in a moment, that gets us being closer to 8% in the range. And what we are assuming there Frank is that the underlying economy around the world is growing similar to last year, maybe slightly better. So solid U.S. growth, Europe sort of recovering, Asia growing better than the rest of the world, but still not a great rate. End markets, also solid growth, nothing too exciting. So that\u2019s sort of what gets into that closer to eight [ph] view of the world. Obviously, there is a lot of optimism about the economy getting better, number of companies talking about that. And if that plays out, that\u2019s going to be upside for us. That\u2019s also translates to the second assumption, which is we are assuming sort of a normal pace of getting prices up in specialties relative to how raws moved. As the economy strengthens, if we can be more successful in pushing those raws through, obviously, that would create some upside relative to sort of where this were eight number. When you think about energy cost, we are using the forward curve on natural gas. Natural gas prices are likely to turn out to be lower than that, that will be some upside. Taxes, another place where right now, with the guidance that Curt gave you, we have got about 200 basis points headwind in tax and we have number of projects we are working hard right now to try and improve that tax rate. So there is a number of different things and we all know that olefins can go in any direction, better or worse, that\u2019s just an uncertainty. So I think that as you look at it, we are driving hard, we like the range that we have. With the world as we see it today, we are closer to 8, but there is clearly a lot of places to have upside.","Frank Mitsch","That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate it. And you did mention that you are counting on getting pricing up in the specialty side, you outlined the positive trends in AFP in terms of volumes, how is that trending so far in terms of getting pricing in AFP?","Curt Espeland","Yes. So I think that the AFP side is one that\u2019s had some good trends. So, we obviously had prices come off in the first half of last year as we talked about as we shared some of the raw material benefit that we held on to in 2015. And you can see that on the \u201814 to \u201815 to \u201816 chart that some of that margin expansion was shared, but not all. The good news is price is stabilized from the second quarter through the back half of the year. And that was important. As we move into the first quarter, we have a few places where we can get prices up, but a lot of it is going to lag, the raw materials. And so as I mentioned to Dave earlier, we will see that more in the second and third quarter as prices come up, but these are great products. And for the vast majority of what we have in AFP I think we will be able to sort of recover those raws. There are few places where we don\u2019t have pricing power like adhesives, where it\u2019s been incredibly tight moving to more of a balanced situation and there is a little bit of Crystex prices coming off. But overall, we feel good about it.","Frank Mitsch","Alright, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mike Leithead","Hey, guys. This is Mike Leithead on for Duffy. Just real quick on the currency. Currency and commodities have moved kind of quite a bit in the past 3, 6 months, should we still expect propylene and FX hedges rolling off to be in that $0.30 benefit next year?","Curt Espeland","Well, sure. So, first of all, let me just remind you, overall we are assuming olefin spreads are the same as last year. However, we are using the forward curve on oil and natural gas. So, the absolute feedstocks are higher than last year as you can see in the marketplace today. So given this assumption, the net benefit or let\u2019s call it tailwind from the reduced commodity hedge costs, has actually increased over $0.50 a share versus the previous $0.40 a share on a year-over-year basis. The offsetting impact is still within the currency hedges that are rolling off, which is still probably now just over $0.10 a share. So, it\u2019s now kind of roughly $0.40 a share net benefit of the hedges rolling off versus our previous outlook. But again, this is offset by the prices catching up the raw material that Mark talked about. Even in Chemical Intermediates, there can be a lag in pricing. We are also assuming higher energy cost and that is not as easily recovered in prices. And again, there is the impact of the stronger dollar on the hedged earnings. And since I am talking about the hedge, I also want to make sure it is a good chance to remind everyone that 80% of the benefit of the feedstock hedges rolling off go to Chemical Intermediates, the remainder will go to AFP and Advanced Materials, but then almost all the currency headwinds that I mentioned are going to be impacting the Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Product lines.","Mark Costa","Yes. Just to pile on, something else I want to say is that we are officially out of the olefin forecasting business. I don\u2019t think anyone has been right in calling it, especially at the quarterly level about what\u2019s happening here. So, we are going to just continue to give you our assumptions that we have made. Obviously, everyone has got their own opinion of where it\u2019s going to go, no matter where you look. And for us, I think we are fortunately headed to a story where this becomes less and less relevant. We have got the transformation where 70% of our earnings are going to the specialties. So, hopefully this is going to be less of a topic for us.","Mike Leithead","Got it. And then Mark, the tow industry has been quite volatile the past few years, do you think with the new industry contract structures and the new asset owner in the space, the industry is kind of structurally set up better to handle further volatility down the line, let\u2019s say, maybe it was 12, 24 months ago?","Mark Costa","Yes, I do. I think that we are highly committed as a key player in the industry to do everything we can to try and drive stability and provide disciplined behavior and we are going to continue doing that. And I do think the long-term contracts helped. Obviously, if someone starts rationalizing high-cost assets, improve their ability to serve their customers that would help. And I have every expectation that Blackstone will be a rationale behavior in the marketplace. So I think all these things help.","Mike Leithead","Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Mike Sison","Hey, guys. Happy New Year.","Mark Costa","Hey, same to you.","Mike Sison","Mark, when you think about your bridge for 2017, just curious how much of that growth you think will come from your specialty businesses and AFP or maybe another way to look at it is just does the earnings growth of those two businesses kind of mirror the EPS growth potential that you see?","Mark Costa","Well, I think that EPS growth is, you got to remember there is other lines of the income statement as you flow from operating earnings to the bottom, right? So we have got things that we are going to do on improving interest costs. And the actions we took, we have things that we are doing to improve share count to keep in mind. But I do think what we are going to see is very solid earnings growth in the two specialty segments and pretty strong recovery in Chemical Intermediates. So, bigger percentage increase there, as the majority of those hedges rolling off flow into that segment. But overall, it\u2019s going to be a great story of the three segments delivering important and valuable earnings growth and a lot of cash flow, obviously offsetting the headwinds we have in fibers.","Mike Sison","Great. And then as a quick follow-up, I know the focus initially is stock buyback and debt reduction, but I think you have done a good job of adding high-quality business to your portfolio, any thoughts on acquisitions and continuing to find specialty assets to add to Eastman?","Mark Costa","Look, I think we have had a very impressive track record of doing excellent M&A that\u2019s created a lot of value for our shareholders. I am very proud of all the acquisitions we did from Solutia, Taminco to Commonwealth to the DPA aviation turbine business, which has been powerful and tremendous in improving the quality of our earnings, the robustness to sort of withstand some of the headwinds we have seen in the last couple of years. And equally important, by the way, generate a lot of free cash flow. I mean, those businesses are just fantastic. And we didn\u2019t overpay for them, which is something I am quite proud of. Paying 9x EBITDA, with 7 or less after synergies, is a lot better than the way the transaction multiples are playing out these days. So as I have said in the past, we have no intention to do any large M&A at this stage. The multiple is being paid right now are way outside of the range that I think provide attractive return on capital to our shareholders. We are always interested and open to bolt-on M&A that has a very tight strategic fit to a business we are already in. And we will always be looking for those opportunities. I will tell you right now, I don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline that has any near-term possibilities. So, what we are focused on doing right now is what we have been doing, drive growth organic improvements, get all these innovation programs, delivering results, take the cost out where we can, deliver earnings and cash flow growth and return that free cash flow to shareholders and an increasing dividend in share repurchases. So that\u2019s our focus. I would really say for this year, for the great bolt-on M&A comes along that we haven\u2019t thought of. We are always going to be smart and thoughtful about it, if it provides an attractive return.","Mike Sison","Great. Thanks Mark.","Operator","And we will move to our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Rizzo","Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo on for Lawrence. You guys mentioned Tritan and Saflex 10% growers, was there any other I mean products that kind of stand out as something that is reaching that level or has the potential to reach that level in the next year or two?","Mark Costa","So, as I said, double-digit growth in Tritan, acoustics and heads-up inter-layers, performance films is growing double-digits in North America and China, because we have new channel strategy that allows to grow a lot more, lot faster than the OEM growth rate. Tire resins in AFP is growing at double-digit rates. The solar winds will be very high volume growth rate relative to last year. So, lot of different places where we are seeing volume growth. I know you have got the new products gaining traction in the marketplace, so they are sort of zero, but now starting to add volume to the story, like the Tetrashield polyester coatings had modest amount of volume with our first one, with our first customer last year that we told you about on the first quarter call, and that\u2019s now picking up momentum with several customers. So, we are going to see more of that this year. The new Aerafin polymer that we are launching that is a better performing polymer and adhesives for hot melt adhesive applications we expect value there. So we are starting to see growth all over. I mean what I love about this is it\u2019s an innovation story that\u2019s starting to pop up across various set of end markets and on multiple technology platforms that really sort of proves that we are creating the value that we intended that we are getting the returns on innovation investment. And then we are making that transformation to being a true specialty company.","Dan Rizzo","Then what percentage of your sales of your products are 10% growers or potentially 10% growers?","Curt Espeland","We don\u2019t actually disclose that data. But I think what you will see as Mark talking about $200 million of new business closed and trying to accelerate that and that\u2019s going to be driven by those innovation programs that he has already mentioned.","Mark Costa","It goes back to the guidance we gave a while ago that says that we can sort of grow the core with the underlying markets and then add sort of 1% to 2% revenue growth on top of that. And we have just proved that in \u201816 with the $200 million new business closed and I think it will be a better number this year.","Dan Rizzo","Okay. And then quickly, you said that you gave the raw material and FX functions, but are you assuming FX stays where it is right now or you are assuming any appreciation going for the rest of year or I am just wondering what level we should think of?","Mark Costa","Our assumption currency for us, particularly European exchange rate is where it is today.","Dan Rizzo","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","Curt Espeland","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar","In Additives & Functional Products, your operating margins were down 200 basis points in 4Q, can you just talk about what happened to Crystex margins and is raw materials an issue for Crystex in 2017?","Curt Espeland","Well, let me speak to AFP as a whole. First of all, you think \u2013 first, if you think about the differences in the cost flow that come up, AFP was down less than 5% from 2015. But AFP\u2019s price declines are in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year as we have already mentioned, they have also been stabilized. And as we look forward, we expect them to continue to be stable and coatings particularly, they are likely to increase with the increasing raw material environment. So despite the price decline, AFP\u2019s operating margins have remained about 20% for the year. And more importantly, our decision to share raw material value with our customers has maintained a strong customer engagement, enabled us to make great progress on our innovation effort. So we have now a more robust and credible growth portfolio in AFP than any other time for all the things we have talked about. So across the portfolio is where I encourage you to look at that. And I think you are going to see continued strong margins in AFP.","Mark Costa","Yes. I would note that as you look at \u201817, we expect margins to be more similar to the full year average margins for \u201816. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the fourth quarter number.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. Thank you. And then on filter tow, given that China continues to de-stock and demand continues to go down, do you think the industry needs to shutdown capacity and do you have any plans for capacity shutdowns? Thank you.","Mark Costa","So as I mentioned earlier, I think that the demand situation in China is certainly not as dramatic as the drop in tow imports. So we see a lot of evidence of substantial de-stocking going on at the retail level, at the wholesale level and the total level that really is the story about why imports have come down as well as don\u2019t forget that we added two significant tow plants between our joint venture with CNTC and Daiso\u2019s joint venture. So a huge amount of the imports was just then backward integrating. So you have to be very careful about interpreting what\u2019s going on in our volume story to a primary demand story. No question, primary demand is not growing as fast as it used to in China. And it may be that it\u2019s moderated by some of these changes on corruption and some other economically driven issues around affordability for the average Chinese consumer. But this recent data about the 30% pull-down inventory, if it\u2019s accurate, would suggest primary demand is actually holding up reasonably well. To your second question, in total, there is no question that there is excess capacity in this industry. And there are a number of high cost standalone assets that our competitors have and it\u2019s their decision obviously about what they are going to doing with those assets. We are going to continue to defend our market share and our marketplace and they are going to have to decide what they want to do. But there is no additional assets for us to take out. We have \u2013 were down to one flake asset, which is the largest scale, backward integrated in coal and the lowest cost in the world. We have some tow assets here in Korea that match that flake capacity and so there is absolutely no reason we would reduce our tow capacity relative to our flake capacity, especially as we have these new applications we are developing that can utilize some of those assets into other markets. So we have done everything we can. We shutdown our UK facility to take out tow capacity. We exited the flake joint venture we have with Primester. So we have actually taken actions in the last 2 years to improve our position. Now, we will just have to wait to see what other people do.","P.J. Juvekar","Great. Thank you, Mark.","Operator","And we will move to our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks and good morning everyone. Just wanted to try to get a better sense of a few of the dynamics that would be impacting the flow of earnings through the year, if I remember correctly from last year, the hedge, the mechanism of the hedge is such that, I guess there is \u2013 it is different effect of it in the first quarter versus later in the year, so I would like to review that. Also in terms of the cost savings, will those flow-through evenly through the year, likewise the risks that you mentioned on tow from China, is that something that\u2019s on the come or will we know about that in the first quarter? And let\u2019s just leave it there for now?","Curt Espeland","This is Curt, let me start. You are absolutely right on the hedges. Generally speaking, the impact of the hedges is actually felt in second, third and fourth quarters, a little bit more in the fourth. And they don\u2019t see a lot of impact in the first quarter, just because of the hedges reset and how inventory turns occur. So you have got that absolutely right. On cost, yes generally speaking, that\u2019s going to flow even through the year. There are some things we are working on, the indirect procurement side that will accelerate during the course of the year. But if you want to use it on average in the course of the year, you are probably not that far off.","Mark Costa","Just on two other points Vincent, one is we have already talked about price versus raw, so there is a little bit of catching up on prices relative to raw that will slow the rate of growth in the first quarter. And on tow, the volume patterns in tow are always a bit chunky, as we have told you before. The first quarter of last year was a little bit strong, this quarter might be a little bit lighter, so there might be a little bit of a difference there, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you have I think that\u2019s Slide 4, you had a lot of innovation on it, so it sounds like you are making a lot of progression there, but I did notice that our R&D for 2016, at least on the income statement, it appears it declined, is that just sort of a transitory thing or is that part of the cost savings or are you just optimizing your spend?","Mark Costa","That\u2019s a great question. We have been making a tremendous amount of investment in our growth capabilities across the company. But the first thing you do is always make sure you are getting the best return on cost for your investors. So we have been shifting the R&D dramatically from a lot of process technology efforts if you think about where we were a number of years ago, being a more diversified mentality to a very focus on innovation and market development. So our top 10 innovation programs within that R&D, we have actually doubled the R&D on those top 10 programs. Within that spend, we have actually shifted our resources working on application development capability from 20% to 40% of the resources and that\u2019s a dramatic change. The secrets of success of specialty company is having application development capability. And for those who don\u2019t know what that is, that\u2019s basically having our customer\u2019s capability to do what they do. So we have paint booths that are state-of-the-art equal to an OEM paint booth for automotive paints in two places, here and Shanghai, where we can formulate our own coatings, prove it out and exactly how they paint it in every environmental condition around the world and show not only our coating customers, but the OEMs what our Tetrashield polyester can do and our other additives can do in coatings. We have the same ability in tires, where we can make tires and road test them and show what our state-of-the-art new proprietary tire resins can do to improve traction on a tire. Same thing we have been doing for years in specialty plastics around making every thing you can make from a thermoplastic. We actually do it. We build molds and set process conditions for our customers because we understand their processes better than they do sometimes, same in inter-layers where we can make a windshield. So significant increases in spend there, significant shift in the SG&A as well in resources towards marketing and sales where we are building some of the world-class marketing capabilities. And our sales forces is just great at carrying a great culture that we have inside Eastman around collaboration and integrity and responsibility of doing what we are saying we are going to do to our customers. But I do think that the spend will increase. So first, we are going to get a good return for you on the money we have and I think we are doing that. Second, we are now going to start increasing R&D spend as we go forward. As these programs are starting to ramp up and become much more significant, it requires more resources to support multiple customers in taking and activating the market. So you will see that\u2019s been the increase.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Greg Riddle","Let\u2019s make the next question last question please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils Wallin","Great. Thanks for taking in. Thanks for footing [ph] me in. Just a question back on the cadence of the earnings growth, you used \u2013 you certainly spoke a lot about the price versus raw and the lag there and some sort of headwinds in the first quarter, the rate of growth growing, should we think about sort of tougher comps in the beginning first half of the year in terms of the year-over-year earnings growth and then improving dramatically in the second half?","Mark Costa","Yes. I think about \u2013 when I think about the comps, the comp I think that\u2019s going to be tough is the first quarter comp, for the reasons you described. I am not sure we are going to show 8% growth year-over-year, but we will see how the year plays out. But the toughest comp is first quarter. I think you will see good results as we progress through the rest of the year.","Nils Wallin","Great. And then just a quick follow-up on tow, obviously a lot of discussion about rationalization and what have you, what type of a capacity rationalization does the industry need to make in order to get back to the 90-plus operating rates you enjoyed in the \u201813 through \u201815 time period?","Mark Costa","Well, I am not going to get into specific numbers and it\u2019s not even appropriate for me to really comment on specifics because it\u2019s not my assets, I think it\u2019s a more appropriate question for the people who have them. I think that there is enough capacity out there to rationalize to make the industry tight again. It\u2019s just a question of whether or not other people choose to do it.","Nils Wallin","Thanks very much.","Greg Riddle","Okay. And thanks again everyone for joining us this morning, really appreciate your interest in Eastman. A web replay will be available on our website later this morning. Have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You many now disconnect."],"7792":["Eastman Chemical Co.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Eastman Chemical Company First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on Eastman's website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Mara, and good morning, everyone, and thanks very much for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager of Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's first quarter 2015 financial results news release, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for 2014 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for first quarter 2015.","Second, earnings per share, operating earnings and EBITDA referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core or non-recurring costs, charges and gains.

Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the first quarter financial results news release.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. It's a beautiful day in Kingsport. We're putting another tough winter behind us and we can see everything blooming. I'll start on page three. We had a strong start to the year with our first quarter results. We've made solid progress in executing our strategy to become the leading specialty chemical company. This progress is the result of a number of actions we have taken to upgrade the quality of our portfolio.","Today, we have a portfolio of world-class technology platforms we are leveraging to be a market leader, an innovation leader and a cost leader. In our first quarter, EPS increased 14% year-over-year, and our first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 24%, which ranks in the top quartile among our chemical peers.","We did a great job of holding on to value for the first-quarter as we increased our operating margin by 120 basis points to almost 18%. This also reflects our continued ability to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines. We're also doing a good job of creating value in both earnings and cash flow from our acquisitions, including Taminco and Commonwealth.","Disciplined cost management has also been a focus, and we're doing an excellent job as we hold costs flat via productivity efforts while, at the same time, shifting more resources to our innovation efforts. Our SGA as a percentage of sales is in the lower quartile of our peers, which is a function of our scale and integration and the great discipline of our employees.","We've also made good progress in reducing manufacturing costs. Productivity is in the DNA of Eastman. Beyond the numbers, we've also been a recipient of numerous awards over the past several months that highlight many of the qualities our stakeholders have come to expect from Eastman.","We are \u2013 for the second consecutive year, we're the Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award, honoring the best places to work. What I value most about this award is that it's based solely on the input of employees. We were also recognized for outstanding corporate ethics and corporate responsibility with awards from both Ethisphere and Corporate Responsibility Magazine. And we are recognized by the EPA as an ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Partner of the Year, becoming the only chemical company to have received this recognition for four consecutive years. Our excellent first quarter results and the recognition we are receiving are a direct result from the great work being done by all of our Eastman employees.","I'll now move to slide four. I want to emphasize the great progress we're making in delivering strong growth in our innovative specialty products, which is a key driver of earnings growth this year and in the long term. At our Investor Day, we described that a key element of our strategy was improving our product mix by growing our high-margin specialty products, and by not growing or investing in our commodities, a strategy that is differentiated from many of our peers. We're very much on track with this strategy.","For this year, we expect strong growth in a number of products across advanced materials, additives and functional products and adhesives and plasticizers. We have several growth programs delivering results now. For example, we expect record volumes in Saflex window interlayers this year driven by auto market adoption of laminated glass in side windows and a much higher use of acoustics.","We had strong growth in North America and China performance films including our new paint protection film from our Commonwealth acquisition. High growth in our tackifying resins in tires as a performance additive to improve traction and high growth in our differentiated hydrogenated tackifying resins, especially in hygiene markets.","We also see another wave of specialty product growth coming. For example, new differentiated polyesters for a wide range of coatings and AFP, leveraging our proprietary monomer that has enabled our Tritan success in thermoplastics. Next generation of Crystex that will enable a 20% to 30% improvement in our costs and a more differentiated product set, and microfibers in both non-woven and woven applications. Bottom line, we are walking the talk to transform our portfolio to a set of high-quality specialty businesses.","On slide five, we have provided an update on the Taminco acquisition as this is the first quarter results as part of Eastman. I'm pleased with the solid performance of this business that was in line with our expectations.","Volume was driven by good growth in the home and personal care and water treatment markets, as well as the benefit of the Taminco formic acid acquisition, which demonstrates the diversity of markets in which our Taminco businesses participate. In our high-margin crop protection business, which goes into perishable, high-value fruit, vegetables and flowers, we realized a stronger-than-expected performance in Europe and North America. And functional amines, which go into herbicides for row crops, we saw some decline in demand in the first quarter as expected. And sequentially, we're seeing improved demand across a number of fronts. We expect the overall Taminco margins to remain stable due to the quality of their market positions and high level of cost pass-through contracts.","On synergies, we remain on track. We're seeing good opportunities in procurement, operational capabilities and supply chain optimization and are aggressively working these. Although we are still in early days, we've already had some operational improvement successes in combining Eastman's deep fundamental operational expertise from our large integrated sites with Taminco's amine manufacturing expertise, resulting in higher capacity utilization rates in several Taminco sites.","We're also very encouraged about Taminco's product development pipeline and see opportunities to help them accelerate their success, similar to what we have done at the solution businesses. We continue to expect synergies of approximately $60 million over the next couple of years.","One of the key elements of a successful acquisition is retention of key talent, and we're doing very well in this area. I've been very pleased with the engagement of the Taminco team in the success of the combination of Eastman and Taminco.","On a full-year basis, we expect volume growth to be greater than GDP for all of Taminco, and earnings accretion on track with our expectations of greater than $0.35 per share in 2015 and greater than $0.60 per share in 2016. Given the strategic fit of Taminco and Eastman, the consistency of their earnings growth in a variety of business climates and the strength of their cash flow, we remain very pleased to have Taminco as part of the Eastman portfolio.","Now, I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss the corporate and segment results.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our first quarter results on slide six.","Overall sales revenue increased primarily due to revenue from the businesses we acquired in 2014. This was partially offset by lower selling prices, which largely reflected lower raw material and energy costs, and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rates. Our operating earnings increased as we largely were able to hold on to value in the quarter, reflecting the specialty and special position nature of a significant portion of our portfolio. Earnings from acquired businesses were also key contributors.","These were partially offset by lower earnings in our fiber segment, an unfavorable shift in foreign exchange rates and propane hedges that we discussed previously. As Mark mentioned, our operating margin increased by 120 basis points, which is an excellent result despite difficult business conditions. Earnings per share increased 14% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher earnings and lower share count; overall, a very strong quarter where we delivered earnings growth.","Moving next to the segment results, starting with Additives & Functional Products on slide seven. Revenue increased due to sales of the acquired Taminco businesses, partially offset by lower selling prices due to lower raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings increased due to earnings from acquired businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency and propane hedges.","As we look at second quarter, we expect strong volume growth sequentially due to normal seasonality and improving building and construction market, particularly in the U.S., and improving demand for tires as they're anticipated to grow particularly in Europe and North America. We also expect solid growth for the full year, especially in our transportation, building and construction and personal care markets. We, therefore, continue to expect strong full-year earnings growth for Additives & Functional Products due to earnings from acquired businesses, with the earnings in heritage Eastman businesses relatively flat as solid volume growth offsets the currency effects and hedges.","Next is Adhesives & Plasticizers on slide eight. Sales revenue declined 7%, primarily driven by currency and slightly lower selling prices due to lower raw material costs. Operating earnings increased primarily in adhesives resins as an increase in spread was partially offset by currency.","Operating margins for the quarter were 17%, up 300 basis points year-over-year. For full year 2015, we are expecting to continue to make progress improving our product mix. We expect strong growth in hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins as the hygiene market grows in Asia-Pacific, and we see solid growth in the packaging market.","We are also seeing continued good adoption of non-phthalate plasticizers. We are also expecting the adhesives resins market to remain tight due to the lack of available raw materials such as piperylene. Offsetting some of these benefits will be the impact of currency and volatile oil prices. Taken together, we expect Adhesives & Plasticizers will deliver strong earnings growth for the year.","Now, to Advanced Materials on slide nine, which delivered a very solid quarter. Sales revenue declined somewhat as sales from the acquired performance film business were more than offset by currency and lower selling prices particularly for copolyesters, reflecting lower raw material and energy costs. Earnings increased primarily due to earnings from the acquired Commonwealth business, an excellent bolt-on acquisition. These earnings were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency.","Looking at the full year, we continue to expect strong results from Advanced Materials as they make progress on our strategy for this business of volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage. Sequentially, we expect volume will increase as destocking by our copolyester customers in the beginning of the first quarter has subsided. We had strong volumes in March, and that has continued into April.","Interlayer volumes are picking up as OEM auto builds remain solid. Acoustic growth continues, and the overall building and construction market in Europe is stabilizing. And as a result, we expect interlayers volumes in 2015 will be at record levels. And film volumes are picking up sequentially as we have seen strong growth in North America and Asia from normal seasonality and share gains, and as the destocking we have seen in Southeast Asia seems to be behind us.","As a result, for the year, we expect good volume growth. One thing I do want to mention, though, that affects this business, this core volume was somewhat offset by an ethyl acetate product that is a low margin product line that was previously sold in both AFP and Advanced Materials in 2014. Going forward, this product line will be sold solely by Additives & Functional Products. In addition to the good volume growth, we expect continued mix improvement as high margin product lines such as Tritan copolyester, acoustic interlayers and Visualize, our film product used in displays for smartphones, deliver strong growth.","And as we continue to fill out existing capacity, we benefit from fixed cost leverage. We expect all these factors will result in strong earnings growth for Advanced Materials in 2015, offset in part by the impact of currency.","Now, to Fibers on slide 10. Performance in this segment is about as expected. In the quarter, sales revenue declined year-over-year, primarily due to lower acetate tow and acetyl intermediate sales volume. We attribute this to customer inventory destocking, which we discussed back in January. Earnings declined due to lower volume, and I would add that the operating margin was about 32% in the quarter, down slightly from year-ago levels.","As we look at full-year 2015, we are pretty much on track with our previous guidance. Based on conversations with customers about their plans and expectations, we continue to expect that the inventory destocking will be more pronounced in the first half of the year and tow demand will improve in the second half of the year. And we are benefiting from lower raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp.","Regarding our UK facility, as previously announced, we discontinued production and expect site closure will be completed in the third quarter. As a result, we continue to expect earnings will be down between $40 million and $60 million for the year, albeit probably closer to the $60 million sitting here today. And we expect to see earnings of this segment improve as we progress through the year.","I'll finish up the segment review with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on slide 11. During the first quarter, we did a great job of holding on to value. Sales revenue increased due to the sales of acquired businesses, partially offset by lower selling prices, particularly for olefin-based intermediates. Operating earnings increased due to improved spreads and earnings from acquired businesses, partially offset by propane hedges.","Looking at the full year, we have a number of factors impacting results. We expect to continue to benefit from strong volume growth and earnings in the acquired businesses. Sales volume for the heritage Eastman business is expected to be about flat as solid end market demand growth is being offset by increasing internal consumption of intermediates for both backward integration with Taminco businesses and growth in heritage Eastman businesses, and lower polymer intermediates volumes. And we are projecting lower propylene and ethylene prices for the remainder of the year, as experienced in April, and expect lower prices to continue for the rest of the year, negatively impacting olefin margins.","We also expect the impact of propane hedges to be more significant for this segment for the balance of the year as the cost of the hedge flows through inventories. We, therefore, expect overall earnings in 2015 to be lower than 2014 earnings.","On slide 12, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with the first quarter operating cash flow of $91 million in which is typically our seasonally lowest quarter.","Net earnings were solid and our normal beginning-of-the-year working capital build was tempered somewhat by lower raw material and energy costs. Free cash flow was negative $34 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $125 million, and we are on track for full-year capital expenditures of between $700 million and $725 million. And our first quarter dividend was $60 million.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate will be between 26% and 27% reflecting the continued benefits of our improved business operations. We continue to do what we can to be at the lower end of that range.","As a whole, I am pleased with the earnings and cash flow performance to start the year. There's good things happening at Eastman Chemical, and I thank everyone that's involved in making it happen. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Curt. I'll close on slide 13 with comments on our full year 2015 outlook, and I'm quite happy to say that our outlook has improved due to the actions we have taken. We continue to have strong growth drivers across the company. This starts with our portfolio of specialty businesses that leverage our world-class technology platforms. These specialty businesses are positioned to grow this year.","We will benefit from growth in a diverse set of end markets, including transportation, building and construction, consumables and food, feed and ag. We also expect high growth from some of our most innovative high-margin specialty growth programs improving our mix. We will benefit from low oil in many of our specialty and special position businesses where pricing is more determined on the functionality and value to customers, and you can see that in our first quarter results. And we expect it will continue for the remainder of the year. We've done an excellent job in managing costs over the years, and I expect this to continue.","And as I've mentioned, we expect significant accretion from the businesses we acquired in 2014. We're all about focus and execution this year and driving value for organic growth and creating value through the integration of our highly accretive acquisitions. Of course, we also have some short-term headwinds and uncertainties in the global economy, volatile oil and the strengthening dollar.","Given our excellent start to the year, expectations for solid growth in our specialty businesses, earnings from the recently acquired businesses and continued cost discipline, we are now well positioned to deliver our sixth consecutive year of earnings growth in 2015, something only a very small percentage of S&P 500 companies have been able to do in the last 10 years.","Lastly, these solid earnings are translating to strong free cash flow generation. We now expect to generate approximately $900 million of free cash flow, at the top end of the guidance we gave you in January, which represents a free cash flow yield of approximately 8%. This puts us in a great position to continue to pay a strong dividend, invest in growth through capital expenditures and achieve the appropriate level of deleveraging. I'm very excited about our performance so far this year, our expectations for the full year and for what we can deliver over the coming years.","With that, I'll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President, Investor Relations","All right. Thanks, Mark. We have a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. So, I ask everybody that is on the line to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.","With that, Mara, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Riddle. And our first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Mark very strong earnings in SFI. Can you help us think about the first, how much did the spread contribute in Q1 versus Q4? And thinking about Q2 versus Q1, how much will this spread hurt you sequentially in Q2 versus Q1?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David. Certainly spread was a factor in the growth in Q1 relative to Q4. As Curt mentioned, we saw good discipline in holding on to prices as raw materials came down and the inventory turns are quite fast in that business and we were able to sort of improve our spread and as also Curt mentioned that the hedge, which predominantly goes into SFI, flows through COGS. You don't see much of that hit in the first quarter as that will increase into the second quarter and the hedge will really be the big driver in compressing some of the margins on first quarter to second quarter.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. If I could add, Mark, on top of that. So, as I mentioned in SFI, you are seeing that margin compression in April that that will be a good \u2013 that will be felt mostly in this segment plus that impact of the hedges. And quite honestly, if I think about just the shaping of the year as well, that's going to impact the kind of the quarters as they progress a little differently than what you've seen in the past. So, I think our full year is going to be more balanced, first half of the year, second half of the year. And second quarter is really going to be probably one of the more challenging quarters we have on a year-over-year comparable basis in part due to that SFI factor we discussed as well as the timing of tow demand.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Very helpful. And just on Fibers, Mark. When do you think the destocking will end? And do you think we'll see normalized demand at any point during the back half of the year? And what is that normalized demand in your view?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So, we do certainly think that destocking will abate in the first half of the year and things will improve in the second half. And the way I think about this, Dave, is primary demand story hasn't changed at all, really, in the last 12 months. So, what we see is, outside of China, demand for cigarettes is trending as it always has. In China, the primary demand is expected to be flat to slightly up, but let's call it flattish.","So, the primary demand situation is unchanged. What's really going on this year is, what's the story in tow demand, and there are really three components of that. The first is, the Chinese National Tobacco Company has added capacity in joint ventures with us last year and Daicel this year. And that removes a certain amount of demand available to the tow suppliers because if you're backward integrated, you're going to run your assets full.","So, there's a certain chunk of market that just leaves the market. Then the rest of it is a destocking story and it's two different stories. So, in China, CNTC produces cigarettes and collects tax revenue at the production level. And over 2013, 2014, they got ahead of themselves in production relative to primary demand and built up more inventory than they needed. And they finally took actions to sort of correct that inventory, which is what you're seeing in the first half of this year. And they continue to tell us that that should clear itself the first half of the year, and that's all that they were able to go on, but it makes sense.","With the multinationals, they also are doing some destocking around the globe for a different reason. Capacity utilization was incredibly tight in the 2010 to 2013 timeframe. And so, they were concerned about making sure they had safety stock in place because they never want to run out of filter tow because it's a very small percentage of their total cost. And so, they were carrying excess inventory. As the Chinese added capacity, that made the capacity utilization a little bit looser. They felt less at risk at that. And there was also a significant large customer changing out their product line and then destocking in the first half of the year and restocking for their new product line in the second half of the year.","So, all of that combines to make the destocking story make sense to us. I would also note that with all of our large customers, we have annual contracts on both price and volume. And they generally honor those contracts, and that also would confirm a recovering demand in the back half the year.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We move now to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Mark. You've talked about demand growth in tires. That seems like a change in tone from your last quarter especially in Europe. So, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the tire demand globally?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Tire demand globally is very moderate in its growth rate if you look at what our customers like Michelin and others are saying in the marketplace. But there's really two stories inside that. Europe and North America tire growth is actually quite solid and getting better year-over-year. The issue is China. And the Chinese are struggling through two things and reducing tire production right now to destock their situation because the tariffs in the U.S. have pushed the sales back out of the U.S. towards China or other markets.","And they've massively overbuilt higher production capacity in China, and the economy is clearly slowing down, especially commercial activity in China where we're leveraged with Crystex. And that's resulted in some decline in demand there in the first quarter. But we have seen a strong improvement in demand going into the second quarter from the first. But overall, I'd say the tire market is going to have very modest growth globally when you add it all together.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And then in SFI, as propylene prices came down, can you talk about what you're seeing in the (26:10) pricing in the (26:12)? And you also, you talked about \u2013 in earlier question, you talked about propane to propylene spread, sort of hinted at that. Can you talk about propylene to delivery spread? Thank you.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. On the market price situation, what we see is \u2013 we saw a fairly large drop in propylene prices in April. And the more commoditized products that we have are going to follow that down. The specialties are going to hold on to value as best as they can with that change in the marketplace conditions. And I think that's all playing out in the way you would expect. Fortunately, commodities are a very small percentage of our total earnings portfolio. But it's the dynamic that's going on right now. I'm going to let Curt answer the olefins spread hedge question.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. And maybe the best way to think about this, P.J., let me just kind of give update on that $0.40 to $0.60 impact we talked about on olefins. And so, it's important when we talk about producing versus buying olefins, let me highlight a couple of things. First, the make-up of our olefin needs are changing as we grow. So, for example, now we produce about 55% of the propylene we need, and we now purchase the rest. So, that's impacting some of this. The benefits of producing versus purchasing olefins, we do expect to be volatile. And you see that as it goes through this April. And so, as we see these decline in ethylene and propylene prices. So, that's going to be a challenge, a little bit more of a challenge than we originally anticipated.","On our propane hedges we put in place last year, that's an additional headwind for us where we've kind of hedged about two-thirds of our propane purchases in 2015 and just over 50% in 2016. So, when I think about the propane hedges themselves, there has been no material change in the expected impact of these hedges on the 2015 results. So, a lot of it is just, right now, coming down to those cracking spreads.","Finally, we have, though, taken a variety of actions trying to mitigate these margin pressures including improved operations and a shift to a more advantaged feedstock mix. I think is probably around 70% propane today. So, putting it all together with the current market conditions, we're probably now at the high end of that $0.40 to $0.60 range we provided early in the year.","As a reminder, though, that impact does not include the impact of pricings \u2013 prices of our derivatives or changes in other raw materials, and so we try to factor those into our overall corporate guidance. But again, the business teams are doing a great job trying to hold on to value, and you see that being done in our first quarter results.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Operator","We move now to Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Could you just \u2013 you said tow was going to be probably at the low end of your operating profit forecast for the year in terms of the impact year-over-year. Why is that? Is that just because the volume is going to come in a little worse than you thought or was there a difference on price or what's the dynamic?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Vince. Yeah. There are two parts of it, both volume-related. So, the \u2013 as the final contract settled, there was a slight drop in tow demand when we added it all together. The other part was, we sell acetyl intermediates into our joint venture with Solvay for producing product. And they also reduced their demand need on that joint venture, so we had lower acetyl intermediate sales.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And on Adhesives & Plasticizers, it seems like some of the issues that you were having last year have settled out. So, what's the update there?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Adhesives & Plasticizer is a great story, improvement in the industry structure. What's happened in Adhesives is the volumes have continued in the market to grow quite solidly in hygiene, hot melt adhesive packaging, so strong growth in the market. As we continue to move to a lighter feedstock slates, the amount of raw materials available for hydrocarbon resins has become more limited and you've got a tightening market situation that's given us a lot of value and pricing power in the marketplace.","I would also note that the rosin question that we've discussed in the past is also quite stable. Prices in rosins are low and availability is sort of typical this year and the low prices of rosins this year would suggest that those won't significantly increase into next year either. So, we see a nice stable situation there in adhesives.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","We move next to Frank Mitsch, Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning and nice start to the year. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments Curt made on the Taminco acquisition. I think when you were talking about the functional amines in the ag business, you saw sequential improvement. Now of course, we'd expect sequential improvement in Q2, but were you also referring to Q1? Did you see sequential improvement in that business there?","And also just in general, it sounded to me that the tone was a bit more positive on Taminco on this call and if you could talk about what you're seeing now that you've owned it for a little bit longer, that'd be great.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We view Taminco as a great acquisition, great add to the portfolio, very much on track in delivering the results and doing a great job in performing, including finding ways to offset their own FX headwinds.","On the specific ag question, Frank, the ag demand on a year-over-year basis, is the way I'd think about it, came off a bit when it comes to the functional amines going into sort of the row crop herbicides, consistent with what you might expect in the marketplace. But we've seen strong indications and improvements of volume sequentially from the first quarter into the second quarter.","In particular, the customers we serve, they're doing a bit better this year than last year. We also saw burn-downs start this year which did not occur last year, so some additional demand as a result of that. As we all know, the winter ag season last year was a pretty tough comp. So, things are going really well there on the row crop.","I'd also remind everyone that the ag business related to row crops is only about 10% of the total revenue of Taminco. So, while we pay attention to it, it's not a significant part of the portfolio. One of the great things about Taminco, like Eastman, is it has a very diverse set of end markets. And then the other part is crop protection is doing better than expected. The nice thing about perishable products is you can't build up inventory and those crop products are having a good demand this year.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great because I do know that some of the other crop protection chemical companies are not as optimistic on the early part of the year here, so that's good to hear from your perspective. And in terms of the $900 million of free cash flow, can you talk about your priorities for that money?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. All right. Capital allocation is always a critical and important debate we have among ourselves with our board, and we are committed to the approach we've always taken. So, when I think about capital allocation, the priority starts with great, attractive organic growth opportunities that are important in leveraging our world-scale platforms and allow us grow and sustain the performance of those platforms. So, organic is always going to take a priority, assuming they have attractive returns.","We're fortunate that our operating cash flow is so strong that we can meet those needs and still have quite a bit of free cash flow. We have one of the best yields in the industry. So, there is a fair question which is, what do you do with all that free cash flow. And we'll continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach to that in looking at both acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders and making sure we do which creates the most value for our shareholders at that time from a long-term value creation point of view.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","If I could, Frank, if you look at our 2015, nothing has changed in our commitment though we also have to take a fair bit of that free cash flow and complete the deleveraging we've committed to.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. My comments were long term.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. So, debt paydown is probably the near-term priority and then Curt's comments are more longer term.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Other way around. So Curt just made the short term comment about delevering and I made the long term comment there \u2013 the long-term capital allocation philosophy.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning. Mark, I was wondering if you could provide an update on Crystex. I think you were planning to take some capacity offline in France, expand in Malaysia and retrofit technology at some sites. Can you update us on where you stand in that evolution?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Kevin. We're very much on track with our Crystex strategy, continue to be very excited about this new technology we developed. As you mentioned, we shut the S\u00e8te business down last year to take out some fixed cost. And the reason we could do that is we have done such a great job in working with the Crystex manufacturing guys combined with our operational experts at our large integrated sites, we found ways to improve the performance of the existing plants, so that out of six plants, we're producing much more than we ever could in seven plants. And that's why we could shut S\u00e8te down, which is just a great operational synergy story.","The new technology will be both retrofits which we've already started in our Germany plant. And then, of course, we're gearing up to start construction of our Kuantan plant to double capacity in that site. So, the overall Crystex story is moving along quite nicely.","I'd also mention that while the overall market is not growing that fast in tires, we're having great success with some of our new growth products that we're selling into tires and growing those quite fast. So, our tackifying resins, their performance added for traction are seeing significant growth this year over last year. So, the overall portfolio has ways to grow beyond just the primary end market.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And a second question, if I may. How would you describe activity or lack thereof as it relates to your efforts to monetize crackers at Longview? And then, second piece, if I may, do you have any propane hedges in place for 2017?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Kevin, this is Curt. On the \u2013 nothing new to report on our efforts around our olefins in Texas. We will continue to evaluate options with excess ethylene and\/or our crackers in normal course.","On the propane, we do have some hedges going into 2017, but they're moderate compared to what I described in 2015 and 2016.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll move now to James Sheehan at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Could you please elaborate on some of the improving business trends that you're seeing in Europe?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. The businesses are actually improving quite nicely in Europe, and the overall economy is obviously sluggish but improving from a GDP point of view. But in markets like transportation, we're seeing nice recovery in volumes. Even in building and construction, there's some improvements that we're starting to see. So, Europe is expected to be sort of a nice story for us this year.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And a follow-up on your comments on the tire market, could you just differentiate between what you're seeing on the passenger side versus truck tires?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Passenger tires are doing sort of reasonably well across the globe. Truck tires are doing well in North America, slow in Europe and challenged in China at the moment because of the economic deceleration going on in China. That's a short-term comment, why they're destocking, we expect that to sort of improve as we go into the year.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move now to John Roberts, UBS.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. You mentioned you don't have any propane hedging beyond next year. What's the go-forward strategy around propane? Do you have any opinion on whether it's going to be more volatile, less volatile and how do you intend to manage that?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","From a hedging point of view, we're continuing to review our hedging strategy and decide what's the most appropriate thing to do. Obviously, there's a tremendous amount of volatility today in the market around where oil is going to go and the associated raw materials from oil. So, we're making sure that we think about it carefully and step forward carefully.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","It doesn't sound like you have a strategy.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, we have a strategy of making sure that we protect our volatility in our earnings, but we're trying to understand what the structural implications are to the change in the marketplaces because clearly, no one saw oil going from $100 to $50, including us. And when that kind of structural change happens in the marketplace, it's appropriate to step back and rethink your strategy and make sure what you're doing is appropriate.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And is the dispute with Westlake completely resolved at this point?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","This is Curt. There's nothing new to update on Westlake.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","But there was a lingering piece there. So, that's unresolved still?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I have nothing new to report.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. When you think about Specialty Fluids & Intermediates, you did the operating income of $102 million versus $64 million last year. Is the improvement primarily all Taminco, and if I did the math, that would suggest that, given the sales and margins really expanded versus last year, and I'm just curious if that math works and how much of the improvement would have been sort of the pricing power over raw materials?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, again, the benefit is partially the acquisitions. If you recall, we said Taminco, if you think about specialty amines and crop protection going to additives & Functional Products, and the functional amines going to SFI, it was about 75% going to AFP, 25% going to SFI. So, that gives you some way to think about the order of magnitude for the Taminco.","And, yes, as Mark mentioned, the margins did expand in the first quarter, but as we talked about, we think that margin expansion is going to come off in the second quarter for SFI, in part because of the decline in propylene and ethylene margins and in part because of the flow of the hedge.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, Mark, I think you described AFP to be up strong, Adhesives to be up strong, Advanced Materials to be up strong, and amino fibers and your thoughts on Specialty Fluids & Intermediates. And given that the first quarter EPS growth was double digits, is that the type of growth you could do every quarter? Is there a little bit of kind of changes because of the hedges and I just want better understand kind of the growth potential as the quarters unfold this year for EPS growth.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, great question. I've been waiting for it. Yeah. We see a great opportunity for us to continue delivering earnings growth this year over last year as well as into 2016. And I think the first quarter is great evidence about the quality of our specialty portfolio and the transitions we've been making to be more of a specialty company. When you look at the earnings performance in the first quarter, it was really quite good in our specialty businesses, we held on to value and we're quite disciplined in how we hold on to value in those businesses and we're able to offset the vast majority of the headwinds we had in currency and hedging. And we did it without volume.","And there is an important point in that which is, we were being disciplined, and as a result, customers held off on ordering, waiting for the best price. And then we saw, when we got those all negotiated, we saw price \u2013 volumes recover in the \u2013 Mark's timeframe into April.","It's also important to note when you think about that story that the COGS flow-through on specialty businesses is quite slow. Three to six months versus commodities being in that sort of shorter, one to two month range. And therefore, when you really look at the story of the specialty businesses in the first quarter, it's quite good.","So, as we go from that into the rest of the year, what we see is continued strong improvement in volumes in those specialty businesses as we go into the first quarter \u2013 I mean, sorry \u2013 into the second quarter and we expect volume growth to continue through the year.","In addition to those end markets delivering volume growth, we also expect high growth of these high-margin products that we have that are selling especially in Advanced Materials that are giving us quite an earnings uplift within that volume growth. So, we feel good about that. But, of course, you've always got some of the offsets we've mentioned, the currency strengthened, the propylene and ethylene prices are lower today than what we expected in January. And so, there's a netting effect of all that.","But if you took current market conditions that we have today, associated with oil, currency, et cetera, and looked forward, you would \u2013 we feel very confident that we're going to deliver earnings growth year-over-year. And as I think about it, you know, this is not a 2015 story. It's a 2016 story, too.","So, you've got all these strong growth drivers that continue into 2016. You've got oil, hopefully one day, showing up as an economic stimulus further improving demand, and then you've got the headwinds that we have this year that are more short-term headwinds when you think about 2016 and not likely to repeat. So, hedge starts coming off, oil prices likely to be higher, Fibers demand is stable to better next year, all give us additional room for earnings growth year-over-year.","And then, of course, I think that all of that is much stronger than some margins this year that we captured, in particular on the first quarter, that would be difficult to repeat next year with prices falling relative to rosins, a small part of our portfolio that's commodity. So, I think our overall earnings story is very much intact on a year-over-year basis for 2015 as well as 2016.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And now, we go to Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs.","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Just had a question within the Adhesives & Plasticizers business. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate a little bit more on kind of the lower selling prices that you're seeing in plasticizers. It seems like maybe that piece of the business overwhelmed a little bit of the positive you're getting from the adhesives side. I was hoping you could provide a little more color there.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. It's a story related to oil. So, raw material prices dropped dramatically associated with oil and plasticizers like other olefins. And so what you're seeing is prices come down with those raw materials in the plasticizers side of that business.","There's also continued competitive pressure in that business. As Asians have been trying to reposition towards North America, Europe is obviously not attractive for them on a relative currency basis for some of them as well as looking to place that product because economic growth in China has not been very good.","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And to elaborate on that economic growth in China, kind of just based on what you're seeing in your businesses, do you expect the kind of deceleration we've seen in the early part of the year to accelerate from where we are, meaning the pace of the slowdown to speed up so to speak for the remainder of the year?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That would be the big question for the world about what is China economy going to do. My personal view is they're not growing at 7% GDP, not close to it, and there are certainly lots of articles out there right now talking about that.","How it accelerates or decelerates from where it is today is a question beyond my pay grade. But I do think that the important part for us is, our volume story is actually quite strong in plasticizers. While we've had some headwinds on margin which will start to abate this year, the volume story about our non-phthalates is great. We are seeing very strong growth in non-phthalates. We're primarily focused on selling these products in North America where we have the best netback and we recently had another factor come in to drive non-phthalate change, where Home Depot has now told all of its suppliers that it doesn't want phthalates in its flooring. So, the pressure to sort of switch to non-phthalates just keeps on increasing.","So, we feel good about this business long term. It's going to have very strong growth. There is lots of addressable market left to penetrate in the switch from phthalate to non-phthalate. We just need to get this margin pressure situation to clear and then that will then turn into earnings growth.","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We go now to Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. In your earlier remarks, I think you said that your propane was hedged by 50% in 2016. My recollection was that in the old days, it was maybe hedged to 90%. So, did you alter your hedged positions or were there various steps that you've taken to change your exposure or your purchases in propane for next year?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, Jeff, this is Curt. A couple of perspectives. First of all, there's been no change to our propane hedging program as we defined it last year. So, you know we moved from that sort of a short-term hedging program to a multiyear hedging program. So, there's been no change there. We had talked in the past about being substantially hedged in 2015 and 2016. I just wanted to provide some more clarity for people who don't understand what that order of magnitude is. So, it was about two-thirds in 2015 and just over half in 2016.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But, Jeff, part of that story is we've taken actions to improve our total production rate of olefins. So, we're improving the quality of how we're running our crackers. We've shifted our mix towards more propane from ethane because propane, currently, is quite advantaged, as you know. So, there are some actions we've taken. But we also were concerned that people were over interpreting our substantial comment, I want to make sure people knew where our hedge positions were.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then for my follow-up, I remember that Taminco had a aircraft de-icing business that was quite depressed last year because of good weather. And so, I would imagine that that might have helped the Taminco earnings overall, and there are some synergies. Order of magnitude, is Taminco EBITDA up $15 million or $20 million or $12 million? Can you size it?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","This is Curt, Jeff. First of all, on your de-icing, the de-icing was up year-over-year. That was a contributing factor. There are some offsets to it within a diversified portfolio have like within our specialty amines business, and that's the formic acid aspect of it there. On the EBITDA for Taminco, I'd characterize it \u2013 as we look at it right now, I think if you take all the factors, the EBITDA of Taminco will be equal or slightly above where they were last year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff...","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, that includes the FX effect, too.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Oh, an FX effect, too. Okay. Great.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","They're facing that FX headwind. So, they're helping offset some of that in that comment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander at Jefferies.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. This is Dan Rizzo, in for Laurence. Just in regards to the acetate tow, you say the destocking is going to continue through the second half of the year, I mean, until the end of \u2013 until next \u2013 the second half of this year. Do you mean it's going to spike in this quarter or is it like moderating as you go forward or is it \u2013 just sequentially from the first quarter to the second, is it kind of the same, or is it getting better or worse and then getting better? Just a little more color.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","If I could, let me just clarify. I think you're referring","to my comment about second quarter being more of a challenge year-over-year, and that's a truly \u2013 part of the factor is this tow demand on a year-over-year comparison basis.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, as you think about overall tow demand, just so we're clear, the destocking is occurring in the first half of the year. We expect recovery in demand in the second half of the year as that destocking abates.","In regards to the second quarter versus the first quarter, I would describe the volume as similar to maybe a little bit better on a sequential basis from first quarter to second quarter.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just given all the moves you made in the past year, so I mean what's the M&A pipeline look like? Are you guys kind of done for a while or do you still see a lot of opportunities out there?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right now, we are very much focused on execution. We have done some great acquisitions, four of them last year. We've got a tremendous portfolio of organic growth projects and we're all about delivering results right now and focusing on how we do all of that incredibly well. That is and will continue to be our priority.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Thank you, guys.","Operator","We go now to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. How would you characterize industry-wide operating rates in filter tow maybe currently and also after capacity cuts that you're undergoing and that your competitor has announced? And also could you comment on Eastman-specific operating rates in filter tow?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll comment on the industry side. What we are seeing, is as I mentioned, we added some capacity and Daicel is adding some capacity with CNTC. And fortunately, what we're also seeing is that the three out of four tow suppliers in this industry are also rationalizing capacity right now that is high cost and not necessary, and so we've taken our working Workington site down. You've seen announcements from Celanese and Solvay about taking some capacity out.","When you add that all together and you look at different demand scenarios for 2016, it would imply industry utilization rates in the low 90%s range, which is a nice stable place to be and, importantly, should indicate ability for us to maintain stable margins just like we've already done this year, maintaining stable margins in the face of this destocking.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And also, could you comment on your foreign exchange hedges? What is the magnitude of any potential benefit that you expect this year, and also how could this progress into 2016? Thank you.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, if you think about \u2013 this is Curt \u2013 the impact of the exchanges, the strength in the dollar and for us it's specifically the euro, we've talked about that change being a $0.25 to $0.30 headwind per share. That's reflecting net of some of the hedges we have in place. We've hedged roughly half of our currency. As you see, currency sitting there today around $1.10, $1.11, that impact is going to be a little greater than that $0.25 to $0.30, and that's what we're expecting in our outlook. I'd say, similarly, we have a hedge going into next year that will help mitigate that, just not to the same magnitude of 50% we had this year.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our final question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. You've spoken a lot about the specialty aspect of your portfolio holding price and capturing value. But your year-over-year price comparisons were down 6%. So, would you be able to parse the price realizations you had on the specialty and special position versus commodity?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I'll take part of this question, and I wouldn't be surprised if Curt piles in. So, first of all, when you look at the overall price performance of our company compared to our diversified peers, we actually did a great job of holding price. And I think that's a good proxy for the quality of our portfolio. But no matter what you are, specialty or commodity, raw material prices came down considerably.","And some of our pricing, especially in our core copolyesters was going to go follow raw materials downward to some extent. And that's the price effect that we're feeling \u2013 so \u2013 in Advanced Materials, and the same logic would apply to the olefin products in AFP and the plasticizers and in A&P. But the spreads did not compress. And so, I think that that portfolio, in fact, expanded in most cases. But there's a limit, you have to treat your customers with respect to make sure you pass on value to them too when the raw materials come down","So, I think that we did a nice job of finding appropriate balance with our customers for the value that we create for them, and we will continue to do so going forward. So, it's also important to keep in mind that the raw material flow through issue being three to six months on the specialty. So, when you look at the margins, you don't have that rapid flow through that you saw in SFI.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And this is Curt. Just as you make your evaluation analysis, you can see some of that in the pricing changes. So, you look at Additives & Functional Products, Adhesives & Plasticizers, Advanced Materials, you see their prices only coming down 2% to 5% versus 16% in SFI. So, that's just some of the factors that Mark described.","I'd also remind people as they evaluate Additives & Functional Products and SFI, keep in mind as we bring the Taminco businesses into those, that does have a weighting effect on the operating margins for those businesses. So, for Additives & Functional Products, they'll have a slightly lower operating margin now just because of the mix of Taminco versus the heritage Eastman businesses.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. That's really helpful. And then, would you have an estimate \u2013 obviously, you had a lot of new assets in the portfolio year-over-year. Would you have an estimate of the total accretion from all these new businesses?","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I would say, right now, it's been factored in our guidance. We look at all the moving parts, and so from \u2013 as it relates to organic growth, we factor that into that aspect. From the acquisition standpoint, we talked about greater than $0.35 accretion this year and greater than $0.60 accretion next year.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For Taminco.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Taminco.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, when you add them altogether, it's more like $0.50.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. Sorry, I meant for this quarter.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For the quarter? We're not breaking that out by quarter.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Taminco is...","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Its earnings profile is pretty constant during the course of the year. So, that's how I would think about it.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President, Investor Relations","I mean, the way you think about it, Nils, is they're on track on a corporate basis for that $0.50 or greater than $0.50 accretion on an annual basis. So, just think of it that way, we're on track with that accretion expectation.","Curtis E. Espeland - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And then as you think about the benefits of the synergies, that's probably weighted more towards the second half of the year.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. Thanks for the help.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Riddle, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yeah.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Eastman Chemical Company First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, www.eastman.com.","We'll now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle from Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle - Eastman Chemical Co.","All right. Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's first quarter 2017 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for 2016 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for first quarter of 2017.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude the effect of non-core items. In addition, the adjusted first quarter 2017 earnings per share is calculated within adjusted tax rate that is forecasted for the full year. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including the description of the adjusted items are available in the first quarter 2017 financial results news release, which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projection of future earnings also exclude any non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items and assume that the adjusted tax rate for first quarter 2017 will be the actual tax rate for the projected periods.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Good day, everyone. I'll start on slide 3. We're off to a great start to the year with first quarter results that were consistent with our expectations. Our results demonstrate the strength of our specialty portfolio with strong volume growth in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products.","We continue to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high margins, specialty product lines, through innovation and market development, a key component of our winning strategy to transform towards the specialty portfolio. As I said before, we are creating our own growth, through innovation, leadership and specialty markets. We are seeing excellent progress in converting our top innovation programs into commercial orders across AM and AFP, and are on track to exceed our business close target of $200 million. In a few moments, I'll share examples of just a few of the ways we're winning with customers through innovation.","Moving next to the cost management front, we remain well on track with our corporate cost reduction efforts, without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives. Our cash flow in the quarter was consistent with our expectations and we remain on track to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2017, enabling an increasing dividend, continued deleveraging and accelerating the rate of our share repurchases.","Beyond these great results, we've also been the recipient of numerous awards over the past several months, which highlight many of the qualities of our stakeholders, who come to expect from Eastman. We were named one of the World's Most Ethical Company for the fourth consecutive year by Ethisphere for outstanding corporate ethics and corporate responsibility, characteristics highly valued by our employees, our shareholders, our communities and our customers. We also earned the 2017 Military Friendly Employer designation by Victory Media, which recognizes exceptional hiring programs for transitioning service members, veterans and spouses.","Finally, we were recognized by the EPA as ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year, becoming the only chemical company who received this recognition consecutively for six years, a win for both the environment and our cost structure.","Our first quarter result and the continued recognition we are receiving are a direct result of the great work being done by Eastman employees around the world. And I want to thank them for their outstanding contributions. These results also demonstrate that we can execute on the things we can control from cost reductions to returning cash to our stockholders, to innovating throughout our enterprise.","Moving on to slide 4, this year marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of our Tritan copolyester, which has been a tremendous success over the past decade, and continues to have significant growth potential moving forward. Hundreds of Eastman team members were integral to the success of Tritan, and we're honored by the American Chemistry Society with the Heroes of Chemistry Award. You can see on the slide the spectrum of brands and consumer medical products that use Tritan, which has now established as the material of choice in the markets we serve. Tritan is currently used by hundreds of brand names globally, and there are over 25,000 products sold on Amazon today with Tritan in them.","Since, Tritan debuted in 2007, it has grown to what is approaching $300 million of annual revenue, the fastest adoption of any polymer in this space. Even with the tremendous success to-date, we still have only penetrated small portion of the total addressable market, particularly as we're still early in the adoption in Europe and Asia. And we're introducing a broader range of products and seen convincing early growth in new markets such as medical. To support this growth, we are currently in the process of doubling our Tritan capacity in Kingsport. Tritan is indicative of the innovation of market development capabilities that Eastman has established over many years. And we expect Tritan will be an important contributor to our growth and success going forward.","On slide 5, we continue to upgrade the quality of our product mix by increasing revenue high margin specialty products through innovation and market development. These initiatives are accelerating as more customers validate our innovative differentiated products, which is driving growth today and into the future. One innovation success is within our paint protection films platform in the Advanced Materials segment. As we leverage the emerging middle income class trend, we are seeing a growing demand for materials that meet consumers' needs for protecting their cars from damage caused by rocks, salt, insects, and other road debris. Eastman is a global leader in paint protection films that deliver high-glass virtually invisible shield with self-healing properties that consumers love.","We recently launched our latest generation of paint protection film and have seen an overwhelming positive response from the market. This is a great example of synergy from the Commonwealth acquisition, combining leading edge paint protection technology with our strong market connect and application development capability. Our paint protection films is on track to deliver over 20% revenue growth this year with margins above the corporate average.","Another innovation success is the commercial launch of our Enhanz feed additive in the Additives & Functional Products segment. As poultry farms move away from the use of antibiotics, there is a growing need to optimize food to feed conversion yield. Eastman Enhanz feed additive reduces feed cost, while improving feed utilization efficiency. We realized double-digit volume growth in the first quarter and expect strong volume growth on a full year basis. I am excited to see the latest innovation in our animal nutrition portfolio coming to market. This success also shows how our growth portfolio has broaden through our Taminco acquisition.","Next, I'll provide an update regarding our next-generation Crystex initiative. This new technology improves our cost position by better than 20%, while also creating a new product slate with improved performance attributes. Performance benefits of this new technology help our customers maximize the productivity of their operations, enable us to leap ahead of our competition. We have now validated the value proposition of our next generation Crystex through multiple customer engagements. This success supports our investment in Kuantan, Malaysia, where we continues to deploy this technology, and build the world's largest and lowest cost insoluble sulfur facility in the world.","We committed to innovation and market development adding 1% to 2% on a compounded basis to drive corporate revenue growth. We met that commitment last year, and you can see with these examples, we are on track to exceed that commitment in 2017.","With that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our first quarter corporate results on slide 6. Sales revenue grew, as increases in Additives & Functional Products, Advanced Materials and Chemical Intermediates more than offset a decline in Fibers.","We did a nice job of driving the volume growth in our more specialty product lines. If you exclude, for example, Fibers, our volume growth was over 6% for the quarter. And we were able to raise prices in our Chemical Intermediates segment to offset high raw material and energy costs.","As a company, selling prices for the quarter were flat year-over-year and sequentially increased over 1%. Operating earnings declined slightly as strong performance in Advanced Materials and Chemical Intermediates was more than offset by a decline in Fibers. Overall, earnings per share increased year-over-year by 7%, reflecting solid operating earnings, and a benefit of other actions taken to deliver growth. These positive results reflected \u2013 reflect our continued focus on controlling the things we can control and taking actions to deliver earnings per share growth in what remains an uncertain global business environment.","Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on slide 7, which delivered another impressive quarter driven by our innovation platforms. Sales revenue increased due to strong sales volume growth and improved product mix of premium products, including double-digit volume gains in Eastman Tritan copolyester, and Saflex acoustic interlayers.","Earnings increased primarily due to strong sales volume growth, improved product mix of premium products and fixed cost leverage, partially offset by higher raw material energy costs and slightly lower selling prices. The operating margin in the quarter increased more than 70 basis points year-over-year to 19%, demonstrating the strength of this business in an environment of increasing raw materials and unfavorable currency. Overall, outstanding first quarter results, which continues Advanced Materials track record of success.","Looking at the full year, we continue to expect strong results for Advanced Materials as we make further progress in our strategy for this business of driving volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage.","Now to Additives & Functional Products on slide 8. Revenue increased due to sales volume across the segment, driven by innovation and market development initiatives, partially offset by slightly lower selling prices and unfavorable currency. The lower selling prices reflect the continued impact of lower raw material prices from last year as selling prices in this segment generally lag changes in raw material prices by about three months to six months.","Sequentially, from fourth quarter to first quarter, prices increased slightly. Operating earnings increased slightly as higher sales volume was mostly offset by higher raw material and energy costs, lower selling prices and unfavorable currency.","Looking at full year 2017, we continue to expect mid-single digit sales volume growth, which would be about double-end market growth, reflecting innovation and market development initiatives such as fluid solar projects, higher resins and Aerafin polymers or adhesives. We also expect to increase sequentially in second quarter and have already achieved increases in many products. However, we still need to manage through the spike in raw materials that occurred in the first quarter with higher costs still needing to flow through the inventory. All-in, Additives & Functional Products remains well positioned to deliver solid results for the year.","Now the Chemical Intermediates on slide 9. Sales revenue in the first quarter increased primarily due to higher selling prices. The higher selling prices were attributed to higher raw material costs and improved competitive conditions. Operating earnings increased primarily due to higher selling prices that are keeping up with increase in raw material costs and the benefits of lower commodity hedge costs. Looking at the full-year 2017, we're doing a good job of recovering from a tough 2016 as we increase prices to offset higher raw material and energy costs, benefit from lower commodity hedge costs and reduced corporate costs, of which Chemical Intermediates receives the largest share.","I'll finish the segment review with Fibers on slide 10, where results were in line with our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices, particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow prices were primarily due to lower industry capacity utilization rates. Lower acetate tow volume was a result of reduced sales in China and customer share shifts. Regarding China, two items worth mentioning, first quarter of 2016 tow imports were at still 2015 import levels and we still expect reduced import levels for 2017 that we discussed back in January.","Outside of China, we were impacted by lost share at a few customers that we have now regained with others. This will result in lower tow volume in the first half of this year, as we will not see the full benefit of regaining lost share until the second half.","Operating earnings for the quarter declined year-over-year due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices, partially offset by lower operating costs, resulting from recent actions. Looking forward, we continue to anticipate earnings for this segment to be down approximately 25% for the year, this includes an expectation that acetate tow volume outside of China will be about flat for the full year. Probably also worth mentioning that with these steps less than 10% of the segment revenue will be impacted by total imports into China. We are taking all actions within our control to provide stability for this business moving forward, and strongly believe that Fibers will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman.","On slide 11, our transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for first quarter. First quarter operating cash flow was $52 million, in line with our normal seasonality of cash flow generation. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $133 million and we continue to expect our full-year capital expenditures will be approximately $575 million for the year. I remain very confident in our ability to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the year.","Looking at the balance sheet, we continue to expect a $350 million reduction in debt this year. Additionally, we remain committed to returning cash to the stockholders. In the first quarter, we returned $150 million through our first quarter dividend of $75 million and $75 million in share repurchases.","Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21%, we now expect our full-year tax rate to be between 20% and 22%, reflecting the continued benefits of an improved business operations and resulting impact on expected tax events.","Sitting here today, it feels 21% for the year, which would be in line with last year, and is reflected in our results for the first quarter. As a whole, I'm pleased with earnings and cash flow performance to start the year and look forward to the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Thanks, Curt. On slide 12, I'll discuss our outlook for 2017. We continue to benefit from our specialty businesses, which we expect would deliver mid-single digit volume growth for the rest of the year, which will be about double the growth rate of the underlying markets.","To deliver this, we're leveraging the investments we have made in our innovation and market development initiatives to drive growth in attractive end markets, which are being positively impacted by very attractive and disruptive macro trends.","We've also taken actions to aggressively reduce costs and we are benefiting from a reduction in commodity hedge costs. We've improved the quality of our balance sheet, reducing our interest costs, and we've also been able to neutralize an expected tax headwind, so that our effective tax rate this year will be similar to last year.","Finally, disciplined capital allocation continues to contribute to growth, including accelerating our share repurchases in 2017 compared to 2016. All of these actions are helping us to offset challenges we continue to face, including uncertain global GDP growth, a stronger dollar, more than normal raw material and energy price volatility and the challenges we face in Fibers.","Putting all this together, on an operational level, our performance remains in line with our previous expectations we outlined in January, and with the tax rate no longer expected to be a headwind, we expect EPS growth to improve to the top half of our previously communicated 8% to 12% range.","On slide 13, we have summary slide that we've shown you before and is even more applicable today. We have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses. We expect to deliver approximately 70% of our earnings from these high-quality specialty businesses, a true testament to the quality and transformation of our portfolio. We are continuing to create our own growth through accelerating our innovation and improving our product mix. We are committing using every lever we have in this uncertain environment, and we're returning our free \u2013 very strong free cash flow to our stockholders.","We're on track to return approximately $650 million to our shareholders this year. I remain confident that 2017 will be a strong year for Eastman with increasing earnings and record free cash flow. More importantly, I believe that we are building one of the world's leading specialty companies to deliver long-term sustainable growth.","Thanks for joining us this morning and I look forward to your questions.","Gregory A. Riddle - Eastman Chemical Co.","All right, thanks, Mark. We've got a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, Ron, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And thank you. And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Good morning.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Good morning, David.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Mark, just on the guidance, now that we're in the top half of the range, is the entire raise due to the lower tax rate, any change to the segments at all versus what you were thinking about back in late January?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","David, thanks for the question and we're really excited about being on track to deliver such attractive earnings growth for our shareholders and principally doing it through operating earnings, as we've sort of neutralized that tax headwind.","As you noted, we are looking at all the businesses and continue to see very strong earnings growth for our specialty businesses, both the AM and AFP, love the volume growth that we saw in the first quarter and expect continued volume growth, let's say volumes coming in a little bit better than expected, which has been fantastic, especially in these high-quality businesses.","Fibers is exactly in line with expectations, no surprises or changes there, but we've also seen raw materials sort of spike up a little bit more than we expected and we're making great progress in improving prices, but we've got to catch up to those raws.","So, when I net it all together, the operational outlook of everything feels pretty similar to where we were with a few sort of slight differences there and volume being better, raws being a little higher, but we feel great about that performance and think it's extremely attractive for us in this industry and these market conditions.","So, as you look at the guidance we gave, we banked the tax rate improvement in our guidance to the upper half of the range, but it's three months into the year. There is a lot of uncertainty about how the economy and these raws will play out. So, we'll just have to see how it goes from here.","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","And David, this is Curt. If I could also add, when we think about the shaping of the earnings for the year that has been pretty consistent with what we were thinking about in January. We've been talking about pricing catching up to higher raw materials, and we've talked about Fibers volumes increase in the back half of this year. The impact of lower hedge costs as they flow through the last three quarters of the year, as well as kind of our growth programs gained momentum through the year.","So, the other thing that I think has been consistent net-net as we kind of expect our earnings to be evenly split between the first half and second half of the year, it's maybe a little bit more weighted towards the second half of the year as we compare it to last year, but similar to Mark, I am very pleased with the business performance that remains on track, delivering the earnings growth we talked about and then the removal of the tax headwind.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just lastly, Curt and Mark, given the decline in propylene prices, can you discuss the impact on how that will affect your ability to get some price increases through in those downstream propylene derivative product lines?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Sure. First, I am very happy with how we've managed pricing in the first quarter where we had the ability to make price changes. As we've said, especially we had a lot of quarterly pricing or in some cases annual pricing, but Chemical Intermediates just did a fantastic job of raising prices and keeping up with raws in the first quarter and then of course we benefited with the heads rolling off.","As we go into the second quarter, it's important to keep in mind that even with the recent drop in propylene prices for one month, the propylene prices, the propane prices, the natural gas prices, the methanol prices are all exceptionally higher than they were a year-ago for Q2 and they were much-much higher in Q1. And we still have those costs flowing through our inventory from Q1 even in Chemical Intermediates, it's a 1 to 3 flow-through where specialties are 3 to 6. So we see absolutely no reason to be reducing prices in the second quarter. I am very happy that we've got prices up in AFP and in Advanced Materials, most of that's quarterly priced. So that should be pretty solid through the quarter. And even in Chemical Intermediates, I think the competitors as well as us have much higher costs and we're still in the process of trying to recover those. And so I don't see any reason that prices should come off. Of course, competitive dynamics can dictate other outcomes, but we expect that we've increased the prices in order to keep increasing prices as we go into the third quarter.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Good morning, thank you. If we turn to Chemical Intermediates, how sustainable is this level of performance for the rest of the year? And also could you address whether there are any changes in underlying supply demand in addition to pricing versus raw material spreads?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Well, I think that for the last question, there is obviously a lot of volatility in some of these raw material prices, where they've moved up a lot and some have come of a little bit lately, all of them which are still substantially higher than last year. So I think the pricing dynamics remain in place, where we \u2013 we're in the business of increasing prices, which is refreshing compared to the last two years, and I think healthy for the industry. So I think that, that will continue. You have to keep in mind for Chemical Intermediates, you've got the hedge starting to be a sequential headwind from first quarter to second quarter. But the hedge cost obviously is less than last year, but it's still a sequential headwind. So that will have an impact on CI earnings. But overall, I think the industry is pretty tight, and when it comes to lot of these market dynamics that are going on right now, some of it is supply driven, and so we'll have to see how that resolves itself and impacts market dynamics, as we move to the back half of the year.","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","And, Mark, if I just could clarify the lower hedge cost will be a benefit for CI somewhat partially in the first quarter and will be a benefit the rest of the year.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go to the next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning. I was wondering, in AM, if you guys could help maybe size the Tritan business, how big is that increase to the East base? And then, can you give us any granularity on individual product line, growth rates within that impressive 10%, were there any of that were meaningfully more or less than the 10%? Thanks.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Thanks, Bob. So, I'm talking about Advanced Materials. It's just a great story of innovation and success that we've been building for many years now and it's great to see us deliver earnings growth this year in the first quarter on top of 20% compounded growth in the last four years. And doing it in a way where we've done it through volume\/mix and improved actually margins in an increasing raw material environment with currency headwinds, I mean it's just a great demonstration of a business delivering organic growth.","And as you said, a big driver is Tritan, a huge success story especially in the first quarter. We had a lot of great wins last year and a number of customers filling their shelves with our polymer into their products, that drove very high growth in Tritan in the first quarter and we expect a very good strong growth for the rest of the year and maybe not quite as high as 1Q, but still very attractive.","Same thing with the acoustics and heads-up display interlayers, you've got double-digit volume growth, as we're growing in the windshields and moving to the side lamps and sunroofs of the car, so we're getting more real estate per car, getting into new models, and just seeing tremendous growth and we still have a lot of room for growth there. We're probably in the third inning of penetration in the automotive market. We've actually seeing good recovery in architectural in Europe, in particular, which is very attractive for us on the interlayers business.","So, rocking and rolling there with double-digit growth. Performance films, same story. We launched some very creative and successful channel strategies in China and North America, which are two largest markets for performance films. These are the tinted window films on cars. And seeing tremendous growth through the auto channel, the auto dealers in addition to the aftermarket stores, and now, really seeing tremendous success in this paint protection film. We had the best film that's been in the market when we bought Commonwealth, and now we've developed a new product that is even better and getting tremendous success. So we really have innovation basically everywhere, across this portfolio and what's great is most of these are proprietary products where you only have one competitor in some of them, and the customers really see us as an essential part of their success, and what they are offering to the market, and we have great relationships in all of them.","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","And, Bob, it's just really exciting to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Tritan. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, that has moved to a $300 million business over that timeframe. And with the expansions that we're adding, we can nearly double that revenue over that future.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","I think we're really establishing that we've got one of the best product and market development capabilities in the industry proving it through this business and you're going to start seeing the same proof in Additives & Functional Products as we move through this year and the next.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Curt, if I can just ask you on your balance sheet targets, if you can remind us broadly what you're trying to get back to from a debt leverage perspective, and I guess one of the things I'm thinking about is just, if you \u2013 let's assume this year it goes according to plan and next year you're able to put up similar growth. And do you think you would do the same amount of debt pay down next year or do you think you'd maybe have more flexibility?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Well, it depends. So, if you think about just our goals for 2017, we talked about that $1 billion of free cash flow, and $300 million goes with that nice dividend that we have in the industry, $300 million. And so the rest is going to be split between share repurchases and debt deleveraging. And so if you combine that with kind of our EBITDA growth that we expect this year, we're getting closing the gap between where to start the year and kind of that targeted 2.5 times debt to EBITDA kind of in shortcut fashion. And so when it gets into 2018, we'll look at how much deleveraging we further have to complete depending on our EBITDA growth we expect for that time and we'll kind of gauge our capital allocation as we get closer to the end of the year.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow up, Williams has now sold its cracker, any update on where you are in your process and does what they printed change your view on what you want to do or any broad update would be helpful?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","No, the other competing asset within marketplace, so we weren't quite sure it was really impacting our process, but nonetheless, it's good to see that transaction get done. And I think we're the only cracker facility that's out there for availability right now. As it relates to the status of that, I feel that we're continuing to make good progress with a number of parties actively engaged with us. Again, as I mentioned before, the variety of options are from an outright sale, partnership, joint venture or whatever the case may be. But we continue to have interest given the quality and reliability of our assets and you've heard me say it and I'll say it again, we're going to be a patient seller, but we're making good progress and I'm still hopeful that we have something to talk about by mid-year.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. I was wondering if you could give us an update on your adhesive resin business, how is pricing going in that business and what do you see as the outlook there given some capacity additions coming later in the year.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Thanks. Adhesives has been a fantastic business for us. It's had tremendous earnings growth and quite attractive margins the last couple of years. And as we've said in past calls, a lot of that is \u2013 due to tight market conditions. These are great attractive end markets that can have a lot of growth. And the growth rates are improving, we used to think about as 4% to 5% growth and it's now up to 5% to 7%, where you see such tremendous growth in hygiene products, in hot-melt adhesive packaging. So, we're very encouraged by what we see in the market. But as you noted, there is capacity coming online. We're feeling some of that pressure this year in our C5 resins with some capacity and the prices have come off a bit.","And there is more capacity coming online on our hydrogenated resin at the end of this year, into next year, and we'll feel some price pressure from that. But as you look at the margins and the ROIC of this business, it's just fantastic. When you think about specialty businesses, they're great attractive businesses, attractive margins, ability to grow faster than the market, but there is still always going to be some amount of cyclicality in any individual product when a competitor brings some capacity online whether it's an impact on volume or margins as you cycle through.","But what I love about AFP as well as Advanced Materials is, it's a robust portfolio, diverse set of end-markets, diverse set of products and that diversity gives you strength as you sort of absorb those sort of trends that happen naturally in any of these businesses.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Terrific. And then in terms of some of the volume improvements you've seen, how much of that do you think is attributable to underlying demand improvement versus maybe some restocking or some pre-buying ahead of price increases?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Yeah. What I love about our growth story in the first quarter is, it's innovation-driven. We have attractive markets and they're delivering good growth and they're nice diverse set of markets that are relatively stable, whether it's transportation, B&C, consumables, personal care, ag and animal nutrition. And even in the large markets like transportation, B&C, high portion of that is pretty stable, because it's re-finish replacement tires type business.","And then on top of that, we're layering in our innovation growth that will continue through the year, allowing us to grow faster than the underlying markets. There was some additional demand in the first quarter. As I mentioned, Tritan had a huge number of wins and there were some high levels of orders to help some of our customers load the shelves with our Tritan in their products. And there was some additional seasonal demand in AFP, strong de-icing year, strong crop protection \u2013 I'm sorry, not year, but quarter. And strong crop protection demand as well in the quarter. So there is a little bit of seasonal dynamics. Regarding pre-buying, I don't think there has been that much. There may have been a little bit in tires, but we don't see a lot of that at this stage.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Can you talk about the effects of the new PDH unit enterprise will bring on stream for Eastman. That is \u2013 you're going to buy some propylene at cost plus, does this increase the amount of propylene derivatives that you wish to sell by any material amount or is it just a substitute of getting propylene from one source than getting it from another source? And in your Tritan expansion, by what percentage are you increasing overall Tritan capacity through your expansion this year?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Hey, Jeff. Curt. Good morning. So if you think about the effects of the PDH unit, that is \u2013 what you described in the latter point \u2013 that is just taking a shift in sourcing of some of that propylene. So we're buying some of the propylene in the market today and with the PDH unit that we'll participate in that will be the source of that propylene and become more of a propane-based source of propylene for us from a cost standpoint. So it doesn't really impact our derivatives and what we're able to sell into the marketplace. On Tritan itself, the expansion that we're in the process of completing and look forward to coming forward, that increases our capacity about 80%.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","80%? Okay. And then for my follow-up, this year you have an expansion in Tritan and Crystex, I think in PVB. If you total up the cost of all of those expansions as part of your capital expenditures this year, roughly how much would it be? And I imagine that you expect to complete all of these three expansions in the second half. Is that correct?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","So if you look at our capital expenditures, you think of our maintenance capital in that $300 million to $350 million range. The rest of it is the growth capital and a good portion of that growth capital will be spent on the projects you just defined. Most of those projects, as you can see our CapEx is pretty \u2013 higher in the first quarter than it was last year. So you can see...","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","...we're really working hard on those capital projects. I know the Crystex facility is going to be mechanically to complete later this year. Tritan, this year, may be carrying it to next year.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","One thing I'd add is what I love about our story is not only just delivering great earnings growth through the specialty businesses, but we're generating $1 billion of free cash flow and that includes spending material amount of CapEx on specialty projects to enable long-term growth not just trying to deliver short-term growth. So it's just a compelling story that we can have one of the strongest free cash flows in this industry and still invest in long-term growth so we can keep this going as we move forward beyond this year and into the future.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, your CapEx should come down a lot next year?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Well, let's talk about that as we get towards the end of the year in our capital allocation. When you have an innovation program like Eastman, yes, some of these projects are going to \u2013 to be completed and come down, but then you'll also have to assume we have additional growth projects that are in the hopper. So, it's logical to assume that's coming \u2013 going to come down, but at the same token, give us the right to bring forward other growth capital projects as we get towards the end of the year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Yes. Good morning. Thank you. To follow-up on your expansion plans, Mark, as you look at the three that you have on the table now, how would you characterize the returns on these projects either in absolute or relative terms. And with regard to Tritan specifically, to what extent can you leverage the existing copolyester asset infrastructure there and, likewise, leverage the TMCD monomer for your Tetrashield product ambitions?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Thanks, Kevin. Great question. And we're excited about all these growth investments we're making and delivering against them. With returns on capital, we expect to deliver 12% to 15% ROIC in most of our large-scale capital investments like these and certainly have done that in the past and we expect to continue that going forward. And relative to our cost of capital these days, that's an extremely attractive return for shareholders.","When it comes to sort of Tritan, you brought up a great point about not just Tritan but actually our interlayers business as well as our cellulosic stream is, we are masters at upgrading value on an integrated asset base and core technology stream where we're the best in the world of developing new applications from these streams. So, you need to think about it with Tritan, we started out with PET assets. We've upgraded those into copolyester assets that was a great success story for many years and still growing quite well. And now, we're upgrading those same assets, so same PET assets are being repurposed into Tritan.","And now, then monomer capacity to make the TMCD to make Tritan is obviously new capital, but you're leveraging this huge infrastructure base in our Chemical Intermediates to make all the intermediates to go into this copolyesters as well as the actual polymer assets themselves and constantly upgrading, and that gives you a great ROIC because you're not having to rebuild or create new ground-up capacity all the time. It's the same story in interlayers, where we make a standard interlayer for decades and now we're making acoustics and heads-up display interlayer on the same asset at substantially higher margins and that's why we keep emphasizing the mix upgrade. It's not just the variable margins are higher, but the leverage on the existing assets is tremendous.","And then a great example is, not only are we \u2013 we've been doing this in Tritan for copolyesters, we're now porting it into polyester coatings and that's a pretty tough business if you're just selling standard polyester coatings, but, like Tritan, we can upgrade substantially what we can offer to the market with our Tetrashield products at much higher margins, and seeing great success there in both automotive. We've gone from one interested customer a year ago to 10 engaged with us now around the world interested in our products, as well as seeing great success for Tetrashield as a BPA-free can coating to replace epoxy with better performance in what's being offered in the market today by the first-generation of polyesters out there.","So it's, again, leveraged assets, leverage acceleration filling out those assets as we bring the coating market on as well as thermoplastic product extensions.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","So just to follow up and clarify, Mark, it sounds like all three of the expansions will be clustered within that range of 12% to 15% that you mentioned and Tritan wouldn't necessarily be meaningfully higher than that given your ability to leverage?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Kevin, what I would say is that, our target is 12% to 15%, some projects particularly, maybe like the Tritan, could be higher than that.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Good morning, Frank.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, I really like the picture of the chick on slide 5. So kudos to whoever put your slides together. Immediately put me in a \u2013 it immediately put me in a nice mood.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.",".","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It was excellent. Hey, look, you're starting the year on a run rate of negative $0.70 a share on the Fibers side and yet you're guiding to negative $0.40 for the year and you're saying that things are playing out as expected. I just, I guess, I want to follow up on your confidence level there and do you have contracts in place, are there orders already on the books that give you the confidence that we are going to see that pickup in the latter part of this year?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","So, the answer to your answer, Frank \u2013 this is Curt \u2013 the answer is, yes. We have a good portion of our business under long-term agreements. What we've talked about is we're kind of going through this transition of some of our customer mix and so that's why we understand what's happening in our volumes in this business, where we're going to see volumes improve the second half of the year versus the first half. And because of those customer relationships and the confidence we have in managing through the transition is the outlook we have for Fibers.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","And, Frank, looking beyond just the sort of share shift dynamics and what's going on this year, we really feel like we're making great progress in stabilizing this business. And when you think about all the actions that we've taken, I think it's certainly going to get more stable. We've obviously done a lot to sort of reduce our capacity, shutting the U.K. asset down, exiting the flake joint venture. Two-thirds of our volume now in the long-term agreements that allow us to provide stability for our customers and ourselves, continue to make progress on how we take costs out across the company, but as well as specifically in this business and we still have more opportunities to improve through productivity there. And then you think about our innovation efforts, that will start kicking into gear this year and be more meaningful next year, finding new applications in other markets, outside of cigarettes.","And I'm really impressed with the progress that team has made and the success we're having there. So you put all that together and I think we've got a good situation to stabilize this business. One other thing to keep in perspective is, China tow now is closely becoming irrelevant to the overall story. When you think about, it only \u2013 it being less than 10% of our revenue this year and Fibers being around 10% of our total revenue, we're now got something that's 1% of our corporate revenue and that we're talking about as far as future import uncertainty when it comes to China. So we're not happy about where we are and how earnings have dropped associated with that business. But as you think about it going forward, that just adds another element of stability, because there is just less risk there.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Got you, got you. One can hope that the change in ownership structure of the industry might also help. And can you provide an update on your $100 million productivity program in 2017 and where you were in Q1 and the expectations as we go through the year?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Sure. Well, Mark mentioned our aggressive cost actions are on track to deliver about $100 million of cost reduction year-over-year. As a reminder, Frank, these are actions that include labor, site optimization, energy efficiency, et cetera. So given the nature of that, I would say roughly 75% of our cost reductions are going to be kind of in that manufacture and supply chain cost area and with its large manufacturing base, Chemical Intermediates gets a good portion of those cost reductions in their results. And so, you saw some of those benefits in the first quarter. Sometimes when things are going through inventory, it's always hard to predict exactly what was in first quarter versus the rest of the year, but the simplest way I'd look at the $100 million of cost reductions, good line of sight, we're implementing as we speak and all these are generally spread throughout the year evenly.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Evenly. Thank you so much.","Operator","And we'll go to the next question, comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Couple of questions on the Taminco business. I know you have a methanol contract that runs through 2019. But with methanol price volatility what was the impact on Taminco's amines business; and then ag chemicals particularly herbicides and pesticides have been somewhat under pressure. Is that impacting Taminco as well?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","So Taminco has been a great acquisition, really done incredibly well. As you noted methanol obviously came off with oil dropping from $150 and that created some pressure on our earnings in 2015 and 2016, but most of the contraction in Taminco are cost pass-through tied to market methanol. And as you noted we have an advantaged methanol position for a part of our cost structures. So as oil has gone up that's been helping that business improve this year versus last.","So that's all sort of on track as you would expect. On the growth side, a lot of the business that they are in is quite stable personal care, animal nutrition, even our crop protection business in the additives & functional products business is perishable products. These are high value typically green product, green vegetables or flowers whatever so there is not as much demand cyclicality as you hear about in sort of corn and soy bean. So the only place we've been caught in these sort of crop demand cycle is in some of our functional amines over in Chemical Intermediates. And obviously our demand was off with the industry where we are starting to see some recovery there this year, but there is still a lot of room for growth and recovery there, that we're looking forward to realizing as we move forward from this year into the next.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And you mentioned \u2013 I looked through the tow line and what's going on there. Do you think there is room for more consolidation after the Blackstone-Solvay deal, or is it just a case of trying to see who checks capacity down next?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Well, I think that, what I'm proud of is, we've been very responsible managing our cost structure and taking out capacity to be better aligned in serving our customers doing what we can do in the last couple of years with the UK tow shutdown and our exit of flake JV. We're down to our last flake asset, and the tow that goes with it and we have the lowest cost position with our integration back to coal and our largest \u2013 larger scale in the industry. So, we've done what we can do. Regards the industry consolidation, I don't think, we play a direct role in that, I think it's really up to what the other three players choose to do, and it's better to ask them what they think is going to happen.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And also you mentioned repurposing some capacity, when we do we begin to see effects of that? Thank you.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Sorry, could you repeat that question, you got garbled.","Gregory A. Riddle - Eastman Chemical Co.","He is asking about repurposing capacity for tow?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Oh, sure. P.J., I think that we have the best innovation capability hands down when it comes to taking a technology stream, and taking it into a wide range of new applications. We've been doing it for 90 years. We've done it in polyester, we've done in cellulosics, we've done it in a narrow part of olefins, we know how to do this. We've created all these different products for the industry. So we didn't stop suddenly and run out of ideas. When the two assets are running really tight, there wasn't a lot of need to do it. But as we saw things start to get a little bit softer in 2014, we formed the best people we had across the company in market development, and product development, and they just had tremendous success in developing a range of new applications.","We're not going to talk about them specifically at this point because we are still in the middle of getting them in the market, and getting all the IP finalized on some of these opportunities, but we'll be telling you more about it as we go through the year, but \u2013 and the margins aren't going to be as good as tow just to be clear. There are some that are low margins, some that are pretty attractive margins, but it's all against zero at the moment with the excess capacity we have. So it's all good earnings growth going forward.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. I'll actually give up my first question. Give kudos to Frank Mitsch, I can't wait to read the transcript. As my follow-up, could you remind us of the range of transactions that you're entertaining at Longview? At the low end, I think it's just the idle capacity. What's the high end of the scope that you're considering?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Well, what we've talked about is the scope of our assets that were available is excess ethylene that's the baseline, because we don't feel that we're potentially the most natural owner of that excess ethylene position. And what we've talked about on top of it is \u2013 we are willing to talk to different parties about some of the more commodity olefins for those crackers. We have not sized that John, and that's because it varies by party. But the baseline is definitely at least the excess ethylene.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to the next question from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. In terms of ASP, volume growth continues to be very good. When do you think you turn the corner and generate some EBIT growth, I know raw materials are kind of squeezing in near-term, but does that show up in 2Q, and 3Q and 4Q?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Yeah. So, we're happy about the growth we've seen in the volume side and we expect good volume growth as we go forward. When it comes to the pricing side of equation, we were successful in getting price increases implemented in many products across the olefins, cellulosics, and amines products.","As already noted, prices are coming off of a little bit in adhesives and we're seeing prices come off a little bit in Crystex, which has been a natural dynamic for some time. So, we net it all together, we'll see prices go up in the second quarter.","We are still intending to continue increasing prices beyond the second quarter as well, as these raw materials flow through. But I think it's more of a back half dynamic than a front half, when you start seeing the earnings growth on a year-over-year basis, because the raw materials spike was pretty big and the first quarter flows through pretty slowly especially. So, we've still got to work our way through that in the second quarter.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then just shifting gears, a lot of the growth that you're seeing in the specialty businesses, you found them with the acquisitions, any change and maybe looking for some bolt-ons to add to your specialty portfolio?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Yeah. We're always looking for how to build the quality of our current businesses and so the bolt-ons are always an opportunity in addition to the organic growth that we are doing. And so that's always a consideration that we have when we look at how to best deploy our free cash flow, but I'll tell you right now we don't have anything active. But I certainly hope, we find some attractive acquisitions I think we've demonstrated that we have a very impressive track record of doing great acquisitions, and doing them in ways that we don't overpay for them. I like the fact that we haven't paid over 10 times for anything, 9 times for our two largest acquisitions and synergies, giving us EBITDA multiples below 7. I think that's a good return for investors; but more importantly by far, we've done an excellent job of integrating these acquisitions into our company without losing any key talent. And more importantly beyond that is, we are now demonstrating that we can not only innovate in our core heritage Eastman technologies, but we can deliver innovation through our acquisitions and grow them equally well. And you're seeing that evidence right now with a strong growth in our interlayers business and acoustics and heads-up display. You see the next generation Crystex technology being launched next generation paint performance film. So really a great story about how we create value through acquisitions.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And going to our next question, it comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. How are you?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Hey, Dan.","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Good morning.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","You mentioned before that you thought with olefins pricing being relatively remaining up through the third quarter, I was just wondering what your thoughts are with pricing towards the end of the year and into 2018, if you're expecting some easing with your outlook and what's your overall assumptions?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","Well, maybe, I don't want to get into the business of trying to forecast the pricing of the different olefins. Maybe the better way that I could address your question is, kind of how we're looking at cracking spreads, maybe a better way to approach it. And so when you're looking over our cracking spreads, they are a little better year-over-year in the first quarter than we probably were anticipating back in January. And we're still thinking for the rest of this year, there is going to be some ebbs and flows, but generally speaking we're assuming spreads will remain the same roughly for the remainder of the year as they were last year.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then your comments about the shift in acetate tow and the reduction in Chinese influence, does that possibly suggest that the end \u2013 towards the end of this year we are hitting the trough in the decline for that business or is 2018 perhaps another more modest leg lower?","Curtis E. Espeland - Eastman Chemical Co.","No, I don't think, there is any reason for us to think 2018 is another modest leg lower. Obviously, it's not completely up to us and how the market dynamics play out, but from a demand point of view, we see stability. As I said, we're down to \u2013 China tow import business being a very small percentage of fibers and a rounding area in the corporate story.","So, it's not as big of an issue as it was two years to three years ago, but we'll have to see. I mean, I think that we've done everything we can do, I'm very encouraged by what we see in the industry, I mean we're encouraged by how we're going to fill these assets with new applications. So, we're planning on stability in 2018 relative to 2017.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.","Gregory A. Riddle - Eastman Chemical Co.","And let's just make the next question the last one please.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Just curious, maybe you can just touch a little bit on China, as a region, what you're seeing, what you're gaining from your customers there across a couple of different businesses and then similarly with the automotives? Thanks.","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","Asia's been great, China including that \u2013 in that statement which is the largest market for us. We've seen great growth in our specialty businesses both advanced materials and additives & functional products, saw growth in automotive as well as building construction and consumer durables are all showing great growth.","In fact, it's impressive when you look at our quarterly revenue growth in Asia being 3.5% over last year in the first quarter, when you consider the drop we had in fibers revenue in Asia. So I think it tells you that the growth in Asia is quite a bit stronger than what you are seeing in the specialties, when you do the net math on that.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just as a follow-up, you had experienced some competitive pressure in a couple of different markets, mainly adhesives and plasticizers as it relates to raws in the past, have you seen any of that or do you think that the market's still irrational now? Thanks?","Mark J. Costa - Eastman Chemical Co.","The plasticizer market has certainly become a lot better, partly it's propylene cost and oil prices being higher raising the cost structures of our competitors. In addition, the anti-dumping duties that we pursued against South Korea for some imports coming in and that suit being validated in the preliminary findings in the U.S. has led to a pretty material drop in \u2013 already a pretty material drop in the imports coming in from that country, allowing us both volume growth and price improvement in that market, we feel really good about that. And I think I've already covered the adhesives conversation, Arun with the prices coming off a bit there.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks.","Gregory A. Riddle - Eastman Chemical Co.","Great. Thanks again everyone for joining us this morning. A web replay, a replay in downloadable mp3 format will be available on our website later this morning.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website at www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory Riddle","Okay. Thank you, Christine, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager of Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's second quarter 2015 financial results news release, and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for first quarter 2015 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for second quarter 2015.","Second, earnings per share, operating earnings and EBITDA referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core costs, charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of excluded items, are available in the second quarter 2015 financial results news release and in the Appendix to these slides that accompany our remarks this morning, both of which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investor Section. Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the second quarter financial results news release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll start on Slide 3. I\u2019ll begin with the strategic highlights for the quarter and the first half of 2015. We had an outstanding second quarter results, clearly demonstrating the strength of our portfolio specialty products and the benefits of our focus on execution.","Adjusted EPS in the second quarter was a record for any quarter and establishes a new level of earnings for the company and we set a record for the first half within a year as well. When you consider the headwinds we are facing, we have demonstrated the power of our strategy of aggressively transforming our portfolio towards specialties. The value of innovation driving growth and improving our mix and the benefit of our advantage cost positions.","As we discussed in our first quarter call, we expected strong growth in our high value innovative specialty products. And now you can see that we deliver that strong growth from acoustic interlayers to our display products, to Tritan copolyester and many others. As the volume growth continues in these products, we also improved our product mix contributing to our strong margins.","This shows the strength of our portfolio as we are able to hold under price relative to declining loss and more than offset the propane hedge and currency headwinds.","In addition to strong organic growth, performance for Taminco continues to be solid and on track as the diversity of end markets and the strength of these business models enable us to navigate a difficult business environment.","We also remain very pleased with the progress on the integration and the achievement of synergies and I would add that our bolt-on acquisitions from 2014 are also performing very well. The Commonwealth film business, the aviation turbine oil business and Knowlton which is accelerating innovation in our microfibers business.","Cost management also remains an area of focus for us. We continue to make good progress keeping cost relatively flat with strong productivity gains. SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales remains in the lower quartile of our peers reflecting our focus on costs, our integration and our scale.","At the same time we\u2019re increasing resources and spending on innovation programs. And the cash engine continues to generate strong cash flow with a record $450 million of free cash flow in the second quarter.","When you look at the first half performance, I want to emphasize that we\u2019re delivering earnings growth through our specialties and our acquisitions. This overall exceptional level of performance is a direct result of the talent, focus, and dedication of Eastman employees around the world who find a way to make a difference everyday.","Now, I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss the corporate and segment results.","Curtis Espeland","Thanks Mark, and good morning everyone. I'll start with our second quarter corporate results on Slide 4.","Overall sales revenue increased primarily due to revenue from the businesses we acquired in 2014. This was partially offset by lower selling prices, which largely reflected lower raw material and energy costs, lower fiber, fiber segment sales volume and foreign exchange rates. ","Our operating earnings increased primarily due to the strong performance in advanced material segment and earnings from acquired businesses. Operating earnings also improved as we continue to hold onto value in the quarter reflecting a specialty and special position nature of a significant portion of our product portfolio.","These were partially offset by the impact of propane hedges, lower volumes in our fiber segment, and an unfavorable shift in foreign exchange rates. Our operating margin increased by 100 basis points to 19%. Overall earnings per share increased to a record $2.1 per share a very strong quarter as we continue to deliver earnings growth.","Moving next to the segment results, and starting with Additives & Functional Products on slide 5. Revenue increased due to both sales of acquired Taminco businesses, and higher coatings product sales volume attributed to stronger demand in key end markets such as transportation and building and construction. ","This was partially offset by lower coatings and other formulated product selling prices, which reflected lower raw material and energy costs. An unfavorable shift in foreign exchange rates was also a headwind. Operating earnings increased year-over-year primarily due to earnings from acquired businesses, with the Heritage Eastman businesses about flat.","We continue to expect strong full year earnings growth for this segment due to earnings from acquired businesses with earnings in the Heritage Eastman business relatively flat as solid volume growth offsets the effects of currency and propane hedges.","Next is Adhesives & Plasticizers on Slide 6, sales revenue declined 11% primarily due to lower prices reflecting low raw material costs and an unfavorable shift in foreign exchange rates.","We continue to see a favorable shift in product mix due to stronger volume growth of differentiated hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins in the hygiene and packaging markets and non-solid Plasticizer substitution in North America.","In the first half this volume improvement was offset by limited availability of key raw materials in non-hydrogenated resins and declines in Plasticizer sales outside of the United States.","Operating earnings increased in the second quarter as improved spreads for Adhesives was partially offset by currency. For full year 2015 we expect to continue to improve our product mix with strong growth in hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins and non-solid Plasticizers.","We expect this will be partially offset by the impact of currency and the propane hedge. Taken together, we continue to expect Adhesives & Plasticizers will deliver strong earnings growth for the year.","Now to Advanced Materials on Slide 7, which is delivering on all elements of their strategy, volume growth, mix improvement and fixed cost leverage. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume and mix improvement across the segment and sales of products of the acquired performance film business.","This strong volume growth was partially offset by lower selling prices primarily for copolyesters due to lower raw material and energy cost and unfavorable exchange rates.","One other point on second quarter volumes, during our first quarter call we said destocking in the early part of the first quarter had subsided by March and that we were seeing momentum heading into the second quarter. We believe restocking in the second quarter was a contributor to the strong volume growth.","Earnings for the quarter were record primarily due to high sales volume and improved product mix especially for Eastman Tritan copolyesters and interlayers for Acoustics properties.","Operating earnings also benefited from improved margins reflecting our value proposition, the benefits of fixed cost leverage and earnings from acquired businesses. These items were partially offset by unfavorable shift of foreign exchange rates. ","On the full year outlook for Advanced Materials, they delivered an outstanding first half of the year. We think you should look at the first two quarters together with the first quarter somewhat lower than it otherwise would have been due to destocking and the timing for lower cost flow of goods through the inventory.","The second quarter was stronger impart due to restocking and the flow through of lower raw material costs. For the back half of the year, underlying business performance should remain very solid. We expect to continue to have year-over-year volume growth and mix improvement.","However, it is typical for volumes to be seasonally slower in the back half of the year and we expect that again this year. And raw material and energy cost are expected to increase moderately in the back half of the year.","With all that said, Advanced Materials is positioned for very strong earnings growth in 2015, which should give them momentum heading into 2016.","Now Fibers on Slide 8, second quarter revenue volume and earnings were about as expected up slightly compared to the first quarter and down year-over-year. We attribute the decline in revenue in earnings year-over-year to inventory destocking as we previously discussed.","Despite the decline in volume, operating margins held at 31%. On our full year outlook, we continue to expect acetate tow volumes will increase in the second half of the year. Based on orders under books and discussions with our customers, we\u2019re expecting tow volumes will be about 20% higher in the second half of the year compared with the first half.","And we will continue to benefit from the action we took earlier this year to reduce cost by shutting out our U.K. acetate tow plan. Taken together, we\u2019re pretty much on track with our previous guidance albeit maybe slightly lower today than we thought back in April.","I\u2019ll finish the segment review with specialty fluids and intermediates on Slide 9. Sales revenue increased due to sales of products of acquired businesses, partially offset by lower selling prices particularly for olefin-based intermediates.","Operating earnings decreased due to earnings from the acquired businesses, been more than offset by the impact of propane hedges. Looking at the full year, we have a number of factors impacting results.","We expect to continue to benefit from volume growth and earnings in acquired businesses. Sales volume for the Heritage Eastman business is expected to be about flat as solid end market demand is offset by increasing internal uses of intermediates for both Taminco businesses and growth in Heritage Eastman business, as well as lower polymer intermediate volumes.","And we continue to project propylene and ethylene prices to remain low for the back half of the year, negatively impacting olefin margins. We also expect the impact of the propane hedges to be significant for this segment for the balance of the year, as the cost of the hedge flows through inventories. We therefore expect overall earnings in 2015 to be somewhat lower than 2014 earnings.","On Slide 10, our transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for second quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with second quarter operating cash flow of $591 million. Net earnings were solid and we continue to be disciplined with working capital.","It\u2019s probably also important to note here that we had nominal income tax payments and no contributions to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. These payments will be more heavily weighted to the second half of 2015.","We generated $450 million of free cash flow for the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $141 million and we\u2019re on track for full year capital expenditures of between $700 million and $725 million. As our underlying capital schedules are also weighted to the second half of the year.","And our second quarter dividend was $60 million and our effective tax rate for the second quarter was just over 27%. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be between 26% and 27% reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations and also reflecting our expectations that our friends in D.C. will sign the tax extenders, including the R&D tax credit and accelerated appreciation into law before the end of the year. Given our outstanding first half, we\u2019re on track for excellent financial performance in 2015.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Costa ","Thanks Curt. Before I get into our outlook statement, I want to reflect on the progress we\u2019ve made in improving our portfolio.","On Slide 11, you\u2019ll see four key financial metrics that demonstrate the strength of our performance over the last five years.","Top left, we've had very steady and improving adjusted EBITDA margins over the last five years which demonstrates both the quality and stability of our portfolio. Top right, our EPS CAGR had 18% over the last five years is also industry leading and demonstrates the value of our diversified portfolio or our acquisitions and our ability to focus on delivering results.","Bottom left, our free cash flow yield from 2014 was also industry leading and demonstrates a quality of our portfolio and the value of our advantage cost positions derived from our large scale integrated assets.","And bottom right, of the last five years we have generated an industry leading 23% compounded total shareholder return creating outperforming value for those shareholders who have owned us. And the first half of this year continues this trend of strong performance in margins, earnings and cash flow.","And that leads to our 2015 outlook on Page 12. We are off to a great start to the year with our first half results, setting a record for the quarter and for the first half of the year. As I have mentioned this performance is a result of excellent growth by our specialty businesses. In particular our high growth innovative products are driving mix improvement which contributes to our strong margins. And we also expect demand recovery in tow and our Fibers business.","We are also seeing attractive accretion for Taminco in the bolt-on acquisitions. And relentless cost management is also contributing to our strong performance. We expect the momentum from these factors will continue into the second half of the year.","We also expect to face challenges. Global economy continues to be slow, raw material and energy costs are an increasing challenge, current movements in oil and olefin prices are good example and the U.S. dollars continue to strengthen.","In this less than ideal business climate, we remain focused on what we can control which is executing our strategy to deliver results. We\u2019ve done a good job in the first half of the year staying focused and I\u2019m very confident that we will maintain our focus in the back half of the year.","When you net the positive momentum and the challenges together, we expect to hold on to the gains of the first half and we expect second half earnings to be similar to last year.","As a result, we are confident that 2015 will represent the sixth consecutive year of solid earnings growth for Eastman and that as a track record we are going to build on going forward.","Turning next to capital allocation on Slide 13. This chart shows our expectations for cash generation from 2015 through 2017. We had a very strong operating cash in the quarter and we expect this will continue given the quality of our businesses. While we are generating significant operating cash flow, we are also making meaningful investments in organic growth initiatives such as Tritan, Crystex and PVB interlayers.","When you subtract the CapEx from the operating cash, the results in very strong free cash flow that we expect will still be above $900 million for 2015. And we expect that our cash generation will increase in the coming years, so that for the period of 2015 to 2017 we will generate greater than $3 billion of free cash flow.","In a short term, our first priority for this cash will be repaying approximately $1 billion of debt, that finance to Taminco acquisition. Through the first half of this year, net debt declined by $280 million. By the second half of 2016, we should bring our metrics back inline to an investment grade credit rating to the combination of paying down debt and growing EBITDA.","We will continue to fully deploy our balance sheet in a disciplined and balanced manner. Beyond delevering, we have increased our dividend 4x in the last four years and over this time, the dividend has almost doubled from an already attractive level. And is reasonable for investors to expect that dividend will continue to grow as earnings grow.","As you do the math, you will see that we still have significant free cash flow after delevering the dividend payments. While we are very excited about the value we are creating from our acquisitions, we do not expect to complete any large acquisitions through 2017. We have been very disciplined in our acquisitions with the focus on generating attractive returns on capital, earnings growth and further enhancing the quality of our cash flow.","However, I believe the transaction multiples are getting too high, making it more difficult for our acquisitions to meet our financial return expectations. More importantly, we are very focused on delivering results from our specialty portfolio as a robust set of growth platforms and successfully integrating and driving results from our recent acquisitions.","Therefore you should expect cash will be fully deployed in an increasing dividend and share repurchases. Of course we will remain open to bolt-on acquisitions if they are very attractive and have a strong fit with our existing businesses.","Over the last five years, we've been very disciplined and balanced in our capital allocation decisions as we grow the company and generate optimal returns. That balance and discipline will continue going forward.","I'll close on Slide 14, with how we're doing so far on the key things for 2015, These are the same as we shared in January and you heard us emphasize each throughout this presentation today. We are delivering on what we set out for ourselves in 2015. Our performance is outstanding in our dynamic business environment on a range to key metrics we are delivering great results.","Our EBITDA margins demonstrate that we have a robust portfolio of attractive specialty businesses with limited commodity exposure and advantage cost positions. We are on track for our sixth consecutive year of solid earnings growth and for free cap would exceed $900 million, something that only a very small percentage of S&P 500 companies have been able to do in the last 10 years.","We continue to make progress, driving growth in our specialties, improving product mix with high growth of our innovative high margin products, and our acquisitions are on track for creating value.","And we maintain our commitment to fully deploy our balance sheet in disciplined and balanced manner, and this discipline the next year means, returning a very strong free cash flow to shareholders.","We've got a great strategy, a great portfolio businesses and simply an outstanding group of employees that continue to execute. I\u2019m very confident in our ability to continue creating value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us this morning. I look forward to your questions.","And with that, I will turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Riddle","Okay. Thanks Mark. We\u2019ve got a lot of people on the line this morning and I'd like to get to as many questions as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, Christine, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","First on Fibers, your volumes were down little bit more than they were down in Q1, while your competitors showed a little bit slower volume decline. Why didn't your volume growth decline slow in Q2 versus Q1 at least year-over-year?","Mark Costa","On the Fibers business, volumes played out exactly as we expected from the beginning of the year. So with our customers who have a slightly different mix since our competitors, so you really shouldn\u2019t compare us to them.","We expected this kind of volume through the second quarter and we are very encouraged to see the volume come back by about 20% into the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.","So, I think that what we see is exactly on track to what we expected on that recovery and the destocking seems to be abating.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just on Advanced Materials phenomenal quarter, any sense to how much you may have over earned in Q2 versus on normalized run rate given the restock and the lower PX cost?","Mark Costa","First of all Advanced Materials just had a stellar first half of the year and we're incredibly proud of all the innovation effort of employees in that group delivering on a series of investments we've been making for years.","And as we said, in the first half of the year we saw volume be a bit slower than we would have liked in the first quarter and we knew that was destocking as we are debating a lot of prices with our customers, and once we got that result we saw the volume come back.","So you do have a bit of destocking, restocking event in that second quarter. But I really do think as Curt mentioned in the prepared remarks, the first half of the year when you combine it together, is a good way to look at the performance of this business which was just outstanding and it's also important to keep in mind when you look at the volume growth of this business, Curt mentioned in the first quarter call that, we had shifted acetate from Advanced Materials to additives and functional products.","So the volume growth is actually even a bit stronger in the second quarter than in the first half then you see by about two percentage points in Advanced Materials and as you look at AFT about two percentage points less because that\u2019s a fairly low margin product, so that\u2019s really affecting volume more than it is profit.","So when you look at all that it comes together as a great first half of the year. That product mix and strength of volume growth on a year-over-year basis, we see continuing to the second half of the year but it is very important to keep in mind what Curt said, which is the seasonal business so demand will seasonally come off in the second half of the year versus the first.","So if you look at history over this business and how it has performed first half, second half, I think that's a reasonable expectation here.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Good morning. Another quick question on tow. Very good margins in the first half given the volume the decline, can you roughly quantify what the overhead absorption was on kind of a down 20% volume number?","Curtis Espeland","Well, we look at all the moving parts Duffy, so we don't really break out that individual piece, but I would keep in mind that even if there is some fixed costs absorption this business had, we are able to compensate for some of that with the actions we took with our shutdown of our U.K. working team facility.","So as a whole, we've always said this business is doing well and we expect it to continue to have operating margins growing 30%.","Duffy Fischer","Fair enough. And then I think you referenced on pensions that we should expect a little more cash outflow in the back half of the year, roughly how much are you targeting?","Curtis Espeland","For the U.S. to find benefit plans, our expectations will contribute about $100 million, and that will all be in the second half of this year.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","The Ag commentary has been generally quite weak from all the Ag chemical producers, which are euro Taminco's customers. So, can you just discuss Taminco's Ag outlook?","Mark Costa","Sure, Taminco, had a very good second quarter. We had solid volume growth both in the functional means that go into the row crops, as well as a nice performance in our crop protection business, which goes into the more perishable, fruits, vegetables, and flowers.","As we look at the rest of the year, we expect volume to remain solid in the crop protection business. On the functional means part of that business, we expect the volumes to come off a bit, consistent with industry.","It's very important to keep in mind though that the row crop business, corn and soybean that everyone else is talking about in their earnings release, is only 10% of the revenue of Taminco.","So it's not a significant driver of the overall earnings portfolio and its actually done quite well in the first half of the year. So it's not that significant for us.","The great thing about Taminco is like Eastman. We have a very diversified portfolio of end markets from the egg, the food, feed egg, exposure as well as the water treatment, personal care, and other industries.","And so, you're not really tied to any one market too much. And I think that's what's robust about their portfolio, and I think that's robust about Eastman's portfolio, where we don't have any end market more than 15% of our total revenue. And in this sort of volatile economic times that gives a lot of diversity and strength to be consistent in our earnings.","P.J. Juvekar","Great. Thank you for that. And then can you discuss the outlook for some of your propylene derivatives like Oxo's. Given your hedges that are in place, how do you see the derivative pricing playing out in the second half? Thank you.","Mark Costa","Sure. I think it's always a spectrum of specialties to the commodities, so the specialty side of our olefin derivatives, whether it's [axonal] [ph] and ketones that we sell in Additives & Functional Products or few of the other products that we have. We're going to maintain good price discipline and hold on to a lot of value relative to raws.","Special positions will also have some durability in that, and the commodity is obviously going to follow prices down. So in general, I think we've done a great job of holding onto values especially in AFP to some of that value to offset the hedge costs and the currency headwinds that that segment has, same thing to some degree in the Plasticizers business.","And then obviously SFI's follow propylene down a little bit more quickly given the nature of their products. They've done a great job actually in holding on to value in the first half of the year, but as we look at the second half of the year, those prices are going to catch up to the propylene and ethylene prices that they are associated with.","Gregory Riddle","We'll move onto our next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Question here you referenced good coatings volume, and we've seen so far that it's sort of a weak environment for the downstream coatings customers. So, what do you attribute the strength in your volume to, and was that a restocking or how should we think about it?","Mark Costa","Good morning, Vincent. What we saw is a good sequential improvement from first quarter to second quarter as similar to Advanced Materials, you had some of the sort of destocking events play themselves out in the first quarter.","About your volume growth on a year-over-year basis, when you look at coatings, is very consistent with our downstream customers. So you're seeing 3% to 4% kind of volume growth. Remember that adjustment I just gave you around acetate, we got to take about 2% out of the AFP segment.","And then tires was obviously a little bit less than that. So good solid volume growth but I wouldn't call it strong, this whole coatings season hasn't really played out as anyone hoped.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And just as a follow-up, the non-hydrogenated resin raw materials and then the lack of availability, can you remind us what's that all about and how that's going to evolve over the back half?","Mark Costa","Sure, a trend has been going on since 2010 that can expect the Shale gas and the driving of cracker feed slate and refinery feed slate to lighter and lighter feed stocks. Because what we basically do is take C5 and C9 resin oil that is a byproduct of those crackers, and upgrade them into resins.","So as these feed stocks slates have been moving lighter, you have limited availability of those raw materials to turn into tackifying resins.","And we saw demand continue to be strong and grow from packaging through hygiene and some other applications and then you continue to have limited raw material availability and that created the constraint as relatively tight that's given us some pricing power.","We do expect some of that to sort of dissipate a little bit in the non-hydrogen resins refining more raw material availability as we're able to pursue more growth, of course that will also reduce some of the tightness in the marketplace.","I would also note that Eastman is very unique in our capability of using wide spectrum of raw materials - resin, and so in this environment, it's hard to find laws, it gives a competitive advantage.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities.","Aleksey Yefremov","Good morning, thank you. In your Fibers business, is it fair to say that that margin should improve in the second half because of higher volumes?","Mark Costa","Certainly we'll see some improvement in asset and capacity utilization rights as we go into the second half, but I wouldn't call it material. We try and run our plans on a fairly even basis in the business like this, we knew that the restocking was going to come and improvement in demand, and so we've been pretty steady on that.","So I think that the margins should stay pretty similar.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you. Now in Advanced Materials, just a bit a longer-term question, where are you in adoption cycle for both new interlayers product and for Tritan how do you expect those volumes to keep growing in 2016?","Mark Costa","We expect very strong growth in those products going into 2016, as well as many other products in Advanced Materials. So on Tritan, this is our BPA-free plastic that's an alternative polycarbonate for all types of houseware applications and medical applications and there is a very large addressable market in front of us where we have plenty of room to grow and that's why we have done the debottleneck on that asset as well as have another capacity expansion planned.","Interlayers is another great story, we've seen tremendous double-digit growth in the acoustic interlayers which is a very high value product that we sell that requires a cabin in the car or allows you to lightweight the glass in the car to improve the fuel efficiency.","And not only are we seeing good adoption from luxury down into mid-level cars, we're also gaining more square meters per car because people are starting to use acoustics on the windshields and the sunroof, I mean beyond the windshields into the side lamps and into the sunroofs.","So, real estate is increasing, the number of model is increasing, it's just a great story. I would also highlight other things going on in Advanced Materials. So we have some new display products are going to mobile devices showing tremendous growth and very high margins and performance homes business had a good first half of the year and I expect it to have a very good year, next year as well.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning guys and congratulations on a record quarter. I was planning on burning up my question to Curt, asking who his friends were in DC, but I'll save that for another time. I want to talk about cash flows over the next couple of years. You are projecting over $900 million free cash flow this year and according to the chart it looks similar next year, let's call it $2 billion over the next two years.","You're going to spend a billion on debt paydown, you're going to spend $400 million on dividend, you\u2019re talking about maybe $100 million on pension, and based on your commentary regarding M&A and the non-likelihood of that occurring and certainly nothing of a larger order of magnitude, that essentially leaves $0.5 billion on share buybacks for the next two years, am I interpreting that correctly?","Curtis Espeland","Frank, this is Curt. So first of all on the math, you see that trajectory that has both improved operating earnings and as we look at our Investor Day, back if you recall we also expected our capital expenditures to moderate into 2017 over 2015 and 2016.","As it relates to your math, of what free cash flow remains after we finish deleveraging and paying our dividends, I would say, yes, there is a good healthy nearly $1 billion available in general terms but free cash flow to deploy, and as we've said before, we expect our balance sheet to be fully deployed during this time period.","Frank Mitsch","All right, terrific. Thank you so much. And I just want to get an update in terms of the 2015 headwinds, I believe you said in a not too distant past that you thought the propane hedges were $0.40 to $0.60 of headwinds, FX was $0.25 of headwind and fiber destock was $0.20. Do you have any update on those three metrics?","Curtis Espeland","Well let me update you on the first two and fibers I think is generally consistent with our expectation maybe a little worse, but generally speaking pretty close to our expectation.","If you think about the impact of producing versus purchasing olefins, we've talked about that last about being roughly around $0.60 a share. The short answer to that question is, there has not been a material change to that, but I can't resist always remind people what is considered into that $0.60 a share.","So recall, we purchase - we produced about 55% of the propylene we need, we purchased the rest and we consume half of the ethylene we produced et cetera. So you know those aspects.","On a cash flow itself, the cash flow hedges were about two-third hedge of this year and just over 50% next year. Cracking spreads are expected to compress in the second half of the year given that continued volatility in olefins that Mark talked about. In addition just don't forget the hedges that are going to weighted more second half of the year as it flows to the inventory.","So we are trying to mitigate this through various operating activities, as well as the advanced feedstock mix where we are now 70% propane. And then finally again I would think about the concept of cracking spreads is theoretical for us because the vast majority of the olefins are kind of sold through derivative.","So, if I think about the impact, the hedge impact can be a little greater in the third quarter than the fourth quarter through that flow through, but at the same talk in the guides they are still going to try all they can to hold on to pricing.","So we\u2019ll see how this plays out. We continue to see volatility in olefins, but we\u2019ll just have to try to say as nimble as possible as they try to keep that impact to roughly that $0.60 a share.","On currency, last we talked about that. We talked predominantly just specifically the Euro and we said that was going to be roughly $0.30 a share impact that remains the same albeit we are facing a little bit more currency headwinds just from some of the other basket of currencies we deal with.","And so for example just in second quarter our currency headwind is $30 million alone. So the $0.30 per share impact for the year over euro is about the same. We are facing a little bit more headwind just because of the other currencies that have been the value against the dollar.","Mark Costa","Specifically the Yen is the one that\u2019s driving to other challenges.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils Wallin","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. On Advanced Materials very impressive incremental margin, would you help us understand all the different elements that went into that, was there a mix obviously your profitability had a great result compared to the revenue growth?","Mark Costa","Sure. So this story is consistent with what we have been talking about this business since 2012. There are three elements. There is volume growth, there is mix, and there is fixed cost leverage. We have made a lot of investments in this business both organically, as well as several of the acquisition sitting in this business.","And as a result, you have a great EBITDA margin in this business when you look pass the DA, it's very high variable margin. So when you deliver volume and then significantly improve mix because the products are growing at the double digit rate within this segment like Tritan, like acoustic interlayers, parts of the performance films business in North America and China, you have tremendous variable margin that drops the bottom line because of the fixed cost leverage.","So it\u2019s really a win in all three funds showing what this business can do.","Nils Wallin","Got it. And then on Fibers, was there any sort of transactional benefits from currency in that business for the quarter?","Mark Costa","Fibers have some exposure to the currency, but its modest relative to the overall profitability of that business.","Nils Wallin","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Sheehan with SunTrust.","James Sheehan","Thank you. Could you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of tire demand globally and update us on your Crystex business?","Curtis E. Espeland","So the tire demand situation is pretty - in our view is probably pretty consistent with global tire companies. North American U.S. tire demand has been quite solid and good growth for us, it\u2019s been offset by challenges in China.","There is clearly two things going on in China. One is their own economy has slowed down that\u2019s reduced the amount of tires, and you have to remember Crystex is highly leveraged to commercial tires.","So that is a challenge in China and plus the Chinese are facing significant challenges in exporting products out of China to the U.S. due to tariffs as well as currency is not helping them when they are trying to go to Europe.","So that market is very challenged on that front. That\u2019s been a challenge all year along and so we already embedded in our record earnings in the first half of the year, as well as our outlook. I think that\u2019s going to continue this way. I think the destocking in China that\u2019s going on should play itself out this year.","James Sheehan","And I am not sure if I caught this correct. But could you just quantify what your spread benefit was in the second quarter in SFI?","Curtis Espeland","Well we don't quantify, when you say spread in SFI we don\u2019t think of it in those terms, Jim. When we look at the $0.60 per share, that is pretty much a full year outlook then it does that impact of producing versus purchasing olefins, a fair bit of that does show up - almost roughly two-thirds.","Mark Costa","It's important to keep in mind when we talk about that $0.60 Curt said something, which is, it is a theoretical spread. It's not actual earnings. Right, so that is - if we are selling propylene and ethylene into the marketplace and while we do sell some ethylene in marketplace, we don\u2019t sell any propylene or half of the ethylene, we turn that into divertive products, but have their own pricing dynamics and in many cases those prices are not falling as fast as propylene and ethylene.","So the headwind for us is being offset by great work by our frontline teams out there holding on to value in the marketplace.","James Sheehan","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Good morning. Is the Texas railroad decision finalized now and if so, did Westlake appeal it?","Mark Costa","John, the disputes continue. The Westlake, the Texas railroad commission has had a room, but that is being contested by Westlake. Nothing really more to update you there other than what I liked is our legal team and the efforts we have because every time we have faced these challenges our team has own. But it's just going to take time to work its course.","John Roberts","Okay. And then in the Advanced Materials, and the Adhesives & Plasticizers where you get a lot lower Para xylene cost I imagine, and also in plasticizers probably a lot of aromatics here as well. Can you hold on to that for an intermediate period of time, will it be multiple quarters before you might have to either respect some products where customers might want lower costs or pass that through?","Mark Costa","Sure John. Advanced Materials the PX has been a nice tailwind, but the vast majority of the earnings were generating Advanced Materials has been through volume and mix. We certainly are benefiting from a nice Para xylene tailwind on that segment, that's giving us some of the earnings there, as prices are little bit sticky and how they follow PX down but a lot of that will play out through the year.","And so I think that there is some of that could be headwind into '16. But as I look at that segment going into next year, the volume and mix momentum is superior to some of that spread expansion. So we will be able to carry earnings growth into next year. ","Adhesives & Plasticizers we certainly have seen some benefits also from PX as it gets turned into DMT for making the plasticizers. But the margin compression of that industry due to aging competition has been pushing prices down pretty quickly with raw materials.","So there is no margin expansion in the Adhesives & Plasticizers segment due to plasticizers. That is just the volume mix upgrade story of selling more North American plasticizers, non-phthalate plasticizers, which is more attractive based on our advantage cost position then selling in Europe and U.S. So that's not really a contributing factor to the margin improvement on A&P.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","Thanks, good morning. You guys have mentioned some success in raw materials following quicker than product prices. I'm just wondering is the flow through of your hedges and lower market prices for some of these raw relative to your product price, do you think that spreads overall for the company improves, declines, what you see happening sequentially into the second half?","Mark Costa","In the second half of the year I think that \u2013 when you look at the olefin spread, like I said earlier on SFI side I think the margins are going to compress with propylene pricing coming off and obviously the hedge is fixed.","So you can see some compression there and the majority of the propylene hedge goes into SFI. You\u2019ll see some of that also flow into AFP and to a lesser extent to A&P. So that will certainly be a factor going into the second half of the year. There is a lot of other great things going on in volume and mix and holding onto prices some especially that helps offset some of the headwind, but it\u2019s certainly a factor.","Bob Koort","Would you say that there is something, I\u2019m guessing you would, but unique to your own portfolio I mean it\u2019s pretty remarkable if you got absorbed that hedge that you\u2019ve been able to see some margin benefit I guess maybe in some of the other segments.","But I would have expected maybe the market competitors who don't have that hedge issue to be a little bit more aggressive. So there\u2019s something about the end markets, have been a little bit more disciplined around pricing or is it just your own product mix is unique and you do have a few problem parts where that hedge is really dingy or how should we think about that?","Mark Costa","First of all I think we do have a fairly unique product mix in some places especially our specialties that we make - that are olefin derived are very unique to us where we have very strong market leadership and market positions.","And so we're in a good position to fight and hold onto value. I think we\u2019ve got great teams that have spend a lot of time focusing on how to create value and find value in the marketplace.","And it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that, the way we're creating value right now is a little bit different than the average olefin player. So we're very North American focused in our olefin\u2019s position and so we\u2019re not benefiting at all from the outage driven tightness in Europe that's driving a lot of earnings up. So that sort of not in our numbers and therefore not a headwind when those outages get removed.","And then in North America as you\u2019ve noted, we certainly have spent a lot of time trying to get into more attractive end markets and segments with our olefin\u2019s because we can be given our smaller size in olefin\u2019s be very more - make sure that I think that\u2019s been quite helpful.","But even there, we're not really expanding margins this year, because of the hedges you've noted, which I would certainly prefer to have the earnings and cash without the hedges this year. But it does also help us out when we go into 2016 where we're not going to have as much of - that much of a headwind as we go into 2016, because of the hedge.","Bob Koort","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Mike Sison","Good morning guys, nice quarter. In terms of your outlook for the second half, you did a nice job growing your earnings in the first half, I think you mentioned flattish year-over-year growth in the second half.","So, any particular reason that the second half is going to be more difficult to grow on the second half and maybe point out some areas of concern and maybe some areas of potential upside?","Mark Costa","Sure. On the upside I think we continue to see good year-over-year volume and mix improvement over the second half of last year in the specialty businesses. And we expect that to continue to drive growth.","We expect the acquisitions of course to continue to provide attractive earnings accretion and that we're happy about the recovery in volumes in tow. But as we clearly guided, those positive momentums do get eroded as these propylene prices and ethylene prices create some challenge for us relative to our hedge, as well as currency being a challenge as we go into the second half of the year.","So we netted altogether and you see a little bit of slowdown in the economy effecting volume growth rates been a comparative what we would have \u2013 what we experienced in the first half of the year.","But I think and to be clear on the economy, that's really a global economy point I want to make. From our point of view China is not that big of a deal. China is only about 10% of our revenue in total for the company including fibers and it\u2019s important when you're thinking about Eastman that\u2019s not a real driver for how we\u2019re going to move forward.","We\u2019re very focused on only specialties in China, we don't sell any commodities there. We\u2019re very focused on consumer durables not infrastructure. And in a way, two of our biggest products going into China which is fibers and additives into tires which are pretty high margin.","We\u2019ve already basically embedded the China economic slowdown in our current earnings for this year. And so that part isn't really a big driving factor for us, but the overall economy is obviously not growing nearly as fast as we would have liked.","Curtis Espeland","And Mark if I could add, just if I think about some of the volatility we faced, you've seen some volatility just in recent in olefin prices specifically propane and propylene so we're going to have to see how those play out.","The hedge does offset some of that impact, but the hedge in the second half of the year will be about $30 million higher impact than it was in the first half of the year so that's weighing in our results as well.","Mike Sison","Okay, great thanks. And then a quick question in Additives & Functional Products. I think you mentioned Heritage Eastman would kind of be flat year-over-year in 2015 versus 2014. If you were able to sort of look at the heritage business on a constant currency basis and less the propane hedges. What type of growth do you think the inherent businesses are generating?","Curtis Espeland","Very solid earnings growth, you'd see the number to be quite a bit higher, I\u2019m not going to talk about it from a AFP point of view. But if you actually look at on a corporate point of view and you exclude both the benefits of a currency hedges and headwinds of the propane hedges, we\u2019d be $0.50 a share higher as a company this year and that really gives you a great demonstration of the quality of our specialty portfolio and the quality of these businesses, and our market positions, we're very niche focused which is a huge advantage in times like this in how we maintain attractive market structures.","And so the business is doing great, before you get to financial hedging and AFP would certainly be better as part of that.","Mike Sison","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies Financial.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. Two quick ones, if you look at your specialty businesses are there any end markets where you feel you have a good line of sight to acceleration over the next two to four quarters?","Mark Costa","I think that - I\u2019m not sure I would frame it as acceleration, but I think we\u2019ve got a great position to maintain great momentum. So we\u2019ve had great year-over-year growth in our specialties and our volumes and our mix especially in Advanced Materials of course.","We expect to sort of keep that momentum going in the second half of this year. And as I think about 2016, I think that those specialty businesses position us quite well to deliver earnings growth in 2016 over 2015.","So, we'll have a great momentum from those specialty businesses, we\u2019ll continue to have good accretion from the cost synergies flowing in through the acquisitions, and all that gives us some great momentum and a lot of the headwinds that we have this year will neutralize as you go into 2016 and then I think that position us really well to sort of keep earnings going and offset.","I think all chemical companies are benefiting to some degree from prices being sticky to rise and have some spud expansion in earnings this year. I think ours is relatively limited for some of the points I\u2019ve already made in this call.","And so when you net it all together, I think that momentum is what gives us confidence so we can keep growing earnings for a seventh consecutive year into 2016.","Laurence Alexander","And then as if this choppy environment continues for the next three to four years, is there any shift in your thinking about your degree of balance sheet leverage?","Curtis Espeland","No, I think our balance sheet leverage we\u2019re guided by our investment grade credit rating and that would continue to be our guiding as we make strategic choices. What I have to say on cap allocation as Mark talked about, if we\u2019re facing this choppy market and that extra free cash flow that we have towards the back end of the three or time period, is in absence of attractive M&A we\u2019re going to be repurchasing shares and returning cash to shareholders.","Laurence Alexander","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi, good morning. There was $145 million cash inflow from other and from first statement what was that?","Curtis Espeland","Jeff those were couple, there's various miscellaneous items in that line item. One example for example is just our current tax accounts. Since our payments were nominal, we're basically building a current tax payable in the first half of the year particularly in the second quarter and then not to get elevated in the second half of year most tax payments getting there.","Also impacting that is just the timing of crude salaries and the settlement of hedges. So I think you\u2019ll see that line item that kind of helped us in the second quarter will moderate in reverse to second half of the year.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And in the quarter, the prices at for the company as a whole was negative six, and I think for the six \u2013 was negative seven, and I think for the six months was negative six. How much did your raw materials fall, like if you had to do a comparable percentage change?","Curtis Espeland","I don\u2019t know if I have a percentage Jeff, but when I look in absolute dollars all-in, our raw materials declined about $220 million in the second quarter and about $180 million in the first quarter.","Jeff Zekauskas","I\u2019m sorry how much in the first?","Curtis Espeland ","$180 million in the first quarter.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. At this time I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Greg Riddle for any closing comments or remarks.","Gregory Riddle","Okay. Thanks, again everyone, for joining us this morning.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman\u2019s website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Riddle","Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jake LaRoe, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I\u2019ll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results news release, during this call and in the accompanying slides, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for third quarter 2018 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for full year 2018.","Second, earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core and unusual items. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results news release, which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings exclude any non-core unusual or non-recurring items.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Page 3. Despite challenging short-term dynamics in the last few months of 2018, I\u2019m proud of our accomplishments for the full year. We delivered 6% top-line growth driven by strong volume growth in our specialty businesses with contributions from product lines across our portfolio. We also made excellent progress converting our top innovation programs into commercial orders with double-digit growth in 2018 and new business revenue from innovation, which I\u2019ll talk more about in a moment.","Beyond creating our own growth, we\u2019re positioning ourselves for long-term sustainable growth. We increased our growth investments by $50 million during the year, which includes 10 new start plant \u2013 new plant startups last year, which is a record for us to support the robust growth in our specialties over the last several years.","We\u2019ve talked about our larger expansions of Tritan, PVB, resins and Crystex on prior calls, and we also added smaller incremental capacity for products including ketones and performance films. Our increase in gross spend also includes investments in capabilities to further strengthen our application development capability. And while we ramped up our growth programs, we also remained disciplined in our cost management to offset inflation.","Our cash engine generated approximately $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year, about a 10% yield. And we pushed that cash to work returning $718 million to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and an increasing dividend, with 2018 representing the ninth consecutive year we have raised our dividend.","In this current environment, we continue to execute on what we can control, namely innovating through our enterprise, managing costs and allocating our strong free cash flow in a disciplined manner. And we see strong evidence that these core elements are working, despite the significant macroeconomic challenges we faced in Q4.","On Slide 4, key driver of our success, as I mentioned, is our ability to convert our top innovation programs into commercial orders. I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019re seeing exciting progress across the portfolio with $365 million of new business revenue from innovation in 2018, growth that continued to the fourth quarter. Here are just a few examples.","In AM, we delivered 7% volume growth in Tritan. This was underpinned by continued growth across a diverse set of end markets and double-digit growth in China, despite the headwinds from the trade dispute. In performance films, we once again delivered double-digit volume growth in our two largest markets for window films, North America and China. We also continue to build momentum in paint protection film with the launch of two next-generation products. Also in AM, our interlayer business continue to benefit from our innovations in automotive with our products and heads-up display growing at 25% in 2018. At the same time, we are building momentum in architectural with our general programs and the launch of a new structural product called Saflex DG and saw very strong growth, particularly in Europe in the architectural business.","In AFP, strong adoption by more than 10 customers of our new generation Crystex Cure Pro, the newest innovation in insoluble sulfur. With this vulcanizing agent, tire manufacturers can improve productivity, achieve better operational control and realize cost savings. In Care Chemicals, we achieved a 12% volume growth in our water treatment business over 2017, as municipalities around the world adopt global water treatment standards, especially in China.","Finally, in Fibers, we continue to accelerate our growth in textiles with 30% growth led by our new product line called Naia. These and many other examples of new business revenue growth from innovation give me confidence that we can be resilient even in an uncertain business environment. In 2019, we expect to deliver another double-digit increase in new business revenue closes from innovation and are on track to generate approximately $500 million of new business revenue from innovation in 2020.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Curt.","Curt Espeland","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for spending some time with us today. I\u2019m going to start off with a few comments on our full year 2018 performance on Slide 5. And given the current business environment, it\u2019s important to remember that through nine months, we were delivering strong results, consistent with our long-term strategies discussed last year at our Innovation Day.","Through the first nine months, our revenue was up 8%, our EBIT was up 6% and our earnings per share was up 13%. And we were delivering these results despite $240 million of higher raw material and distribution cost, historically low spot ethylene prices and higher costs resulting from increased growth investments and the industrial gas supplier disruptions in Texas. Key to this performance was volume growth and mix improvement in our specialty products, successful price improvements relative to raws through the third quarter, strong cash generation and a weaker U.S. dollar.","As the third quarter ended, the business environment became more challenging as all of you know. We felt this in our fourth quarter through inventory destocking that was beyond normal seasonality and we attribute this mainly to the U.S.-China trade issues, plus we saw some additional destocking in other markets, given the rapid drop in oil prices and related raw materials.","On the destocking, we believe that the amount occurring above normal seasonality is largely in China, where we mostly sell specialty products, which therefore drives a negative earnings mix shift. And given the large drop in Brent beginning in October, we had a harder time raising our prices, but we still had $90 million of higher raw material and distribution costs year-over-year due to the third quarter flowing through our inventories. The result is that our fourth quarter results were more challenged than we were expecting, especially as the quarter progressed.","With that said, given what we know today, we expect the issues we faced in the fourth quarter will get progressively better in 2019. And we\u2019re already seeing evidence of improving order patterns sequentially into the first quarter.","Now on Slide 6, I\u2019ll start segment results with Advanced Materials, which showed strong volume growth and mixed growth in our premium specialty products through the first nine months of 2018, offset by some short-term dynamics in the fourth quarter. Looking at the full year, sales revenue increased 7% primarily due to higher sales volume and improved mix across the segment.","Full-year EBIT increased due to higher sales volume and improved product mix, partially offset by higher raw material costs, particularly for paraxylene in the last four months of the year and growth investments of approximately $25 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, sales revenue decreased mostly due to customer inventory destocking in specialty plastics as a result of economic uncertainty created by the U.S.-China trade dispute. EBIT decreased due to lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by improved product mix, which was less than normal due to customer inventory destocking in China. ","Despite volume declining at the segment level in the fourth quarter, Advanced Materials grew volume and mix in performance films and advanced interlayers in both the auto and architectural markets. In auto, both interlayers and performance films grew faster than the global auto market due to their breadth of innovation products. And in the architecture market, which now represents just under 50% of the interlayer sales, we are seeing strong growth particularly in Europe as we benefit from trends towards more windows in commercial architecture trends we are well positioned to serve.","Looking ahead to the full year of 2019, we expect strong growth. While orders in January have improved sequentially, we expect some inventory destocking to persist in the first quarter, impacting our specialty plastics business. We also expect higher cost in paraxylene to flow through inventory, temporarily impacting margins in the first quarter. And we will not face the same step-up in growth costs as a headwind coming into 2019. As those issues moderate, we expect Advanced Materials to return to robust growth in the final three quarters of the year. Putting it all together, we anticipate Advanced Materials EBIT growth to be at the high end of the 7% to 10% provided at the Innovation Day range for 2019.","Turning now to slide 7, into Advanced \u2013 Additives & Functional Products. For the full year, sales for Additives & Functional Products revenue increased 9% primarily due to higher sales volume, higher selling prices and a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. Higher sales volume was attributed to strong volume growth in Care Chemicals, coatings additives, animal nutrition and tire additives.","Full-year EBIT increased due to higher sales volume and a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased growth investments of approximate $20 million. For the fourth quarter, sales revenue was flat as higher selling prices were offset by an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. EBIT declined as higher prices were more than offset by higher raw material, energy and distribution costs.","The decline in EBIT in the fourth quarter was \u2013 which offset strong earnings growth through the first nine months of the year was due to few factors that played out simultaneously. First, destocking in coatings and tires within China and Europe weighed on product mix, as these products have higher margins relative to the segment average. Second, competitive dynamics in adhesives continued to limit upside in pricing, while higher oil-based raw material costs flowed through our inventory from the third quarter and third, higher growth investments and the impact of lower capacity utilization.","Looking ahead to 2019, we expect higher raw material costs to continue to work their way through inventory in the first quarter. While we see a pickup in orders, we still expect some destocking in tires and coatings to continue in the first quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect to return to growth as raw materials become a tailwind, destocking plays out and we don\u2019t expect the same cost headwinds as last year. All in, we anticipate Additives & Functional Products to grow EBIT at the low end of the 5% to 7% range provided at Innovation Day.","Next to slide eight in Chemical Intermediates, which overcame numerous challenges in 2018. For the full year, sales revenue increased as higher selling prices across the segment were partially offset by lower sales volume due to the actions we took to mitigate historically low spot ethylene prices. Full-year EBIT declined as an improvement in spread in our derivatives was more than offset by headwinds from merchant ethylene.","In the fourth quarter, sales revenue increased mostly due to increased selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volume attributed to merchant ethylene. EBIT declined due to higher raw material, energy and distribution costs partially offset by higher selling prices. Volatile raw materials had an impact in the quarter as higher costs were still flowing through inventory, while market prices for raw materials dropped rapidly creating a short-term disconnect between costs and pricing.","For the full year, we expect a couple of headwinds will not repeat in 2019. First, we\u2019ve largely mitigated the merchant ethylene headwind with the completion of our RGP project. And second, we do not expect to have a large industrial gas supplier outages repeat in 2019. The lack of these headwinds were netted with some expected softening in acetyls and in some olefin derivative products in 2019, lead us to expect 2019 Chemical Intermediates EBIT to be similar with 2018.","Finishing up with the segment reviews on Slide 9 with Fibers. Looking at the full year, sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume, primarily due to continued growth in the textiles innovation products and non-woven products previously reported in other. Textiles volume growth was 30% in 2018. The sustained volume growth of these products is a great story, demonstrating how these product lines are contributing to stability in the segment.","EBIT decline is lower acetate tow selling prices were partially offset by higher textile innovation product volumes. Tow volumes were relatively flat for the year. In the fourth quarter, sales revenue increased due to continue strong volume growth in textiles innovation products and higher sales volumes primarily to non-woven innovation products, previously reported in other. EBIT declined due to lower capacity utilization related to year-end inventory destocking in the quarter.","Now a few comments on 2019. First, we have fairly good line of sight into customer order patterns in this business. We are also not qualified to shift into China from our tow plant in Korea mitigating some of the impact we discussed last quarter associated with shipping tow into China from the U.S. We expect stability in 2019 as we continue to stabilize tow and benefit from strong textiles volume growth that builds throughout the year, which offsets the gradual decline in the tow market. But different from past years, the first tow quarter is expected to be the lowest quarter for tow due to customer buying patterns, partially attributed to rebuilding in imports into China and few other customers. All in, we expect EBIT to be about the same in 2019 compared with 2018.","On Slide 10, I\u2019ll transition to some corporate financial highlights. Cash from operating activities was over $1.5 billion and free cash flow came in close to target added approximately $1.1 billion. We continue to demonstrate our ability to convert earnings into cash and manage our working capital. The Eastern team knows the value of converting earnings into cash, especially our BA, credit and cash management teams. As a result, our free cash flow conversion was over 92% in 2018.","We returned $718 million to stockholders in 2018 through share repurchases and dividends. And I\u2019m proud to say that, we\u2019ve increased our dividend for the ninth consecutive year. Our full year 2018 effective tax rate improved to 16% from our previous outlook, as we\u2019ve got better clarity on the impact from the Tax Reform Act.","Looking into 2019, I expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 17%, and we\u2019ll work hard to have that towards the bottom end of that range. I expect our free cash flow to be greater than $1.1 billion in 2019. We\u2019ll remain disciplined with our use of cash across the various buckets. I expect a growing dividend, debt repayment, but to be a lesser extent than 2018. Share repurchases in absence of bolt-on acquisitions. And I would remind you, we should always expect that we\u2019ll fully deploy our cash.","Finally, don\u2019t miss the modeling slide in the appendix of this slide deck to further help you in your analysis. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Curt. On Slide 11, I\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2019. We have a number of growth drivers as we enter the year. As I mentioned earlier, we were doing a great job of driving new business revenue, as we leverage our innovation driven growth model. Results in our specialties growing faster than our end markets, and we expect new business revenue from innovation will increase to greater than $400 million this year.","We\u2019re also taking a more aggressive approach to cost management to hold manufacturing costs flat, offsetting not just inflation, but also the annualized effect of growth investments this year in a much higher shutdown schedule. This is different than 2018 relative to 2017, when we had a roughly $125 million headwind comprised of growth investments, the industrial gas outages and the ethylene headwind, which we have now neutralize to the RGP investment.","We were also chasing increasing raw material costs especially in the back half of the year. In 2019, we\u2019re also managing a few headwinds. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we expect global growth to be slower this year, due to China trade issues and the European economy slowed down with Brexit and other concerns. On the U.S. trade dispute, we are expecting it to get \u2013 we\u2019re not expecting it to get better or worse from the current situation in our guidance.","We are projecting the dollar-euro exchange rates remain about where it is through the end of the year and this will be about a net $25 million headwind is about half of it in the first quarter. And we\u2019re expecting pension expenses to also be about a $25 million headwind for the year. On spreads, we expect higher costs raw materials to continue to flow through until about the end of the first quarter. After that we expect to benefit from the flow through of lower raw material costs.","So putting all of this together, we expect that EPS will grow between 6% and 10% for the year. Given what we know today, growth would likely be towards the bottom end of this range. We\u2019re calling that our Innovation Day in February of our last year. Our long-term EPS growth projection was in the range of 8% to 12%. The difference between the midpoint of our long-term range and the range I just gave you for 2019 is primarily due to the lower expected earnings in the first quarter, due to raw material flow through and the destocking playing out and the substantial currency headwind we face.","One other comment on the first quarter is that, although, we are expecting EPS to be down year-over-year. We are expecting strong improvement sequentially and indicated that the headwinds are lessening. Lastly, I would add that there\u2019s obviously some uncertainty around all of these assumptions that we\u2019ve made for the year. And so we\u2019ll know more as we go through the first quarter.","Finally, let me bring everything together. On Slide 12, what you see is our innovation-driven growth model, which we first discussed with you at the Innovation Day last February and I\u2019ve referenced a number of times this morning. This model is central to our winning strategy and given the progress that we\u2019ve made, we\u2019re confident we\u2019re on track. The headwinds we face in the fourth quarter and that we see right now looking forward is transitory and even this uncertain global business environment, we\u2019re poised to deliver resilient results with solid EPS growth and the strong cash flow generation.","As you look past the first quarter, we will be back on track for our long term EPS guidance range of 8% to 12%. As I look forward, given the progress that we\u2019ve made in the commitment that I see from the Eastman employees around the world, I\u2019m more confident than ever in our future today then and I look forward to creating a lot of value for shareholders both in earnings growth and cash flow.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Greg.","Greg Riddle","All right, thanks mark. As usual, we\u2019d like to get to as many questions as possible this morning, so I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, Holly, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Mark, just in the guidance, you know honestly, on the lower end of the range bias, what are the range of outcomes that could actually result in either guidance be at the very top end or the very low end of the guidance range?","Mark Costa","Sure. Good morning, David. So there\u2019s obviously a lot of uncertainty right now, as we sit here in January, looking forward, especially on whether or not the trade dispute gets resolved, what happens in the European economy. And so the real wild cards here are the macroeconomics. From what we can control point of view, I have a lot of confidence in the innovation that we\u2019re delivering, our ability to grow fast than the markets we\u2019ve already shown, even through the fourth quarter, where we have innovation in the interlayers, performance films, for example, we grew much positively both in volume and mix in a relative to a down market.","So we feel the growth engines are intact, but there\u2019s just a macro in economic uncertainty. So the trade war gets completely resolved that\u2019s going to be upside for us. If Europe doesn\u2019t have the headwinds, people are concerned about upside for us relative to our forecasts. And obviously, if the reverse happens that\u2019s where the downside occurs.","David Begleiter","And Mark just in Advanced Materials, the 2% decline as volume in that segment. Can you talk about what volume was tracking until destocking in the world slowed? Was it more of a normalized number, perhaps October and early November?","Mark Costa","Yes. So the demand pattern there is, it\u2019s important to separate things out. So performance films and interlayers had a really good fourth quarter. So they continue to deliver good volume and mix growth. The auto business, even though it was challenge especially in China, we still deliver growth and the architectural market also very strong, where our interlayers go into a lot of laminate glass, especially in Europe growing much faster than the underlying market, because buildings are moving to a lot more glass on the facade. So we get a lift well above actual construction rate.","So the real challenge sat in especially plastics, David, and it was principally in China for them. When you think about a lot of our specialty plastics business, it is principally products we sell that are made into consumer durables that are then sent back to the U.S., and Europe. So heavily export-driven from China to the U.S., and so those customers were worried about, where the trade war was headed, they started \u2013 because they didn\u2019t think they can handle the 25% increase on January 1. They started aggressively destocking. And really taking inventories down to almost zero and it would only order us, when they received an order from their own customer.","So that really was the story on the demand decline and that has a pretty significant mix effect for us on a regional and product basis, because it\u2019s important to remember that in China, we only sell our high value specialties for AM and AFP. The lower value chemical intermediate products are almost entirely in North America. So when you have a slowdown in China, it really comes with a negative mix effect.","David Begleiter","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","Hey, good morning folks and thanks for the color on the outlook. I just want to get a little more granular in terms of your expectation. Since you have such a large business over in Asia and in China that impacts the three of your four segments. What are you baking in, in terms of an expectation post Chinese New Year, in terms of volumes coming back? Are you expecting any kind of normal bounce back, higher bounce back, lower bounce back? What is embedded in your estimates?","Mark Costa","Well, I think that there\u2019s \u2013 you have to break it down into a couple of different components. So I\u2019m going to deal with the destocking part first. And then I\u2019ll talk about primary demand. So on the destocking side, if you think about what I just said in the last question that destocking is actually playing itself out fairly well. And we have line of sight that will be completed by the end of the first quarter in specialty plastics. Same thing is true in AFP, where we see destocking should play out by the end of the first quarter. So that I think, something you can see coming to an end.","The primary demand question really is about the Chinese consumers. And AFP really has more sort of Chinese consumer exposure than AM does, when it comes to this demand question, because their products have a tendency to stay more in China. What you have is, Chinese consumers are worried about their economy. The government was already slowing the economy down in the first half of 2018. And the straight issue sort of was a trip wire to really make people nervous, especially businesses about what\u2019s going to happen going forward. And so you see people holding back on high ticket items. That\u2019s why you see the car sales down in the back half of last year, as you can all see. Same is true for appliances or any other high ticket item.","And so people are being conservative. My personal opinion is if the trade where doesn\u2019t escalate further, that fear subsides. Things are going to be viewed as more stable. And we will expect, some demand recovery but modest. If the trade war gets settled, then I think you could see more material restocking event than what we have in our forecast.","Frank Mitsch","All right, that\u2019s very helpful. A question and a follow-up for Curt, obviously, he did nice job in reducing debt throughout 2018. I guess partly at the expense of buybacks being slow during the fourth quarter. How should we think about Eastman buybacks in 2019?","Curt Espeland","Well. Sure, Frank. First of all, as you think about the free cash flow greater than $1.1 billion, we\u2019re going to be funding that attractive dividend that we have seen increase again this past year. On the deleveraging side, we believe that deleveraging can moderate some compared to last year. And so I always throw people out there right now, assume kind of roughly $250 million, but we\u2019ll modify that during the course of the year, maybe a little lower, depending how EBITDA grows during the year. And I think as we go into 2020, the deleveraging should be pretty much behind us to a greater extent, as we think about EBITDA growth going into 2020.","And so when you look at all those factors, then the remaining amount of that cash flow should be for share repurchases. And what you saw on 2018 and you could see a similar effect in 2019, we did a fair bit of our share repurchases in the first half of the year and you should see a similar effect this year. Quite honestly Frank, we probably could have done a little bit more in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s on me. I did want to hit our deleveraging targets. And as the cash flow came in strong, I kind of missed the window to maybe do another $25 million or so more. But regardless, I\u2019ve already made up for that as we started this year because we\u2019re in the markets as you would expect, especially where valuations are.","Frank Mitsch","Terrific, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and then good morning, everyone. In adhesive resins, the impacts on the new capacity obviously a bit more pronounced in the fourth quarter, given everything else that was going on. But where are we in that process and sort of what type of impact have you baked in for 2019?","Mark Costa","Sure. Good morning, Vincent. So adhesive capacity that came online that was sort of substantial with Exxon really didn\u2019t become effective until the back half of this year and the impact it had on pricing was holding our prices relatively flat through the end of the year as opposed to what we\u2019ve been doing, which is successfully increasing prices with raw materials up until that point. So you had \u2013 raws go up quite a bit with oil through the third quarter, that flowing through very slowly in the fourth quarter and we lost our ability to raise prices to offset it. And so that\u2019s a bit of the impact that you have. As you move into the first quarter, I think what we expect is prices to start coming off a bit, but we also expect raw material flow through to help offset some of that and mitigate some of that challenge. But it\u2019s going to be a challenging year in 2019 and part of the challenges we have to overcome for AFP and we have plenty of growth to do so.","I would even know within adhesives, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that this is a very strong growth market on the end market, it\u2019s hygiene, hot melt adhesive packaging, has very strong underlying growth in the sort of 5% to 7% range. On top of that because the sustainability trends and sensitivity to odor and VOC emissions, there\u2019s a strong drive to convert rosins, which don\u2019t measure well on those criteria over to hydrogen or hydrocarbon resins, which are the cleanest of what\u2019s available to market today.","And then on top of that, we just launched a new low-odor, low-VOC product as by far best-in-class in the world and are modifying our capability to produce that and go commercial on that product in this year. So that\u2019s going to be a real help. And we\u2019re seeing really strong growth in the polyolefin side of the business, which is sort of new for us, but we launched some new products as we\u2019ve told you in the past on Aerafins, what we call Aerafin that you pair with resins and that\u2019s going really well. So a lot of growth going on there, we\u2019ve been clear that this sort of spread compression was coming and we\u2019re working our way through it and feel great about this business long-term. It still has margins above the company average and it has a lot of innovation opportunities for us going forward.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And just as a follow-up. This might be the year that the excess ethylene capacity is monetized?","Curt Espeland","I would say on excess ethylene, we have dealt that through the RGP option. That RGP option is \u2013 can be adjusted back to normal operations if the markets improve. Until that happens, we are not doing much more with the sale of excess ethylene until the market improves. I know, there\u2019s interested parties, but right now until the market improves, there is not much we can do.","Mark Costa","Vincent, the value of it, right now doesn\u2019t make sense. In addition to the RGP, which sort of eliminates all the downside risk of the ethylene to propane volatility, which is up and running by the way already ahead of this call, we do believe the market situation should improve materially in ethylene in 2020 from what we can see as they had a lot of export capacity, ethylene to get that excess quantity that\u2019s been holding prices down out of this U.S., market.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Can you talk about the propylene complex in 2019? And that, just I guess using polymer grade prices, they have come down from say $0.60 to $0.40 and you sell a lot of propylene derivatives. What might be the year-over-year economic effect of that change for you in 2019? And how does it work in Eastman?","Curt Espeland","Well, maybe \u2013 well, how I answer that question Jeff is really what we\u2019re assuming on olefin spreads and maybe that helps address your question is, right now, we\u2019re expecting that propylene \u2013 propane spread to be above the same in 2019 compared to 2018. And we expect the ethylene-propane spread to little bit better that Mark mentioned, but still challenged relative to what we consider normal.","And then the impact of propylene on our derivatives and CI that\u2019s where you\u2019re really looking at. You got to go segment-by-segment, business-by-business on what the pricing is relative to the performance. And what we\u2019re seeing there, as I\u2019ve mentioned, a little softness in acetyls and in certain olefin product lines we expect some softening relative to 2018, but offset overall by the cost improvements we expect in CI.","Mark Costa","Yes. Jeff, while the propylene prices are off, you got to remember the propane prices are also off quite a bit. And so the spreads are holding fairly well. And we do expect some prices to come off in the propylene derivatives and in the acetyls. We have a nice offsetting situation where we\u2019ve eliminated the headwind from ethylene with the RGP investment. We have the lack of industrial outages in this segment and we\u2019re going to hold cost slight, so that nets out to where we can stay stable this year versus last year.","Jeff Zekauskas","And for my follow-up, is the raw materials that went up in the fourth quarter, I take it that was ethane, propane and paraxylene and ethane and propane have obviously come off and paraxylene has come off. And that\u2019s why you believe that you\u2019ll begin to have relief in the second quarter as you work your \u2013 and volumes slowed down, so you\u2019ve got extra stuff that you have to sell in Q1. Is that the general dynamic going into 2019?","Mark Costa","Yeah. That \u2013 you described it well, Jeff. I mean, oil-related items spiked in third quarter, propane, paraxylene and the like. Those have started to come off in fourth quarter. We couldn\u2019t turn them over quick enough because of the destocking in our normal seasonalization. Those will work its course through first quarter. And as those come up, you\u2019ll see the benefit in second quarter, absolutely right.","Curt Espeland","The only thing I\u2019d add to list was benzene was also incredibly high in the third quarter and it has come off dramatically as you know. And it\u2019s not just the flow through of the high-cost raw materials. Remember that when demand is really slowing down like that, also, we can\u2019t buy that much of the cheaper raw materials in the fourth quarter. So it really slows your turnover rate. Now that volumes are ramping up, we can both flow throughout the high cost as well as get a lot more of the low cost lot faster now.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We will now take our next question from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thank you. At the end of the presentation, it says you\u2019re assuming Brent crude will be similar at current levels. It\u2019s been so volatile over the past couple of months. Could you just talk about what you mean by current level? Is that rising through the year like the Futures Curve or average for the first two months of this year? Or what do you mean? And then related to that, you said more important that oil just be stable that\u2019s there. And so it could average in a pretty wide range and you could make your guidance as long as it\u2019s stable and not going and up and down and up and down?","Mark Costa","So to answer the first part of the question, we are assuming close to I think what the curve is. So oil sort of in the low 60s moving up to the mid-60s through the year sort of what\u2019s embedded in our forecast. On the volatility question, stability is far better for us than volatility when it comes to oil and how it impacts raw material costs. And if it stays stable in the 60 range, we feel very good about our forecast. If it pops back to 85, obviously, we will get back into having to chase that raws up, but hopefully that\u2019s because demand is incredibly strong and the economy is recovering, if we\u2019re in that scenario, we have all the pricing power to do so.","John Roberts","And then it seemed like you had really strong performance in Saflex in the quarter. And was that in-spite of inventory destocking your channel supply correction and so that it gets even stronger as you get into the second and third quarters?","Mark Costa","The business was really pretty stable. It wasn\u2019t much of a destocking event there. That was really isolated, especially plastics. So there we have such strong growth in innovation products with heads-up display and acoustics that are very high margin. So as those are growing at very high rates, the margin mix up grade you get is great. So the overall square meters could be down a little bit with the auto market, but the volume mix situation is actually quite strong. And I think that trend just continues as we go to the first quarter, same in performance films. It\u2019s remarkable that not only was North America a great story of growth, but China was a great story of growth through the fourth quarter even with car sales being down because our paint protection films are growing at incredible rates and very high values as we penetrate and develop really that market. So \u2013 and that trend again will continue as we go into the \u2013 in the first quarter.","So destocking demand situation is really about speedboat as well as the raw material situation was also entirely about specialty plastics, where you had such a dramatic spike up in PX, which was a bit unique relative to the other raw materials in the third quarter and having to sort of get that through the system. ","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Curt, I was wondering if you could provide some color as to what you are assuming for two things, working capital and cash taxes in formulating the free cash flow guidance for 2019?","Curt Espeland","Good morning, Kevin. So yes, we are expecting another strong cash flow. If I think about just the moving parts, it\u2019s not the two that you mentioned. We are expecting earnings to improve, so that should help us translate into cash, because we know how to convert earnings into cash. Working capital should improve compared to 2018 because we\u2019re not anticipating that same impact of higher raws as it flows through working capital items, such as inventory and receivables. We will still have some growth in working capital for our growth programs, but as a whole, the value should improve during the course of the year. I had also mentioned that you\u2019ll see in the Appendix we\u2019re going to moderate slightly our capital expenditures.","So offsetting all those positive things, you did see a step up in cash taxes or you\u2019ll see a step up in our cash taxes in 2018 as we no longer enjoy the benefits of those NOLs from the Solutia acquisition. And I think that will continue in 2019 as we move back into more normal cash tax payments and that headwind could be say $50 million to $75 million on higher cash tax payments in 20 over 208. But again, we\u2019re going to generate greater than $1.1 billion and over the course of the year we\u2019ll see how much greater over $1.1 billion it will be.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And I realized the new textile products are not enormous for you, but would you comment on how big that business is? And would you expect the growth profile to remain in the 30% range going forward?","Mark Costa","Yes. We\u2019ve had tremendous success in this business and it\u2019s really exciting, because it\u2019s really core to our story of Eastman and how we take these world-class technology streams, develop all these new applications have created this diverse set of products off of the silos extremely just like we have done in polyester and several other streams. And we\u2019re really proud of the team who engaged in this and so it\u2019s now probably about 16% of our revenue in the Fibers business. And if you look back three or four years, it was a much smaller percentage. So really changing the mix and quality of where we can get growth in the \u2013 into the Fibers business and these new growth applications. And that gives us that confidence of stability and looking for a very modest kind of growth out of this business if you look at the long-term.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Lawrence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Alexander","Good morning. One end-market question and one high-level question. On the end-markets, could you give a little bit of around the world take on what you are seeing in commercial construction trends? And secondly, can you give a sense for how lean you think Eastman is now? And what I mean by that is if demand does surprise on the downside in the back half of 2019 or 2020, how much room is there for cost-cutting in response?","Mark Costa","Sure. So from a commercial activity point \u2013 commercial construction point of view, I think that was your question Laurence, Europe has actually been pretty strong. There is a nice backlog that we can see of commercial buildings going up and they have a lot more glass on them, as I mentioned earlier and that\u2019s been driving very strong growth in Europe. Same in North America. We see commercial construction fairly good.","China is a little bit of wildcard and not relevant to us as much on the commercial side, because we don\u2019t really sell our interlayers into that market. And if you think about our coatings business with our textile on to the architectural additives, that\u2019s a little bit more residential oriented than it is commercial oriented in the volumes. And that overall I think has been relatively stable for us and a good source of growth, net of the current economic situation.","When it comes to your second question, which is if we head into more of a recessionary kind of situation, what we can do with costs. I\u2019ll break that down into sort of two parts. So on the manufacturing side, one of the big advantages we have of our large integrated sites is how we staff and operate them to give us flexibility in our cost structure when things are really strong, like the first nine months of last year versus where we are now versus that decline in demand question. And the way we build on that flexibility is quite a few of our employee base are contractors and we also use a lot of over time to run the plants really hard. And what\u2019s nice about that is as demand comes off, you can pull that lever and reduce those spends quite quickly, which we already have started doing in the current situation. And if demand falls further, you can pull those costs down even faster with less volume. So we have some flexibility built in there that can be meaningful to manage our cost structure.","On the SG&A and R&D side, it\u2019s a little but different. If you look at where we have been in SG&A and R&D, we have been quite successful in holding the costs relatively flat through productivity. And I would mention that\u2019s actually true for the total complex. Right? So if you look at 2014 through 2017, we did about a $1 billion of cost savings productivity that allows to completely offset inflation in that time period. As we told you in 2018, our costs were going to go up about $50 million. By the way, most of that is in manufacturing, not in SG&A and R&D, but it was a $50 million headwind to us last year against variable margin growth. And now, we\u2019re going to take it back down to being flat.","So I think that the SG&A and R&D though has less flexibility for pulling it down because we\u2019re already still efficient. On that side, we\u2019re already in the bottom quartile of SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales in this industry and we have one of the most successful and robust innovation portfolios. So, we\u2019re already being incredibly efficient with our spend on that side of things. And we are increasing growth investments in the commercial R&D area there, but we\u2019re offsetting it with cost cutting everywhere else. There is less ability to sort of pull that number down in a meaningful way and stay on strategy with our innovation and growth. But net, I think we feel very well positioned for all of this. And I had also mentioned on our cash flow side, if you go into slowdown like that, you free up a lot of cash in the inventory receivables. So we feel very confident of our cash position in a more dramatic slowdown.","Lawrence Alexander","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just wanted to understand, maybe you can just give us your commentary on some of the end-markets, automotive obviously has been an area that we have seen quite a bit of destocking, especially in China and pullbacks and builds. How does that have affect your business and maybe you can also touch on what you\u2019re seeing in paints and coatings? Thanks.","Mark Costa","Sure. So overall market on the transportation sector, I would say, has been relatively good last year, obviously, slowed down especially in China in the fourth quarter and as I mentioned earlier despite that in Advanced Materials, we were able to deliver strong volume and mix growth through the end of the year. When you get over to coatings and tires in the AFP segment, it\u2019s a little bit different. We\u2019re a little more tied to sort of the actual underlying market trends. We do have some robust growth in things like resins, in tires as well as some of our ketones and other growth projects inside coatings. But we\u2019re going to track a little bit more with demand there. And that\u2019s where you saw some of that destocking take place. I would \u2013 and it was \u2013 there is a lot of it going on in China and I would mention some of it also going on in particular in tires in Europe.","In the tire market, the tire produces have a bit of a slinky effect sometimes through the year on how they produce relative to what\u2019s flowing through their relatively complex distribution in retail channel. So every once in a while, you go through this corrections of \u2013 they\u2019ve produced more than where demand is at. And we saw some of that inventory correction going on in China and Europe in the fourth quarter and you can look at the tire companies, they all have identified that markets are sort of slowing down.","The important thing to keep in mind though about these businesses is exposure is quite different for us when it comes to OEM and aftermarket, and we\u2019re a lot more balanced. So, in AFP, it\u2019s about 50-50 in the OEM exposure versus refinish, really in coatings, in tires, it\u2019s actually 25% OEMs, 75% refinish. You also would remember that we are much more levered to commercial tires than passenger tires in the amount of Crystex that is consumed in the much larger rubber content of a commercial tire. So it\u2019s very dangerous to over interpret a decline in OEM personal car production as a headwind for us across our businesses. ","Arun Viswanathan","All right. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, you had mentioned that AFP could be maybe at the lower end of, say 5% to 7% and AM would be at the upper end of 7% to 9% EBIT growth for the full year. I guess both of those imply a pretty sharp snap back in Q2 through Q4. So, maybe, you could just give us your confidence level in that. And just asking because again there seems to be some concern about the level of destocking versus declining primary demand, so if it is more of the latter, just wondering, how we get that sharp snap back in Q2 through Q4? Thanks.","Mark Costa","Yes. Great question. Obviously, when we spent a lot of time debating and as we said, we\u2019re in an uncertain world right now. So, it\u2019s a little hard to predict what the macroeconomy is going to be for the year. So, what we\u2019re assuming as a slow growth world, not as robust as the first half of last year and that is a planning assumption. The \u2013 we are pretty clear in our line of sight to inventory destocking going on in coatings and tires and specialty plastics with these very high value products. And so you can only destock for so long. And so you can see through that and then AM, again, I told you it\u2019s all predominantly exports back to the U.S. So, as long as U.S. consumers in place, the destocking will hit an end and then demand will recover.","So, we actually feel pretty good about that. Coatings and tires, a little more exposed to the Chinese consumer. So that\u2019s a little bit less clear, which is why we\u2019re being a little more conservative in our guidance in AFP than in Advanced Materials. And \u2013 but we still see the destocking coming to an end, the question just is where is the Chinese economy for the rest of the year. And our belief is it\u2019s actually still relatively good right now, but there is a lot of short-term caution by consumers. And if the trade war doesn\u2019t escalate, it will come back.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from PJ Juvekar from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","PJ Juvekar","Yes. Thank you and good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","PJ Juvekar","Mark, you talked about tire products and destocking there. So on Crystex, you had some smaller players shut down in China last year due to environmental reasons. But now with the auto industry slowing down, where do we stand on Crystex inventories? And was Crystex a big contributor to the 400 basis points margin decline in AFP in the quarter?","Mark Costa","No, Crystex wasn\u2019t a big contributor. I mean, most of the \u2013 I mean, there was some destocking of Crystex, of course, like some of the very high-value additives we have in coatings and that contributed to some of the headwind. But the bigger factor was obviously just high raw material costs flowing through relative to pricing for the overall segment. And we feel great about Crystex going forward. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 it is a market that\u2019s had waves of competitive activity, as you noted, some of those competitors have left. There\u2019s always new competitors coming back in and that\u2019s why we focus on innovation versus just looking at supply-demand balances for our future. And this is a place, where we\u2019ve been incredibly successful in innovation.","So the new Crystex plant is up and running well in last year for the Cure Pro and Cure product lines, which provide far superior heat stability and efficiency in helping the tire plants run incredibly well. We\u2019re talking fairly meaningful improvements in tire plant productivity, because this mixing step where our product is used is typically the bottleneck for running a plant fast.","So, the adoption rate has been great. We\u2019re focusing on innovation. This is all patented and we\u2019ve even got another generation product beyond this one that is sort of revolutionary and what we can provide to the tire companies on the horizon that takes us even beyond this. So, this is a business that\u2019s got a lot of innovation opportunity and ways to keep it moving.","PJ Juvekar","Great. Thank you. And then I want to go back to your RGP project on the cracker. It looks like that $20 million investment is working well. Can you quantify the benefit in 2019? And as you make less merchant ethylene, you \u2013 how much less propane and propylene do you buy? Can you just give us the mass balance around that? Thank you.","Mark Costa","Well, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Greg to give you some of the mass balance stuff, because he is helping communicate there. But I\u2019m not going to give you a specific number just on the improved ethylene. I would say that\u2019s embedded in our overall guidance in CI. What the benefits are is that simply we produce less merchant ethylene. And thus the pressure we felt on that in 2018, which you can quantify pretty easily with the market data, we\u2019re just not going to have that merchant ethylene sale. And I\u2019d like Greg talk about the balance.","Greg Riddle","Yes. So if you remember on a corporate basis, we produced about 1.4 billion pounds, 1.5 billion pounds of ethylene. About half of that, we sell into the market. And with the RGP investment, we\u2019ll be producing about 80% less of the ethylene that we would normally sell into the market. So obviously, much less exposure to the merchant ethylene market as a result of this project as opposed to what we normally have.","Mark Costa","It\u2019s also great volatility reducer, because PGP to RGP is very stable, if you go look at history relative to what you can see on the propylene and ethylene relative to propane. So, it also sort of mitigates volatility as well.","PJ Juvekar","But you also buy less propylene, right?","Curt Espeland","We\u2019re buying\u2026","Mark Costa","No, actually because of the RGP\u2026","Curt Espeland","Yes, we\u2019re fire grade\u2026","Mark Costa","Being substituted, which is obviously, propylene as a feedstock, it actually produces just a little bit more propylene.","Curt Espeland","And PJ, we\u2019ll send you a chart that we have that can help you manage now through this balanced state.","PJ Juvekar","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning folks. I just want to understand better when your customers destocked in Q4, did you guys get the inverse of that and that you had to eat some inventory or were you able to ramp back your production enough that that wasn\u2019t the case? And if it was, can you kind of help us size how much on your balance sheet was in excess because of that effect?","Mark Costa","Sure. Yes. No, because of the stocking kind of played out through the quarter and was more pronounced as we ended the year, we in fact had difficulty adjusting our operations to fully overcome the destocking in our own production rates. To size it, maybe just look at the difference between our targeted free cash flow and what we achieved. Maybe that\u2019ll give you some sense of what that inventory effect was.","Duffy Fischer","Okay, great. And then just a second one. On the ability now to ship tow into China from Korea, is that meaningful or not meaningful for this segment?","Mark Costa","To me, fully keeping the segment stable. So when you look at \u2013 we had tow sales into China until August in 2018. And if they had stuck to their policy this year of no tow from the U.S. or even without qualifying in Korea, that would have been a headwind for us. By getting Korea qualified, that allows us to keep things relatively stable to 2018.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you guys.","Greg Riddle","Holly, let\u2019s make the next question the last one please.","Operator","Okay. We will take our last question from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Matthew Blair","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I was a little surprised at the quarter-over-quarter decline in CI, just given that the propane cracking margins seemed like they should have improved for you. Could you just walk through the main moving parts here and perhaps provide some sort of break-out of the impacts you saw in intermediates versus means versus plasticizers? Thanks.","Mark Costa","So first of all, we weren\u2019t selling ethylene in the quarter and have some of the unobserved fixed cost as a result of that. Second, you have prices coming off with the raw material environment as they tend to do in Chemical Intermediates, but still at a slow flow through of raw material costs on that basis, in particular in some of the acetyl products and a few of the olefin products. So that really is what drove the earnings to come in year-over-year lower.","Curt Espeland","And if I could add to that Matthew, don\u2019t forget, we were not able to turn our inventory over. And so we have \u2013 still have that higher valued inventory sitting in our manufacturing sites, a good portion of that is attributable to CI and we\u2019re live full shop and what that does to our earnings in a particular fourth quarter item.","Mark Costa","Yes. Even CI is seasonally lower in volume sequentially from the third quarter to fourth quarter, so that just spike in raw materials in the third quarter is a real tough timing in the year to get rid of it.","Matthew Blair","Great. Thank you.","Mark Costa","So I just want to wrap up and say that obviously, we recognized fourth quarter was tough and the first quarter is not what we wanted to be. But as we look at the future of this company and all the investments we\u2019ve made that innovation-driven growth model really does give us the ability to push through this kind of environment, continue to create value and find ways to grow and we\u2019re also sensitive to the environment we\u2019re in right now and aggressively managing costs more than normal to make sure that we translate very well margin growth from the top line to EBIT a lot quicker this year than what we were able to do last year with the headwinds that we had relative to what we\u2019re expecting this year. So that leverage I think is an important part as we think about the overall math in a slow growth world this year being able to deliver quite strong earnings growth once we get passed the first quarter. So, appreciate all the questions and thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen...","Greg Riddle","Thanks again for joining us this morning. Have a great day. Go ahead, Holly. Go ahead.","Operator","Yeah. Sorry. This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. "],"7951":["Eastman Chemical Co.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Eastman Chemical Company's Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman website at www.eastman.com.","We'll now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory Riddle","Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager-Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's third quarter 2016 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2016 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2016.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core costs, charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures including a description of the excluded items, are available in the third quarter 2016 financial results news release. You can find this on our website at www.eastman.com in the Investor section. Projection of future earnings also exclude any non-core unusual or nonrecurring items.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide three. I'll begin my comments by reviewing our strategic highlights for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016.","We continued to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines, a key component of our winning strategy. And I have increasing confidence about the breadth and depth of our innovation portfolio which is significantly more compelling today than it was three years ago.","One of our recent innovation successes is within our tire resins platform in the Additives and Functional Products segment. Tire manufacturers face a significant challenge in improving fuel efficiency while maintaining traction safety. Eastman is uniquely qualified to meet this challenge. We are the world leader in resin technology chemistry. I'm pleased to report that we have gained commercial approval with a major tire producer for two new proprietary products and are in the process of sampling a full range of resins with selected innovation partners.","So far this year the tire resins platform has delivered approximately 20% volume growth over 2015 with margins above the corporate average. This is a great example of revenue synergy from the Solutia acquisition combining a strong market connect and application development capability with our resin technology platform.","Moving next to our capital projects that support our specialty growth. We are leveraging our unique innovation capabilities and investing for long-term growth where it counts. From Tritan to inter-layers to Crystex, we are the world leader in both process technology and product offerings and are winning through our innovation platforms. We are walking the talk with our investments in growth and specialty products and seeing the results.","We are therefore driving hard to complete these capital projects to support our growth. All three of these projects are on target to finish on or well below budget which demonstrates our competitive advantage through best-in-class engineering, construction and operational capabilities.","In a slow growth world, we are creating our own growth and investing capital smartly. We also are proving that we can drive innovation while managing costs aggressively. We remain well on track with our cost reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line in 2016 without sacrificing our investment in long-term growth initiatives.","These efforts include implementation of hundreds of projects across our global footprint. One example is the successful initiative recently completed by our process control team. We were able to utilize a plant loader program associated with our largest cracker in Longview, Texas. The initiative increased feed efficiency saving almost $2 million in cost. This is a great example of how our significant scale and integration at our two largest sites provide us a unique competitive advantage where we have dedicated experts in a wide range of specialized operational disciplines.","We also leverage these experts across the globe to optimize performance in the smaller manufacturing sites from our acquisitions to our sites we have had for a long time.","In addition, we remain on track to execute our second cost-reduction initiative this quarter which we expect will deliver an additional $100 million to the bottom line in 2017.","Productivity is a core capability at Eastman. Over the past five years, we removed almost $700 million in cost to offset inflation and deliver results to the bottom line while maintaining our commitment to quality, reliability and safety.","We are continuing to innovate throughout our enterprise in product development, in how we think about manufacturing, and our approach to productivity across all of our functions. All of these areas will contribute to our strong growth going forward.","With that I will turn it over to Curt to discuss corporate and segment results.","Curtis Espeland","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our third-quarter results on slide four. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower fiber sales volumes more than offsetting higher sales volume in all other segments.","Our operating earnings declined as an increase in advanced materials was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Despite the challenging business environment, our operating margin was above 18%. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.86 for the quarter as actions we took led to both operating earnings and taxes coming in better than expected.","Moving next to the segment results and starting with Advanced Materials on slide five which delivered another quarter of impressive growth driven by our innovation platforms. Third quarter sales revenue increased due to double-digit volume growth of premium products. Eastman Tritan copolyester once again had a record volume quarter as we continued to lead in consumer durables and housewares.","Saflex acoustic inter-layers continued their strong growth this year as applications have expanded from the windshield to the side windows and the sunroof as well as expand into more models. Performance Film volumes were strong this quarter due to an excellent new channel strategy in North America and China.","The volume and mix improvement was partially offset by lower selling prices primarily for core copolyesters attributed to lower raw material costs. Operating earnings were up 22% or $25 million primarily driven by higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products as well as lower unit costs due to higher capacity utilization.","Operating margins for the quarter increased by approximately 350 basis points to over 22%. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we are expecting normal seasonal decline in volume. With that said, we expect Advanced Materials will deliver low double-digit earnings growth for the full year of 2016 and anticipate this business can continue to deliver strong growth again in 2017. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment.","Now to Additives and Functional Products on slide six. Sales revenue declined primarily due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs partially offset by higher sales volume. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs and higher sales volume.","The operating margin remained solid at over 21%. For full-year 2016, we continue to expect higher volumes and expect prices have mostly stabilized. One other item I thought would be useful as you analyze this segment this year, we have been operating under a new organizational structure for a couple of quarters now which if you recall put some major product moves between Additives and Functional Products and Chemical Intermediates.","As we analyze how resources and costs are flowing, it is coming out a little different than we expected in our historical recast. As you consider year-over-year comps, about $20 million or more costs are flowing through Additives and Functional Products in 2016 than what was reflected in the $660 million recasted view for them in 2015 while approximately $20 million less is flowing to Chemical Intermediates.","Putting it all together, Additives and Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full-year earnings to be somewhat down which would be a solid result in the current business climate. As pricing stabilizes, we expect solid earnings growth next year through market volume growth and our innovation effort.","Now to Fibers on slide seven. Third quarter revenue, volume and earnings were in line with our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow sales volume was primarily due to reduced sales into China.","Operating earnings declined due to lower sales volume. The lower selling prices were offset by recent actions we took to reduce raw material costs and actions to reduce operating costs. As a result, operating margins held at approximately 32%.","Our full year outlook has not changed as we continue to expect second half earnings to be similar to first half which includes tow volumes being down approximately 10% for the year.","I'll also mention that we continued contract negotiations through 2017 and anticipate earnings for the segment to be down roughly 20% next","year.","We remain confident in our long-term position and strongly believe that Fibers will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward.","I will finish up the segment review with Chemical Intermediates on slide eight. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices. We attributed these lower selling prices to continued competitive pressures due to lower oil prices and weak demand in Asia-Pacific.","Operating earnings declined primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs and lower hedge costs. During the quarter, we saw some modest improvement in the overall business environment impacting chemical intermediates and now expect earnings in the back half of the year to be slightly higher than the first half and we expect this improvement to continue into next year.","Lastly, I will give you a quick update on our process for divesting our excess ethylene capacity and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential partners or parties and now anticipate this process will carry into next year though I will add that executing a transaction in this current environment remains challenging.","On slide nine I will transition to an overview of our cash flows, our other financial highlights for the third quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash with third-quarter operating cash flow of $450 million. We contributed $50 million to our US pension plans in the quarter.","Capital expenditures totaled $141 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while maintaining growth investments and continue to expect full-year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million.","Free cash flow for the quarter was a strong $309 million and during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $160 million, paid our third-quarter dividend of $68 million and repurchased $75 million of our shares. Through nine months of 2016, we have reduced debt by $400 million and returned almost $325 million to our stockholders.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was just over 21% as we are benefiting from foreign tax credits and other positive tax attributes. We expect our full-year tax rate will be between 22% and 23% which is better than previous expectations reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations. We continue to look for every opportunity to reduce costs including taxes from both an earnings and cash flow standpoint. This quarter was another great example of our tax team finding such opportunities including amending previously filed tax returns.","Lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for this year which is a very strong performance in the current environment.","With that I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Curt. On page 10, we've talked a lot about the benefits of our portfolio transformation and how that contributes to more consistent earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation. You can see that our portfolio transformation has been a key element to delivering strong earnings for quite some time.","Over the last six years, we have taken decisive actions to improve our portfolio through acquiring attractive specialty businesses and divesting underperforming businesses. We acquired these specialty companies at reasonable valuations with very attractive synergies that we have delivered.","Organically, we have grown our volume and more importantly upgraded our mix. This is both within our heritage businesses and within the acquired businesses through great efforts in our innovation programs and through our commercial excellence.","As a result of these efforts, you can see a very different story from who we were before versus today. We have improved the earnings mix across segments significantly. In 2010, Fibers and Chemical Intermediates were roughly 60% of the corporate earnings. Today that percentage is closer to 30%.","For 2016, we expect that the combination of Advanced Materials and Additives and Functional Products will represent approximately 70% of our earnings and even in this environment, our EPS CAGR will still be roughly 11% from 2010 to 2016.","We also dramatically improved our free cash flow, almost tripling it from 2010 to 2016. With improvements in our core businesses and adding the strong free cash flow generation from our acquisitions has potentially upgraded the quality of our portfolio. And we are still investing capital to deliver long-term growth in our specialty businesses while we generate one of the strongest free cash flows in this industry.","On slide 11, I will discuss our 2016 outlook. We are doing a great job of executing our strategy in a challenging global business environment. Strong growth of high-value innovative products continue as we benefit from leading positions in our attractive niche markets. We are seeing benefits of scale and integration translating to growth in earnings and we continue to invest in innovation and product development so we can sustain our momentum into the coming years. We are also seeing be benefit of acquisition synergies in both cost and revenue. At the same time, we are achieving our cost reduction goals. I can't say enough about how our Eastman employees globally who made this possible.","As I mentioned earlier, productivity is in the DNA of Eastman and I remain very confident we will achieve our cost reduction targets for 2017. In addition, we are using all lines of the income statement to support our performance this year including lower tax rates.","All of these actions are helping to offset the challenges from low oil, sluggish global GDP growth and the challenges we face in fibers. Putting all of this together, our outlook for adjusted full-year 2016 earnings per share has improved to between $6.70 and $6.80 which I consider to be a solid result given our challenges.","We also continue to expect strong free cash flow this year above $900 million. We are creating value for our stakeholders with our balanced and disciplined allocation of this cash, increasing our dividend, increasing share repurchases and continued delevering.","With this momentum in mind I will make a few comments about 2017. On the last call, I indicated we have confidence that we can get back on track for EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range in 2017 and we continue to be confident. As we look at it, we expect growth and innovation driven mix improvement in Advanced Materials and Functional Products.","Cost reduction actions contribute about $0.50 per share. The net of propane and currency hedges continue to roll off in 2017 to contribute about $0.30 per share. An increase in the level of share repurchases while maintaining a balanced approach with deleveraging.","We continue to use all of the lines of the income statement to contribute to EPS growth. These would more than offset the roughly $0.30 per share headwind from Fibers and the preproduction expenses from our new specialty plants.","The combination of these factors would get us to EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range.","I would also note that we don't need the world to get much better to achieve this growth and if things get better, there is upside.","We will talk more about the outlook for 2017 in our fourth-quarter call in January. But I believe it is important now for you to understand why we are confident about delivering strong earnings growth and strong free cash flow in 2017.","This has been a tough year and I'm proud of our employees around the world who have maintained focus and positioned us for growth going forward. I'm confident that 2017 will be a better year for Eastman.","Most importantly, I believe that we are building one of the world's leading specialty companies to deliver long-term sustainable growth in a world where you need to create your own growth.","With that I will turn it back over to Greg.","Gregory Riddle","Thanks, Mark. We've got a lot of people on the line this morning this morning and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, Ron, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Mark, thank you for the 2017 outlook, the early read. On 2017, can you talk a little bit about the free cash flow that 8% to 12% will generate and the uses of that free cash next year as well?","Mark Costa","We will let Curt handle that question. I just want to add before he does that, we are really excited about getting back to this path of earnings growth. We feel great about all the levers in front of us to get there and certainly expect it to improve our cash.","Curtis Espeland","As Mark highlighted earlier and if I could, Eastman has one of the best portfolios I think that can generate cash in the industry and you are seeing that in the results and also you'll see that next year. We do expect higher free cash flows next year as we see operating earnings grow as well as we will see a modest decline in our CapEx.","A couple of factors to think about when I am looking at 2017 cash flow is we will be watching what kind of raw material environment we are facing, if we expect higher raws, as you know that is going to give us some challenges in working capital that we will try to offset.","I also am expecting some higher cash taxes next year as we have now fully utilized the NOLs as part of the Solutia transaction as well as you know there is a phaseout of bonus depreciation for manufacturers like Eastman.","So putting it all together though, we are going to generate free cash flow over $900 million. With the earnings outlook that Mark talked about, I wouldn't be surprised if we see free cash flow approaching $1 billion.","The allocation, what you will see is still a balance across the different buckets that we have. You know our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation but what you will see is some more balanced approach to deleveraging and share repurchases with that free cash flow.","So if you think about deleveraging was the predominant use of cash flow this last couple of years that will moderate to be more balanced. And so you will see share repurchase probably in excess of $300 million.","David Begleiter","Excellent. And Mark, you have seen some pricing increase announcements in oxos and plasticizers. Can you comment on the cadence of those price increases and how they could contribute to 2017 earnings growth?","Mark Costa","Sure, David. We are seeing traction in getting price increases in September and into October as the propylene and ethylene markets have strengthened, that has put pressure across the globe and played out as we expected in our second-quarter call. We saw that our competitors especially the Asians setting price on a lot of these products on a global basis.","We are starting to hit their cost positions and as oil strengthened and their raw material cost, who often purchase propylene, ethylene was going up, they would face pressured increased prices and that is what we are seeing. So it is very encouraging to actually see prices go up for once. It has been a long time.","We do expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter and carry into next year but obviously that will depend a bit on the raw material environment. So we will have to see where oil and olefin prices go. But we are happy to see the change in the direction and some traction right now.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort","Thank you very much. Good morning.","Mark Costa","Morning, Bob.","Robert Koort","I was wondering if you could talk, two items real quick, an update on how the Kuantan plants are progressing and when you might see some commissioning of those? And then secondly, can you speak a little bit about the volatility you have seen in Advanced Materials?","Obviously you had a very nice showing again this quarter after a bit of a dip the prior. But what is sort of the path forward and the level of consistency or reduced volatility you might be able to deliver out of the business? Thanks.","Mark Costa","We are making great progress on both our Crystex and our PVB plants in Kuantan and driving hard to get those up in the back half of next year. And as I said, they are on track and we are excited.","Customers around our new Crystex product that we are producing off of this new process technology are very excited and we are feeling pressure to get the plant up as quickly as we can to serve this new interest in the better performing product. The growth rates have largely been fantastic so we need to get the plant up to keep our growth.","In regards to Advanced Materials, they are just having a phenomenal year like they had a phenomenal year last year and it is really proof of our strategy we have been talking about for the last five years. We said we we're going to drive growth through innovation and that is what we are doing.","In Tritan, in heads-up display and acoustic inter-layers and our performance films business all delivering double-digit growth and driving not just the sort of overall volume growth but the mix upgrade with all those products growing at such high rates with above segment and above company average margins.","So it is just a good story, it is really very little of it is a raw material tailwind and what is driving the results which gives us confidence that it will sustain going forward. And obviously third quarter was a quarter where everything just ran really well. We had good volume, good mix.","The plants run incredibly well. One of the challenges in these kind of businesses where you are making such a physical product is you have yield and quality issues and we just had a really clean quarter in how we ran the plants.","Robert Koort","Terrific, thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Mike Sison from KeyBanc.","Q \u2013Mike Sison","Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Mark, could you help us out a little bit in terms of looking at Additive and Functional Products. It is sort of sitting in this specialty area in your bar chart so the earnings are going to be slightly down. Can you kind of parse out, there is a lot of business in there, what is growing?","And maybe just kind of highlight the areas that the specialty business there that are showing earnings growth and maybe some of the headwinds, the hedges and stuff that is kind of impacting that?","Mark Costa","Sure. So first of all, this portfolio is a great set of specialty businesses, tremendous additives that add a lot of functionality across our customers in coatings, tires, adhesives and animal nutrition, crop, etc. It is just a great business of unique additives. So we view it as a business that will continue to grow.","As you look at the pricing which I think is the key question and how it has come off, prices have really stabilized since the second quarter so we did a great job of holding onto raw material value at the beginning of last year, started giving some of it back in the third quarter but really started giving it back in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year as we decided to share value with our customers. But those prices have stabilized.","Really didn't have much sequential decline in prices at all from second-quarter into the third-quarter this year and we expect the same sort of stability as we go into the fourth quarter. You will see that even on a year-over-year basis, January as you see the trends in the fourth quarter. So that feels very stable to us an appropriate.","We actually expect prices probably to start moving up in the coatings area especially on the olefin related products. The specialties are a little slower on prices on the way down. They are also slower on the way up. So Chemical Intermediates has already started to move on the pricing front and we expect as we go into next year, those prices on the specialty related products will also start to move up with these current market conditions.","That all feels directionally correct to me. I think the important point is how you sustain these margins and continue to deliver growth over the long-term. It is easy to hold onto prices when raws drop but if you do that too aggressively and not share some of it with your customers you really create a problem with those customers being engaged and working with you on any future renovation.","I think we have struck the right balance here and we are seeing that in the proof of our innovation successes. We are just having tremendous success throughout the AFP portfolio with innovation. Our Polyester Coatings is doing tremendously well, we talked to you about that in the first-quarter call and we have gone from three to 10 customers aggressively working with us on how to commercialize our product and take it to market.","We are seeing great success in the tire resins that I just told you about. We're seeing great success in the Aerafin olefin products that I told you about in the second quarter call that go with the adhesive resins. We continue to see great traction in our low odor coalescence.","So across the portfolio you are seeing a lot of innovation, a lot of traction. And as I said before, this is a little bit slower in getting started than Advanced Materials but as you look at the next three years, you are going to see all of these innovation programs driving growth and mix improvement here just like what we are doing at Advanced Materials.","What I love is we are proving across the board that we can deliver growth and innovation, we can create our own growth. We are not waiting for the economy to get better and that is the story you are going to see us deliver over the next three years.","Mike Sison","Great. And I know you don't want to be too specific on '17 yet per segment but if Additives and Functional Products grows volume next year, hedges come off, is there any reason why this segment wouldn't participate in showing some good earnings growth next year?","Mark Costa","We expect AFP to show good earnings growth next year as a combination of modest market volume growth. We are not assuming an improving economy next year just to be clear but we do assume there is an economy growing somewhat. So we will get some volume growth, we will get some mix improvement through the innovation.","We will certainly see some benefits of the hedge but remember 80% of the hedge benefit flows to Chemical Intermediates so it is modest here. And of course the broader cost management programs, a certain amount of that benefit is going to flow into this segment.","Mike Sison","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions. Curt, just a little bit of a clarification. I think you said that you are planning on doing at least $300 million of share buyback in 2017. Obviously you did $75 million this quarter, Q3. Should we assume that pace, that same $75 million plus pace in Q4 as well?","Curtis Espeland","We will look at various uses of our cash in the fourth quarter. If we don't have more attractive uses of that cash, yes, some of that cash will be deployed for share repurchases.","Frank Mitsch","I'll take that as a yes, thank you.","Curtis Espeland","I am just saying, Frank, there is always competing uses of cash in the fourth quarter and we are going to look at all the options but in absence of others attractive options, yes, share repurchases will be one of the leading ideas for our deployment of our cash.","Frank Mitsch","Got you. Just kidding. I have to ask a question, Mark, with respect to fibers and the positioning the portfolio. 2015 very difficult year, '16 very difficult year, '17 you just changed guidance from 10% to 20% down to now down 20%.","As I think about some of the shifting that is going on there, we used to kind of count on annual sort of contracts with your customers there but now we are hearing of multi-year contracts.","So if you guys are structuring multi-year contracts, are we setting the stage where 2018 and 2019 are also going to be more difficult years? Can you talk a little bit about the prospects for that business post another difficult year?","Mark Costa","Sure, Frank. We obviously spend an extensive amount of time talking about what is going on in the fibers business from demand trends to competitive behavior. And I think I provided quite a long soliloquy on this one in the second quarter call. So I will try and be sort of brief on it now.","Bottom line is you've got a situation where demand situations weakened across the globe, specifically the imports in China and that has created pressure on pricing. And what we are seeing right now is that pricing pressure play out into the 2017 timeframe. Our objective is we can just keep the business stable. That has been our objective from the beginning. We took capacity out in the UK as we added capacity in China and we also exited some flake capacity as well.","On the pricing front, we have attempted to be as stable as we can be on the pricing. Unfortunately we got pushed pretty aggressively on some of our competitors trying to take share from us outside of China. And all we are trying to do is defend our share and keep it stable outside of China.","We are not trying to recover lost imports in China by taking share outside of China. We think the best way to do that is to get multi-year contracts on volume and price in place with many of our large customers which will provide stability actually from '17 into '18 and '19 as we provide security supply to our customers but also provide security demand to us.","So I think that those actions are actually going to put us in the right direction as far as the things we can do to control the outcome in this industry and our performance and we will just have to see how the rest of it plays out.","Frank Mitsch","All right, great. That is helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Good morning.","Mark Costa","Morning, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Do you have to take another restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of comparable size in order to accomplish your cost-cutting program next year?","Curtis Espeland","No. The restructuring charge you saw in the third quarter pretty much covers the restructuring program we have underway.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And in terms of taxes, are your cash taxes in books -- how different are your cash taxes and book taxes this year and your expectation for next year? And what do think your fibers volume growth rate is in 2017?","Curtis Espeland","I will talk about the taxes. Again as you know Jeff, you can see a lot of what is going on with our cash tax rate versus current, just what goes through our deferred tax line in the cash flow statement and so you see that has improved this year. And again, that is again a lot of great work that occurs with our tax finance and legal teams who are looking for ways to really how do we help reduce costs and how do we help cash flows within this company?","And so when I look at that going into next year, I do believe again we won't have the benefits of those NOLs from Solutia that we have enjoyed and in fact as mentioned earlier, we have utilized all the NOLs since the acquisition in 2012 and so that was at an accelerated pace because of that great work, and again the phaseout of bonus depreciation. So there is a pretty good opportunity for us to continue to look at our cash tax rate but it will be more challenging as we go for the next several years.","Mark Costa","On the fibers demand, I will take that one, Jeff. Outside of China, we don't expect any changes in trends where the markets continue to decline 1% to 2% a year which has been true for a long time. Inside China, demand in China is a complicated and opaque question. Right now we have seen some changes in production rate, cigarette productions, where they've taken it down 6% to 7% which is great because I think they are just destocking primarily with those actions.","You have to remember the production rates are not equal to primary consumption rates. We do expect that they had trouble destocking cigarettes in '15 and '16 -- I'm sorry, '15 and '14.","So I think that we are actually encouraged to see them take the actions to finally address that issue like they are already addressing at the tow inventory level as well. So in some ways I think there is progress to put this behind us. Primary demand is \u2026","Jeff Zekauskas","So roughly your volume growth is minus 10 next year?","Mark Costa","No, no, no. That is not what I said. I said this year we are seeing cigarette production being reduced in China and I think that is destocking. As we look at next year, what we hope is they complete their destocking this year and demand at the production level is stable next year versus this year and that is sort of our assumption at this point.","So when you look at next year, I think imports are going to be somewhat stable, they could be a bit off as they finish out some destocking at the cigarette level and we will just have to see how it plays out.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from PJ Juvekar from Citi.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, good morning. A question on Crystex. You seem to be doing a good job on innovation but the OEM market -- the other OEM market is slowing, the classic drug market seems to be slowing as well. So can you talk about demand there and is there any generic competition from China coming in?","Mark Costa","So in auto demand, it sort of impacts us in multiple places. So in Advanced Materials, which is very OEM driven, we are looking at that. What has been great about our success to date is we are creating a lot of our own earnings growth from mix upgrade in double digit growth in things like acoustics and head-up display as well as a new channel strategy in performance films where we are growing the whole size of the market and our share of it.","So even in a slow automotive growth world, we can still deliver growth, it may not be as high as this year but still deliver growth. So I feel good about where we are there. And we see tremendous innovation opportunities continuing out there to add more functionality to the windows as we work with our customers and next-generation of acoustics and head-up display as well as other functionality. So it is just a very robust opportunity for growth.","On the Additives and Functional Products side when it comes to coatings and tires, we are more balanced, that is more of a balanced market from refinish or replacement tires than OEM. And so there we are less exposed to sort of OEM trend rates as we are in Advanced Materials. So I think that again we will have some solid growth there and I'm not really worried about the OEM trend rates being a material issue.","PJ Juvekar","Okay. And then just going to - I think Curt, you mentioned that selling [that end] business has been difficult in this environment. I would imagine that as we get into the second half of '17 and '18 when the new olefin capacity starts up that it will get even more difficult. Can you give us your thoughts about the timing of the sale?","Mark Costa","The timing of the sale? Sorry, you just were breaking up there.","Curtis Espeland","So if you are looking about the excess ethylene and the commodity olefins, we continue to have a number of parties actively engaged in the process. As I mentioned, it has continued to be a challenging environment right now to ensure we get fair value for those kind of assets and quite honestly it has been further compounded by having a competing asset coming into the marketplace.","So we will just be disciplined on valuation and patient on timing as needed. And so like I mentioned, this is going to go into next year. I can't give you a good sense of next year other than I would suspect the first half of the year feels about right that we will have better progress on different options that we have.","And again, we are not just sitting idle. We will look at to see if an outright sale is possible but we will continue to evaluate other options or structures and pursue them as appropriate as well.","Mark Costa","The one thing you should take from us is we are committed to improving the quality of our portfolio and the stability of our earnings. Before it became a trend we were already divesting a lot of underperforming volatile businesses and have done a lot of portfolio transformation as we noted earlier.","And we will continue to look at every way we can do it that is practical. But at the end of the day, we are going to focus on shareholder value creation and make sure what we do creates value.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Mark, your Advanced Materials operating margins were up 350 basis points year-over-year. It looks like they were up actually a little bit more than that versus the first quarter. How sustainable is the current level?","Mark Costa","Good morning, Kevin. We feel good about the margins we have in this business. As I said, we were running incredibly well through the third quarter and did this through volume and mix which in general we view as a very sustainable way to grow earnings over the long-term. It was a clean quarter so there is always some quarters where you are going to have some quality issues and things like that. But I think the margins are sustainable.","I would note that the fourth-quarter always does have seasonal decline in volumes and so those margins are always going to be a little bit lower on the fourth quarter basis versus the third.","Kevin McCarthy","And a follow-up I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned Performance Films had a new channel strategy. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that?","Mark Costa","Sure. One of the great things about this business is it is a consumer products business where we have direct access to consumers and deliver a wide range of products and we have the best products in the industry. But when we picked up Solutia, their strategy on how to go to market and how to even expand the market was not that sophisticated.","So we spent a lot of time rethinking our channel strategies and figured out how to not just go through aftermarket retail shops but develop much more compelling programs through auto dealers in the US which allows us to access an entirely new set of customers that don't show up in an aftermarket tint shop and have been incredibly successful expanding the market and also improving the quality of how we go to market.","The same thing true in China. We were doing quite well aftermarket, not as successful in the auto dealerships and have significantly improved our channel strategy to go through the auto dealerships which is a very important channel in China and we are seeing great success.","And it is not just going to those channels but how we take the products to market, how we are positioning our value proposition versus our competitors in a more compelling way. It has just been a great story of determined improvement of our go-to-market strategy over the last three years.","Kevin McCarthy","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And the next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. Just two questions. One on the fibers market. Can you give a sense for how steep you think the underlying cost curve is? I'm thinking particularly where you see the smallest most marginal producers?","And secondly, as you look out over I would say the next three to five years, are there any large chunks of non-operating expense that would affect the free cash flow bridge either maintenance turnarounds or facilities where you need to do another CapEx cycle or pension contributions or anything else that you see like on the three- to five-year horizon?","Mark Costa","So on the cost curve side there is certainly high and low cost assets in the integrated flake and tow components of the Fibers business. As I have said in the past, we are the lowest cost producer, we are backward integrated in coal, we have the largest scale and we are actually now down to our largest most integrated asset as our only asset here at Tennessee of flake which is matched to our tow capacity here in Tennessee combined with our Korean tow capacity and China.","So we are very happy about our cost position. Our competitors are based on either purchased methanol or in hydride in some cases. So some of these assets are certainly exposed to much higher cost position. They picked up some advantage with lower oil today versus where they were.","As oil goes up, that cost position is going to become less competitive relative to where we are. There are a number of high cost assets out there that can be shut down by competitors if they ever choose to do so to improve their cost position to serve their customers, and are going to have to see what they choose to do.","As the market stabilizes, as we put in stability through these multi-year contracts, it becomes more challenging to figure out how you are going to grow earnings growth and hopefully they will look at those options.","Curtis Espeland","On the operating cash flows and some of the things you mentioned, when I look at two or three areas, first of all on pension, we talked about contributing about $50 million to $75 million of pension this year. That is still what we are anticipating. Over the next couple of years I'm looking at maybe roughly $75 million of pension contributions over the next couple of years.","After that point you kind of have to really look at what discount rates have done and how the returns have come into whether that number needs to increase to $100 million or maybe come down to $50 million. But that kind of gives you a band to what pension contributions could be like over the next three to five years.","On capital, when you've got the kind of assets we have, yes, every three five years, there is going to be turnarounds. What we do and we have a great team that does it, we try to manage the maintenance spend and capital spend we have each year. Part of it is not only cash flow, part of it is just resources.","So yes, we are going to have some capital spend over these years. But some of the unique items that we have had these last few years like some of the assets that we had to build in Texas as well as the conversions from coal to natural gas, there is a little bit ahead of us yet, most of it is done.","So I would suspect our maintenance capital will be in that $300 million to $350 million range over that five-year time period. Then we will have growth capital on top of it to support all the attractive innovation programs that Mark talked about. So I think those are the main two things you are looking at there.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan","Good morning. Could you comment on what you are assuming for currency, any adverse impact from currency in 2017 in your assumptions right now?","Curtis Espeland","No, right now I would say the currencies we are seeing today is kind of what we anticipate going into the next year.","James Sheehan","Great. Some of your coatings customers are experiencing some headwinds now. Can you comment on what you are seeing in terms of downstream coatings demand and whether you are feeling the same pressures?","Mark Costa","Since January, we have always assumed a very slow economic growth world and we never assumed that the economy was going to improve. So this sort of 1% to 2% volume range is sort of where we have been and what we have assumed and so there is no real change in our forecast.","Based on some of the comments I have seen by a number of customers, it sounds like what they are talking about is they expected stronger growth and now they are sort of moderating back to this slower growth expectation. If that is the case, we are already there in our forecasting and there wouldn't be any challenges for us.","The risk though of course is if they have been planning and assuming higher growth, do they have some destocking issues that they have to address in the fourth quarter? We have no evidence from any of our customers that that is happening yet but that is something we will have to keep an eye on.","James Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts","Thank you. How much of a lower tax rate in the quarter was adjustments from prior period tax returns and how much was just geographic mix in the current period?","Curtis Espeland","So if you look at the tax rate, let me just make one comment. In any particular tax year, you are going to have discrete items such as the one you are asking about specifically. It was a $60 million benefit from better utilizations of foreign tax credits from the Solutia acquisition that we recognized in the third quarter that was related to amended returns that we were able to put in place.","But I would add discrete items can vary each year for a variety of reasons, the results of audits, returns, et cetera. Again, I'm going to say this twice because they deserve it. We have a great tax, finance and legal team that knows how to manage these as best we can in any given year. It hasn't been asked yet but I know and anticipate it, is a little early for an effective tax rate for 2017 but let me go ahead and throw it out there.","When I look at the things we put in place, there are some permanent improvements that we have seen for the actions that we have taken so I think our effective tax rate for next year will improve and I think it will be more in the 23% to 24% range.","John Roberts","That is good. I didn't have to use up my second question. Are there non-fiber applications for cellulosic resins that could use up some of the excess polymer capacity to help rebalance the cig tow market or should we think about the use of polymer for fiber as distinct from other applications?","Mark Costa","Excellent question and I'm glad you asked it. There are other applications so as we saw in 2014 that the world was going to start slowing down and tow demand associated with cigarettes, we started up a team to aggressively look at how to develop new market applications around cellulosics. And we are making tremendous progress on how to reuse these assets into new market applications.","Something to keep in mind about Eastman is that we have a 90 year history of innovating when it comes to cellulosics. We started out with film, then went into yarn, then we went into tow, then we went into plastics for things like tool handles and sunglass frames and then we took cellulosic technology into coating additives, then TVs and now into tires is another new emerging application. We know how to innovate in this space.","We have done a lot more of this innovation than anyone else has ever done in creating new markets. Just like we have done in polyester starting with polyester fiber to PET to a wide range of polyester applications so we know how to do this.","So we are making great progress, we are not going to get into the specific products right now because we are having great success in moving this forward and we are still locking up IP. But these assets can make other products that go into other applications and you will hear a lot more about that next year. It is what we do and are very good at doing.","John Roberts","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks and good morning. In the past it has been referenced that perhaps there could be portfolio options, further divestitures not all that different than what you've done over the years. Any updated thoughts on that?","Curtis Espeland","Our focus right now has been the excess ethylene and the commodity olefin product lines. We continue to look at the rest of the portfolio to see if there is opportunities that maybe there is a more natural owner.","We do that in due course with our Board and at this point there is nothing that we are talking about specifically but we will continue to evaluate different things in our portfolio. We like the portfolio as a whole so it is really stuff on the margin.","Mark Costa","We have been on this journey of optimizing our portfolio for a long time. I mean we have sold off $3.5 billion of revenue underperforming businesses. We have done acquisitions adding $4.2 billion of revenue specialty businesses and by the way, we paid 9 times EBITDA for those specialty businesses with 7 times EBITDA multiples post synergies to provide attractive synergies as well as reasonable ROICs above cost of capital for our investors.","I feel great about the actions we have taken in improving our portfolio and we are certainly committed to keeping that momentum going but I don't think there is any big large changes that we need to make both on the acquisition side or on significant divestiture side.","But we are going to continue to look at these opportunities like the ethylene as ways to take out pockets of volatility. But our focus and our strategy is about innovation and growth. We are driving innovation growth, we are managing costs aggressively, we are going to continue to create value in a capital efficient way because we are doing mix upgrades of existing assets in how we drive this innovation. We are going to generate a lot of free cash flow and buy back stock and increase the dividend and improve our balance sheet. I think it is a compelling story as it is.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Just a follow-up on capacity utilization levels, you might have mentioned this earlier but I had to hop off for a second. In Advanced Materials, you talked about how part of the margin improvement was being able to run at a higher utilization level. Is there -- as volume grows into next year is that a benefit that we should continue to see or are you sort of now at a new traunch of profitability at this utilization level?","Mark Costa","I don't think we are going to dramatically improve our profitability from where we are at this stage. But I do think we are going to continue driving double-digit earnings growth going forward as we grow volume, mix and manage costs. But even here, we've got a Tritan expansion going on.","We will have to bring on a new chunk of capacity next year to support this incredible growth we are having with Tritan with the existing products. And I should mention, we also have new products that we are making off of the same chemistry to access even more addressable market than where we are today with Tritan. So you add new capacity, it add some chunks of cost you've got work your way through.","Curtis Espeland","And Vince, if I could just add, as you add those chunks of capacity, as you transition to that, you will have some start-up cost next year and that will be some challenges for this business but again they will still deliver that double-digit earnings growth despite that and you need that capacity then to grow past 2018 and beyond.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","And the next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Securities.","Aleksey Yefremov","Good morning. Thank you. Could you give us an estimate of a sales opportunity for the new tire products that you talked about today?","Mark Costa","For tire resins, it is a great opportunity. Tire resins has historically have just been used as a processing aid and now we have this whole new addressable market in the tread as a performance additive improving traction in the tire, seeing tremendous adoption and interest across tire companies across the globe. And we really seem to be the preferred innovation partner because we have the broadest set of chemistry.","So we are still trying to understand the full potential of this market and we are not going to complain about the 20% growth rate. Obviously it is off of a relatively small number but we see it as a significant market that could easily be $100 million to $200 million of additional revenue.","Aleksey Yefremov","Great, thank you. And in the tow business, the 20% expected decline in profitability next year, how would you attribute it to volume versus price?","Mark Costa","As I said earlier, we have a strategy defending our share outside of China so we are not expecting it to be a volume driven story outside of China. It is going to be a price driven story. In the China side of it, there's a lot of conflicting data about what is going on with demand and destocking in China so it is a little hard to know what the imports are going to be next year and so we're just going to have to see. Right now we are assuming a modest decline.","Aleksey Yefremov","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Nils Wallin from CLSA.","Nils Wallin","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The first one is we haven't heard you guys talk about your deal with Enterprise and their PDH. Is there going to be any benefit next year as that comes online in terms of your propylene purchases?","Curtis Espeland","Well, first of all, a good partner and we are looking forward to that capacity online. Yes, what that will ultimately do for those that aren't familiar with that is allow us to where we have been purchasing propylene we will now have additional propylene that is sourced through that propane and will be more sourced with propane than we are today.","We used to talk about that benefit was going to be roughly $30 million a year but where the spreads are today it's much lower than that. But we are still going to like that contract and that relationship long-term.","Nils Wallin","Got it. And then in Chemical Intermediates obviously there was quite a significant ramp in spot ethylene prices during the quarter, yet there was you mentioned some other competitive pressures. So was the benefit from the spot ethylene margins going up offset by competitive pressures or are you just not quite as able to capitalize on that spot price ramp?","Curtis Espeland","No, I think we did a nice job of capturing the ethylene benefits. But you also have to remember propane and ethane costs also went up considerably in the quarter so there wasn't a huge expansion in spreads but it certainly was better than last year and certainly carrying into the fourth quarter in a better shape than last year.","Nils Wallin","Got it. Thanks very much.","Gregory Riddle","We got time for one more question please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a couple of quick questions on normalized margins. You have held up margins quite well in both Fibers and AM. So on AM, do you think that you would still be able to grow margins the next couple of years as you continue to grow volume? And similarly on Fibers, if you stabilize volume, would Fibers margins kind of hold at this level? Thank you.","Mark Costa","On AM, the margins are likely to be more stable around these higher levels than further increase. As we mentioned, there is the preproduction expenses starting up new capacity and the focus on volume growth. So I think it will be stable.","When it comes to Fibers, the margins will come off from where we are today with the forecasted drop of earnings of around 20% into next year. It is important to keep in mind the altitude of these margins.","This is an exceptionally profitable and attractive business and even some moderating margins here are still incredibly attractive for any business. So we are going to manage through that and continue to find a way to stabilize it into '18.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","Gregory Riddle","Great. Thanks again for joining us this morning. A web replay and a replay in downloadable MP3 format will be available on our website later this morning. Have a great day.","Mark Costa","Thank you, everyone.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7785":["Eastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 30, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Gregory A. Riddle - Director of Investor Relations","James P.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, www.eastman.com. We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thank you, Jenny, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mark Costa, President; Ron Lindsay, Senior Vice President; and Josh Morgan, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 4 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's second quarter 2013 financial results news release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for first quarter 2013 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for second quarter 2013.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation excludes certain noncore or nonrecurring costs, charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in our second quarter 2013 financial results news release, which can be found at eastman.com in the Investor section. Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the second quarter financial results news release.","Third, this presentation includes revenues and operating earnings on a pro forma-combined basis assuming the acquisition of Solutia have been completed prior to second quarter 2012 that compare post-acquisition results to pre-acquisition pro forma-combined results. More information on pro forma-combined results is in our second quarter 2013 financial results news release.","And lastly, we have posted slides to accompany our remarks for this morning's call on our website in the Presentation and Events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Greg, and thanks, everyone for joining us on a bright, sunny morning here in East Tennessee.","I'll begin on Slide 3. As I always do on these calls, I'll take just a moment to provide an update on our most recent public statements. First of all, progress on the Solutia integration continues to exceed our expectations. We have been one company for just over a year now, and I can say we are ahead of where we thought we would be last July. As is his normal practice, Curt will provide you with an update and some more color on his section. But as I have now stated for several quarters, I'm quite pleased with how the integration is going and how well these businesses and cultures have come together to create value.","Next, in February, we raised our full year 2013 EPS expectation to a range of $6.30 to $6.40, a 17% to 19% growth rate over 2012. Today, we're increasing that guidance again to $6.40 to $6.50 as we see additional strength in both our Fibers and Specialty Fluids & Intermediates segments, partially offset by continued challenges in Adhesives & Plasticizers. We also said we expected to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow in 2013, and we're on track to achieve this.","Finally, as always, management committed to remain disciplined in our capital allocation. And we continue to believe that prudent resource allocation focused on financial return metrics is what delivers the best long-term performance in this industry.","Now on Slide 4, I'll review the Eastman corporate results. Operating earnings increased second quarter 2013 versus second quarter 2012, primarily due to higher sales volume in 4 of our 5 segments and higher capacity utilization, which lead to lower unit cost. In particular, the Advanced Materials segment had strong volume growth in our Tritan copolyester product line, particularly for durable goods, and the Specialty Fluids & Intermediates segment also had a strong quarter with higher volume in both fluids and olefin and the Intermediates contributing nicely to earnings growth.","The operating margin for the quarter was 18.6%, a 160 basis point improvement year-over-year and a greater than 100 basis point improvement over the first quarter. Second quarter EPS was $1.80, Eastman's best EPS on record. With this level of earnings, we are well positioned to achieve our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. So while the global economic environment remains mixed and somewhat unpredictable, our second quarter earnings results were a continuation of the strong start we saw in the first quarter.","On Slide 5, I'll highlight our results by geographic region. Our largest region, North America, was down less than 1%, so basically flat, with it primarily being the case of lower selling prices resulting from lower raw material costs.","We had a really nice quarter in Asia Pacific, up 11% year-over-year and driven primarily by strength in both our Fibers and Specialty Fluids & Intermediates segment, as well as significant growth in our Tritan copolyester. You'll recall our first quarter year-over-year growth was also 11%, so we've had a very good start to the year in Asia Pacific.","A big factor of play here is in China, where our portfolio is benefiting from an emerging middle class and a focused shift to a consumer economy, and our portfolio is less exposed to the declining infrastructure spending in the region. I'll also point out that we have done a particularly good job on execution in this region, in particular with some of our oxo alcohols this quarter, as our team was pretty nimble and was able to move some material when it made economic sense.","Revenue in Europe was flat for the quarter. And frankly, given the state of their economy, this is really solid performance.","And Latin America revenue was up $6 million or about 5%. So our geographic diversity continues to be a source of strength for our portfolio, and our second quarter results reflect that.","Moving next to the segments on Slide 6, where I'll begin with Additives & Functional Products. Sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume. This was particularly true for solvents as we continue to benefit from the strengthening U.S. building and construction market. For tire additives, Crystex insoluble sulfur volume was higher year-over-year, while antidegradant volume was lower in what remains a very challenged oversupplied market. Operating earnings decreased slightly, largely due to lower earnings in antidegradant product lines, while the operating margin remained above 24%, within the range we provided for this business at our Investor Day in December.","Looking at the full year, we're expecting second half earnings to be slightly higher than first half as tire additives are expected to benefit from somewhat higher sales volume, improved capacity utilization and lower raw material and energy costs in the second half of the year. And our solvents product lines are expected to benefit from higher sales volume, in part due to an expansion of ethylene oxide derivative capacity at our site in Longview, Texas. As a result, we continue to expect full year 2013 operating earnings of approximately $410 million, which would be a solid improvement over 2012 in an economic environment that remains challenging.","Moving next to Slide 7 in Adhesives & Plasticizers. Second quarter results for this business reflect ongoing challenges, primarily for the adhesives resins product lines, where we continue to face multiple headwinds. First, focusing on adhesive resins, we continue to see demand weakness in consumables, in particular for packaging tape and labels. Coupled with a weak demand, the market is also experiencing increased supply, contributed primarily to increased raw material availability, resins in particular. And these factors, combined, have led to lower selling prices. In addition, customer destocking has also been a factor in the first half of the year, but we are cautiously optimistic that this is largely behind us.","For Plasticizers, we continue to face competitive pricing from producers, who, in response to slower growth in Asia and European markets, have increased exports to other regions. We also continue to see manufacturers of phthalate-based plasticizers trying to defend market share.","Looking at the full year, we expect operating earnings to be approximately $200 million. And there is downside risk to this number, reflecting the limited visibility we currently have in our adhesives resins business.","With that said, as I stated on first quarter call, we remain confident in the 2 key long-term growth drivers for this business: first, solid growth from increased use of hygiene products, such as diapers in fast-expanding markets, particularly Asia; and second, substitution of phthalate plasticizers with non-phthalate plasticizers in Europe and the U.S.","Advanced Materials is on Slide 8, and they had a strong quarter. Year-over-year sales revenue increased with contributions from all 3 underlying businesses. Tritan had another fantastic quarter with volume up over 70%, that's 7-0 percent, primarily in the durable goods market. If you recall, last quarter, we were up around 40% year-over-year. So we're really seeing strong adoption by the market as we get wins across several applications and geographies. And as a result, we are expanding our Tritan capacity by approximately 25%, which we expect will be online around the middle of next year, and we continue to evaluate options for more significant expansions in the future. Interlayers' volume increased, reflecting strong demand in the Asian and North American transportation markets, and performance films volume was also higher as that business really had a nice quarter.","Operating earnings increased primarily due to higher sales volume and higher capacity utilization, which led to lower unit cost, as well as improved product mix. We continue to sell more premium products in this segment, Tritan copolyester, V-Kool brand window films and the interlayers with acoustic properties. And this mix improvement, along with improved volume and higher utilization, is expected to continue to drive our earnings growth, consistent with what we told you at Investor Day back in December. The operating margin for the quarter improved to just under 13%, a nearly 250 basis point increase year-over-year.","For the full year, we're expecting the distribution of earnings to be similar to the past few years with first half earnings just under 60% and second half earnings just over 40%. We're expecting a decline in second half earnings due to copolyesters and interlayers manufacturing shutdowns in the third quarter and seasonally slower demand. As a result, we expect 2013 operating earnings to be approximately $250 million. Given the continuing weak auto market in Europe, as well as lower demand in areas like packaging and displays, this would be very strong performance, we think.","Next is Fibers on Slide 9, another great quarter for this great business. Revenue increased with both volume and price up. Earnings were a record at $116 million, due primarily to higher selling prices. For full year 2013, we're raising our earnings expectations to approximately $450 million, which means we expect earnings to be slightly higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half as we anticipate higher raw material and energy cost, namely wood pulp in the second half based on how these costs flow through our system.","Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation to expand acetate tow capacity in China. We're on track for the facility to come online during the third quarter. We expect qualification of material will take place through the end of the year, and therefore, we expect to begin to recognize earnings from our equity investment in the joint venture in early 2014. We also expect to begin recognizing revenue and earnings from acetate flake sales to the joint venture during the second half of this year.","I'll finish off the segments on Slide 10 with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates. Sales revenue increased year-over-year as we had higher volume in both olefin-based Intermediates products and Specialty Fluids. For olefins, we benefited from having a full quarter of output from the furnace we added to our type 4 cracker, which came online at the end of the first quarter, and offset from identifying opportunities to move some of our butanol from Texas into the Asian market. For Specialty Fluids, the higher volume was primarily due to the timing of customer sales.","Operating earnings increased significantly year-over-year, primarily due to higher volume, with lower raw material and energy costs largely offset by corresponding lower selling prices. Sequentially, operating earnings increased by $23 million or almost 25%. We saw improvement throughout the segment, largely due to increased volume, which was up 7%. Also, the operating margin for the quarter was over 17%, an increase of about 250 basis points over the prior year quarter and about 170 basis points higher sequentially. For the full year, we are raising our operating earnings expectations to approximately $410 million, reflecting strong earnings expectations throughout the segment.","I'll end on Slide 11 with an update on our 2013 outlook. We're at the halfway point for the year and have had very solid results from our portfolio specialty businesses. We continue to benefit from our leadership position in attractive end markets, from the diversity of the end markets we serve and from our broad geographic footprint.","Given our strong first half of the year, we're raising our full year expectations for 2013 EPS to a range of $6.40 to $6.50, and this is despite slow global economic growth and weakness in certain markets, like European autos and adhesive resins. We're expecting earnings in the second half to be slightly lower than the first half due to seasonally lower volume. And I would add that, in the third quarter, we also have several shutdowns that I previously mentioned. But in the fourth quarter, we expect higher year-over-year capacity utilization, which we expect will result in lower unit cost compared to what we had in the fourth quarter '12. We remain on track to achieve our 4 -- fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, and I remain confident we are well positioned to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next 2 years and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Moving ahead to Slide 13, I'll review some of our financial highlights for the second quarter. We generated $362 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter, primarily due to strong net earnings. Working capital increased by $46 million, primarily due to increased receivables. We also made a $13 million contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans and continue to expect the full year contribution will be approximately $120 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $216 million with CapEx at $100 million. Finally, our cash balance, which includes cash equivalents, was $234 million at the end of second quarter.","During the quarter, we also incurred $18 million in net asset impairment and restructuring charges, primarily for closure of a photovoltaics production facility in Germany. The site produced ethylene vinyl acetate for use in photovoltaics, an end market that has been very weak for some time now.","Our tax rate for the second quarter was 30.9%. This is a bit below our previous guidance of a rate slightly less than 31.5% with the difference primarily attributed to investment tax credits from the state of Tennessee related to our recently announced future capital expenditures at our Kingsport site. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 31%, assuming no dramatic change in foreign earnings mix.","On Slide 14, I'll walk you through our estimates for free cash flow in 2013. Consistent with our previous guidance, we project operating cash flows of roughly $1.3 billion. The full year operating cash estimates include our projection for continued strength in earnings, as well as the following items: first, slightly higher working capital as a result of increased revenue and a broader geographic footprint, with the majority of the working capital build in the first half of the year to work down in the third and fourth quarters; second, funding of balance sheet accruals, such as the EVA environmental funding of approximately $30 million, primarily for legacy Solutia sites, and restructuring accruals for site closures in Brazil and Germany; third, any Solutia restructuring and integration costs that are excluded from our earnings projections; and lastly, as previously noted, an anticipated $120 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit plans.","Also, consistent with our prior guidance, we expect 2013 capital expenditures to total approximately $525 million. This capital spending will be more in the second half of the year due to normal operational trends, as well as timing for our growth projects, such as our Specialty Fluids expansion in Wales. So putting this all together, we reaffirm our 2013 free cash flow expectations to be between $600 million and $650 million with the midpoint of this range representing a growth rate of greater than 30% over the 2012 total.","Next, on Slide 15, I'll provide an update on the Solutia integration. We remain well on track to achieve the synergies we expected when we acquired this business last year. As the slide indicates, for the cost synergies, we expect to achieve greater than $100 million run rate by the end of this year. On the tax synergies, we're on track to utilize, at a minimum, approximately 50% of the NOLs by the end of 2015, and I've also put in place structures to help lower our effective tax rate. For the revenue synergies, while these remain difficult to quantify, at this point, we are excited by the commercial improvements and new product development projects that will be added further toward this transaction.","As we noted last quarter, we reached a major milestone in April with the successful integration of the rubber additives product lines, part of our key Additives & Functional Products segments, over to our SAP system. And we remain on track to complete SAP migration of the remaining former-Solutia businesses in late 2013 to early 2014 timeframe.","The Solutia acquisition remains a very add -- value-adding transactions for our shareholders. The Solutia transaction and some of divestitures we have completed over the years, Eastman has demonstrated a commitment to evaluate our portfolio of businesses and assets to ensure we are obtaining the best value for our shareholders.","As another example, we have been evaluating options with our excess ethylene position as summarized here on Slide 16. As a reminder, we have 4 crackers at our site in Longview, Texas. We have one larger cracker with 800 million pounds of annual ethylene capacity, and we have 3 smaller crackers, each with approximately 300 million pounds of annual ethylene capacity. One of these 3 million -- one of these 3 smaller crackers has been idle since 2007.","We use all of the roughly 600 million pounds of propylene we produce and buy about 300 million pounds annually. We use about 50% of the ethylene we produce with the remaining 700 million pounds of excess ethylene sold into merchant market. There is a common carrier ethylene pipeline between Longview and Mont Belvieu that is not owned by Eastman.","Our focus has been to look at options to monetize or otherwise improve the economics of the approximately 700 million pounds of excess ethylene position while retaining our reliable and cost-advantaged integrated position for our specialty and proprietary products. As part of the effort, we recognize the safe and reliable operation of our crackers is essential to ensure reliable supply of our materials for specialty and proprietary product production. And we believe that ownership of our larger cracker is essential for our integrated site integrity.","We also intend to retain the cost advantage of our fully integrated position to propylene, since losing this advantage would be trading volatility in propane for even greater volatility in propylene. Therefore, options at our consideration rated -- range from a capacity reservation fee to divestiture of the 2 smaller and one idle crackers.","In addition, ethylene could be used as raw material for a new on-site derivatives facility that another party could build or could move offsite over the common carrier ethylene pipeline. To size this for you, over the last couple of years, earnings from this approximately 700 million pounds of excess ethylene sales have been between 3% and 5% of overall Eastman earnings.","In terms of status, we're making good progress. The data room has been set up for some time now, and there have been a number of management presentations, as well as a number of visits to the Longview site, and there have been multiple parties that have expressed interest. In addition, there are various complexities to work through, such as feedstock mix to ensure adequate supply of propylene for our needs or how to price such propylene if we were to sell any of these 3 smaller crackers. Furthermore, we have assumed third parties would continue to have reasonable access to the common carrier ethylene pipeline.","However, earlier this month, Westlake, the common carrier pipeline owner at the site, modified the tariff on the pipeline and effectively eliminated the ability of a third party to move ethylene offsite, which had not been the case up to this point. Eastman, yesterday, filed a legal challenge with the Texas Railroad Commission, which is the governmental entity that regulates pipelines in Texas, and we are confident in our position as stated with the authorities.","Resolving this issue has caused some delay in our efforts thus far. This extra time has enabled additional parties to visit the site, peer management presentations and join the process. However, if resolution to this matter is prolonged, it will continue to delay our efforts.","One other comment. As mentioned in the last call, we feel investors are spending probably a little too much time on this issue. We are a large company with a great portfolio of businesses, and it doesn't necessarily make sense to me to decide whether or not to buy Eastman stock based on what we do with our excess position-- ethylene position alone. We will continue to be disciplined regarding decisions with these assets as we've demonstrated with our portfolio the last several years, and we'll update you further on our efforts as appropriate.","And to close on Slide 17, we will also continue to be disciplined with our approach to capital allocation. As previously mentioned, we expect capital expenditures of $525 million, which is similar to 2012 when you factor in the $51 million Solutia spent in the first half of 2012 prior to the close of the acquisition. This reflects our commitment to pursue organic growth across our portfolio.","On the debt side, paying down a significant portion of the Solutia acquisition term loan will continue to be a priority for cash throughout 2013. During the quarter, we reduced the term loan balance by $350 million and, on a net basis, reduced our long-term borrowings by $100 million, effectively using our strong balance sheet to obtain more attractive funding in the commercial paper market and other sources of funding.","Moving next to joint ventures and acquisitions. As previously noted in the Fibers section, the acetate tow JV is on schedule to be online this quarter. Our Regalite hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin JV with Sinopec is supported by continued growth in the hygiene market. When this project is completed, it will be the largest hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin asset with a first quartile cost position located in a strategic part of the world. Working with both customers and our partner, we have the flexibility to adjust the timing of this project if it makes sense to do so, and we're currently assessing our options. Additionally, we'll continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic bolt-ons.","Lastly, we expect to continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 46 million of Eastman common stock and paid $46 million in dividends.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Greg, and I thank you for your interest in Eastman Chemical Company.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks, Curt. We have a number of people on the line this morning, and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. [Operator Instructions]","So with that, Jenny, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will hear first from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, first off, 2 questions on Fibers. Your volume grew 8% in the quarter after -- I believe it was plus 3% in the first quarter. I don't normally think of volume growth quite that strong in cigarette filter tows. So perhaps you could comment on what is driving that strength and whether or not you've gained any share? And then the second piece of it would be the expected impact from your acetate tow JV in the back half of the year as that flows through earnings.","James P. Rogers","And, Kevin, we -- this is Jim. We, upfront, mentioned too it on the call. I probably should have said I thought it was very appropriate, given the, frankly, fantastic results of this quarter that the guys who are directly responsible for had a shot at being on the call and getting some of the credits. So that's why Mark and Ron are on this call. And with that, I'll let Ron justify this question.","Ronald C. Lindsay","Kevin, as far as second quarter, what we saw -- you've heard us talk about this business having a pattern through the year in terms of deliveries and how we supply certain customers. So we get some of that noise one quarter to the next, and you see some of that in our tow for second quarter. The -- now we also had, in the second quarter, excuse me, a pop up in some acetate yarn demand as well that helped us with some of that volume gain sequentially. We've been fairly poor demand environment there, and we saw some rebound there, as well as some customers deciding to restock a bit in the face of some of that rebound. So that contributed as well in Q2.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, at the risk of increasing focus on an issue that you think people are already too focused on, Jim, wondering if you could just elaborate on the pipeline tariff issue, what exactly changed there with Westlake and what is your case as to why it's inappropriate and what does it mean for the timing of any action that you may be able to take on strategic alternatives for the smaller crackers.","James P. Rogers","And I'll get Curt to talk about that as part of the process. But let me -- well, I missed the second half of the question.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, I didn't get your question about the effect of the JV. First off, let me just comment that the JV is -- as we -- consistent with what was said earlier but just a little bit more granularity, we do have the plant complete from a construction standpoint and have chemicals in it, so we're on track there. As we go through this, we tell folks all along that we see the second half of this year as a period of startup, getting the plant, getting it lined out then qualifications. So we're going to see most of the impact really starting to hit us in 2014. We will be selling flake to the JV in the second half, and you see that baked into our numbers. One of the things you won't see quite as obvious in the second half -- first half is we had some opportunities to sell some acetate flake in the first half unrelated to the JV, and that'll balance out the \"first half, second half\" comparison a bit. So it won't be quite as obvious when we see the additional JV, the flake sales to the JV in second half. But I think, you're going to mostly see this being an impact in 2014 and following.","James P. Rogers","And, Ron, I think you told me mix shows up and volumes as well. And they're looking at this volume...","Ronald C. Lindsay","That's right. There's some mix effect there, part of that yarn effect, part of the flake effect and some tow.","James P. Rogers","Curt?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. Kevin, in regard into your earlier question, if you compare the recent tariff versus what was in place previously, Westlake has, in essence, eliminated bilateral movement with the pipeline, as well as third party's ability to do exchanges of ethylene. Through these actions, Westlake has restricted use of its pipeline by any other third party beside Eastman. In regards to timing, we just filed our objection with the governing body in Texas, and we're still working through the timing. The good news is we still have various parties interested in our excess ethylene position as we work through this. But to the extent the -- to the extent that this resolution of this matter is prolonged again, it will affect our efforts to get something done.","James P. Rogers","And, Kevin, if you're on the Westlake call, you might want to ask them what they were doing, what they were trying to do when they changed the tariff.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about the geographic spread of your volumes rightly attributed there -- or characterize that as a favorable trait of the company. I was a little surprised the U.S. were -- it would seem industrial productions been reasonably okay relative to the world. You didn't have a little bit more robust results there. So maybe talk about the 1 or 2 things that held you back in the U.S.","James P. Rogers","It's funny in this quarter with how we performed to have anything about something holding us back. We didn't feel too held back in general. It felt like a pretty good quarter. And I'm sitting here thinking I kind of like having about 3\/4 of my revenue in North America and Asia, at least for the present and the foreseeable future. Would you want to add a little color, Greg, and...","Gregory A. Riddle","Yes. On North America, as Jim mentioned in his comments, part of it is just you had lower raws, that you had propylene that was down about 3%, propane that was down closer to 8% or 9%. I'd also mention that Adhesives & Plasticizers, where they've seen some challenging on May -- on a revenue side, about 60% of the revenue is in North America. And so some of which you're seeing is that challenge as well. But the remainder of the business was pretty strong in North America this quarter.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And could you provide -- I don't know if you guys rolled this up or have at your fingertips, but what year-over-year look like in various industries? And I'm mostly interested in auto tire and construction industries.","James P. Rogers","Go ahead, Mark.","Mark J. Costa","Sure. I'm happy to cover that. I'd -- what I'd say is that from an end market point of view, tires has been relatively stable this year relative to last year. We've seen some slight improvements in demand, on tire demand on Asia, but by no means are we seeing any signs of the anticipated restocking events of the tire industry. It's still somewhere out in the future, and there's no clear indication of when that may occur. In regards to building and construction, it certainly have been also solid. I wouldn't say that this seasonal demand pattern has been as strong as some past ones. And so as we see this pickup in residential construction in North America, there's a bit of a lag effect for our markets, like painting a house takes a while before you get around to that step of the process. So I would call it solid but not incredibly strong from the B&C point of view this -- so far. But for those key markets, again, consumables is holding together fairly well. I would just describe it as solid.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I may, just slip the last one then on the ethylene stuff as well. Obviously, this pipeline can be a challenge. Is that a 2-way pipeline and then if there's any contract terms with Westlake that could also bust up a deal?","Curtis E. Espeland","Well, as it relates to a contract with Westlake, as you would imagine, when we sold our polyethylene businesses, there are various contracts with -- between the 2 respective parties that are not necessarily out there in the public domain. And the pipeline has the ability to move both directions, yes.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just on Adhesives & Plasticizers, you lowered guidance again this quarter. What's the change versus what you had back in late April in terms of the guidance?","James P. Rogers","I'll let Ron take that.","Ronald C. Lindsay","Yes. David, I think the view we have is similar in terms of the supply demand kind of picture for Adhesives & Plasticizers. And what we're just continue to see is sluggishness in the end markets and as well as some supply that has come on, particularly in the resins area, and that's just all resulted in a fairly competitive environment out there for pricing. And so I would say the difference in the last forecast and this one is we just -- we got another quarter under our belt. We've seen a bit more how the market is shaking out, and we're just reflecting that as we look out the rest of the year, not a tremendous change in the view of environment from first quarter. I would say that we still have sluggish markets or sluggishness in end markets. On the plasticizers side, we continue to see in the midst of all of that, continue to have nice progress on switching. If you don't mind, just taking an opportunity to highlight that. We talked about that some, but just to give you a sense of it, we made the acquisition of the Texas City site sometime back converted a line over -- 1 to 2 over to make non-phthalate plasticizers. We're filling that out exactly on plan. It's, versus what we thought it could do originally, we're at about 90% capacity utilization. We actually have a lower percent utilization because we've been able to push the capacity a little bit more and have got a second one to go. So in the midst of all this, we still see that good story going on. But it's still -- we do see a lot of competitive actions around pricing, given the softness in the end demand.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And, Jim, you mentioned also a shutdown cost in Q3. Could you detail those costs and by segment as well?","James P. Rogers","Well, we -- I mentioned the 2 segments. I don't know, Curt, you want to -- well, it's less than $10 million...","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's right, Curt, little less than $10 million.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question, which comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jim, I'm not sure what I'm more impressed with, your record earnings or the -- your ability to plant questions on other conference calls.","James P. Rogers","I can't well -- I don't know if I could be, but I'm not on that conference call. I would be curious, just ask them what were they trying to do in that process.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It'll be very interesting to see it play out. On the EVA shutdown in Germany, how much more do you have left in the photovoltaics business?","Curtis E. Espeland","Frankly, we have left is just going to be some assets we have in China. However, those assets are multipurpose. We can do other things with those assets, and that's what we're going to be looking at, is just how do we pick that asset base and maybe support our other Interlayer business and other Advanced Materials segment -- materials.","James P. Rogers","I don't expect to talk about photovoltaics again on the call.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, that's fine. And, Curt, you talked about priority for the balance of the year, paying down debt. And following that, obviously, with a very good cash flow, how should we think about the positioning in terms of M&A or doing more than just offsetting dilution in -- for your share repurchase? Can you talk a little bit more about the priorities, the use of cash going -- after you finish making the paydown of the debt?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. Thanks, Frank. As you know, we got some pretty good cash flow and feel good about that debt paydown as we get towards the end of this year. And I think you also know our approach pretty well now on capital allocation. We're trying to look at across all of the 4 buckets of opportunities, trying to find the best opportunities we can. We are focused on deploying capital for growth and actively looking at M&A opportunities. I'd also say that our standards for M&A are probably as high as they've ever been in our past, and thus, we're going to be -- continue to be prudent. But we are actively looking for ways to deploy capital for M&A and growth. At the same time, we'll continue to be returning cash to shareholders. Again, you can expect an increase in dividend as we work that through our board, and share repurchases continue to be a good use of cash. And as we get into next year, we can do more than offset dilution, and that will be a viable use of cash as we look across our different options set.","James P. Rogers","And if I could, Curt, let me just add on -- so if you back up to what our priorities are, our #1 priority, growth of the company, and in particular double-digit earnings growth throughout the foreseeable future. In cash, the -- we're blessed with this strong cash flow, and it's one of the ways -- or one of the things that gives us comfort putting these targets out there. Obviously, I need a lot help from different parts of the world and we've given you all our expectations of what the economy will do, et cetera, and markets will do. But having a strong cash flow is a nice cushion to have, and that is -- as we go to decide how to use that cash, we think about accretive acquisitions, our share count, et cetera.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","Eric Petrie","This is Eric Petrie standing in for P.J. Just on the propylene, the propane spreads, quite higher propane exports. Prices really haven't moved much due to high inventory levels. But as we work through this inventory, where do you see propane prices going and the resulting propylene to propane spread?","James P. Rogers","Yes. So I guess you could -- maybe giving a sense of your timeframe, but as we -- let me just take a shot at it. First off, just for the remainder of the year, we're forecasting spreads to be slightly down from where they are. As we're going out, as you point out, there are opportunities coming on or capacity coming on to export more propane. And as we look out that there's a variety of views as to how quickly that's going to make a difference, given not just the inventories, but production. And so we think, on balance, there's some upward pressure on propane over the next several years that we could face, given that, but it's going to be hard to call exactly. We do things along the way to help deal with volatility. And propane is -- I think everybody knows, we do hedge and we've done some of that this year. This help smooth things out. We do still feel like, all in, that being backwards integrated to propane for our derivatives is a good place to be.","Eric Petrie","Great. And then just on Crystex and Santoflex, tire volumes seem to be stabilizing. Where do you see volumes going, particularly in the commercial truck market? As well as can you comment on your recent price initiatives in antidegradants from last quarter?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. This is Mark. In regards to Crystex first, we feel good about that business. It's actually holding together quite well. Demand has been solid and slightly improving on a year-over-year basis, and so that business is continuing to contribute and improve earnings. So it just -- it's been a solid part of the business. When it comes to antidegradants, the PPDs that we have, as we've said before, that's a very challenging business. That's where the year-over-year earnings challenge has really come from for the entire Additives & Functional Products segment. It has been from this relatively small business. But we really faced a pretty severe compression last year as benzene prices went up dramatically in the second half of last year, and at the same time, price competition developed due to the excess supply from the Asians. We've had some progress in improving price this year. As we mentioned, we've been rolling out some initiatives to do that. I'd say the improvements so far have been modest. And certainly, benzene prices are coming off or going to help in the back half of this year to the extent that they stay where they are. But I'd say it's a tough road there, and it's an industry that's most likely headed to some further consolidation, from our view. We feel very confident in our position in this industry. We got the low cost position in the western hemisphere and feel like there -- long term, this is a business that will improve from where it is today.","Operator","And we will move to our next question from Andy Cash of SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This is Jim Sheehan sitting in for Andy. You gave some updates on what your expectations are for the full year, in 2013, for the various segments. And I was just wondering if you could also comment on the corporate and other line?","Curtis E. Espeland","If you look at the corporate other line, that's developing pretty consistent to what we expected. Last year, the corporate and other line was $125 million, of which $50 million was attributable to Perennial Wood. We've talked about that reduction being cut in half and, as well, some further improvements. So I think we've couched that, probably around $75 million for the year.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Could you also provide some more color on your new -- your V-Kool product, your Interlayer products? What type of growth rates are you seeing there year-over-year?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. This is Mark again. The performance films business is having a great year. In particular, the V-Kool products, these are our premium products, are selling quite well, high double-digit earning revenue growth in that business, especially in Asia. So that's -- that part is going well. Overall, I'd say the sales environment in China for auto sales has weakened some, but that product is outperforming the industry.","Operator","And we will go to our next question from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, first, on Adhesives & Plasticizers, what needs to happen for the business to be and to grow sustainably again, and how far is it away from tightening? And where do you think profits could get to in 2015?","Ronald C. Lindsay","It's Ron. Okay, yes, thank you. Let's see, as far as improving, what we've seen that has caused the issues here in the last several months has been some weakness in demand and then additional capacity. So I think the short version is, particularly in the resin side, we need to see some continued growth and the end use demand soaking up some of that capacity. And I think it's going to be difficult to call exactly how long that'll take until we see what kind of growth rates are reestablished. But as to what it takes is we need to see some of that additional product consumed. We do still feel like we got some good value propositions. One of the areas there, that Jim mentioned, is the hygiene market has higher-than-average growth and also tends to need higher-performing adhesives and resins, which is what we got in our portfolio, and this is the kind of product that we're going to get out of our new capacity in China. So we're going to get cost position coming our way there, as well as we're in the market, geographically, where we see a lot of the growth opportunity. As far as 2013, we see the -- as far as the 2 parts of Adhesives & Plasticizers, probably getting closer to our original targets in 2015 on the PV side and taking a bit longer on the Adhesives side, but it's going to be hard to call at this point till we see a little bit more clarity in just how strong the demand is going to be. But we are definitely pushing out from our earlier forecast for 2015, hitting those numbers out a year or 2 or so.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then with the exception of that segment, your volumes are very strong across your portfolio. What did volume grow sequentially? Was this better than normal seasonality? And kind of what kind of volume growth is embedded in your guidance for the back half of the year on a year-over-year basis?","Curtis E. Espeland","Well, I think what we'd characterize is the volume expectations for the second half of the year, it reflects primarily just lower seasonal demand in our volumes. I don't think we have a specific percentage out there today, but we'll come back you as we get those results.","James P. Rogers","On the second quarter, you -- we always get a seasonal increase in volume, first quarter to second quarter, and we saw that again. I mean, I actually felt pretty good about the growth we had. I've looked around at some of the other guys in the industry, I don't feel bad at all about the volume growth we had in the second quarter nor our expectations for the remainder of the year.","Operator","And we will hear next from Nils Wallin of CLSA Investment Bank.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","On Advanced Materials, have you fully sold out the Tritan capacity as yet? And then if you are expanding, my understanding was that, originally, the expansion you had recently was to basically fill all of your polymer capacity with your monomer capacity. Does this new expansion require you to expand both monomers and polymers?","Curtis E. Espeland","Nils, thanks for the question. I've been waiting for my Tritan question all day. It's certainly one the most exciting product launches we've had in the company, in our history, I think. And it's grown certainly beyond our expectation this year, and we're excited about the prospects going forward. As you mentioned, we are selling quite a bit, but we are not at capacity yet. We still have some capacity to grow at the market, but we are moving very quickly to debottleneck that plant and extend its capacity from 60,000 to 76,000 tons, which we'll have online next summer, so excited about the growth, certainly looking at stretching the capacity. And we also have a much larger expansion and development, where we can add a much larger chunk of capacity to continue supporting the market growth.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just on the Longview cracker. If you were to sell the smaller 300-million-pound crackers, what would that do to your overall propylene position while retaining your 800-million-pound cracker?","Ronald C. Lindsay","This is Ron. I'll address that. Curt described our process as selling this excess ethylene position. We want to retain a good cost-based propylene position to support our various derivatives. You might recall that the propylene produced at the site is only part of what we need. We've also got a longer-range supply agreement with Enterprise for when their PDH plant comes online. All that together will make us fully backwards integrated and propane-based cost for our propylene derivatives. And so as we go forward with the process, our focus has been to sell that ethylene position, that merchant ethylene position, but retain a propane-based cost position for the propylene.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Mike Sison of KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I appreciate you have Solutia's integration going well, maybe ahead of expectations, as you noted. Could you give us an update, though, in terms of sales volumes since you owned it? It certainly -- lot of businesses are a little bit less than we thought heading into this year, but maybe frame up where you think the businesses are at across-the-board and what the upside potential could be?","James P. Rogers","I'm going to let Mark hit that because he's closest to it, but one of the things he is pointing out to me was to really look at it on a gross margin basis so you don't get confused with the cost allocations. And I'm jumping down the income statement a little bit beyond what you asked. But, Mark, you want to give him some color on the Solutia business?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. As we've discussed in the past, going from '11 to '12, we certainly hit some headwinds with the European economy and some of the Solutia businesses, given their exposure to Europe. And that hasn't improved significantly yet, but we are very well positioned to grow these businesses. Overall, the gross margin dollars this year will be higher than last year for these businesses. So they are stable and well positioned for growth. All the key products, whether it's Crystex, that Interlayers products, performance films, have sufficient capacity to support growth and economic recovery in those businesses as you look over the next 3 years. More importantly, the premium products are doing quite well. So the acoustic sales in Interlayers is very solid growth. We're setting records in acoustic sales in the last 2 months, which are certainly a very strong mix upgrade there. As I mentioned, the Crystex products are doing well, and we have several new products in development that we're preparing to launch next year and feeling excited about that. In Ron's business, Specialty Fluids, is doing quite well and exceeding expectations. So overall, I think they're very well positioned. It does require an economic recovery or, specifically, some end market recovery in tires and building and construction, and we need the European economy to solidify and start moving in, at least, a positive versus negative direction. But we feel good about it.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. Then in terms of SAP for the tire additives business, great that you got that on there. Can you maybe talk about some of the benefits you expect to see from that being rolled in there? And one of the earlier ones that you tend get in SAP is pricing, maybe an update on that?","Mark J. Costa","You hit a great chord for us. At Eastman, our historical growth and earnings performance, frankly, has been driven by some very sophisticated understanding about our markets and pricing and capturing the full value and using SAP for that insight. So we've been quite excited to get SAP integrated solution applied to those pricing tools that we've developed into those businesses and are already starting to see some of that benefit. So we do expect to gain a lot of benefit and pricing insight, not just in the rubber business, but in the Saflex product range and the performance films product range. So we expect that to be another contributor for revenue synergies or margins synergies, however you want to define it, the next few years.","James P. Rogers","And, Mike, If I could add, as you probably know, getting those SAP implementation also then enable us to get those cost synergies, as well as continue to pursue additional productivity gains in 2014 and beyond.","Operator","And we'll hear from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, you've got the $8 number out there, and you've talked about it a couple of different ways: one, kind of coming from organic growth; and then one using the cash flow. It sounds like using the cash flow, you still feel very strongly that you get there. How would you handicap being able to get there with just organic growth at this period?","James P. Rogers","Yes. That's a tough one, Duffy, and thank goodness, I don't have to handicap myself. I mean, we've got a history of using every line of the income statement. We do what it takes to hit our numbers and, hopefully, give you a little extra. But I got the genesis of your question is that you know as I do that it's a tough environment out there. And Mark was just leading into it with looking for some end market recovery in some of our key end markets, looking for Europe to get a little better, which was really significant for the old Solutia businesses. So I would not bet against us, frankly. And as I'm heading out here in a few months, I got the highest amount of confidence that the guys are going to do everything they can, from our side of the table, to make it happen. But you never get guarantees in life. As I said, you need the economy to give you a little help. But we're going to use all the tools we got, because we think it's really important for our shareholders to keep driving that track record of earnings growth year-over-year. And that's what separates you from being a more commodity-diversified guy who's up 1 or 2 years and then down 4. When we start stringing these 4 to 5 to 6 years together of strong earnings growth, people have to think about you differently, and that's our game plan.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair enough. And the on the phthalates and non-phthalates on that mix, how much more can the phthalate guys cut price to try to maintain market share. Are they getting close to their cash cost at this point, where you can say that they've pulled about -- or fired all the bullets they can, or can they still continue to cut price, do you think, more from here?","James P. Rogers","It's hard to know exactly. But what I would say is, instead of talking about what they can do, I just tell you what our customers are telling us. They see this as just a -- depending on which one you're talking about, how urgent they are, but it's just inevitable. And then ultimately, it's not going to be a price issue for them. It's just a matter of how quickly they make the switch. Some have seen -- it's just a corporate strategy that it's the right thing to do, get on with it. Others have been a bit more followers, and we're seeing that dynamic as well, where they may have not have been so interested and they see some of their competitors doing it and now they're -- have gotten more interested. So I think that side of it is just kind of a near-term dampener maybe. But all in all, we see that dynamic is getting strong and continue.","Operator","And we'll go to our last question from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Ian Bennett - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Ian for Vincent. On Advanced Materials, could you quantify how much of the strength was due to auto and transportation demand?","James P. Rogers","Mark?","Mark J. Costa","Yes, it's Mark, certainly. Advanced Materials had a stellar quarter. We're really excited about it. The primary driver of the earnings improvement in the quarter was really Tritan, more so than the automotive sector. So we've had phenomenal growth in Tritan, that's very high-margin product for us, and it's both volume and mix improvement for the segment. Performance films also had a very solid, solid quarter and improvements with our sales, not just in Asia, but we actually had very strong growth in the aftermarket window films in North America, actually, up 8%. The third contributor was Interlayers in the order of contribution. And the reason is we see very solid volume growth globally, where things are holding together, but Europe has been a big part of our revenue as Saflex and an important part of our margin contribution from the geographic mix point of view. So very solid quarter for Interlayers, but not an exceptionally strong one. The automotive segment, overall, is growing, but depends on where it's growing. I do want to come back to the underlying mix, and the acoustic products has been performing quite well. Very consistent with our Investor Day presentation, our strategy is to drive the mix up, have solid volume growth, leverage the capacity utilization of this business to improve the earnings, and we're seeing all 3 of those levers play out as we've laid out in our strategy.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks, again, for joining us this morning. A web replay and a replay in downloadable MP3 format will be available on our website beginning approximately 11 a.m.","Have a great day, and thanks very much for your interest in Eastman.","Operator","And again, that does conclude the call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman\u2019s website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Greg Riddle","Thank you, Taylor. And good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I\u2019ll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the Company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results news release, and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for third quarter 2015 and the Form 10-K to be filed for 2015.","Second, earnings per share, operating earnings and EBITDA referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core costs, charges and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in the fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results news release and the appendix to the slides that accompany our remarks this morning, both of these can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the investors section. Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the news release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Good morning, everyone; I\u2019ll start on Slide 3. 2015 was another outstanding year for Eastman as we continued to make excellent progress on our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio. We delivered our sixth consecutive year of solid EPS growth despite a very challenging global business environment, and generated record free cash flow of $960 million, reflecting strong earnings as well as the benefit of recent acquisition, which generate outstanding free cash flow.","A strong contributor to earnings growth in our specialty businesses in 2015 was the progress we made on organic growth initiatives. I\u2019ll highlight just a couple of examples.","In the Advanced Materials segment, our window interlayers, particularly our acoustic and heads-up display products delivered solid double-digit volume growth for the year. Also in AM, we delivered very strong growth from our new optical film solutions for mobile devices. And in Additives & Functional Products, tackifying resins into tires was a strong contributor to overall growth in 2015.","These are just a few examples of how innovation and market development is supporting growth in an overall difficult environment. We also did a great job in 2015 of successfully integrating our recently acquired businesses. Each of these acquisitions were completed and aligned well with our strategy of delivering consistent superior value, and combined delivered over $0.50 a share in accretion for the year, as expected. In our cost management, we did an outstanding job in 2015, reflecting very strong productivity gains.","Overall, we were able to more than offset inflation by about $25 million. We also made substantial progress on reducing our net debt. Finally, during the year, we remained committed to returning cash to our stockholders. We increased our dividend by 15%, the sixth straight year of increases and over that time, we have more than doubled the dividend. And we repurchased more than $100 million of stock.","This strong performance on so many fronts is a great testament to the strength of Eastman\u2019s portfolio and the integration and scale that has been built over decades. More importantly, I am very fortunate to work with such a strong team of employees who consistently overcome challenges and find ways to deliver results for our stakeholders.","Now, I hand the call over to Curt to cover the financial details for 2015, and then I\u2019ll come back to talk about 2016.","Curt Espeland","Thanks, Mark; good morning, everyone. Since we have a lot to cover today, I\u2019ll be brief with my comments. I\u2019ll start with our fourth quarter corporate results on Slide 4. We delivered solid earnings despite the many increasing challenges we faced during the quarter.","The decline in revenue largely reflected lower selling prices due to lower raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings were down somewhat. Positives included strong volume growth in Advanced Materials and strong operating margins in Adhesives & Plasticizers. Headwinds were low oil prices and the associated propane hedges, which largely impacted Specialty Fluids & Intermediates and lower volumes in Fibers. Earnings per share was solid and included a lower tax rate year-over-year, which reflected the full-year impact of the tax extenders enacted in December.","Next on Slide 5 looking at the full year, we delivered outstanding results reflecting the strength and robustness of our strategy to transform to a specialty portfolio. Sales revenue increased slightly as sales from recently acquired businesses more than offset lower selling prices which largely reflected lower raw material costs.","Operating earnings increased in three of our segments with particularly strong earnings growth in Advanced Materials. Our operating margin for the year was 18%, an increase of nearly 100 basis points compared to 2014. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our results in a challenging business climate.","Moving next to the segment results beginning on Slide 6, Advanced Materials had an exceptional year, as they continued to deliver on the elements of their strategy. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume and sales of products of the acquired performance films business. Offsets were currency and lower selling prices which reflected lower raw material costs, particularly paraxylene for copolyesters.","Operating earnings increased more than $100 million or about 40% due to a number of factors: Volume growth and mixed improvement; volume from the acquisition; operational improvements; and improved spread. The improved product mix was driven by increased sales of optical film solutions and premium interlayers. The operating margin increased to roughly 17% from just over 12% in 2014. These results reflect execution of a strategy over a number of years to improve the operating margin in this business and to achieve an appropriate return given the investments made. We expect to build on this success going forward.","Moving next to Additives & Functional Products on Slide 7, which had a solid year; the revenue increase was due to the impact of the Taminco acquisition. This was partially offset by lower coatings and other formulated products, selling prices which reflected lower raw material and energy costs as well as the impact of currency.","Operating earnings were up year-over-year, reflecting both improved spread and the impact of the Taminco acquisition. The business did a great job managing value in the face of a slower growth environment, increased competitive rivalry and narrowing olefin spreads.","Moving next to Adhesives & Plasticizers on Slide 8, for 2015 sales revenue declined primarily due to lower prices reflecting lower raw material costs and currency. Volume was about flat as growth in non-phthalate plasticizers, particularly in North America was offset by lower adhesives resins volume due to the lack of availability of raw materials early in the year as well some operational constraints.","Operating earnings increased as improved spread was partially offset by propane hedges and currency. The operating margin increased to just under 20% as we did a good job of holding onto value through the year.","Now to Fibers on Slide 9, revenue declined mainly due to lower acetate tow and acetyl chemical sales volume. The decline in tow volume was mainly attributed to customer destocking, especially in China. And the decline in acetyl chemicals volume was due to increased sales to the cellulose acetate flake joint venture in Kingsport.","Operating earnings were down year-over-year due to lower tow and acetyl chemicals volume. Despite the challenge for lower volume, the operating margin for the segment was 32%.","I\u2019ll finish the segment review with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on Slide 10. Sales revenue decreased as lower selling prices, and lower chemical and other intermediate sales volumes more than offset the impact of acquisitions. For operating earnings, we had a number of significant headwinds impacting results. The significant decline in oil prices reduced the North America shale gas advantage. And as the market became long in ethylene and propylene, the drop in olefin prices outpaced the decline in oil, further impacting margins. Also slower than expected economic growth in Asia led to an increased level of competitive import threats to the U.S. and Europe. And the impact of propane hedges was significant for this segment. These headwinds more than offset earnings from acquired businesses and commercial and productivity actions we took through the year. While operating earnings declined for the year, we did a good job managing through a challenging environment.","On Slide 11, I\u2019ll transition to the overview of cash flow and other financial highlights for 2015. We did an excellent job of generating cash in 2015 with operating cash flow over $1.6 billion. This is a new record for cash from operations as is our free cash flow of $960 million for the year. Capital expenditures totaled $652 million, below our previous expectations as we managed the pace of spend with the current economic environment while maintaining our growth investments. We expect to be at a similar level in 2016.","Looking at the balance sheet, net debt stands at $6.7 billion as of year-end, reflecting almost $600 million in debt reduction for the year. Our cash flow, strong balance sheet, and liquidity keep Eastman in a position of strength in an uncertain economy.","Our full-year dividend was $238 million, and this included a 15% increase in the fourth quarter. In addition, we had $103 million in share repurchases through the year including $55 million in the fourth quarter. The combination of regular increases in our dividend and share repurchases reflected a continued confidence in future earnings and cash flows.","And finally, our effective tax rate for the year was approximately 25%, which again includes the enactment of tax extenders during the fourth quarter as well as favorable geographic mix of earnings. We expect the effect of tax rate for 2016 will be at a similar level, if not better, as we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce this rate further.","Overall, a strong year of results given the challenging conditions. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Costa","On Slide 13, I\u2019d like to transition to 2016 and share our key objectives for this year. We are obviously in a challenging macro environment and are using every lever to create value for our shareholders. In the next few slides I\u2019ll discuss some of these levers.","First, our priority will be continued volume growth and mix upgrade in our specialties. We are aggressively increasing our cost reduction activities and we are also taking our next steps in portfolio management and organizational design. And we will return our strong free cash flow to shareholders.","On Slide 14 I wanted to provide you a quick view on our historical volume growth as the basis for our forward look. Over the last five years, we delivered 10% compounded volume growth. Let\u2019s start with the foundation before our acquisitions. The yellow line reflects volume growth from our heritage specialty businesses which you roughly see a 3% compounded growth. And then we levered our strong free cash flow and very strong balance sheet to expand our connection to attractive end markets with high-quality specialty products for several attractive specialty acquisitions. This organic growth, both in heritage Eastman and within our acquisitions is a tribute to our management team on two fronts: One, we are driving high growth and innovation platforms that is well above end market growth rates; and second, we are doing excellent job of balancing price volume trade-offs in our core businesses. It\u2019s a great story of organic growth and disciplined capital deployment.","We\u2019re also not waiting around for market growth. We are focused on creating our own growth. On Slide 15 you can see a depiction of how we execute our innovation and market development efforts. On the vertical axis are our key world-class technology platforms. And this is a combination of platforms that Eastman has had for decades, cellulose esters; polyesters; oxos; and hydrocarbon resins, and some that we recently acquired, PVDs and alkylamines. Across the horizontal axis are four key end markets where we are concentrating our growth efforts. What you see is that we have a fairly concentrated set of initiatives that take advantage of our expertise in these platforms to help us further penetrate these attractive markets. Some we have already mentioned this morning, such as tire resins, acoustic and heads-up inter-displays -- interlayers, and new mobile device displays. Others, we have discussed in the past including Tritan, our next generation copolyesters coatings and microfibers.","We are making great progress with the innovation and market development portfolio, and I am committed to accelerating investment in and emphasis on these efforts because I believe it is the key to Eastman\u2019s long-term success.","We expect over the next three years that innovation and market development initiatives will add between 1% to 2% to overall Eastman revenue growth on a compounded basis and that operating earnings for these revenues will be well above corporate average.","Moving next to Slide 16, we also recognize that we are in a tough economic environment that will require aggressive cost management. Over the last couple of years, we have been able to offset inflation with productivity and cost reduction initiatives. And in 2015, we were able to do a little bit more with over $25 million falling to the bottom line. This year, we know that in this very challenging environment, we need to do much more.","We expect to double our productivity and cost reduction efforts, so that they\u2019re in the range of $200 million. After offsetting inflation, we project these combined efforts contribute about $0.50 per share to EPS this year. And I want to emphasize that as we achieve these cost reductions, we will continue to invest in our innovation and market development initiatives. We have a great track record of cost management, and I\u2019m highly confident we will manage and achieve these cost reduction targets for 2016.","That brings me to our outlook on Slide 17, and it starts with growth drivers that have been constant for us over the last six years. We have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses that are well-positioned for growth. They have delivered over the last six years and we expect that to continue into \u201816 and beyond. In addition, we expect that our innovative specialty products will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix and accelerating overall earnings growth.","As I mentioned on the previous slide, we are taking aggressive cost actions to add $0.50 a share. In addition, we will achieve further cost synergies from the acquisitions, as we have guided in the past. We are also looking at every other lever. We see further improvements in tax, as Curt mentioned, and pension costs. We also will repurchase shares with our industry-leading free cash flow after de-levering in the back half of the year.","All that said, we face some increasing near-term challenges. The further collapse in the price of oil recently has increased price pressures especially in our olefin and acetyl products. Stagnant global economic growth combined with weakening Asian, European currencies are increasing some competitive activity in some products. And we further expect to see inventory destocking in Fibers in China.","In this challenging environment, we will drive hard to deliver EPS in 2016 that approaches our 2015 EPS. And we expect our EBITDA margins to be similar to 2015. Finally, we expect to deliver another strong year of free cash flow above $900 million.","Next on Slide 18 is announcement that we are improving our business structure which results in changes to the segments in which we report our financial results. Principally, we are making changes that better align our business model to drive long-term growth and support our continued transformation to specialty portfolio. In part, this is enabled by the completion of the Taminco integration. This new structure should result in acceleration of growth opportunities and attractive markets. This also enables us to reduce costs in a more streamlined structure. And finally, this improved reporting structure will result in less complexity and enhanced visibility for those tracking our performance.","On Slide 19 you can see this new structure. The biggest changes is that we have moved from five segments to four with the Adhesives business moving to Additives & Functional Products and the Plasticizer business moving to the new Chemical Intermediate segment. Adhesives and AFP will enable us to better manage our businesses in combination with our great success of our tackifying resins going into tires. We also see more opportunities in application development adhesives and we can leverage our world-class market development application development capability in AFP. Plasticizers and distribution solvents from AFP will be better managed in Chemical Intermediates where we have commercial excellence in managing pricing and asset utilization in a highly competitive environment.","In addition, there are various product line moves to enhance market connect. This reporting structure is effective here in the first quarter. And we plan to provide historical segment results on the new segment basis prior to releasing first-quarter earnings. With these moves, the more specialty businesses are now in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials, and the significant majority of our oil exposure and olefins will now be in Chemical Intermediates.","Our 2016 earnings expectations for these segments are as follows: We expect another year of strong growth in Advanced Materials driven by volume and mix upgrades; Adhesive & Functional Products is expected to remain stable despite a tough market with volume growth offsetting price pressures, including Adhesives being modestly lower. For Fibers, we\u2019re expecting declining prices due to lower pulp prices and weakening currencies, which will be offset by cost actions we have taken. Therefore, the key variable is volume. We expect continued destocking in China, but we don\u2019t know yet how far it\u2019ll go and we expect no more in the coming months.","For Chemical Intermediates, we expect earnings to be lower given the collapse in the oil and the pressure on spreads in that business, with the same trends impacting plasticizers. And once again, we believe this new business structure supports our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio.","As you know, we have been on a long and committed journey to divest commodity businesses and additional specialties. On Slide 20, I\u2019ll provide an update on our portfolio management efforts.","Having successfully integrated our attractive acquisitions in 2015, we are shifting our focus in 2016 towards portfolio optimization, consistent with our long-term strategy. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve been looking to divest our excess ethylene position that continues to be a source of earnings volatility. These efforts have been constrained due to the pipeline dispute with Westlake which we have discussed previously. With favorable rulings from the Texas Railroad Commission and the Appeals Court, we believe we can now move forward with our efforts to divest the excess ethylene. We are also pursuing strategic options for both excess ethylene and commodity olefin intermediates that are not essential to our specialty strategy, and can be operationally segregated at the site. Of course, the specific scope may vary depending on buyer interest and valuation.","I also want to be clear that our integrated Texas site produces advantaged ethylene and propylene, much of which we translate into our specialty derivatives and as such, will remain a critical integrated stream within our portfolio. We have hired an investment bank to restart the process to monetize our excess ethylene position and the other commodity olefin related product lines that are not essential to our long-term strategy. This effort will be one of our top priorities in 2016 and we\u2019ll provide more details later in the year as it progresses.","On Slide 21 here are our expectations for cash generation. As you can see on the bar chart, we have a history of generating strong free cash flow, particularly over the last five years. This reflects the strength of our solid core businesses as well as the transformation of our portfolio. Looking at 2016, we expect free cash flow to be greater than $900 million. With this free cash flow, we expect to continue deleveraging, having reduced the debt by over $600 million in 2015, and we expect to complete our de-levering in 2016 to get to approximately $1 billion of debt reduction. As a result, we\u2019ve also committed to our investors in past calls that we expect to fully utilize our free cash flow to pay an increasing dividend, continue de-levering and repurchase shares.","So in summary, on Slide 22, we have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses that we are confident in and we know that are going to drive volume growth this year and continue to drive volume growth into the future. This organic set of initiatives, our innovation, our product mix improvement are essential to our strategy and they were essential in how we grew value last year, this year, and into the future. We are committed to using every lever we have in this challenging environment including increasing our cost reduction efforts. And we will return our strong free cash flow to stockholders. So, despite our short-term challenges this year, I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll continue to deliver solid earnings growth in the long-term. And I\u2019m looking forward to the questions on this call. Thank you.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thanks, Mark. We\u2019ve got a lot of people on the line this morning. So, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, Taylor, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Mark, on SFI, it was a challenging Q4; how should we think about the earnings progression into Q1 and for the full year?","Curt Espeland","This is Curt, David. I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s fair to say first half will be our toughest comp year-over-year especially the first quarter given the strong performance Specialty Fluids & Intermediates had last year. Also if you think about earnings trajectory in general, our cost reduction efforts will help in first quarter but will be mostly in the subsequent quarters, plus the deleverage in some other share repurchases in the second half of 2016 will help kind of the overall shaping of next year. And specifically of SFI, when I look at their run rate last year versus this year, I would say right now the way things are shaping up what you saw in third quarter is more representative of what you might expect for the year.","David Begleiter","And just Curt and Mark, just on Slide 16 on the cost actions, can you give any more concrete examples besides Workington reduction, where else will cost actions come from, plants being closed, people being let go, anything more concrete you can add?","Mark Costa","Sure. So, we saw things developing and knew that we needed to take action on cost like most people in this industry. And so, we\u2019ve done a restructuring program where we\u2019re going to reduce non-operating labor about 7%, David. In addition, there\u2019s a bunch of other non-labor spend items in SG&A and R&D that we have that we are going to be able to reduce some spend on, and then there is a wide range of manufacturing cost improvement throughout our plants that we are pursuing. In addition of course, there are things like the plant closure in Workington. But that would be additive to the $0.50 a share. That Workington closure was not included in that $100 million. So that\u2019s an additional plus. I\u2019d also emphasize that you\u2019ve got quite a bit of cost synergies continuing to flow in from the acquisitions on top of that $0.50 a share. So, in collection it adds up to a pretty significant number.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch","When Curt was talking about the various segments, he did talk a fair amount about the interplay of pricing dropping due to the raw materials coming down, and that always is kind of a signal of more commodity type behavior rather than specialty type behavior. So, Mark, as you think about your portfolio, and you went through this exercise to re-segmenting to four, what percent do you see being commodity versus specialty in your mind? And I know you mentioned that you\u2019re going to restart the ethylene sale process. Are there other parts of the portfolio that you see as perhaps not fitting longer term into EMN?","Mark Costa","Sure, Frank. First on the specialty part, with the re-segmentation, you should think about the parts of the products that we have that are commodity oriented have been concentrated in Chemical Intermediates. So, the other segments really don\u2019t have anything we consider to be commodities. The reality is that even in specialty businesses when you have oil prices drop from $100 to $30, and you are oil-based, your customer sort of notice and expect that some of that raw material benefit is going to be shared with them. So throughout last year, we realized obviously significant raw material benefits in our specialties and our commodities. And the pace at which the price is shared with them is very different. So, in the commodities it happens relatively quickly. In the specialties, you still give back value to your customers. If you don\u2019t do that and if you hold onto price very aggressively which you can certainly do in a specialty, you set yourself up for a volume cliff in the future because even if you\u2019re a proprietary product and we have a number of ones where we\u2019re the only manufacturer in the world, if you don\u2019t share some of that value at an appropriate level, you put your customers on a jihad [ph] to find new suppliers, whether it\u2019s an alternative material or a smaller competitor you might have where you\u2019re a very strong leader in a specialty business.","So, we do that. We have probably the most sophisticated commercial excellence and pricing systems I think in the industry where we make these price volume trade-offs all year long to make sure that we\u2019re sharing value but we\u2019re also maintaining to be able to grow volume in the long-term. So, over the year that plays out and prices come down to some degree and you take that into this year, and that\u2019s a bit of a headwind versus how you started last year. But no, I don\u2019t think our specialties are commoditizing at all. And what I love about most of our technology platforms is we have next generation products building off of the same assets whether it\u2019s next generation of acoustics in heads-up display, the Tritan product replacing some copolyesters and a series of opportunities going on to improve Crystex with our next generation Crystex technology etc. So, we never sit around waiting for people to try and replicate as we are always moving the ball down the field and advancing what we offer to our customers. So no, overall I would say the portfolio feels great on that front.","What I did say though in my prepared remarks is, we are expanding the scope of what we\u2019re considering selling beyond excess ethylene. So, we are looking at what other olefins that have commodity behavior in Chemical Intermediates, a lot of volatility, a lot of distraction for investors that is not essential to our long-term strategy, so they are not critical intermediates for our specialties. And so, we\u2019re going to look at how much of that we can package with excess ethylene and find a buyer who values that olefin portfolio and their strategy.","Frank Mitsch","And following up on this theme, I really appreciate the Slide 14 with the volume growth of 3% in your AAA businesses. And then on top of that I believe you\u2019re expecting 1% to 2% innovation market development as well. So that would almost imply kind of a 4 plus percent improvement in that area. My sense is that given the economic backdrop in 2016 that would not be the case. How are you thinking about the potential volumes in the AAA side in 2016?","Curt Espeland","So Frank, I think when we look at what is now the AA I guess, we\u2019re moving up in the ranks, those two segments we still expect solid volume growth. Obviously, the economy is going to do what it does and we\u2019ll track with it, especially in the end markets we serve from transportation to B&C and consumables being our three large end markets. And I think those all have attractive growth trends this year from what we can see.","So, I think we\u2019ll grow with those markets. So, I think we\u2019ll have volume growth that will be like history. And within that I think we\u2019ll get some mix uplift that will be these high growth specialty products that aren\u2019t necessarily huge volumes but they are very attractive to earnings and they provide a nice lever to earnings. But we don\u2019t see a volume problem in this year. We think it continues to be solid. We think AM and AFP will have good volume growth. We think AFP\u2019s volume growth will be better this year than last year when we look at as last year wasn\u2019t as much as we wanted of course. So, we do see some places in specific areas where we\u2019re improving our market share position where we\u2019ll get better volume growth there too.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Just trying to get a sense on the earnings bridge. You did 7.28 in 2015 bringing $0.50 of cost savings. In your segment breakdown, you basically told us that AM is going to be up; AFP is going to be stable; Fibers, there is a question mark around volume; and then you\u2019ve got the oil spread issues. So, can you just help us, what do you think the FX headwind is in 2016? And then when you say, you\u2019re going to approach last year, does that mean you\u2019re going to be north of 7 or do you think you\u2019re actually going to get close to 7.28? And I guess what I\u2019m really asking you is how much risk do you think there is on spread side of things and is that really the true wildcard for results next year or this year?","Mark Costa","So Vincent, thanks for the question. And it\u2019s obviously a very important one. As we look at it, we do see a lot of tailwinds, as you noted. Good volume growth, mix upgrade, the cost reduction actions, the acquisition synergies, improvements in tax, pension costs as well as share count. So, there are a number of very attractive tailwinds for us. And there are really two principal issues, as you\u2019ve identified that are the headwinds. So, how much spread compression do we take this year versus last year in this volume on Fibers? When it comes to the spread issue, I think that there\u2019s predominately that spread from compression is going to be in Chemical Intermediates but you also feel a little bit of an AFP, which still will have some olefins in that segment and we expect prices to come off a bit in Adhesives where things have been relatively tight last year. And so, we\u2019ll have a little bit of price give back but better volume growth this year, netting each other but somewhat down. But the majority of the issue is really a spread issue. And then of course, we\u2019ve put in an expectation of some additional destocking in Fibers. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts when it comes to oil, the economy, the uncertainty in destocking, and I can combine those into a variety of different scenarios. The way I would suggest you all think about it is we\u2019re somewhere between stable to 2015 EPS and down 5% when I combine all those different factors together. And those I think give us that sort of a range.","Specific to FX, I\u2019ll let Curt answer that question.","Curt Espeland","Yes, Vince, just the way I think about currency itself, right now the currencies we\u2019ve seen, predominately our exposure is euro is slightly down compared to what we saw on average for 2015. Maybe the best way to look at is if you think about just the net impact of hedges, whether that was the cost of the propane hedges or the benefit of the currency hedges, net-net that was probably a $0.60 headwind for us for the year. For \u201816, we think the net impact of these changes in hedges net-net is going to be about flat. This is a little lower than we were thinking before, primarily due to the class of oil and the underlying impact on our propane hedges, but then that $0.60 impact really rolls off in \u201817 and \u201818.","Mark Costa","And just building on that comment, I think it\u2019s important for investors to understand that a lot of what we\u2019re seeing right now we view as very much short-term pressure, not long-term pressure. We don\u2019t think there is anything undermining our long-term growth strategy of delivering attractive earnings growth in \u201817 and beyond. To Curt\u2019s point, if oil and currency stay where they are at, we\u2019ll just get a natural $0.60 lift in \u201817 and \u201818 -- $0.60 a share lift, as those roll off. If oil prices go up, our earnings will improve just as they\u2019ve pressured it down. So either way, you look at, you\u2019ve got earnings growth coming in \u201817 and \u201818, depending on your view about oil prices because I think it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll be better than where they are today.","In addition to that, you\u2019ve got continued volume growth next year. You\u2019ve got this transition of spread expansion into 2015, normalizing a bit of those spreads in 2016. That is a two-year event when you\u2019re adjusting from $100 to $30 oil, but you don\u2019t have that in 2016 anymore; that will be behind us. And then on top of that, we\u2019ve got continued ways to improve costs and very importantly, we have a very strong free cash flow. And we\u2019ll be repurchasing shares starting in the back half of this year and strongly in \u201817. So while we\u2019re certainly disappointed about some of these challenges we\u2019re enduring right now, we are focused on driving long-term growth and taking actions that make sense to maintain that volume growth long-term and deliver strong earnings growth beyond this year in \u201817, \u201818 and beyond.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays Capital.","Duffy Fischer","Question on just the bridge between earnings and free cash flow. So, other than the share count changing, which should advantage earnings, if I\u2019m looking at a linear relationship, is there anything else that should affect the difference between free cash flow and earnings in that bridge?","Curt Espeland","I think if you look at that bridge, the only thing that probably is going to be a little different, two aspects: One is we\u2019re not anticipating the release of working capital as great as we experienced in 2015 as we go into 2016, just because of just the way the raws have fallen on a relative basis; plus, there\u2019s always some difference in years between when you make your tax payments et cetera. But I\u2019m very confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash flow in 2016. And I think it\u2019s just a matter of how much higher over $900 million it\u2019s going to be.","Duffy Fischer","And then in Q4 AF&P also saw price down about 10%, which was probably the price movement that surprised me the most. Is that still just the olefins affecting that segment or were there some other spreads in there that got compressed as well?","Mark Costa","It was principally just the olefins. We\u2019ve been doing a great job of holding onto value all year long, but we came to the point where at some places we needed to reduce prices to remain competitive. It\u2019s a tough comp versus where prices were at $100 oil in the fourth quarter of \u201814. So, it was just that.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","It just seems like you were hurt more by the ethylene change than the propylene change, given your spot ethylene exposure. Would you agree with that? On the propylene side, how much give backs did you have to do in the coatings area?","Mark Costa","So, on the propylene side, propylene prices also came off through the year, and when you look at cracking spreads, they obviously came in on the propylene side, if you look at the first half versus the second half of the year and our prices tracked with it. And we\u2019re taking in that lower propylene price into this year. So, certainly there is a first half headwind this year versus last year, when it comes to propylene. The ethylene is sort of the opposite story. Ethylene prices were relatively good in the first half of last year and then obviously came off pretty significantly in the back half of last year. So, it\u2019s sort of the flip story there on sort of where it goes. But we expect ethylene prices to improve into the second quarter this year. As this very large cracking maintenance schedule takes place this year that should sort of move ethylene prices back up a bit. We\u2019re not expecting it to go back to last year but we certainly expect improvements versus right now, so moving parts there. On the coating side, our customers there have done a pretty good job -- on the coating side, we certainly saw our customers do a very good job of working with us and getting their prices down on the propane related derivatives and getting a benefit from that.","P.J. Juvekar","A quick question on tow. You took a step down in 4Q in terms of year-over-year comparison. Can you discuss some of the declines? You said declines in China. Can you discuss tow declines in China and outside of China?","Mark Costa","Sure. So, with the tow business -- first I\u2019ll take outside of China, which is the more straightforward story. What we\u2019ve seen there is that destocking come to an end and we expect volumes to be relatively stable into this year. Outside of China, we have seen prices come off some with the reduction in pulp prices and our competitors in Europe and Asia Pacific using their weakening currency as a way to attempt to chase volume. We of course defended our market position but the prices did come down a bit. With all the cost actions we\u2019re taking in that business, we\u2019ve been able to offset that pricing decline that we\u2019re seeing outside of China. So, really, it is about a pure question around what does volume do in China at this point. And what I\u2019d say is in the -- from what we can see, the Chinese National Tobacco Company made progress in their destocking in 2015 but did not achieve their objectives in going as far as they wanted to. They have to walk a tight balance in delivering their tax revenue increase for the year, which they did do, which limits how far they can go in reducing production and achieving their inventory management goals. And so, they are going to do another round of that this year in trying to work that inventory down.","It\u2019s important to keep in mind as well that when you see this sort of volume issue in \u201815 and \u201816, a good portion of it is also the CNTC backward integrating with tow suppliers. So, we did our JV in the end of 2014 with CNTC and that is what led to a certain amount of volume decline in \u201815. And Daicel did a JV which is going to be part of why volume goes down this year.","So, you shouldn\u2019t misinterpret that as a decline in primary demand. We don\u2019t see any issues with primary demand and cigarette [ph] consumption going to a decline. This is all about inventory management and some backward integration. The good news on the backward integration front is that we don\u2019t expect any other tow backward integration by CNTC until the 2019, 2020 timeframe. So that won\u2019t be an issue. Again as we go into \u201817 and \u201818, another upside for us or \u201817 and \u201818 versus what we\u2019re seeing this year. So overall, I\u2019d say we expect some decline and we\u2019re just going to have to wait to see how it goes with the final conversations and contract negotiation.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jim Sheehan","Mark, could you give us outlook in 2016 on the Crystex business?","Mark Costa","Sure. Crystex has been a great business for us. Obviously, it\u2019s a challenging market condition with primary demand not being robust, but we saw volume growth last year. And in particular, we saw that volume growth really pick up in the second half of last year relative to the first half. And we expect that volume growth will continue into this year. So from a demand point of view, everything seems to be on track.","On the pricing side, it\u2019s a competitive business. We have a bunch of little small competitors in Asia we have been dealing with since 2012 and we\u2019re seeing some price pressure there. I\u2019d say in one place, our Japanese competitor is using their weakening yen to sort of chase volume where we\u2019re once again defending our market position, so they are just giving up potential earnings growth but -- and improving margins. But I think it\u2019s all playing out sort of as we planned. We feel very good about our new technology; we\u2019re bringing on our new process technology and our retrofit in Germany this quarter; and we\u2019re on track to develop the new plant and build the new plants and have it on line at the end of -- in the beginning of 2017. And that will significantly improve our cost structure for competing in this business. So, feel good about the business.","Jim Sheehan","And then you made some comments on ethylene divestitures and how the pipeline dispute was holding that process up. It looks like you feel more confident that this process is moving forward in 2016. Could you just evaluate the pipeline dispute and where it stands and how quickly you think you could wrap that up?","Curt Espeland","Eastman has -- and Mark mentioned, Eastman has won every case to-date on this dispute, whether it\u2019s those Texas Railroad Commission rulings or their favorable opinion on their Appeals Court. So, it really speaks to the strength of our position. So, we recognize there may be a few more steps to completely resolve this dispute, but we\u2019re confident that we can move forward with these efforts to divest the excess ethylene at this time. And the timing of resolving these disputes is very similar to the timeline we think it\u2019s going to take to complete a divestiture.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","In the fourth quarter, your EBIT in Specialty Fluids was $20 million, and I don\u2019t know how much of your -- how much of the hedge penalty you had or how many hedges you unwound. But in general, oil prices have come down a lot. So, is that $20 million your run rate on a quarterly basis for 2016 in the current environment or in some way is that an unrepresentative number, and could you explain why it\u2019s unrepresentative, if it is?","Curt Espeland","Jeff, I mentioned that earlier in a previous question, do not think the fourth quarter is representative of this business segment. When I think about the moving parts that you\u2019ve highlighted, we think it will be down, as Mark mentioned in 2016. But it\u2019s probably more comparable, if I look at the best quarter of last year, it\u2019s more comparable to kind of a third quarter normal rate as we\u2019re going into 2016.","Jeff Zekauskas","And so why was it so much lower than the third quarter? Is that because there was an above average amount of hedges that were unwound there?","Curt Espeland","Jeff, and I\u2019ll end it with this. There is a plenty of items that always affect the fourth quarter; sometimes it\u2019s your schedule of shutdowns; sometimes it\u2019s going to be the impact of the seasonality; and sometimes it is going to just be competitive behavior in that particular quarter. So those are some of the moving parts. As we best see it, we know it\u2019s going to come down, but fourth quarter is not representative of what we\u2019re expecting this share at this point.","Mark Costa","We also saw some destocking in volume\u2026","Jeff Zekauskas","Some destocking?","Mark Costa","There was just a variety of individual elements that added up to that number, making it a bit more sort of extreme than what is representative.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then lastly, you have very good cash flow and free cash flow generation for next year. You talked about a $200 million productivity gain. Are there non-recurring charges that you need to enact in order to capture that $200 million? And if you do have to take them, how large are they?","Curt Espeland","As you\u2019d expect, Mark mentioned some of the labor reductions of that restructuring. You do anticipate a restructuring charge in 2016 that will have a cash impact. We\u2019ll highlight that into our adjustments and that number is roughly about $50 million.","Jeff Zekauskas","$50 million. And then of the businesses that you want to sell, like if you totaled them all up, what\u2019s the revenue and EBITDA order of magnitude?","Curt Espeland","Jeff, as we said, we\u2019re still working through the scoping of what our divestiture process, our strategic options will be. That\u2019s going to highly depend on just a variety of factors including what the buyer slate may be interested in. We\u2019re just going to work on that out over the next several months.","Mark Costa","Yes. On that point, I just want to be clear with folks because I\u2019m sure this question will come up a lot. The reality is we want to maintain some flexibility because in the olefins world, each potential buyer actually has a slightly different interest in what they might want in our portfolio. And so to maximize shareholder value in what we sell, we\u2019re going to keep that flexibility in there and be able to sort of address what the interest might be.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Berney","Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I just wanted to ask within your EPS guidance that you\u2019ve given, which sounds like it\u2019ll be a little bit below where you were in 2015. You gave this really nice breakout where you break out price and volume for us, both kind of by the segments but also for the company as a whole. So, if you were to take a step back and think about what you\u2019re imputing in your guidance for 2016, what kind of overall Eastman Corp. volume price assumption are you assuming?","Curt Espeland","Well, to be honest with you, I would just have you go through segment by segment and do that analysis. I think what you\u2019re going to see is the volume growth in the Advanced Materials as well as AFP. You\u2019ll probably see solid volumes in SFI. That\u2019s going to be more of a margin pressure. And Fibers volume is going to be impacted by the final imports into China. Pricing, we\u2019re going to see where oil goes.","Ryan Berney","And then maybe you can help me understand the ethylene issue a little bit better. My understanding is that you are running about 70% propane feed through your crackers and you still also have one of your crackers that\u2019s shut down. So, when you think about divestitures, would you be -- I mean can you help me understand, would you be moving away the asset you closed down or would you potentially be putting any capital to work to move towards a heavier even propane feed in order to kind of get the propylene you need? I guess I\u2019m just kind of figure out how you get rid of that ethylene without also losing some of the propylene that you need.","Curt Espeland","The good news, there are solutions they are. And so, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past as we\u2019ve tried to monetize our excess ethylene, we\u2019ve always indicated we do not necessarily need to be the owner of the smaller crackers, many times we call the type 3 crackers. Nothing has changed in that regards. Our larger cracker is really heavily integrated into our overall site operations and is really critical to our specialty derivative production. So, as we go through the strategic evaluation and we will ensure the reliability, integrity and the safety of this cracker is preserved to support our specialty derivative product lines. And this is consistent with our strategy again to reduce volatility, but not compromising our specialty growth.","On the propylene, I\u2019d also remind you, yes, we are a net buyer today but as we look forward to the start-up of the PDH unit with Enterprise, we\u2019ll be kind of fully integrated with our propylene. But as we look down the road, we can think about different options on how these crackers may play out in our strategic options. And we\u2019ll be able to adjust appropriately.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Just a quick one on your transportation and construction breakouts for the special businesses, can you break out your current thinking about how much is maintenance versus first fit for OEM and what you\u2019re seeing on the OEM trends in the very near term, like the next three, six months?","Mark Costa","I\u2019ll take a shot at it, but I\u2019d say our customers are probably more qualified to comment. On the tire side, 75% of that business is roughly replacement. It\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re levered to commercial tires much more so than passenger tires when it comes to the amount of Crystex for tires 10 times in a commercial tire versus passenger. So, what we see there is like the globe, the economy getting better in the U.S., improving in Europe and it is still growing in China by the way, just not as fast as we\u2019d all like. And so that\u2019s all sort of driving the need for replacement tires especially increased construction activity in North America and even some increased construction activity in Europe that we\u2019re seeing. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d talk about the tire side of it.","On coatings, when you look at transportation and building construction, we expect a good year in North America which is where we have our largest market share with the increasing construction rate of housing coming for us in \u201816. And we also saw decent growth rates in Europe. So, that\u2019s all feeling relatively good. China is a bit of a wildcard but still some growth.","When it comes to interlayers, they had a phenomenal year last year in automotive as well as a good architectural year in Europe. And on the automotive side, we grew significantly faster than the market for a couple of reasons. One is we\u2019re seeing the addressable market grow because a lot of company -- OEMs are moving to putting laminated glass in the side windows and even the sunroofs, so the market is just getting bigger relative to OEM build rate. In addition, a lot more use of acoustics, both for quieting in the cabin as well as light weighting the windows and heads-up displays growing very strongly with the whole mobility trend. To figure out the next trend you\u2019ve got to go to the consumer electronics show for cars and the heads-up display is a critical part of all those technology trends. So, all of that\u2019s allowing us to grow much faster than the OEM build rate which is about 60%, 70% of the total for interlayers. So, each business is a different story, but all of them are good ones.","Laurence Alexander","And then if we roll all of them up for the two As over the next three, four years, what you see as your mix tailwind for margins when you have a lot of moving parts in terms of the hedges and market trends, but what do you just see as a tailwind just from margin uplift, if any from mix shift?","Curt Espeland","I think what you\u2019re going to see, this is Curt, in Advanced Materials, you\u2019ve already seen what has happened with their different elements of improving mix, getting volume growth and fixed cost leverage. And so they are at a 17% operating margin, so I think they\u2019ll continue to grow from that. On the Additives & Functional Products, I think over the next several years, they can maintain their margins if not slightly improve them through that mix of group.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Mike Sison","I was wondering, it might be helpful if you total up all the headwinds that you\u2019re facing in 2016, it seems like it\u2019s going to be well over $1, maybe even more. And is that kind of what you\u2019re overcoming with your specialty businesses and what you can control internally?","Curt Espeland","I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve done all of the exact math that Mike you\u2019re doing, but we can compare notes like we always do over time. But I would say, yes, we\u2019re facing significant headwinds and so we are offsetting that with again growth in Advanced Materials, stability in AFP. We\u2019re also then seeing the cost reduction actions. I\u2019d also remind that we\u2019re also going to finish deleveraging during the course of 2016 as well as look at repurchasing shares, mostly weighted towards the second half of the year. So, those will also help overcome some of that headwind.","Mike Sison","And then one quick one, Mark. Eastman\u2019s done a nice job of kind of locking away from more commodity businesses and adding specialty businesses. Unfortunately, the commodity business seems to continue to weigh on your earnings results probably more than you might have thought. What are your thoughts -- what do you think you need to do with the portfolio now to maybe reposition it to continue to lessen those exposures? I know you want to pay down debt, but is acquisitions something that you would consider to continue to improve the portfolio?","Mark Costa","I think what we want to do is what we just announced which is get the volatile bit out of the portfolio. So, going to four segments, concentrating the olefins in one segment where we can better manage that business and the volatility in it day to day to make sure we capture the best value in the current market situation. That\u2019s why we pulled the distribution solvents out of AFP and put plasticizers in there. It also allows us to look at all the options for what is best divested from this portfolio that certainly is a distraction for investors having a disproportionate impact on our valuation and allow us to focus on our specialty strategy. Because -- you\u2019re right, last year we did a great job of growing our specialties. It was why we delivered earnings growth and we\u2019re going to do it again this year and beyond. And that\u2019s where we should be spending our time and focusing our efforts.","When it comes to acquisitions, as I said in the second quarter call and the third quarter call last year, we\u2019re not looking for large M&A. We\u2019re looking to focus on growing our platforms that we have. We have a lot of great organic growth initiatives kicking into gear already and ones that are about to come especially in AFP. Those were a little bit behind in the cycle relative to Advanced Materials. So. you\u2019re going to hear a lot more stories about that as we go forward. But we\u2019re not looking for any large M&A. It\u2019s always possible to find some bolt-on M&A that might be attractive that dramatically improves the business we\u2019re in, like we did last year in Advanced Materials with our Commonwealth acquisition, but our focus right now is generating cash flow and repurchasing shares.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura.","Aleksey Yefremov","How did Taminco products do in the fourth quarter and was there any change in competitive intensity or volumes there?","Mark Costa","Taminco had a great year and a good quarter. So overall, they did as we expected. Volumes held together nicely. You saw strength in things like crop protection for the year as well as personal care doing well. Obviously, there\u2019s some pressure in soybean and corn-related functional mean demand with all the drama in the ag industry, but that\u2019s a relatively small percentage of their total revenue. And we took some hits of course in some of our products going into down-hole applications on the energy side but a lot of that was offset by gas cleanup sales doing quite well on the downstream part of that business for us. So, volumes held in well and it came out as we expected. Margins also are fine. The only two hits we\u2019ve had in that business is currency obviously like everything else, and then some of the methanol that we produce from our advantage contract obviously is feeling spread pressure relative to how methanol prices have come down.","Curt Espeland","And if I could add Mark, on top of that, what I also like about Taminco is we have completed the integration. We achieved about $25 million in cost synergies in 2015. We expect that to be about $50 million of cost synergies as well as we now believe we will have some good tax synergies that will help our effective tax rate in 2016. So, again, not only is that a good reflection of good integration by both teams, it\u2019s also the business -- the team is responding to tough business climates to help our businesses, whether it\u2019s Taminco or heritage Eastman.","Aleksey Yefremov","And as a follow-up, does your guidance include buybacks? And if so, how much?","Curt Espeland","The guidance, you could assume, there will be some buybacks weighted mostly towards the second half of the year, and so some of that would be included in that guidance. But that will be more of a benefit as we go into 2017 because you\u2019ll get the full effect of those buybacks plus how we deploy our cash in 2017.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Congratulations on moving forward. We had another chemical company write off an unfavorable raw material contract this quarter. You haven\u2019t been able to do that with your propane contracts. Is that just due to how hedge accounting works or is it simply because it would just improve the optics and there is no net present value to doing it?","Curt Espeland","In this case, John, it is purely the accounting because it\u2019s a cash flow hedge. Even if we settled those hedges today and spent the cash, I\u2019d still have to recognize the impact and earnings over the cash flow associated with the purchases.","John Roberts","Okay. So, it\u2019s more an accounting issue than it is an NPV issue?","Curt Espeland","Yes.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thanks again for joining us this morning. A web replay and a replay in downloadable mp3 format will be available on our website later this morning. Have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7790":["Eastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 31, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Gregory A.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Riddle. Please go ahead.","Gregory A. Riddle","Thank you, Kim, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Josh Morgan, Manager of Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 3 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's third quarter 2014 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for 2013 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2014.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain noncore or nonrecurring costs and charges. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in our third quarter 2014 financial results news release can be found on eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings in the presentation also exclude such items as described in the third quarter news release.","Lastly, we've posted slides that accompany our remarks for this morning's call on our website in the Presentations and Events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa","Thanks, Greg. Good morning. It's shaping up to be a beautiful day here in the Smoky Mountains, beautiful fall day, and happy Halloween. I'm happy to say for our shareholders we have a treat, not a trick, as great results this quarter and a good outlook for the fourth quarter next year.","I'll start with my comments on Page 3. This has been an exciting quarter for Eastman as we have made solid progress towards our global -- our goal of becoming a leading special chemical company. We delivered strong EPS in the third quarter despite continued global economic uncertainty, and I'm proud to say we're on track for a fifth consecutive year of compelling earnings growth in 2014.","Earnings growth is a reflection of how our world-class technology platforms have enabled great success in establishing leadership positions in key end markets, diversifying into attractive end markets and geographies, and enabling an advantaged cost position through vertical integration and advantaged raw material position.","In September, we entered into an agreement to acquire Taminco, a highly successful global specialty chemical producer with a clear focus on niche markets built on their world dealership position in alkylamines and derivatives. Taminco has the #1 or 2 global market share position for the vast majority of the chemicals producers, making it a very exciting addition to our portfolio. Today, I'm pleased to report that the closing process is on schedule, and we expect the transaction to close by the end of the year. We couldn't be more excited about the addition of this great company to our portfolio.","Also during the quarter, I was most excited to see the results of our innovation, leveraging our world-class technology platforms. Our strong growth of innovative high-value specialty products was a big driver of our earnings growth in the quarter and will be in our future, especially in Advanced Materials segment.","And lastly, we generated $355 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which reaffirms the quality and the strength of the Eastman portfolio. And I'm confident that this strength will continue to be a great value driver for investors in the future.","As we move on to Slide 4, I'll cover our third quarter corporate results. Our portfolio of businesses posted solid year-over-year revenue growth of 3%, with 4 of our 5 segments delivering very strong growth. The higher revenue is primarily driven by higher volume and improved mix in Advanced Materials as well as higher volume in Adhesives & Plasticizers. Pricing was also higher, particularly in the Specialty Fluids & Intermediates segment.","Operating earnings increased by 5% year-over-year, driven by revenue growth in Advanced Materials, Adhesives & Plasticizers and Specialty Fluids & Intermediates, and the continued reduction in raw material and energy costs.","Earnings per share improved by 12%, driven by higher operating earnings and a lower share count. The lower share count reflects our continued commitment to return share -- return cash to our shareholders and fully deploy our balance sheet.","All in all, our strategy is to continue to get great results, and I'm confident that we've put ourselves in an excellent position to continue delivering these results for our shareholders through this year and the years to come.","With that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Okay. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5, with a review of the Additives & Functional Products results.","Sales revenue was higher by 3%, primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volumes for coatings product lines. That was attributed to stronger demand in several key end markets, particularly building and construction and durable goods.","Revenue growth in coatings was somewhat offset by lower sales volume for Crystex insoluble sulfur, primarily due to lower demand in both Asia and Latin America.","Operating earnings were lower by $9 million, primarily due to higher raw material energy costs, particularly for propane; and costs related to the development of our next-generation Crystex rubber additive technology. The higher raw material and energy costs reflect the flow-through effect of higher cost inventory, with inventory turns for specialty products typically taking a bit longer than other parts of our portfolio.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect both revenue and earnings to have a strong growth year-over-year and to be about flat sequentially due to solid demands for coatings product lines; strong volume improvement for tire additives product lines, particularly in Asia Pacific; lower raw material and energy costs; and lower fixed costs for Crystex due to our intent to close a manufacturing facility and as we ramp down development costs from higher levels.","As a result, we expect operating earnings will be approximately $400 million for the year. Given the headwinds this business has faced this year and the investment we are making in Crystex for the future, we view these as solid results. In addition, AFP is well-positioned for solid earnings growth in 2015 and beyond, supported by great technology platforms, leadership positions in attractive end markets and advantaged cost positions.","Adhesives & Plasticizers is on Slide 6, and they reported another solid quarter. Sales revenue increased by 8% as higher sales volume more than offset lower selling prices. The higher sales volumes in adhesives resins was primarily attributed to stronger end-market demand, particularly for packaging and hygiene.","The higher sales volume for plasticizers was attributed to the continued substitution of phthalate-based plasticizers with non-phthalate-based plasticizers, with Eastman 168 non-phthalate plasticizer volume growing about 13% in the quarter. Lower selling prices for plasticizers was attributed to the continuation of global competitive pressures, resulting from weak demand in Asia Pacific.","Operating earnings increased by $11 million, primarily due to higher sales volume and higher capacity utilization in adhesives resins that resulted in lower unit costs. Operating costs were also lower, and this includes targeted cost reductions that are helping us this year and will continue to help us into 2015.","Looking forward to the fourth quarter. In addition to the seasonality we typically see in the segment, we anticipate some constraints for key raw materials and adhesives resins to result in lower volume year-over-year. This raw material supply issue is the result of a shift to lighter feedstocks across the industry, resulting in fewer byproducts. It isn't unique to Eastman, and our feedstock flexibility provides an advantage in a tight raw material environment. For the full year, we expect Adhesives & Plasticizers earnings to be approximately $190 million. This level of earnings would be approximately 10% higher versus 2013 and reflects a stable foundation for future growth.","Moving next to Advanced Materials on Slide 7. Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, with year-over-year revenue sales up 4%. The 5% volume increase was primarily due to continued strong growth of premium products across the segment. Premium product growth was driven by Eastman Tritan copolyester, which was up 15%; as well as Eastman Visualize Material, interlayers with acoustic properties; and V-Kool window film, each of which continues to benefit from strong adoption in their respective markets.","Operating earnings increased by $11 million, driven by higher volume and improved product mix. The Advanced Materials segment had a strong quarter and continues to deliver earnings growth in higher margin supported by 3 drivers we have previously discussed: higher volume, improved product mix and fixed cost leverage as we fill out previous capacity expansions.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect normal seasonality to impact demand across all major product lines and associated lower capacity utilization. However, we expect operating earnings to be meaningfully higher year-over-year, resulting from a continuation of mix improvements across the segment, favorable raw material costs, particularly in copolyesters and lower-fixed costs. As a result, for the full year, we are tightening our range toward the upper end of what was previously provided and now expect operating earnings to be between $290 million and $300 million, reflecting an expected double-digit earnings growth for this segment versus 2013.","Next is Fibers on Slide 8. Sales revenue declined as lower acetate tow sales volume more than offset higher selling prices and higher sales of acetate flake to Eastman's China joint venture. The lower acetate tow sales volume was due to the impact from additional industry capacitation for acetate tow -- primarily Eastman's joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation; flattened demand in China that has resulted in a reduction in imports; and customer buying patterns, which we have experienced before in this segment.","Operating earnings were basically unchanged as higher selling prices and lower raw material and energy costs were offset by the lower acetate tow sales volume and resulted in lower capacity utilization, which resulted in higher unit costs.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential pick-up in earnings due to customer buying patterns for acetate tow positively impacting our results. For the full year, we continue to expect operating earnings to be approximately $480 million, which would be a solid improvement over 2013's earnings.","I'll finish up the segment reviews with Specialty Fluids & Intermediates on Slide 9. Sales revenue increased, primarily due to higher selling prices for intermediate product lines. The higher prices were largely the result of supply tightness in multiple markets, most of which we do not expect to continue through the fourth quarter.","Revenue in the quarter was also positively impacted by the aviation turbine oil business we acquired from BP. You will recall we have closed this transaction during the second quarter and have gained a growing specialty business that aligns well with our existing Skydrol aviation fluids business.","The higher intermediate selling prices and addition of the aviation turbine oil business revenue, was partially offset by weaker sales volume and heat transfer fluids as well as lower intermediate sales volume, resulting from greater demand internally for downstream derivatives. The lower sales revenue for heat transfer fluids is due to delays or cancellation of industrial products -- projects, and we continue to expect this to continue in 2015.","Year-over-year, operating earnings increased due to higher intermediate selling prices and the benefit from the acquired aviation turbine oil business, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs as well as lower sales revenue for heat transfer fluids.","Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect continued strong performance in the intermediates product lines driven by solid demand and lower propane costs as well as the continued benefit from aviation fluids product lines. However, we also expect normal seasonality demand and for demand weakness in heat transfer fluids to continue.","In addition, this segment is impacted the most by the costs from a maintenance shutdown at our -- at the largest of our crackers at our Longview site. This shutdown occurs every -- once every 5 years, and we expect the impact to be approximately $20 million for the company.","The shutdown has been recently completed and was done in a safe and timely manner. This was not a trivial shutdown given the various complexities involved, including the weather. So I want to thank the Eastman team involved for their diligent efforts and demonstrating, once again, the operating capabilities of this company.","Anyway, taking this together and recognizing the volatility inherent in the business, we continue to expect operating earnings for the full year to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million.","On Slide 10, I'll cover some other financial highlights. On one of my favorite topics, during the quarter, we generated a very strong $560 million in operating cash. This, again, reflects the solid net earnings that we -- was the main driver as well as our working capital discipline. And as with previous years, during the quarter, our working capital turned from a use to a source of cash.","Our cash flow in the quarter was also -- reflects timing of lower cash tax payments and the timing of pension payments, which will occur in the fourth quarter.","Our free cash flow in the quarter was $355 million, including $53 million in dividends. Capital expenditures totaled $152 million in the third quarter, and we continue to expect our full year 2014 capital expenditures to be approximately $575 million.","With the expectations for cash from operations approaching a record of $1.4 billion for the full year, we are on track for full year free cash flow of approximately $600 million. Besides dividends, we have returned cash to stockholders, with share repurchases of $50 million in the third quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to $410 million through the first 3 quarters of the year.","You should expect that for the next couple of years, our focus will be on deleveraging following the close of the Taminco acquisition. While we are deleveraging, we do expect to continue to offset dilution with share repurchases.","Lastly, our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27% below the second quarter due to a reversal of a deferred tax reserve, but it is essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2013 when we see the benefit for our adjustments to the tax provision to reflect the finalization of our 2012 federal tax return.","We continue to expect our tax rate for the full year to be approximately 28%. It could be lower if a package of tax extenders, including the various business and other R&D tax credits, is signed into law later this year.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa","Thanks, Curt. On Slide 11, I'll review our outlook for 2014. I'm excited about the strong earnings and growth that we've seen through the first 9 months. As I look forward into the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect it to continue to grow.","We expect sales revenue year-over-year to increase roughly in line with global GDP, and this reflects continued growth of our specialty products, particularly in Advanced Materials; increased volume in Additives & Functional Products, driven by higher coatings volume and strong volume improvement for tire additives, particularly in Asia Pacific; and solid revenue growth in Fibers due to customer buying patterns.","So far this quarter, we're seeing strong orders through October across the company. Of course, there's always some risk of more-than-normal destocking with the current economic uncertainty, but we don't see any evidence of it yet. We also expect some favorable raw material and energy tailwinds to improve earnings. As a result, we expect operating earnings in the fourth quarter to be up strongly year-over-year. The increase is expected to be pretty much across the company.","Taking all of this into account, I'm very excited about being able to revise our guidance for 2014 to be approaching $7 a share, which will be our 5th consecutive year of earnings growth. And we believe this momentum can continue in the years going forward.","That brings me to our last slide, which is our Investor Day, which is scheduled for next Thursday, November 6 in New York. I'm very excited about how we're going to bring our growth strategy to life, which will deliver outperforming earnings growth and a very strong free cash flow for our shareholders.","We will discuss how we've transformed our portfolio into a leading specialty chemical company. Within this portfolio, we're particularly proud of the progress we are making with delivering innovative products to the market, and we will discuss the strength of our core businesses and how they are well positioned to deliver solid revenue growth and sustainable margins. I'm confident that our strategy will create great value for our shareholders now and into the future. There are more details on our website in the Investors section. I really look forward to seeing as many of you as can make it next week. And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] With that, Kim, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first question from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mark, just on acetate tow. As you head into year-end negotiations, what are you hearing from your customers about underlying demand, specifically in China, for tow and cigarettes for '15 and beyond?","Mark J. Costa","David, so the Fibers business is one we're certainly paying a lot of attention to and trying to make sure we have a good understanding of the market. What I would say is that we see demand as basically relatively flat in China this year relative to last year. And as we look at that, I think that it's principally driven by austerity measures from what everyone is telling us as opposed to a broader set of trends. And so as we think about austerity measures, they tend to have a onetime effect. And so as we look at population growth and other factors, you can see a scenario where demand in China could improve going forward, probably at a moderate level to the past, but continue to deliver some level of growth. So that's our view on China. So when you add that together with the rest of the world, where you still have growth in Asia Pacific and some other parts of Eastern Europe and Latin America, you can see a scenario where global demand growth is slightly improving going forward. Now as we think about specifics to 2015 and what's going on in this year, there are 2 things to keep in mind. One is, part of the reason demand is down this year is our joint venture with CNTC. So as they bring their joint venture online, they're obviously going to shift volume to running the joint venture full like they do the other joint ventures, and then that's going to have an impact on import volumes, and we've taken our share of impact on those imports -- reductions this year, which, of course, is more than what you would have expected with flat demand. So there's a bit of that going on this year that factors into it. There is some debate and speculation around to what extent there's inventory that needs to be destocked in China if they are producing -- expecting growth which didn't materialize. So we also view that there's always some -- a moderate amount of inventory correction that you could see next year or as part of what is going on this year. But overall, I think the important to tell -- the investors need to understand is we see this business being stable, we see the demand being stable and -- as well as our earnings being stable going forward from this business. And if we don't see that demand materialize, we do have our actions we can take in managing our cost structure to respond to keep earnings stable again. So that's where we see it. We'll spend a lot more time talking about this at our Investor Day next week.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Very good. And Mark, just on Crystex. Can you talk about underlying demand? And when do you expect that demand to actually pick up doing forward?","Mark J. Costa","First of all, we've seen already a pick-up. So October, we saw a strong rebound in orders in Crystex, especially in China, which is where we saw the most destocking. It's important to remember that we're highly levered at commercial and truck tires as opposed to passenger tires as you compare us to the reports of our downstream customers. It's 10x as much Crystex in a truck tire as a passenger tire. And so October volume is actually, on a global basis, the strongest month of orders we've seen in 24 months. We're already seen a good rebound. Of course, when we need to see this continue into November and December, but at least we're off to a good start.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you just speak a little bit to the customer buying patterns in Fibers? Is that just sort of a seasonal thing? Is it a trade load? Or -- and what gives you the confidence that it's going to swing back in 4Q, which I typically think there was a time where these guys liked to manage inventory levels going into the end of the year?","Mark J. Costa","Vincent, I think the old word that prior CEOs of Eastman have used is chunky, and I think that customer buying patterns don't have some sort of predictable seasonal pattern in the fibers industry. There is a lot of different factors that go into how they manage their purchases. And we can already see improved orders from China in the fourth quarter. So I'm pretty sure we can see what's going on, and we expect the volume to improve. So it was just a shifting of order patterns as they were adjusting some inventory in third quarter versus fourth.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And could I ask, on the cash flow statement, you had very strong cash generation in one of the items. There's like $101 million that came on the other line. What was that?","Mark J. Costa","Vince, that's an example of the cash tax payments in third quarter of this year is lower than they were last year. So that's the primary driver.","Operator","The next question comes from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I assume you view the Texas Railroad Commission ruling as favorable. Do you expect that to be appealed? And will that allow you to restart a process to explore any transactions for your olefins capacity?","Curtis E. Espeland","This is Curt. Well, just to remind everyone, there's 3 disputes with Westlake over that pipeline. Two disputes was the hearing that was held earlier in this year around bidirectional flow and swaps, and there's a hearing that's been held on tariff that we're still waiting for a ruling. But on those first 2 items, the ruling was issued by the examiner, as you indicated, on October 20. The ruling was in favor of Eastman as they found Westlake's removal of bidirectional flow and exchanges as an unlawfully discriminatory action against Eastman. We're not surprised by that ruling, given our position and our outstanding legal team. So parties do have the ability to appeal this decision within 15 days. We're just going to wait that 15-day period out and see what happens. Until then, just to your comment, we have continued to explore options with our excess -- ethylene position. The timing, unfortunately, has been impacted by this activity with Westlake, but we'll continue to explore those options now that this ruling is out there.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, how much of your revenue would you expect to see some price pressure from customers or competitors if ethylene, propylene and other petrochemicals start declining as a result of lower NAFTA prices?","Mark J. Costa","I'll take that question. Just on the Westlake part, I want to add one additional comment, which is we're committed to try and reduce the earnings volatility of our company, which is why we're looking at selling those crackers. But I need to remind investors that this is not a material event, whether we keep those crackers or we sell them. The bulk ethylene is about 2% of our earnings stream this year, and it's just not what people should be focusing on. And it's a great segue into your second question, which is what's the impact of the $85 oil scenario on Eastman? And we, of course, are spending a lot of time thinking about that and trying to assess what that impact might be. And at a high level, I don't think there's a substantial impact to Eastman. And I'll walk you through our logic and give you a rough idea of what the impact could be. So most of the press I read says that the brand oil going down to $85 is primarily a supply-driven event. So first, I'm going to talk about this holding demand constant. Because if it's supply-driven, it's not a -- we're not having a macroeconomic recession debate here. And there are really sort of 3 drivers to keep in mind when you assess Eastman as we think about this impact. The first is, of course, our raw material costs will improve. As propane prices drop, we'll benefit from that. That would be somewhat mitigated by the hedging strategy we have in place. Also, you have to remember that about 1\/3 of our purchased -- raw materials purchase is propylene, not propane. And we'll see benefits of lower purchase propylene costs coming into us. So we'll see a tailwind there. The other side of the equation, of course, is what does propylene and ethylene prices do to us. Well, first of all, we don't sell a lot of -- we don't sell any propylene, and we only sell a modest amount of ethylene, as I mentioned, when it comes to total earnings for Eastman. So we sell derivatives. A lot of those are specialty products. And as raw materials fall, we generally tend to have stickiness in our prices that don't fall as fast as our raw materials. And therefore, we'll capture some value on the way down as you think about 2015. The third part that's quite important is that we're not just -- olefins is only 15% of our overall earnings this year if you look at it from a pure cracking spread point of view. And so you've got to remember that the other vast majority of Eastman benefits generally from a lower raw material environment. And so the third component is our raw materials, paraxylene and benzene. And things like them [ph] , PVOH, are all going to improve. And again, those are specialty products that have stickiness with raw materials moving, and we should benefit. And then we can shift to the demand equation. If it's a supply-driven event with $85 oil, then this is going to a great economic stimulus for the world. It is going to help improve cost structures for consumers, for governments, that should help everyone from China to Europe to the U.S. So I can make an argument that we'll have a demand offset there, too. But ignoring demand for a moment and just holding demand constant, I would say that the impact to us is roughly around $0.25 in EPS as a potential headwind. And then if you believe that the world's going to be stimulated by $85 oil and we'll get growth out of it, then we'll offset some of that $0.25. So overall, not material. At the end of the day, Eastman is just not an olefins play. We continue to sort of get lumped into that category by some, and they seem to be missing the fact that we've significantly transformed our portfolio. This is becoming a smaller percentage. And as we grow our specialty products and add Taminco to our portfolio, it's going to become an even smaller percentage of our EPS in 2015.","Curtis E. Espeland","And Mark, if I can just clarify. John, that 25% EPS headwind is going into 2015.","Mark J. Costa","Yes, sorry. That's -- this is a 2015 analysis. We actually feel good about our position for 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question kind of on competitive dynamics. The Chinese are building out a lot of propylene molecules over the next couple of years, and they're trying very hard to get to some of the downstream derivatives where you guys would compete like 2-EH. When you look through your propylene derivative portfolio, how do you think you're set up competitively versus kind of this onslaught from China over the next several years?","Mark J. Costa","We always look at that competitive situation. The reality is, it's already very competitive in China from a supply -- oversupply point of view, and our margins have still held up quite well. The vast majority of our 2-EH and other propylene derivatives that we sell out of SFI are sold in North America, where we have a better industry structure and a better cost structure. And we tend not to compete so much in Asia Pacific with those kind of products. And then when you get to the specialty products, we're not competing on a basis of propylene prices anyway. We're competing on value, so I don't think it's going to be significant.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the due diligence you did on Taminco, one of the pushbacks I'm getting from some investors is it gives you ag exposure at a point when most investors don't want ag exposure. When you did your due diligence, what kind of downside, if ag went into a 2-year down cycle, let's say, could we see out of that business?","Mark J. Costa","We, of course, looked at the ag exposure, both short term and long term. And first, from a long-term point of view, we feel great about the long-term macro trends for ag. So really, the question is just, short term, is there some risk specifically in crop products like corn and soybean with where prices have gone to demand for us? And when you really dig into the Taminco portfolio, the amount of exposure in total earnings that they have to grow crops is not that high. Their whole crop protection business actually goes in the high-value products -- fruits, vegetables, things like that, where we don't see any risk to demand trends. And they've got a great pipeline of new growth products going in crop protection. So you're really talking about a small part of the functional means that go into ag. And if we think -- we know there is some exposure there we factored in our valuation, and we still feel good about our guidance.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You talked about a potential $0.25 headwind in 2015, which begs the question, how are you thinking about 2015 in general and obviously, that $8 marker that's out there?","Mark J. Costa","Mitsch, I know I can always count on you asking this question, so I appreciate it. Well, in this case, I'm actually going to beg off a little bit to Investor Day. We've put together a very compelling and exciting story about how Eastman is going to grow earnings in '15 and beyond for next week, and I don't want to steal our thunder from next week. But the short answer is I think we're going to do fine in 2015. I still feel confident we're going to grow Eastman's earnings in a strong way into next year. And then the Eastman -- and then the Taminco acquisition and the Commonwealth acquisition will add great earnings accretion to that growth. So we still feel good about that. Obviously, if we stay in the $85 oil scenario next year, there will be some mitigation to that growth, that $0.25 roughly. But you got to keep in mind that $0.25 out of our total EPS is a very small number on a percentage basis. And it doesn't change our goal to grow -- deliver good growth in earnings next year over this year.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Well, I certainly appreciate the teaser for the meeting next week. And then just on A&P. You talk -- adhesives, it looks like the second quarter now we're with pretty good growth. How sustainable do you look at that? And then, obviously, on the plasticizer side, you're still seeing some price competition. What's the outlook there?","Mark J. Costa","First of all, we feel great about how this business has stabilized and how it's improved this year and how we expect it to continue delivering earnings growth into the next couple of years, which we'll, of course, address next week as well. On the adhesives side, what we see going on is demand's come back. We had soft demand in '13, as we all know. But hygiene, hot melt adhesive packaging, which is a very sophisticated application that requires high-performance resins, we're seeing some great growth in that and great demand coming to us. And then on the supply side, the industry has just become tight again, and that's allowed us to improve our pricing power and capture the value that we create for our customers. So we see that as a good thing. The resin crops came in a little below average, and then the crop outlook for next year is that, that's just finished and the resins are collecting off [ph] the hills today. It looks like it's going to be slightly below average. So the industry looks like it's going to stay tight going into next year. Plasticizers, demand growth has been very strong as people continue to switch to non-phthalates plasticizers. And then the spread compression has offset that this year, but we expect that to moderate because where pricing has reached, I think we're reaching a point of stabilization on the pricing front as we go into next year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us an update on your PDH offtake -- that plant, when you expect to actually start receiving material and how that might compare to the original time line.","Gregory A. Riddle","Bob, this is Greg. I think what Enterprise has said publicly is that, that would be online in early 2016, and I think that's just a little bit later than originally anticipated.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is there -- I know you guys have some sort of bridge agreement until that plant started up. Do you get the favorable cost plus economics during that bridge period? Or do you have to wait until that unit is actually producing?","Gregory A. Riddle","There is a propylene market contract that's in place. It started in 2013 and...","Mark J. Costa","And we're seeing the benefits of both today, and that will continue until that product has -- project has come in online.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And relative to what somebody else asked earlier about oil, and you mentioned it's a -- much ado about nothing maybe for Eastman. I think you were right to point out you're not an olefins company. I'm curious, though, given your feedstock base and some of your Appalachian coal exposure relative to maybe peers that are more oil-based, I mean, would you expect to see some compression in margins as maybe coal prices locally don't necessarily match up with what oil prices are doing globally? Or would we expect your raw material basket to echo changes in oil prices?","Mark J. Costa","Bob, that's a great question. First of all, we love our cellulosic acid teal [ph] stream and its profitability. And it is coal based here in Tennessee, where we're one of the few companies in the world -- certainly, the only company really outside of China that does coal gasification successfully. And that position has translated into a lot of value for us. When you look at the final products where we're selling, those aren't really based on NAFTA, and the competitor's cost structure is more of a natural gas kind of competition. And the vast majority of our cellulosics that come off of our coal are very high-value specialty products that aren't trading on movements of raw materials on a daily, monthly or even annual basis.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","With regard to the volume declines in acetate tow, and you're also mentioning that you had Eastman-specific things that you could pull if you didn't see demand. What are those Eastman-specific things? Are you -- would you consider closing any capacity going forward? And at what level in terms of margins or -- would you say it's time to start taking control of the market on your own?","Mark J. Costa","Well, certainly, there are a number of different choices we have in front of us. One of those choices is capacity, but we're not going to make any snap decisions here. There's a lot of uncertainty in what's going on in the fibers market, obviously, with the change of demand pattern in China. I think we're getting a good grip and understanding of that. Were still in the beginning of contract season right now to see how our contracts will play out and therefore, what our volume will be next year and more importantly, what we think is going to happen with volume on a long-term basis, not just reacting to short-term events. And then we'll make the appropriate decisions of what is the best way to manage our cost structure if we see demand pressure, but I'm not going to get into those details until it's appropriate.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Understood. And then on Tritan, the 15% growth is obviously quite strong. Would you be able to parse out how much of that is just the capacity expansion versus market share gains? And what type of growth rate do you expect for that product going forward?","Gregory A. Riddle","Nils, this is Greg. The debottleneck, as it's coming on line here in the fourth quarter, is happening in the fourth quarter, so that would not have affected the kind of growth that they had in the third quarter. So that's still to come as the debottleneck gets completed.","Mark J. Costa","But just to brag on the Tritan product and the team that has delivered such great growth across so many markets and applications. This is a great business. We've seen tremendous growth out of this business. Last year was incredible. This year has been very strong. We see all kinds of applications coming our way in the future, and new end markets like medical that we haven't even touched yet. So we're going to continue investing against this and growing it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to follow up on Advanced Materials market. I think you cited a number of factors there driving it to the high end, better mix, raw materials, lower fixed cost. I was wondering if you could just kind of walk us through this -- those issues, provide a little bit more color and where you're seeing the positive variances by product line. Is it mainly Tritan or in the other pieces of the segment?","Mark J. Costa","Great question. We're extremely happy with how Advanced Materials has been performing through the last few years and what we expect going forward. And it is a -- it's a specialty product mix upgrade story that's very consistent all the way back to what we said at Investor Day in 2012. And it's across the board. So yes, Tritan is showing tremendous growth and improvement. It's a high-margin product. We've got a great patent position, which we -- we'll be able to sustain this advantage in the marketplace for many years to come. And so that's a part of it. But that's not the only part. If you look at the interlayers business, we're seeing tremendous growth in our acoustic interlayer products that go on automotive windshields, not just further adoption of different OEMs, but starting to put acoustics on the side windows, so just an acceleration of growth relative to underlying demand. And that's a great product, and we're excited about the next-generation products we see there. And in the window film business, also showing good growth in China and North America. We're still in the beginning of implementing our growth programs there. So we see a lot of growth coming from that as we go into the future. So it's really across the board that we see this story, and we have a lot of capacity available in these segments. We don't have to spend much capital, except for Tritan, to continue to grow and leverage that capacity so we get the fixed cost benefit. And the other great thing about this business is the assets are very flexible. So as we grow the specialty high-end value products, we can shift and make those on the same assets we've been making some of the more core products over the past. So we just get a lot of leverage in this business.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Appreciate that. And then a second question, if I may, for Curt. Propane has been very volatile. It started off the year as a trick. And at the moment, anyway, it looks like a treat, but you've got a lot of hedges in place. Can you talk about 2015? And what can you tell us about hedge levels and ratios as we think about the economics versus the volatility?","Curtis E. Espeland","So as a reminder, the intent of our commodity hedging program, as you indicate, is really to reduce earnings volatility related to input costs, particularly like propane and natural gas. And as I discussed earlier in the year, we kind of changed our hedging philosophy. Instead of just going out 6 months out, we now go out multiple years to take advantage of forward curves as the year progresses. So specifically on propane, we -- I would characterize, we have hedged a substantial portion of our purchases for the remaining of fourth quarter as well as 2015. You can imagine, I was taking those position -- our team was taking those positions during the course of this year, which was probably just over $1 as a lot of those forward curves were reflecting at that time. We use -- do use a combination of swaps and options, and so we still get to enjoy some of the benefit as propane comes down going into next year. But the swaps, obviously, are helping us kind get a predictable cost flow and reduce earnings volatility. And as a reminder, hedging is just one of the things we're doing to reduce the amount of focus the investment community tends to have on our olefins exposure. And so this hedging program not only helps achieve reduced earnings volatility, but it should lessen the focus on olefins for this company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you expect your filter tow volumes to grow next year? And if you do, by what magnitude?","Mark J. Costa","As we look at filter tow volumes next year, we don't expect them to grow. We think that they're going to be stable to modestly down based on the logic that I just laid out, but we still see the earnings being stable. There's multiple factors, including pricing and raw materials, that go into our view of earnings and how we manage it as well the actions we can take.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I guess to follow up on Kevin's question. If propane stays at $0.90 and you're hedged at $1 or a little bit more than $1, who -- with some offsets, what's the effect on the income statement? Do you take hedging losses? Or how exactly does that ripple through the income segment?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. Basically, what that does is that, that will just -- you'd still have the purchases -- underlying purchases of those lower raw materials. But as a cash flow hedge, it would offset some of that lower raw material costs. From an earnings standpoint, then that has the same type of effect. It provides a stable cost position, and we're not going to have volatile earnings that go up and down around that propane. And that has -- that was factored into our analysis that Mark talked about, where the net impact going into next year would be roughly $0.25 per share.","Mark J. Costa","And Jeff, just -- those hedges are just going to follow what propane's used, so it'll show up in the segments that use that material.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then lastly, do you have a view on propylene for next year as to where you think it will settle and what exactly that -- and is your view that, that would have a positive economic effect on you or a negative economic effect if it were lower?","Curtis E. Espeland","Jeff, this is Curt. That's a question we're going to be presenting next week as part of our overall view of what's going to help drive earnings growth for next year as one of several factors of input. So if you don't mind, stay tuned until next week.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from James Sheehan of SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A question on the tire market. What gives you the confidence that we're seeing a real pick-up in the tire demand, is it -- rather than just a seasonal impact? And also, could you give us an update on your development of your rolling resistance product?","Mark J. Costa","Sure. So the tire businesses, they've got a great strategy they're going to share it with you next week, that talks about Crystex being a solid source of earnings, and then -- and these growth programs, as you just mentioned. When it comes to demand, from what we can see from our customers and what you're going to see in their calls is I think demand is stabilizing, improving overall globally for primary demand in tires. Obviously, we're going to benefit from that. I think we're still doing a good job of defending our market share in the Crystex business and holding on to that growth as it comes our way. To remind everyone, we always expect to lose a little bit of market share, so we expect to grow through 1\/2 the rate of the market. In a Crystex sense of the world and -- the hard data I have right now is very strong orders in October showing a recovery out of the third quarter. But as I said, I'd like to see several months in a row before we can call a recovery in sort of destocking and softness in tires. From a growth program point of view, we're seeing great success on our 2 top growth programs. We'll tell you a lot more about that next week at Investor Day. But the hydrocarbon resins that are going in as performance additive to improve wear -- improve traction on the tires is showing a lot of interest across a number of our tire OEMs. And so we feel very good about that and seeing strong growth. And then our cellulose ester is also going into -- as a performance additive for the tires, is showing great excitement by our lead alpha customer. We think we're headed towards commercialization soon on that, so we feel great.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And on filter tow, you mentioned the possibility of further inventory adjustments next year. I'm just wondering, how long can the products actually be stored before the customers actually have to replace it?","Mark J. Costa","The life of the product is not a material issue for the inventory adjustments here, so I wouldn't be worried about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Mark, when you think about the portfolio now and Taminco coming in by year-end here, what percent of the portfolio do you think, in terms of your earnings power now, is more specialty than more commoditized stuff going forward?","Mark J. Costa","Mike, thanks for that question. That's a great set-up for Investor Day. We've actually spent a considerable amount of time evaluating -- first of all, getting some clear definitions about what is specialty versus commodity and a third category we'll share with you next week and really getting a much clearer understanding of the entire portfolio of Eastman as well as thinking about Taminco and how that all fits and continues to transform our portfolio into being a much more stable variable margin business. So I think that we'll give you a lot more insight, which, you're going to see, is a great story of the commodity part of Eastman's portfolio becoming a very small percentage of our total. And I'm looking forward to sharing that with you next week.","Curtis E. Espeland","And Mark, if I can add because it's a great opportunity to also highlight the pulp [ph] of the value of Taminco. We do expect that to close before the end of the year. Mark and I have actually had the benefit of going out and meeting the Taminco team and further understanding their businesses, and I think we're very excited about the quality of businesses that they have, the quality and capabilities of the Taminco team. And I think that acquisition will be very complementary to the direction this company is going.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sounds good. And then real quick on Additives & Functional Products. This is the third year in a row earnings have been sort of flattish here. What do you think needs to happen to get that business back on the growth trend longer term?","Mark J. Costa","Well, as you look at AFP, first of all, the revenue growth has been great. So we're seeing strong revenue growth in the coatings areas and some of our other formulary products. Obviously, we had some slow demand in tires, but we may be turning the corner there, as we've discussed. The challenge this year hasn't been revenue, it's been cost-driven. And a number of those cost factors I think are, to some degree, isolated to this year. So you had the huge propane increase and cost structure increase that impacted several of our businesses, including AFP. You had some of the planned outages that came in, and then we've had some specific growth investments we're making around our next generation of technology for Crystex that provided a headwind this year that shouldn't continue into next year. So we see revenue growth continuing into next year, and we see the cost situation improving relative to this year and feel confident about delivering earnings growth next year from AFP.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess 2 questions, one in the spirit of counting chickens before they're hatched. Taminco was fairly vocal about having a pretty rich pipeline of fast payback acquisition targets such as the formic acid deal that they did. Is there any strategic or integration-related reason why, if their math checks out, you wouldn't pull the trigger on those ideas faster than they could have? And secondly, on FX, what do you see as the headwinds at current level for Q4 and for next year?","Mark J. Costa","So on the acquisition front, I'll take that question. I'll give the FX to Curt. On acquisition, I do think they've got a robust portfolio of small bolt-on opportunities to continue building and extending their world leadership position that they have in alkylamines and, like you said, formic acid, which is a nice related product to their market. And we don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue to pursue those kind of opportunities. Clearly, we're going to be focused on delevering in the next 2 years from some of the debt we take on to buy Taminco. So we're not going to be doing any other large acquisitions until we've improved our debt metrics, but that doesn't mean we can't do small bolt-ons that have a great fit and create a lot of very quick payback for our shareholders. And so we'll look at those and do those where they make sense.","Curtis E. Espeland","On currency, Laurence, our primary exposure is the euro. We have some exposure to the yen. On the euro, we do have an active hedging product that helps reduce the volatility from currency fluctuations. You see that in our sales table, and you continue to see currency not having any real material impact on revenues. When we look at going into fourth quarter in terms of volatility, there's a slight headwind. But again, mostly, that's mitigated by our currency program. I think as we get into '15, we'll talk more next week. If the euro stays in that $1.25 to $1.30 level, it will continue not to have a material impact on us going into next year.","Operator","And as we have no more questions, I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Riddle.","Gregory A.

First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company\u2019s third quarter 2019 financial results news release during this call and in the accompanying slides and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2019 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2019.","Second, earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core and unusual items, and use as an adjusted tax rate the forecasted full year tax rate. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the third quarter 2019 financial results news release, which can be found on our website www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings exclude any non-core unusual or non-recurring items and assume a forecasted full year tax rate.","With that, I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 with some strategic highlights. We had solid results in the third quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment which has deteriorated in the second half of this year. EPS for the third quarter was similar to the second quarter, especially considering the local electrical outage that caused a shutdown at our Longview site. We took actions to offset a decline in volumes, as our teams are focusing on what they can control to manage costs better, accelerate our innovation programs and remain disciplined with discretionary spending among other actions which led to the solid performance.","Despite the economic challenges, we remain on track for approximately $400 million in new business revenue closes from innovation in 2019 led by Advanced Materials. This segment has a number of innovative products that are showing tremendous resilience in this environment. Even with exposure to the challenge auto OEM markets, strong growth across specialty products like paint protection film, Tritan, acoustics and heads-up \u2013 heads-up display interlayers are offsetting weakness in the core business. AMs resilience is a testament to the strength of the strategy and our innovation programs we\u2019ve been leading for close to a decade. And although AFP innovation initiatives were started later, I\u2019m confident they will make substantial progress over the next couple of years.","As we discussed before in this challenging business environment, we continue to achieve our cost reduction targets where we stay focused on innovation to create our own growth. Consistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we returned $583 million to stockholders through the first nine months of 2019, through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We are also focused on improving the strength of our balance sheet by de-levering $300 million for the full year. And finally, we expect our free cash flow to approach $1.1 billion.","Two additional highlights, I am especially proud of. Earlier this week, we announced that we have achieved commercial operation of our carbon renewal technology or CRT, which is a form of chemical recycling. This is a significant step forward in our efforts to help solve the problem of plastic waste and accelerate the circular economy. CRT is a game changer for recycling, because it provides an end of life solution for many plastics from a variety of sources that have no alternative use and end up in landfill or the ocean. CRT is operated here in Kingsport at our largest manufacturing site, so we can take full advantage of our integration to make this happen. This means a plastic waste we recycle through CRT will go into products used in markets we are already participating, including textiles, cosmetics, personal care and ophthalmics. And with CRT, plastic waste can be recycled in infinite number of times without degradation of quality unlike mechanical recycling.","In 2020, we expect to use of to 50 million pounds of waste plastic in our CRT operations. This technology significantly changes the value proposition of our cellulosic products which have been about 60% bio based and certified sustainable for us. Now the other 40% will be recycled content, which creates a very compelling offer with a dramatic increase in the environmental sensitivity and many of these markets that we serve. And within the next several years, we expect revenue from CRT will be in the $200 million to $300 million range with significant upside from there in our specialty products. So we\u2019re very excited about this milestone. In addition, by the end of the year we also expect to be commercial scale for another chemical recycling technology for polyester. One of many more advancements, you can expect from Eastman in the area of waste plastic recycling and accelerating the circular economy. Second, we recently were recognized for our leadership in the area of sustainability by LUXE PACK, the premier cosmetic packaging event for luxury brands.","Eastman has won of the 2009 LUXE PACK Green Award for activate in the circular economy. At the LUXE PACK show Eastman showcased next generation Eastman Treva, engineering cellulosic bioplastics and introduced Eastman Cristal Revel copolyesters, which is a new line of proprietary consumer recycled content compounded polyesters. These investments enable us to be a leader in accelerating the circular economy a commercial scale ahead of many others.","With that, I will turn it over to Curt to discuss the corporate and segment financial results.","Curt Espeland","Thanks Mark and again good morning everyone. Starting with the corporate review on Slide 4 and beginning with the year-over-year comparison. Sales revenue declined due to lower selling prices, lower sales volume and mix and the stronger dollar. Chemical Intermediates was the biggest contributor to the lower selling prices, and this is mostly due to prices following lower raw material and energy prices, as you would expect. The lower volume was primarily due to the challenging economic climate which worsened during the quarter as industrial production decelerated, as well as the impact of planned and unplanned shut downs this quarter. This deceleration had a significant unfavorable mix impact with lower volumes of high value specialties. We partially offset these factors with growth in new business revenue from innovation.","EBIT declined due to the combination of lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix, increased maintenance costs and the stronger dollar somewhat offset by cost reduction efforts. Looking sequentially, revenue declined slightly due to lower selling prices. EBIT was down somewhat, mostly due to the higher maintenance related costs. There are a number of factors that have changed since our call in July. Industrial production has decelerated, driven by the further escalation in global trade issues including the U.S. China trade dispute in August. As you can see in the German and U.S. economic data, and we believe it is also occurring in China. In particular, we can see the impact of key consumer discretionary end market slowing, including transportation, consumer durables and electronics. As a result, volume has come in lower than expected, which in turn has resulted in lower capacity utilization. In an environment like we are in now, we remain focused on what we can control closing new business revenue, reducing costs and generating strong free cash flow.","Now turning to Slide 5 to review Advanced Materials which had a record quarter despite about one-third of the segment exposed to the automotive market, on a year-over-year basis, sales revenue decreased modestly as our innovation success is mostly offset demand challenges caused by the global trade disputes, disruptions and reduced global automotive sales. In particular we delivered strong growth in premium products including Tritan Copolyester, Saflex acoustic interlayers and paint protection film. EBIT increased primarily due to lower raw material costs, more favorable product mix and continued cost management. Sequentially, revenue was stable and EBIT increased. The increase in EBIT was largely driven by higher Triton volumes, the flow-through of lower raw material costs and the benefit of cost management. As we think about the balance of the year, we expect to continue to benefit from strong growth in some of the more premium product lines, which will help to offset the general weakness in some of our end markets such as transportation.","Also consistent with my corporate comments, we expect a normal seasonal deceleration in demand in the fourth quarter which will offset benefits from lower raw material costs and cost actions. All-in, we think the fourth quarter EBIT will be up significantly year-over-year. Putting it all together we expect Advanced Materials EBIT to grow in the low single-digits for the full year of 2019. These results in this challenging economic climate demonstrate the strength of our innovation-driven growth model to create our own growth and defend our value with customers.","Turning to Slide 6 in Additives & Functional Products, year-over-year sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices, lower sales volume and less favorable product mix and a stronger dollar. Lower selling prices were primarily due to lower raw material prices with about 50% \u2013 40% of the decline from cost pass-through contracts and the remainder attributed to increased competitive pressure, particularly for adhesives resins, tire additives and formic acid that serves several end markets. We realized solid growth in Care Chemicals, water treatment and specialty fluids. But that growth was more than offset by weaker end market demand resulting from continuing global trade related pressures particularly in transportation and other consumer discretionary markets. EBIT decreased primarily due to less favorable product mix, lower sales volume, increase planned manufacturing site maintenance costs and a stronger dollar. Excluding currency, spreads were flat.","Turning to the sequential comparison, sales increased as higher volume and better product mix was mostly offset by lower prices, particularly for Care Chemical cost pass-through contracts. EBIT decreased due to the volume growth and mix improvement being more than offset by higher maintenance shutdown costs as well as lower prices and tire additives and formic acid products. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect earnings to moderate due to normal seasonality, albeit from a lower base, due to the slower economy. This uncertain environment is weighing on the end markets for AFP. We are seeing some signs that customers may have decided to stay down longer coming out of their fourth quarter shutdowns. With this risk in mind, we expect AFPs EBIT in the fourth quarter to be similar to last year.","Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the performance in Additives & Functional Products this year and add a little more color. Although it is hard to see in the results, we had about two-thirds of the revenue performing well in this difficult business environment. These areas were Care Chemicals, water treatment, specialty fluids and coatings businesses as well as parts of animal nutrition. Strong growth in Care Chemicals, water treatment and specialty fluids expanding spreads and fixed cost reduction actions were offset by lower coatings volumes in high value additives in auto models, currency headwinds and lower animal nutrition demand due to China swine fever. Earnings in these businesses combined have only declined modestly year-to-date, where there has been the most pressure in the remaining third of this segment has been specifically tire additives, adhesives resins and formic acid businesses. So the pressure you are seeing in this segment is not in most business but rather in those three businesses I just mentioned.","Now the Chemical Intermediates on Slide 7. Year-over-year sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices and lower sales volume. The lower selling prices were due to lower raw material prices and competitive activity. The lower sales volume was due to weaker demand particularly for agricultural end markets as a result of wet weather and for other intermediate products due to increased competitive activity. EBIT decreased due to increased plant shutdown costs and a local power disruption impact in the Longview, Texas manufacturing site. Taken together, these costs were about a $30 million headwind for Chemical Intermediates in the quarter, $15 million of which was due to the unplanned power outage. EBIT also decreased due to lower sales volume and lower spreads. These headwinds were partially offset by the benefits from the recent refinery grade propylene investment and continued cost management. On a sequential basis, sales revenue decreased due to lower sales volume, particularly for functional amines due to normal seasonality. EBIT decreased primarily due to the planned and unplanned outages, continued spread decline in Olefins and acetyl and functional amine volume seasonality.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there are few headwinds in front of us. First, volume is lower due to weak demand environment, but also increased in competitive pressure as markets outside of the United States are increasingly challenged by global trade issues. Also remember the cost of the turnaround of our \u2013 largest cracker in Longview, Texas is in both the third and fourth quarters. So a similar amount of the cost of that planned shutdown will be in the fourth quarter. And then finally, customer inventory management at year-end potentially beyond that normal seasonality could put pressure on our volumes and our capacity utilization rates.","Finishing up the segment reviews with Fibers on Slide 8, year-over-year sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower acetate flake sales volume due to our acetate tow joint venture in China attributed to customer buying patterns. The sales revenue decline was partially offset by the sales from the recently acquired cellulosic yarn business and increased sales of textile innovation products. EBIT decreased due to the impact of the inventory recovery in the third quarter of last year or third quarter of 2018 from the coal gas incident and less favorable product mix. On a sequential basis, results were stable with the second quarter. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect earnings to be consistent with the run rate of the last two quarters as we have made good progress stabilizing results in this business.","Lastly, a quick update on our textiles business within Fibers, we are making great progress in our focus areas within textiles as we are aligned with some of the leading brands in our materials particular Naia is incorporated into these customers, sustainability collections. This has been somewhat offset by slower demand and more traditional applications such as suit linings and tapes due to slower economic growth. With that said, we remain confident that we are on track with our textiles initiatives to offset the expected continued decline in tow demand in the long-term. In particular, I am very excited about how we can accelerate growth in Naia with carbon renewal technology adding recycled content to a product that is already bio-based.","Switching to the financial highlights on Slide 9, we continue to expect free cash flow approaching $1.1 billion. Our free cash flow is up about $50 million this quarter compared to third quarter of 2018. And our business teams are working hard to deliver this result in a challenging fourth quarter. Consistent with our track record, I\u2019m confident in our ability to deliver solid results. Through nine months, we\u2019ve returned $583 million to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends and we remain committed to our investment grade credit rating. For the full year, we still expect to de-lever by about $300 million. In the last few years, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation through a combination of share repurchases and increasing dividend and debt pay down. As we progress into 2020, we will continue to use our cash in a combination of all three, including further de-levering in 2020. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be 16%. Capital expenditures will be approximately $425 million to $450 million for 2019, and we still expect corporate other net cost to be a little above $60 million for the full year.","With that, I will turn it back to Mark.","Mark Costa","Thanks, Kurt. On Slide 10, I will provide an update on our 2019 outlook. We continue making progress in closing new business from innovation and market development initiatives. But the increased trade uncertainty including from the U.S. China trade dispute has caused a meaningful deceleration in industrial activity around the world, including Asia and Europe and now here in the U.S. In this kind of economic environment, we are resolutely focused on the things that we can control. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve made excellent progress on increasing new business from innovation in this environment particularly in Advanced Materials.","In addition, we continue to aggressively manage costs across the company and we continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow this year despite the challenging environment. However, this market context is leading to lower volumes in the second half of the year than we had previously expected. There is some continuing pockets of de-stocking related to lower demand such as transportation in Europe and the U.S. And we are also seeing some customers extend maintenance downtimes and shift turnarounds into the fourth quarter to manage inventory due to this deceleration that was not expected in the summer.","We are also managing our inventory in the quarter, in line with what we are seeing from our customers. These lower volumes are resulting in lower capacity utilization than we had expected, and the fixed cost hit of the utilization is mostly offsetting the cost savings from our productivity actions we took in the first half of the year. Putting this altogether, we are updating our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $7 and $7.20. Our guidance is based on current economic conditions and normal seasonality from here. However, we can\u2019t predict macroeconomic conditions and the extent to which customers will choose to manage inventory at the end of the year. I can give you scenarios where we could be higher given the strength of October orders or lower if we face unusually high inventory management December. And we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of approaching $1.1 billion which remains a priority and will be a great result in this environment and will present very attractive free cash flow conversion.","Earlier I mentioned, it\u2019s our robustness that gives me confidence in our future what remains true for me today. Even with some unprecedented challenges we face the people of Eastman remain steadfast in our commitment to drive results. And I want to thank them for continuing to execute on our strategy while aggressively managing costs. Big picture, we will continue to focus on what we can control as we manage through this incredibly uncertain environment and remain committed to long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation from our owners for all of our stakeholders. At the same time, we are looking at every action we can take to increase performance this year and next. Focusing on engaging with customers who seek innovation, especially in the areas of sustainability this fuels our growth in new business revenue closes, providing resources to grow in markets that have favorable trends and resilience in this environment.","We are planning to take additional productivity actions to accelerate top line growth to the bottom line. Building on our strong track record of disciplined portfolio management, we will continue to look for opportunities where optimization makes sense. Continue to be focused on free cash flow generation as we manage working capital and we will be disciplined in how we deploy free cash flow. In addition, we are creating another big vector of growth with our new technologies for chemical recycling to enable a circular economy as we once again innovate solutions to improve the quality of life in a material way. And with this meaningful deceleration industrial production reverses as we know well, we will be poised to create even more of our own growth from our innovation-driven growth model and accelerate earnings growth as the mix and fixed cost leverage becomes favorable in the recovery. That\u2019s why I am comfortable we are going to win today and into the future.","With that, I will turn it back to Greg.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thanks Mark. As usual, we have a lot of people on the line this morning and we would like to get to as many questions as possible. So I ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, Matt, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First we will go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Mark, looking ahead to 2020...","Mark Costa","Good morning David.","David Begleiter","I know it\u2019s early but \u2013 good, thank you, I know it\u2019s early for 2020. But can you still achieve you think your long-term 8% to 12% EPS growth in 2020 versus this past year?","Mark Costa","Thanks for your question, David. It\u2019s good to hear from you. So we are not going to provide a quantitative bridge at this stage in this environment, but let me sort of walk you through how we think about it from where we are today. So if the current economic conditions continue into next year, I guess we all know we have to make that assumption. We believe will deliver earnings growth going into \u201820 versus \u201919 and it really sort of breaks down into sort of three core buckets in how we do that. First, innovation is always at the heart of our strategy and you have seen a great demonstration of how that\u2019s created value for us in Advanced Materials and we continue driving growth there as well as continuing to get traction on some innovation in AFP even though it\u2019s much more early stages at AFP, it\u2019s going to contribute like it has this year in some places. It\u2019s also important to remember that we have a lot of markets that do have favorable growth across Advanced Materials, AFP and in CI as well as textiles. So there is a lot of places where we have good growth, whether it\u2019s Care Chemicals, water treatment and going back to a more normal seasonal demand, medical applications. So, there is just good growth that\u2019s going to help, but we do have exposure in consumer discretionary around 45%. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that 55% is actually quite stable in consumables etcetera. The other part that\u2019s going to help on the demand side will be the vast majority of the de-stocking, if not all should have played out by the end of this year. So, at least on a relative basis, there is no way that we can see the amount of de-stocking that we are seeing this year occur again next year. So that gives you some additional relief in demand and growth. So volume should be better on a variety of different fronts.","The second of course is what you can control as well as your cost structure. And as this industrial recession that we\u2019ve been in for the last 9 to 12 months continues to drag out, we know that we also have to start taking more additional actions on productivity. So we\u2019ll start looking at how we build on what we\u2019ve done this year, we\u2019ve taken out a net $40 million of cost down in manufacturing this year as that annualizes in the next year and if we have volume equal to or better than this year, that\u2019s going to start to flow through and be a benefit. We are going to are looking at our asset footprint and whether there is opportunities to optimize our asset footprint and take out chunks of costs. We\u2019re going to look at how we get much more productive with digital investments. We\u2019ve made choices to invest a lot in digital this year, in productivity and commercial execution and already seeing a lot of benefits that\u2019s paying for those investments this year and we\u2019ll start seeing the benefits on a net basis next year and there is more investments we\u2019re going to continue making, And there is a broad set of manufacturing initiatives that we\u2019re doing on productivity that are giving benefits to the success we had this year that will continue to increase the benefits next year around maintenance and that\u2019s both in earnings and cash as well as some other activities. But to be clear, we are going to continue investing in innovation. So next year, we will spend more on innovation than we did this year. We have so many huge innovation programs going commercial in AM and especially in AFP, we have to provide the resources to close that business with customers and ensure we get the benefits of those investments. So that\u2019s the second bucket. The third bucket is strong free cash flow. Even in this tough environment, we are generating incredibly strong free cash flow at a very high conversion rate and we have every expectation we can do the same thing next year, and we will continue to be disciplined in how we deploy that cash in dividends, share repurchases, debt repayment and bolt-ons where it makes sense. So that\u2019s sort of relative current economic conditions. If there is a trade war settlement, we will do a lot better than that. And if there is a recession, obviously where demand is more challenged, we have additional levers we can pull to manage costs. And the innovation will still create some growth to offset those challenges and I still think the de-stocking is behind us. The thing to keep in mind is, if there is a recovery, the leverage on the upside is equal to the leverage on the downside that we have seen in the last 9 months. So mixed volume asset utilization will come back in a mirror image of what we have been through could there \u2013 could provide substantial upside.","David Begleiter","Very helpful. Thank you. And just one more thing for both you and Curt, can you comment on the recent Moody\u2019s action to put you on negative watch and how you are thinking maybe about debt reduction versus buybacks next year? Would you be focused more on debt reduction just to remove this issue completely from the table rather than keep on buying back stock? Thank you.","Curt Espeland","Yes. The recent change to negative watch really doesn\u2019t significantly change our capital allocation philosophy, as you would expect, we have a very open dialog with our agent \u2013 rating agencies about our plans and expectations, they understand, we remain committed to our investment grade credit rating, which is again not only important to us, but many of our investors that I speak with. So we will remain disciplined with our approach to capital allocation which \u201819 includes $300 million of de-leveraging. If the environment continues to be challenging, as we go into 2020, we will probably do a similar amount of de-levering at a minimum. I imagine over the next couple of months there will be a few debates internally and externally around what should be the amount of de-levering and I look forward to your opinion, David and others on that topic. But regardless of what we do, we will remain on the path of improving our overall debt and EBITDA ratios and further strengthen our balance sheet. A couple of other things I would just remind everyone and David I know you know these well is, we have no material debt maturities over the next couple of years. We generate great cash flows and even in a recessionary environment and then we also have plenty of access to liquidity. So we are well positioned to manage through this uncertain economic environment. So I feel very good about that. And also a reminder that a disciplined capital allocation approach whether that\u2019s putting cash to share repurchases, bolt-on acquisitions or even debt pay-down are all viable ways of creating value for our shareholders. So, we are going to remain committed to our investment grade rating. We have a reasonable pathway to continue to improve our credit metrics and then that\u2019s consistent with our commitment around the disciplined capital allocation philosophy.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, hi, good morning. I had a quick question on tire additives business. You had those duties on Chinese tires. How is the trade flow impacting your China business? And is there an offsetting benefit in the U.S. and Europe business?","Mark Costa","So, the tire duties in the U.S. and in Europe had a real impact on tire demand in AFP. What happened is this is really at the customer level they were shipping a lot of tires and it was found that they were dumping in both Europe and U.S. So, all those tires got backed up into China and there is too many tire companies in China and so there has been a pretty aggressive fight there, but trade flows rebalance. So these Chinese companies have also built plants in Southeast Asia. So they just shift their production efforts to go into Europe and the U.S. from there and so it\u2019s overall created a lot of pressure for all the tire companies. We can see that by some of the big multinational tire company announcement recently about the actions they are taking to improve their cost structure. But for us it did create predominantly a very competitive situation among additive suppliers into tires in China and we felt that impact both in volume and in pricing, which is why we have had the pressure in that business and that ultimately moves across the globe to some degree.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you. And question for Curt, Curt, you just talked about potential more de-leveraging in 2020 if the economy remains weak. If the economy remains weak, would you try to get some growth through M&A as well and get some inorganic growth. I know that doesn\u2019t stick well de-leveraging, but given the choices, how would you allocate capital if valuations come down and M&A looks attractive? Thank you.","Curt Espeland","Sure. While we have always considered, you think about that strategic cash that we have after we funded our own \u2013 already organic growth. We love the opportunity to pursue opportunities of growth and bolt-on acquisitions through M&A. And I think we would just have to do that in a smart way. I\u2019ve always told the business teams that if they find a great attractive bolt-on acquisition or acquisition in general, we\u2019ll find a way to finance it and we\u2019ll find a way to finance it that\u2019s still consistent with our investment grade credit rating.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Good morning everyone. A question on Chemical Intermediates, the agriculture impact on the amines, obviously we know its tough season in the U.S., do we need to lapse that meaning, do you need the channel inventory to be drawn down before you are going to sell back through so that this could be an issue all the way through the middle of next year or is it already sort of played out?","Mark Costa","Hey, Vincent. From what we can see and what our customers are telling us there one of the volume challenges we are having the back half of this year is their efforts to take their inventory down given the weak season we had this year. Our belief is they will achieve those goals and get back to sort of what is a sort of normal production strategy next year and we will see the benefits of that demand.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And can I also ask you the other and corporate costs appear to be up a lot in the quarter, was there a reason for that and how should we think about that number next year?","Mark Costa","Yes. So if you think about the year-over-year impact of any other segment the primary driver has been that higher pension costs that we talked about, the $30 million or roughly $0.20 impact. And most of that which is really driven by the discount rate as well as the lower assets we started the year, that\u2019s really what drove the delta \u2013 great management of our cost and innovation programs. So the other areas, so it\u2019s really the pension cost. As I think about 2020, a little early, but you have already seen the discount rates coming down, so that could very well improve our pension costs next year, we will see if that holds true as we finish out the year.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Next we will hear from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. On your cash flow statement, there has been $165 million positive swing for the first nine months in other items net. What is that and does that reverse next year or continue? Can you provide some elaboration?","Mark Costa","Sure. Really there is two main drivers and that other cash items, Jeff, that are kind of an anomaly this year. First, last year and the end of the third quarter of \u201818, we had a $65 million insurance receivable that we collected the following month. Obviously, we don\u2019t have that kind of receivable this year. And then secondly, this year, we actually have a higher restructuring accrual, a higher than last year because of the events that took place early in this year and that\u2019s roughly $25 million. So those are the two main drivers of note. The other things are just the normal things you see resulting from timing of tax payments, other miscellaneous payables-receivables. So you shouldn\u2019t see this magnitude of change next year just because of those two things I just mentioned.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. In listening to your conference call, you spoke about increased competitive activity in the number of businesses and Chemical Intermediates and in your AFP segment, and at least to my ears that sounds new. And you seem to tie it to slowdown in demand and trade difficulties. Can you elaborate on your competitive position in a number of businesses where it seems that the competitive activity has intensified? Can you talk about why that\u2019s the case and how long do you think it will maintain itself?","Mark Costa","Sure, Jeff. It\u2019s a good question and love to address it. So first of all Advanced Materials I think is looking exactly as a great specialty business, it\u2019s got. Demand challenges, obviously there is competition, but the innovation is allowing it to offset those market challenges and deliver strong growth, especially when you think about the high consumer discretionary spend and benefit from raw material flow through as you can sort of defend the value in your pricing. So that business is on track and it looks like it should. And, as Curt mentioned in the prepared remarks about two-thirds of the revenue the AFP looks just like AM right. It\u2019s got good strong market growth in a bunch of end markets, even though it does have headwinds in the macro economy, especially in automotive. It\u2019s offsetting it with expanding spreads and if you back out currency the earnings are even closer to just year-over-year flat. So that business in that part of the portfolio is doing quite well. And then you\u2019ve got this one-third, that goes to your question, where there is increased competitive activity. And obviously we have some of that in CI in a few places. On the AFP front, the three areas we identified tires, adhesives and formic acid have that dynamic. The dynamic is a little bit different in each business. So in tires, really it is a demand driven event as I mentioned earlier, where you\u2019ve got a drop in demand. It\u2019s increasing competitive activity and of course, we have our new next-generation Crystex we\u2019ve launched. We have other innovation in tire resins etc that offset some of that pressure, but it\u2019s just too early stage on the new Crystex launch to sort of offset it. And so you\u2019ve got pressure in earnings, both in the volume in the macro as well as in spreads. Same is true in adhesives, but which is more of a supply driven event. The demand is a little bit more stable there. But you\u2019ve had the new supply, which we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. Similar, we\u2019ve got innovation launch there to offset it with ultra pure which is this non-emissive low odor or no odor resin, great inventions in amorphous polyolefins that we\u2019re launching, but not sufficient in this environment to offset some of that pressure. And Formex a more narrow story of just a competitor was shut down in China that came back and it would been fine or mitigated if demand for swine was not going well in China to consume that new capacity, but when the swine populations off 25% to 40% you\u2019ve got a problem. So overall, what you\u2019ve got is a situation where this one-third is not performing the way we\u2019d like. And we recognize that this is not the kind of stability in overall AFP that we wanted to deliver. So we\u2019re goanna start looking at all options on how we address this. Those options could be how to restructure some of these businesses or how to partner with them or potential divestment. What\u2019s important to keep in mind is that a lot of considerations have to go into how you make portfolio decisions like this. So you\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019re not overreacting to sort of short-term macroeconomic problems. You make sure you really assess what is the innovation potential or other improvement opportunities you could pursue, and of course, you have to think about timing of these kind of decisions. But we\u2019re going to start doing that. CI is critical vertical integration. We haven\u2019t changed our view on the value of it, but we\u2019re going to look at asset optimization opportunities there to improve our ability to be more sort of stable. RGP is a great example of an investment we made last year that reduced our ethylene exposure that\u2019s been quite beneficial this year. And we\u2019re going to try and think about what else we can do. So, we do recognize we\u2019ve got some volatility. The pressures in CI I think is well covered sort of competitive pressure in acetyls and olefins, but we are not standing still, we are going to take action and see what we can do to improve things.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next question will come from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America.","Matthew DeYoe","Good morning.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","Matthew DeYoe","You just stated like the backdrop continues to worsen due to trade uncertainty at least was one of the key drivers. Volume is actually shifting on the headlines that you\u2019re seeing or just pointing to general [indiscernible]. So I\u2019m trying to gauge how sensitive your top line is when you had mention orders picked up in October briefly. But then, would that be consistent with the trade discussions and possible traction there or is that just maybe a one-off?","Mark Costa","Well, first I have learned my lesson about predicting the macro economy this year and exactly what to interpret from any order pattern in one month. I think there is a lot of volatility uncertainty out there, where you go back and forth between an escalation that trade war in August and where there is Phase 1 progress that\u2019s debatable in October and there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty that\u2019s impacting business and consumer confidence out there. Especially in China, and how that\u2019s impacted their economy and sort of global effect that as places like Europe and Southeast Asia, so dependent on exporting to China and you can even now see it impacting sort of U.S. industrial activity. So it\u2019s a little hard to predict how this is going to trend, but I would tell you that as we look at the impacted \u2013 that our guidance and performance has had through the year it is entirely a volume mix story. Where we were in July, we were expecting the economy to be stable relative to the second quarter as we said. Obviously things escalated and that\u2019s why our volume forecast came off \u2013 were actually off a bit as Curt mentioned in 3Q, and now as we go into 4Q with this slower activity plus normal seasonality leads to this decline in volume, but it\u2019s all hard to interpret.","Matthew DeYoe","Okay. And if I look at AFP, EBIT margins are down 210 bps and 2Q, like 260 bps in 3Q. How much of this is actually due to poor utilization rates versus competition on price versus volumetric to clients. Give me some clarity there?","Mark Costa","So the entire \u2013 for AFP in total the entirety of the hit is a volume mix and asset utilization story. So if you look at the total segment altogether spreads are about flat year-over-year. Obviously there is a bit of a currency hit, but it\u2019s much more moderate in the second half of the year. So it is totally volume mix hit on the impact that has on variable margin as well as the impact it has on asset utilization. But as I said, it\u2019s sort of a two-thirds, one-thirds story where we have improving spreads in some places and and compressing spreads in others netting out to flat. That\u2019s not the margin story.","Operator","Next we will hear from James Sheehan with SunTrust.","James Sheehan","Good morning. Thank you. So you just referenced in AFP about a third of the business was not performing the way you would have liked. Could you also assess what proportion of the makeover business falls into that category as well?","Mark Costa","So the only part of to make that\u2019s in the one third is formic acid. So when we bought Taminco we were very excited about the Alkylamines platform and the value of that integrated platform into a wide range of end markets. They had acquired a small business in formic acid about a year ahead of buying to Taminco for us. That was a business we\u2019d actually looked at and didn\u2019t find very attractive, but which is part of the deal that we had to accept. So it\u2019s a business that just has some competitive challenges, but it\u2019s a very small part of income.","Curt Espeland","And if I could add some of the positives that Mark referenced in the two parts of two-thirds were also to meaningful Taminco acquisition.","Mark Costa","Yes, we have tremendous growth in Care Chemicals and water treatment. And long-term, we\u2019ve had great growth in the ag business as well over in the CI side from Taminco, it\u2019s been a great acquisition.","James Sheehan","And on the chemical recycling projects, you referenced several $100 million of revenue ultimately. How quickly could you start to see commercial revenues from that? What segment would you report those results? And if you could just comment on long-term project returns, if we were to compare the expected returns of those recycling initiatives to other more traditional product innovations, is the ROI higher, lower or about the same?","Mark Costa","Sure. So we\u2019re incredibly excited about what we can do on the circular economy. For those of you who\u2019ve been paid attention to this industry, in the last 18 to 24 months, sustainability environmental sensitivity about the impact we are having in the environment, especially with plastics in the ocean and the issues with landfill etc. is one of the biggest disruptive macro trends I\u2019ve seen in a decade. And it\u2019s either a great opportunity as its for Eastman or challenge as it might be for others who are heavily in single use plastics. Fortunately for us, we got PT in 2011. So we\u2019re not doing circular economy to defend our existing business and single use plastics. All of our investments are to improve our competitive offerings in more durable applications and more specialty applications by adding recycle content into it to deliver net growth. And so we\u2019ll be commercial as we said in the fourth quarter of this year with both technologies, the one we announced this week as well as the polyester one by the end of the year. And that will be incorporating products and driving revenue growth for us next year into the first quarter. Customers are incredibly excited especially in the luxury world, so think cosmetic packaging high in ophthalmic sunglasses where our polymers go. Our textile business even though bio content is highly valued by our customers, the women\u2019s wear fashion industries are extremely focused on how to close the loop, a lot of textiles, a phenomenal amount of textiles end up in landfill especially with fast fashion. And so they want to close the loop in our unique CRT technology allows us to actually take back textiles, garments, and recycle them, not just waste single use plastic. We can even carpet back. So we can solve a lot of real serious problems that other technologies can\u2019t do. So we\u2019re really excited about it. It\u2019s just a \u2013 it\u2019s great opportunity and this is just the beginning to be clear. These first two steps are very incremental capital and modifying our gas-fire with the CRT to sort of take plastic waste instead of coal, and turn that into cellulosic products. Same thing with polyester, the first step is fairly modest. The ROIs are extremely high. There are bigger investments we can make to do a lot more than we\u2019re going to do this first step, but even when I look at those capitals, the returns are well above a typical investment project. Because we\u2019re leveraging into products we already make and already sell into existing markets, it\u2019s a drop-in replacement. It\u2019s just now has recycle content. So we don\u2019t have to do qualification.","James Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Thank you. Mark in your concluding comments on scenarios, it sounded like you\u2019re October orders actually picked up from September. Why would that have been?","Mark Costa","What I\u2019d say is actually October orders are holding similar to September where they normally start trending off seasonally. So I don\u2019t want to overstate the October order claim, but it\u2019s certainly coming in a bit better than we had forecasted. I think it\u2019s just \u2013 customers are managing and growing with a little more optimism and we\u2019re holding in reasonably well. I can say there is any specific reason I can point to you at this stage. And we really have to watch out for where December plays out this year with this uncertainty, it could go either way.","John Roberts","And then secondly, do you expect IMO 2020 to have an impact on spreads between refinery grade propylene and chemical grade propylene?","Mark Costa","As we look at it, we\u2019re not seeing that as a significant event. I know there\u2019s a lot written about it and a lot of opinions about it. Actually RGP investment I think helps us a bit and gives us more flexibility on that scenario.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will hear from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Mark, when you look across your portfolio, do you see opportunities for rationalization of assets. It sounds like some of the margin pressure is utilization related, quite understandably, given the environment. So, are there opportunities to consolidate plants or would that be a mistake because you\u2019ll need the capacity when the macros start to cooperate again in the future?","Mark Costa","Hey Kevin. So we are looking for opportunities like that. We\u2019re not going to talk about it on this call, but we have several asset options under investigation for that reason. But our focus is always on innovation being the core thing. But in this kind of environment, you have to look at every lever you can to improve productivity and your cost position to compete.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. And then secondly for Curt, it seems as though you have put all the capital budget to some degree, maybe you can talk about what has changed there and what your preliminary views of the trajectory could be looking into 2020 and beyond?","Curt Espeland","Sure. On the capital front, what we\u2019ve been doing is this clause, we are making some adjustments to the investments we make mostly of those are growth investments, just because of the environment and we\u2019re not quite sure when we\u2019re going to need that new capacity. We\u2019ve already added a large portion of capacity to support our growth this year and last year. So we\u2019ve kind of just tweak things because we can move things out just because the demand environment is not there right now. And then we\u2019ve got a great capital team that\u2019s also being disciplined on the amount of support capital that\u2019s needed to run this company in this kind of environment. Looking at next year, I still keep it right now in the same range we are at today. But a lot of it\u2019s going to depend on what the economic environment is. If it\u2019s starting to improve, we might pick up our capital a little bit, if it deteriorates, we may slow it down a little bit more.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question will come from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.","Frank Mitsch","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Mark Costa","Good morning.","Frank Mitsch","I want to think about the fourth quarter and your implied guidance there because it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s the lowest EPS ex-CGI that you\u2019ve done in the last five years. And obviously, volume mix is going to be a big part of that. And so I\u2019m trying to think what the range, I mean your volume mix has been improving throughout the year, it was down 6% Q1, down 5% Q2, down 3% this past quarter. What are you baking in to get to this low level for 4Q?","Mark Costa","So, Frank. I mean part of where we\u2019re coming from is we said in the \u2013 we always do this to some degree assume the current activity economic and macroeconomically is the basis for our forecast, so obviously moderated through the third quarter. And then we\u2019re adding normal seasonality on to that lower base. I mean that\u2019s how the forecast got constructed. In addition to that you\u2019ve got lower capacity utilization, because volumes this year are going to be lower than last year for the second half. So you\u2019ve got some headwind on asset utilization and that adds to serve some of the decline from third quarter to fourth quarter. But those really are \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s a little bit of increased competitive pressure on spreads in CI that\u2019s part of the story as well, but that\u2019s a small part of the story relative to the volume mix and asset utilization.","Frank Mitsch","So I mean, should we be thinking about low single-digits or low double-digits in terms of a decline in volume mix in terms of what\u2019s embedded in your guidance?","Curt Espeland","I would say Frank as some of the volume mix that you\u2019ve seen in the last quarter two is kind of what we are expecting. It\u2019s really that utilization effect, that really start to hurt our margins in the fourth quarter. And then we\u2019ll see how those respond depending on demand environment in 2020.","Mark Costa","Yes. Something I\u2019d add on that front is that, what I\u2019d say is what you\u2019re seeing is how we\u2019re performing in an industrial recession Frank. I don\u2019t think there is one in front of us. I think we\u2019re already in the middle of one that started in the fourth quarter of last year, where you put a lot of the sort of de-stocking, drop in volume that\u2019s where some primary demand, we\u2019ve already been enduring all of that and some of its continuing in the fourth quarter in the US is starting to slow down. We turned to over high-cost inventory from third quarter of \u201818 to low cost inventory that\u2019s always really painful. A lot of that is now behind us. So all of that\u2019s behind us at this point. So you\u2019re more a bit about where primary demand goes as you look at next year and \u2013 but you\u2019re still sort of finishing a lot of that sort of adjustment to recession environment out now. And of course you got all these actions we\u2019re going to take. Another reference point is when you look at what we said at Innovation Day in 2014 that our new portfolio would be a lot more resilient and only down sort of 20% if you did the \u201809 recession. With the current portfolio versus what we had in \u201809 versus what we were down was 40%, that sort of playing out on a ratio basis now. So if you look at sort of our earnings performance for the first nine months we\u2019re about half of sort of the commodity, diversified companies and how we\u2019ve declined. So the portfolio is performing better. We\u2019re obviously not happy about parts of our portfolio and we\u2019re going to look at ways to address it, but I think we\u2019re doing quite well in this environment.","Frank Mitsch","Alright. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Anthony Walker","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Anthony Walker on for Bob. Earlier in the call you guys referenced the several buckets that would impact 2020 results. And I understand you\u2019re not providing a bridge to next year. I was hoping that you could maybe walk us through the several one-time items impacting 2019 results that you would expect not to repeat next year?","Curt Espeland","So the only other one-time items that I can think that we\u2019ve talked about this year. One is the unplanned outage, so that you don\u2019t expect. And in pension, I already mentioned earlier, where things sit today, pension could be lower. Pension cost should be lower next year versus this year and then currency will be stable. So those are the two or three other major items that I can think of that help next year that are different than they are this year.","Mark Costa","But it\u2019s important to keep in mind there are a lot of cost reduction actions we\u2019ve taken are going to sort of annualize and flow into a benefit next year. And if we get volume to be better next year, which I believe we will, that will flow through attractive way with asset utilization.","Anthony Walker","And just can you help us in the bridge to free cash flow in 2019 which you maintained despite the reduction in EPS, I assume you\u2019re anticipating a pretty big tailwind from working capital? Thanks.","Curt Espeland","Yes, sure. So we do have a great track record of managing our free cash flow. What you\u2019ve seen already, we\u2019ve generated $525 million of free cash flow through nine months. That\u2019s $40 million higher than last year. If you look at fourth quarter last year, we generated $600 million of free cash flow and just in that quarter. Now that did include that $65 million insurance receivable I had mentioned. So it\u2019s kind of $535 million excluding that. So I think we\u2019re going to generate roughly that same amount of free cash flow in fourth quarter of this year, despite the lower cash earnings and that\u2019s primarily as what you had mentioned, we expect higher working capital release, then the $365 million we did last year given the current environment as well as various working capital initiatives we\u2019ve been implementing throughout the year. And then as you are to see, we\u2019re also expecting lower capital expenditures of roughly $10 million to $20 million that helped us achieve this kind of result in this tough environment.","Operator","Next we will hear from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Hi. Could you flush out the year-end de-stocking or extended shutdowns comments that you\u2019ve made through the call from a different angle, which is if you look at it more as a cumulative effect spread between Q4 and Q1, what degree of impact are you concerned about? And is it just any auto and industrial customers, or are you concerned about a broader kind of de-stock cycle?","Mark Costa","So the de-stocking concerns that we have in the fourth quarter are more about normal seasonality then some sort of dramatic de-stocking event. I mean, clearly we\u2019ve seen significant de-stocking in the first half of this year that goes way beyond where primary demand was at that point, as people are pulling their inventories down, trying to access lower cost raw materials that were available and adjust to an uncertain environment and \u2013 but the rate of de-stocking, the amount of it has decreased significantly as you look through the year, even in the third quarter, I would say it was less than the first half, and fourth quarter will have some of that, but not to the degree that we saw in the first half of this year.","Curt Espeland","And if I could add a Laurence the area that I\u2019m hearing from our businesses, these are just our customers trying to work to their inventory targets to finish this year and then you get back to that more normal production levels next year. So this is more about a fourth quarter rather than something carrying into the first quarter of next year.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","And next we will hear from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.","Mike Sison","Hey guys. Just one quick question, if you think about your guidance for 2019 down about \u201820, if you get a similar volume mix improvement in 2020, is that kind of the leverage upside meaning you would get $1 \u2013 $1.20 in earnings per share or is it a little bit \u2013 maybe potentially higher because you\u2019ve taken some cost out and improved the productivity of the portfolio?","Curt Espeland","Well, Mike, welcome back, and we could pace it down with different models and get excited about different scenarios. But yes, if there is a bounce back and restock event we could see a material improvement in EPS next year, that\u2019s what Mark talked about. But it\u2019s really just different scenarios that could play out next year. And it\u2019s just really too early to call.","Mark Costa","But I think you can be substantial Mike and we believe that will happen when you get a sort of a settlement of the trade war.","Greg Riddle","Let\u2019s make the next question the last one, please.","Operator","Certainly. And your final question will come from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Good morning, guys. A number of your coatings customers have already gone and there is some cross currents there where they\u2019ve talked about raw materials moderating and some numbers on demand have been a little bit stronger, a little bit weaker. Can you walk through your coatings raw material portfolio? What do you think the market is doing that you\u2019re selling into, and then how are your products faring in that market?","Mark Costa","Yes. So Duffy, I think our coatings volume situation reflects our downstream customers when we look at just that part of AFP. So I don\u2019t see any sort of \u2013 on an overall volume point of view, any real differences than what you\u2019re hearing from them. The only thing that would be the exception is we did have some very high value additives that go into some automotive coatings into China to predominantly to local OEMs for their cars and that part of the market really is off dramatically. It\u2019s probably down 25% year-over-year and so that\u2019s been a pretty big sort of mix hit in the overall coating story. But besides that sort of one part of the story everything else is pretty similar and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not at all worried about. It\u2019s a proprietary product. Only, we make and I\u2019m pretty confident Chinese will make cars again and all the EVs that they\u2019re expected to produce will be largely made by these local OEMs with these paint lines and be a real benefit for us. It\u2019s just a short-term issue.","Duffy Fischer","Okay, great. And then one for Curt lastly, can you explain to me why pension is a benefit next year, with interest rates dropping so much more this year than we would have expected. One might have thought that actually the discount rate hurts the gap and so that pension costs would start to move up and maybe more cash flow would have to be put into pensions. But can you just walk through that for me?","Curt Espeland","Sure. There is two dynamics there. First is the discount rate and you just need to think about, because we mark-to-market our pension liability that pension liability gets readjusted at end of this year based on that new discount rate and then that discount rate is the determination of your interest cost. So with a lower interest \u2013 with a lower discount rate you have lower interest expense on your pension liability next year. And then secondly, last year we had a dramatic decline in our pension assets, because of the fourth quarter performance in our overall market. The assets obviously are performing much better this year. So if you start the year with a better \u2013 total amount of pension assets, then you also get assuming the return on those assets. That\u2019s another contributor that would help our pension expense on a year-over-year basis. So what I\u2019m talking about pension cost could return to more normal levels like they were in \u201818 versus the headwind we faced in \u201819.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you.","Greg Riddle","Okay. Thanks again everyone for joining us. A replay of this call will be available on our website later today. And I hope you have a great day. Thanks.","Operator","Once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7950":["Eastman Chemical Co.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Eastman Chemical Company's Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman website at www.eastman.com.","We'll now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Okay. Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Louis Reavis, Manager-Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's second quarter 2016 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for first quarter 2016 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for second quarter 2016.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core costs, charges, and gains. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded items, are available in the second quarter 2016 financial results news release that could be found on our website, www.eastman.com, in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings also exclude any non-core, unusual or non-recurring items.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide three. I'll begin my comments with strategic highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2016. We continued to make solid progress in executing our strategy of becoming a more specialty chemical company. During the quarter, we continued to upgrade the quality of our product mix by growing high-margin specialty product lines particularly in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products. In the first half, AM delivered 14% growth over last year on top of 40% growth in 2015 over 2014 and we did it primarily through organic volume and mix and a highly attractive bolt-on acquisition.","As growing innovative, high-value products is a key component of our strategy, I met with several customers in Europe recently to see how our innovations and strategies are proceeding in action and how we're helping our customers win through innovation.","In Germany, I met with a leading manufacturer of medical devices for the operating theater. They've been in search of a polymer that can withstand the new, stronger disinfectants being used in hospitals, which is causing cracking with existing polymers. The company gets a lot of polymers, all of which failed to deliver the needed chemical resistance. However, Tritan delivered on the challenge by providing the required blend of chemical resistance and durability. This has positioned Tritan as the material of choice in both clear and opaque applications. Next stop for Tritan are applications in safety and protection devices.","Also in Nienburg, Germany, we successfully started up our new Crystex technology. This improves our cost position by better than 20% while also creating the opportunity for more differentiated products like in Crystex. This new technology pushes the boundaries of thermal stability, dispersion and flow, all important properties of insoluble sulfur, which can help our customers maximize the productivity of their operations. With the conversion, we are rolling out several new Crystex products with differentiated cost and\/or performance and we are working with several customers to get our products to market. Early indications of performance are very positive and we anticipate having business before the end of the year.","The success in Nienburg supports our investment in Kuantan, Malaysia, where we're continuing to deploy this technology and build the largest and lowest cost facility in the world. And this is just great evidence of us creating value through innovation not only in heritage Eastman but in our acquisitions here, as well as what you've already seen us delivering in interlayers and Performance Films.","Finally, we recently launched Aerafin. It's a family of new adhesive polymers for hygiene and packaging markets leveraging Eastman's olefin technology platform, which expands our offering beyond adhesive resins to adhesive polymers. The need in this market at the consumer level is for low-odor adhesives and Aerafin is recognized as best-in-class on that front. In addition to low odor, Aerafin provides a more robust offering environment enabling higher line speeds at lower temperatures.","I'm incredibly excited and very proud of how we are driving innovation and customer engagement. As I spend a lot of time out in the market place, it's great to see the evidence of these wins, which gives me great confidence we're on the right track to drive growth through innovation.","While we're seeing growth in innovative specialty products, we're also facing increasing macro challenges particularly in Chemical Intermediates. We're pulling all levers to mitigate the impact of these challenges. On the cost management front, we remain well on track with our cost reduction efforts to deliver $100 million to the bottom line without sacrificing our long-term growth initiatives and we are making progress with the process we restarted earlier this year to divest our merchant ethylene as well as potentially other commodity olefin product lines.","Our cash engine continues to generate very impressive free cash flow as we are on track to deliver another great year of $900 million enabling a strong dividend, deleveraging and accelerating our share repurchases.","Our second quarter earnings overall are disappointing. We continue to deliver compelling results in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products and I'm confident as we get the challenges for Chemical Intermediates behind us and we stabilize Fibers, Eastman will emerge stronger than ever.","Now, I'll turn it over to Curt to discuss the Corporate and segment results.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I know it's been a busy week so I appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll start with our Corporate results on slide five. Overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices particularly in Chemical Intermediates. Volume was down slightly with a decline in Fibers, mostly offset by an increase in Advanced Materials.","Our operating earnings decreased primarily due to declines in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers. Despite the challenges, our operating margin was above 16% and adjusted earnings per share was $1.68 for the quarter.","By no means are we satisfied with the business environment we find ourselves in and the negative impact it is having on our results. Thus, we are taking additional actions to mitigate the challenges we face. And Mark will outline these actions in a few minutes.","Moving next to the segment results, starting with Advanced Materials on slide six, which delivered a great first half of the year. Second quarter sales revenue was relatively unchanged as higher sales volume of premium products including Saflex acoustic interlayers and Tritan copolyester was offset by lower selling prices, primarily for copolyesters, attributed to lower raw material cost such as paraxylene.","One other point on second quarter volumes. Advanced Materials experienced some destocking in the first quarter of 2015 followed by a restocking in the second quarter of 2015. So, we are very pleased with these results for our second quarter of 2016, especially given the tough comp.","Year-over-year operating earnings were relatively unchanged. Sequentially, operating earnings increased by $24 million or more than 20%, driven by a seasonal increase in sales volume including another quarterly volume record for Tritan copolyester.","And for the first half, operating earnings increased year-over-year by 14% or $30 million, driven by a 5% increase in sales volume, improved product mix, and lower unit cost due to higher capacity utilization. As a result, first half of 2016 operating margins increased to 19.4%, an approximately 200 basis-point improvement over the first half of 2015.","For the back half of the year, underlying business performance should remain strong as Advanced Materials continue to execute its strategy of volume growth, mix improvement, and fixed cost leverage. To underscore how well this business is executing the strategy, in 2015, Advanced Materials increased earnings by almost 40% and we expect to build on that success this year.","Given the results of the first half of 2016 and our strong outlook for the second half, Advanced Materials is positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016. We are delivering compelling proof of our ability to drive growth through innovation even in a difficult macro environment.","Now, to Additives & Functional Products on slide seven. Overall, a solid quarter despite short-term challenges, revenue declined due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material costs; 2% volume growth from many attractive end markets, including strong growth for Crystex, for our tire resins, and for animal nutrition products was offset by volume and mix declines in product lines exposed to energy and industrial construction markets. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs. And the operating margin remains solid at 21.8%, slightly above the year-ago period.","As I look at full year of 2016, we expect to grow volumes and expect our prices to stabilize. Our commercial teams are doing a great job in managing trade-offs and maintaining margins and customer engagement for innovation and growth. We will continue to face macroeconomic and competitive challenges, but given the strength of the portfolio businesses in this segment and attractive end markets, Additives & Functional Products remains on track with our previous expectations for full year earnings to be slightly down, which would be a solid result in the current business climate.","Now to Fibers, on slide eight. Second quarter revenue, volume and earnings were slightly below our expectations. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, particularly for acetate tow, flake and yarn combined with lower selling prices particularly for tow. The decline in acetate tow sales volume was due to customer inventory destocking in China, consistent with our expectations for volumes to be down to about 10% for the year. The lower acetate flake sales volume was due to timing of shipments to our China acetate tow joint venture. Lower yarn volume was due to trade issues impacting our customers.","Earnings for the second quarter decreased due to lower sales volume. Despite the decline in volume, operating margins were about 31% as our cost reduction efforts offset the decline in prices.","Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect second half earnings to be similar to first half, which is slightly below our previous expectations as we are experiencing some short-term challenges in acetate flake and yarn, which is an incremental headwind.","And I'll add that as we discussed for some time now, in the last earnings call and at investor conferences, price risk exists going into 2017. Given the current lower capacity utilization in acetate tow and the lack of additional asset rationalizations beyond what we did in the United Kingdom, the risk of competitors chasing share with price does exist, and we have seen our competitors attempt a strategy which has created pricing pressure in our contract discussions for next year. Frankly, I don't understand the logic of these actions in a flat to declining growth business but yet, here we are.","What I do understand, and what I like about Eastman and our future in this industry, is we have the lowest cost position, from the larger scale of backward integration with the flake matched with our tow position in Tennessee, Korea, and China. And our customers place significant strategic value on both our asset footprint and our ability to innovate and deliver high-quality, reliable product.","Further, our vertical and horizontal integration creates tremendous value and an innovation capability for cellulosic products in Additives & Functional Products and Advanced Materials, and we have a track record of innovation from this technology platform that is well established over decades. So I am confident about our long-term position, and I strongly believe this will continue to be a valuable business for Eastman going forward.","I'll finish up the segment review of Chemical Intermediates on slide nine. Sales revenue decreased due to lower selling prices, which were mostly the result of negative impact of lower market prices for propylene, ethylene, and methanol, and continued competitive pressure from weak demand in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings decreased due to lower selling prices, more than offset lower raw material costs, in addition to higher planned maintenance costs.","Looking at the full year of 2016, we expect a number of factors to impact results. We expect olefin margins to remain under pressure, as the increase in oil prices has not yet translated to improving olefin prices. In particular, bulk ethylene prices have been disappointing, as we have seen U.S. prices remain significantly discounted versus the rest of the world.","We also expect lower methanol prices to continue, putting pressure on market prices for some of our acetyl and amines product lines. And competitive pressures, particularly from competitors in Asia, have intensified, and we expect this will continue through the back half of the year. Considering the low oil environment, excess global capacity in olefins and methanol, and increased competitive pressures due to slow economic growth, we expect second half-year earnings to be below first half, with sequential improvement for both third and fourth quarters, which should continue into next year.","Lastly, I'll give you a quick update on our process for divesting our merchant ethylene capacity, and potentially certain commodity olefin product lines. We continue our discussions with potential buyers and still expect this process will take the greater part of this year to resolve itself. As you would expect, we will remain disciplined and patient sellers as we move through the process.","On slide 10, I'll transition to an overview of our cash flow and other financial highlights for second quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of generating cash, with second quarter operating cash flow of approximately $500 million. We had nominal income tax payments and no contributions to our U.S. pension plans in the quarter. These payments are typically in the second half of the year, and we expect that will be the case in 2016.","Capital expenditures totaled $124 million. We continue to manage the pace of capital spending with the current economic environment while still maintaining our growth investments, and thus have reduced our full-year capital expenditures to be between $600 million and $625 million.","Free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $370 million. And during the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $300 million, paid our second quarter dividend of $68 million, and repurchased $25 million of our shares.","Also during the quarter, we successfully sold \u20ac500 million 1.5% notes due 2023 in a European public debt market, with proceeds used to repay $500 million of our 2.4% notes due in June of 2017, as well as some other borrowings.","Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was just over 21%, aided by an expected discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate will be between 24% and 25%, reflecting the continued benefits of our improvement in business operations.","And lastly, we remain on track to generate more than $900 million of free cash flow for the year, which is a very strong performance in this current environment.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Curt. I'll transition to our outlook on slide 11. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly, improving product mix, and accelerating our overall earnings growth. We continue to see the benefits of our vertical and horizontal integration as it enables an advantaged cost position and delivers a capital-efficient earnings growth in our specialties. We will also get a (17:12) benefit from the acquisitions, which are creating value in both cost synergies and accelerating revenue growth. We remain committed to our aggressive cost reduction targets, and are on track with them. And after reducing debt, we also expect to accelerate share repurchases in the back half of the year.","In the near term, we have a number of challenges, particularly impacting Chemical Intermediates, and these have been increasing. As Curt mentioned, lower olefin margins and lower methanol prices are headwinds. In particular, the most significant change in our expectation was U.S. ethylene prices not tracking up with oil and global ethylene prices.","We're also seeing excess supply pressure, as slow economic growth is not sufficient to absorb the large amount of capacity that's been built in a number of products, especially in China, for Chemical Intermediates.","Our most recent outlook was that 2016 adjusted EPS would be down about 5%. Given the challenges we face, most significantly in Chemical Intermediates and modestly in Fibers, we expect full year 2016 EPS will be down up to 10% compared with 2015.","As you think about the cadence through the rest of the year, we expect earnings in the third quarter will be similar to the second quarter, as sequential growth in operating earnings is offset by an increase in the tax rate for the quarter.","Last, I'll add that this outlook assumes current business conditions continue in the back half of the year. If the conditions improve, that would be upside.","Turning next to slide 12. Obviously, our EPS expectations for this year are not where we want them to be, and we're not happy about that. Given that, we are taking significant action to mitigate the impact of the challenges we see in front of us. We are using all levers to improve results, not just in 2016 but going forward. For me, that begins by maintaining our commitment to innovation and market development and doing everything we can to accelerate growth from these platforms.","We've already realized commercial success for many of these platforms this year and we are on the cusp of even bigger wins, and we're working to deliver these successes as fast as possible. We also remain committed to cost reduction. As I mentioned, we're on target with the cost reductions we implemented earlier this year. And, as the challenges we face have increased, we will be removing at least another $100 million of cost towards the end of this year to ensure that we deliver attractive earnings growth next year.","While our SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales is already in the lowest quartile of our peers, we are committed to retaining this new cost reduction target without sacrificing innovation and market development.","We continue to review our portfolio, and this includes the process to divest our merchant ethylene capacity and some other product lines and we'll effectively manage capital allocations through this slow growth environment. This includes our strong dividend, which we'll increase; reducing debt, and increasing our share repurchases in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.","As I look beyond 2016, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we will continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio. With the combined set of actions we're taking, we expect to be back on track for 8% to 12% EPS growth in 2017.","I'll close with our key themes for 2016 on slide 13. We continue to have a strong portfolio of specialty businesses and through these businesses, we are driving growth, we are innovating and we are improving our earnings mix. We face increasing challenges particularly in Chemical Intermediates and Fibers and responding to this challenging environment with the actions I just outlined.","Our cash flow remains one of the best in our industry, and we are deploying it for a strong dividend, reducing leverage and accelerating repurchases of shares.","And lastly, despite near-term temporary challenges, I remain very confident in our strategy and our ability to grow our earnings. Eastman will emerge from these challenges stronger than ever and we'll continue our journey to achieving our vision of becoming a leading specialty company.","With that, I'll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Okay. Thanks, Mark. And we have a lot of people on the line this morning and we'd like to get to as many questions as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that Ron, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, indeed. [Operator Instruction] And we'll take our first question from Mr. Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Mark, obviously, a large part of the reduction in 2016 outlook is related to Chemical Intermediates. And obviously, you're in the process of trying to monetize some of the crackers as well as other parts of that portfolio. Given the fact that you were hitting a rougher patch than expected earlier in the year in the Chem Intermediates business, how is this impacting your outlook on when and what value you can execute a transaction?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Frank, I'm going to start and let Curt finish. We're obviously pushing as hard as we can in this process. It's a pretty dynamic time with what's going on with a lot of very temporary challenges in olefins, especially ethylene, as part of the package what we're divesting. You've got a lot of stranded ethylene in the market today in the U.S. When you look at it, ethylene prices here, almost $0.20 a pound lower than the globe. So, it's pretty disconnected.","So, we have to make sure that we think about the long-term value of this business and get an appropriate price. We do have engaged buyers who are very seriously considering it but we're working through the steps of it.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, if I could add, again, as we mentioned there have a number of management presentations that have occurred, and there again are active conversations going on. But as you already mentioned, Frank, we recognize it's currently tough economic environment or environment with ethylene margins right now. So, really in order for this to really progress, our belief, it really requires two strategic parties, buyers or sellers that understand the long-term value of olefins and the value of the quality of assets that we have. So, my sense is everyone is kind of looking at that way but we'll see how it plays out.","In regards to timing it's still a top priority for us. We've got a great team working on it but we'll just have to be disciplined as we go through the process and it will still take a greater part of this year to see how this plays out.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Terrific. And in terms of the outlook approaching or could be down 10%, what sort of olefin margin are you embedding in that forecast, i.e., are you assuming second quarter levels or are you assuming June levels? Are you assuming July levels? I just want to try and get a baseline there as to what is embedded in that outlook.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Frank, you just summarized the problem of forecasting olefins. You pick a week and you can have a different answer. There's a lot of volatility going on right now. As I mentioned, on the olefin side, we're seeing \u2013 especially ethylene but as well as propylene being fairly depressed in the U.S. relative to what's going on outside the U.S. So, even though oils improved, we haven't really seen a logical improvement of those olefin prices.","And that's been a disappointment in the second quarter and we certainly revised our outlook for the rest of the year to reflect the current conditions that have been in the sort of June, early July timeframe when we built our forecast.","I would also note that while the olefin prices haven't gone up much, the propane prices and ethane prices have, especially propane. So, they have tracked up with oil with the significant improvement in global export capacity to get the propane out of the country. So that's created some compression here that on a long-term basis, I don't think it plays out. I don't think you have ethylene and propylene stranded in the U.S. forever. There is, obviously, not enough derivative capacity to monetize that monomer in the globe, but that will come online like many people have already discussed. And this disconnect will get closed and we will go back to what it a normal situation where these prices are more closely connected to the globe. And then that would be a material recovery in earnings for us when that happens in the future.","So, I think that's, all playing out sort of as we expect. And that's sort of the olefin story. I would note that there's two other parts of the story when it comes to Chemical Intermediates. Methanol prices are 40% lower than they were a year ago. It's the same kind of story, not only have they tracked down with oil, but there's oversupply in methanol. And so, we haven't seen methanol prices recover really in the second quarter as you would have expected with the recovery in oil and that's also putting pressure on the earnings in the segment.","When you think about acetic acid, acetic anhydride, competitors in Asia set the price ultimately based on their purchased methanol cost and that's put a lot of price pressure on those products. Not as significant as olefin for us, but it's still quite material and it's even having a modest impact on Functional means where we have a lot of cost pass-through contracts tied to methanol prices. And in both acetyls and methanol, we have advantaged coal gasification, as well as disadvantaged fixed price methanol contract, and so you get some compression there. And then there is some additional pressure, of course, with Asian competitors with excess supply. No demand in China to absorb it, so they're dumping those products all over the world.","I would say though Frank that the good news about this is that we're seeing the prices stabilize and we're seeing evidence of this in a couple of different fronts. One, we just filed an anti-dumping case in plasticizers where we're seeing some pretty extreme behavior from our Korean-based competitors and the Commerce Department has already agreed that we have made the case for economic harm and have launched an investigation into that. And we're also seeing some other products some of our competitors in China shut down because they're out of the money at the current pricing that they're sort of driving in the marketplace.","So, I would say we think it's bottoming and we just need to start seeing some of the situation to improve, and that's all embedded in our guidance. But, right now, our guidance for the rest of the year is it stays challenging like it is now for this year.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Mark, on acetate tow, your other main competitors, we talked about similar aggressive pricing actions in the industry and competitors chasing volume. If it's not you and it's not them, it's obvious Solvay and maybe DYCELL. How are number three and four players causing so much problem in this industry?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dave, I guess this question might come up and, obviously, there's been a lot of commentary in the industry already with investors about what's going on in the space. And so, I've spent a lot of time trying to put my thoughts together, and I think there's a number of things that are important to be clear about, both in the market context and what our strategy is.","So, let's start with demand. First of all, nothing's changed in our view about tow demand for this year and moving forward. Outside of China, continues declining, 1% to 2%. We still believe that the primary issue in China this year is inventory destocking of tow where they had way too much inventory in tow and we think that will run its course this year.","There remains some uncertainty about what that will turn into next year because while I think tow destocking will be over, we still don't have clear understanding of what's going on in cigarette demand in China. And so, there's chance of some continued destocking there. But when you put it all together, our view is tow imports into China next year will be sort of flat to potentially modestly up.","Regarding our specific performance versus our competitors, as you can see through the first half of this year in the data, we are obviously taking a bit more of a hit in volume than our competitors, and we've been clear about that because for 10 years we've been a huge beneficiary of having the largest share of imports in China while China was growing. And there's always two sides to those positions and when imports drop, we're going to feel more of that than anyone else.","But when we look through all that, we still see that we're on track for a 10% decline in tow demand, nothing has changed our view about that at all. But you got to remember that there's some chunkiness in the buying patterns with all different customers to some degree. And so, there's some chunkiness in buying patterns that will \u2013 so, for our second quarter, are probably a little bit light compared to what we expected, but nothing material.","It's also important to remember in our volume numbers that while we're seeing 10% down in tow, there's other things going on like the timing issue in flake, some yarn being off and no longer having acetyl chemical sales to ourselves and the JV we have with Solvay for making flake.","But we are seeing some aggressive actions by all of our competitors going after share. And we mentioned a long time ago, when you get a huge currency change like you do in Japan and Europe, you can think about passing that on the marketplace to chase share and not even feel the margin impact. And we've seen \u2013 as you can see through the data that everyone's reporting that we have some dynamics going on there. And the part of the story for us is some modest share loss this year outside of China but, it's pretty modest at this point. But it's disappointing to see this happen. We've been talking about the fact that its excess capacity remains in the industry. It's entirely possible that we're going to have people behave in a way where they try and chase the share with price with these margins it's really tempting as you're just living for the short-term and we're seeing some of that.","But, in this context, I think, we've had a very clear strategy of what we're trying to do. And, I just want to sort of make sure we're clear about what we're doing. First, we recognize and accept the challenges that we have in China. And so when we added capacity with CNTC, which was very low cost tow capacity, we chose to take out an equal amount of capacity in United Kingdom that was relatively high cost for us, balancing our position there, and accepting those changes in market conditions.","We also exited our flake JV with Solvay to reduce our cost, given we no longer need that capacity, given we had shutdown the UK tow situation. So, we've done everything we can to sort of balance our capacity situation and the results of what's going on in China. And we're now down to being the lowest cost supplier in the world in tow. We have the largest scale asset in flake, it's backward integrated in coal and we have the lowest cost tow assets in Tennessee, Korea, and China that's equally matched to that flake capacity. And we have no further tow assets that we can shut down or it would just leave us long in flake, which doesn't make much sense for us.","Second, we simply have the best cost position in the industry. We have every intention of maintaining our market share outside of China. So, when these competitors are trying to gain share from us, which obviously they have done, it simply results in lower prices, and therefore lower earnings and cash flow for everyone.","Third, we're committed to being the leading supplier to our customers, based on the strength we have and our quality and our reliability, our unique innovation capabilities, and the strength of our asset base to supply our customers.","So as you look at 2016, we do expect earnings are going to be down due to this price pressure as these contract discussions have now started early, and we're seeing this behavior from our competitors. And it's likely we'll be down 10% to 20% before you include the cost actions we just announced. But it's early, and so we're going to have to see how all these contract discussions play out for the rest of the year and how it nets out. Then we'll keep you updated.","When I look beyond 2017, and this is quite important, many of these new contracts are going to be multi-year contracts, providing price and supply stability for our customers. You would also think that, given how this is all playing out and not really working out very well for anyone, that our competitors are going to have to start looking at their cost positions, like we did, and think about rationalizing high-cost assets that they all certainly have, and we'll just have to see what they choose to do.","I would also note that we're not just sitting around waiting for what's going to happen to tow business. Eastman has been the innovator for 90 years in cellulosics. We've innovated a huge range of new products over the years, and you've seen those great results we've had in AFP and AM. And so as we saw these things start to develop all the way back in 2014, and we knew that we had to accelerate our innovation efforts for new applications in cellulosics, and we've been doing that as ways to load these assets in new applications.","It's obviously still early when it comes to growth and innovation, but I've been incredibly impressed by our teams and how they've raised to that challenge, and we have a number of great projects going forward here, developing new applications that will help in the long term.","So when I look at the Fibers challenges that we have, and included, I'm still confident we can do 8% to 12% earnings growth next year. When I consider the company-wide cost actions we're going to take, as well as doing everything we can to reduce cost in Fibers directly, and the growth that I expect in the other three segments relative to this year, as well as our ability to deploy free cash flow.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very helpful, Mark. Just one more quick question for you and Curt on the buybacks. What's the trigger to accelerate the buybacks in the back half of the year heading into 2017?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if you look at the timing of the buybacks plan, also we have good visibility to our free cash flow. We know our free cash flow will be a little stronger second half of the year than the first half. And so, we also then will know we're on track to be able to complete the deleveraging, the total $500 million this year. And so, we are accelerating our share repurchases, and that acceleration is occurring as we speak.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Vince, are you there?","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Ron, go ahead and move on to the next, please.","Operator","Okay. You know what, I apologize. He is still in the conference. Go ahead, Mr. Andrews. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello? Hello? Hello?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi there. There you are.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry about that. Sorry. It's Friday. In Chemical Intermediates, you referenced a few products that (37:00) oversupply and sort of exacerbating the pricing issue with the energy cost. I'm just curious, when you look at those supply and demand balances, as we get into 2017 and into 2018, is there incremental capacity coming in those products, or are we going to see the worst of that S&D balance this year and as demand grows over the next couple of years, things should tighten up a bit. How is that going to play out?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great question. From what we see right now, we think the price pressure is upon us, based on those capacities. I don't think we see any increase in those pressures in any significant way. There is incremental capacity being brought on always in these kind of products. But unfortunately, the prices are now down to what I think is cash cost for the different relevant Asian players that we face. So, we've sort of reached the bottom, as long as oil stays in the sort of $40 range. Obviously, if oil drops into the $20s, you're going to see additional pressure.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And if oil goes up, we'll get benefits as well.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If oil goes up, as many expect, that would be a tailwind for us next year.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just in general, in terms of where your pricing is now relative to the raws, it was something you brought up at 4Q, and obviously it's been playing out through the year. Do you think the pricing conversations that you've had with customers in terms of where spreads have gone, I mean, do you think things are relatively balanced now, as we head into the second half?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think so. And from what we can see, pricing has stabilized, and that's our view right now, in the back half of the year. The big question is going to be, how do all the moving parts on olefins change? They're bouncing around a lot, even in July. You've seen propane cost be anywhere from $0.52 to $0.43, depending on the day. So, there's just a lot of volatility there. But, right now, as Frank asked earlier, we're assuming conditions stay pretty challenging like they were in the second quarter, and continue that way for the rest of the year.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If it gets better, we'll do better. But it's really hard to predict right now.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. In your Advanced Materials, you averaged about 5.5% volume growth in the first half. Is this about the level that we can expect in the second half? And also, what is sort of organic growth going forward in the segment?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Advanced Materials is just a phenomenal success story for us last year and this year. And what I love about it is what you just highlighted. It's a volume and mix-driven story. It's not some temporary expansion on price relative to raws. So we feel great about how we're building on last year's tremendous growth this year. And we do expect volume growth to continue in a similar level in the second half of this year, and we'd expect unit volume growth to continue into next year. But it's really important to highlight, it's not about the absolute volume growth, it's all about the mix.","So, while we're having double-digit growth in really high margin, great innovative products like acoustic interlayers, heads-up display, Tritan, our whole Performance Films business, our core copolyester are growing slower than the average that have lower margins. And so, you're really getting a great mix improvement in every quarter on top of just good overall solid volume growth.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And if I could add, the margins you're seeing from the businesses are the kind of margins you would expect given the investments being made with this business.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. And maybe back to Fibers. How far down this road of price cuts is the industry for committing 2017 contracts? Is there still time, do you think, to sort of \u2013 for the industry to pull up and be more rational? Or I guess, in other words, has there been significant volume committed at lower prices for 2017?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say where we are \u2013 the customers were quite smart in sensing that the industry had excess capacity. It's been a great industry for 10 years of consistent earnings growth for us and incremental improvements in margins. Over the last five years, we've been increasing price. And with the excess capacity, I think customers are smart and they sense an opportunity and they started contract discussions early to see what kind of price improvements they could get. And some people responded and we're defending.","And so, I think that that's \u2013 that horse has left the barn as far as 2017 goes. We're going to see prices come down at our large customers. But I do think that positive side of the story is they also put a high value on stability and security supply and are looking for long-term commitments in contracts with suppliers that are committed to being in the industry for the long-term. And we stand out as the most committed given our integration and scale so that I think it will work well for us as we try to maintain our market share position. And so, these long-term contracts, if this is the way it continues to play out will also provide needed stability for our customers on price and supply. And, of course, it also helps us provide stability to us, too.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. In the tow business, do you see any opportunities for strategic combinations or joint ventures or would antitrust issues preclude anything like that as being a possibility?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think we've looked at it for ourselves of course and given we're the largest merchant supplier in the industry it's unlikely we could do anything. I think in a flat to declining industry, you can make a case for consolidation and get it approved when a couple of other competitors want to come together. In theory, any combination of the other three competitors is possible, based on our look at it, but it would obviously be a comprehensive process with the antitrust agencies to make sure that there'll be no harm to customers, but I think it's possible. Whether or not it happens is, obviously, out of our control and we'll have to see what our competitors choose to do.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And could you comment on how your propane hedges roll off next year? And how you see propane supply\/demand? And just generally, how do you see propane factoring into your earnings for 2017?","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I'll answer the hedge first. On the hedge, nothing has dramatically changed and our outlook of the impact of the hedge is net of the currency. We said that impacts around $0.60 a share and we think about half of that will still roll off next year. But we'll have to see how propane moves around a little bit. But generally speaking, we still expect that benefit next year.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd note that that hedges and that comment, so that's both propane headwind being rolled off as well as the currency hedge benefits coming off. On the outlook for propane and propylene, I guess, what really matters is the cracking spread relative to propylene and ethylene. Our view is the market is already reconnecting propane to global values with all the export capacity that's readily available in the U.S. So, I think you're seeing that now with our propane prices improve through the second quarter and even as oil has come off recently, you've seen propane prices follow it down.","So, it just depends on your view on oil and you can get a view of what you think propane is going to do next year. The bigger question is, what I already discussed which is, what our ethylene and propane prices can do to you especially ethylene as they've been stranded and disconnected. I mean, it's really significant when you think about ethylene in Asia in the mid-$0.40 range, and we're in the mid-to-high $0.20 range in ethylene x 700 million pounds of ethylene that we sell. It's just that product line. You do the math and whatever you think that delta should be and you can get to some very large earning numbers that it's been a headwind for us relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Mark, when you think about your portfolio, I think you've done a nice job moving it in the right direction, but you still have about a-third of it circling quite a bit here. Does it make sense to look at more acquisitions? And what percent of your portfolio do you think you need to be able to offset these headwinds over time? I mean, is it more like an 80%, 90% of your portfolio of specialty or what do you think you need to do to get more stable?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike. Certainly, we're committed to driving our portfolio towards specialty as hard as we possibly can, and you do that through multiple things. We've done, I think, some excellent acquisitions, large ones like Solutia and Taminco and some bolt-ons as well. And we paid reasonable prices for them and are going to get attractive ROICs relative to weighted average cost of capital.","And, frankly, those acquisitions were intentional. We always knew we had challenges in Fibers and olefins at some point in the future. We intentionally chose not to build crackers and PDH unit because we were convinced five years ago that that industry would overbuild. And we're intentionally diversifying our portfolio with the strength of the cash that we had at the time in olefins and fibers, into a more attractive long-term market where we can innovate.","So, I think that part of the strategy is great and on track. And of course, we've always been a disciplined seller of underperforming businesses. We've sold off $300 billion of revenue from PET, the polyolefins, et cetera, in the past and we're trying to get rid more of it now in this current process, on the bulk ethylene and some other products. So, we're doing everything in our control.","Unfortunately, I've said this before, we're out of the M&A market, as a tool to sort of further diversify our portfolio at this moment in time. I think the valuations are way too high in the market that are being paid right now, 15 times anything. It seems, it's hard to get an ROIC at an acceptable level. And we still are old-fashioned that way. We still believe in an unlevered return on capital even if that is close to free. And so, we don't think that's value-creating for our shareholders, so we're not going to do that.","What we are going to do is focus on innovation and driving innovative growth across our portfolio. We've been doing it for a long time here at Eastman, and we're showing you excellent proof points about how we're doing it in the acquisitions from interlayers to Crystex, Performance Films, and we're starting to accelerate somewhat great opportunities in Taminco now that we've got under the hood there. So, we're going to do that. We're going to take out cost as much as we possibly can, but not cut our innovation programs, that's a core choice for us. And as Curt mentioned, we've got one of the best free cash flows in the industry and we'll be repurchasing shares as aggressively as we can, but also maintaining our credit rating.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then, Advanced Materials has been a bright spot this year. Operating income is up 14% in the first half. You mentioned that it should grow double digits in 2016. Will you have double-digit growth in the second half of 2016? And if so, what do you think will drive that?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think we're going to continue to have rate of growth through the rest of the year in its volume and mix. It's just a continuation of the story we've been delivering for a long time.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you remind me how much is your pension funding this year? And I would imagine your pension liabilities will grow given the interest rate environment that we're in. And so, do you have any sort of guesstimate for how your pension funding might change next year or in future years?","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Jeff, I'll answer those in reverse order, if you don't mind. First of all, we do anticipate lower discount rates. And so, if you just give a $0.01 for every 25 bps that the discount rate lowers in 2016 that's roughly a $50 million increase in our liability for our pensions. If you expand that globally about $90 million. And so, if you take current discount rates, there's probably about a 75 bps, 80 bps decline. So, you're looking at maybe a couple of hundred million increase in your pension liability. But it's only July so we'll see what the next five months hold.","As it relates to pension funding, we contributed about $100 million last year. I suspect it will be between $50 million to $75 million this year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Great. And then, for my follow-up, in the Additives & Functional area, can you remind me which product lines are growing in volume and which ones are shrinking?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Jeff. So, overall, the segment net had a 2% volume growth for the second quarter. And what we're seeing is very strong growth in tire additives, especially Crystex. Great recovery there and we're doing really well with our customers across the globe there. And then anti-dumping tariffs on tires are really helping us out as we have a stronger position outside of China and we're benefiting from that shift to the U.S.","Coatings are growing with the market consistent with our customers. And as you think about adhesives, it's also \u2013 has modest growth. All that success is being offset to some degree by decline in energy markets, which has been double-digit. We have some products that go downhaul into that space, and industrial construction, which is where fluid is going. And so, we're obviously seeing a pretty drop in the construction cycle in China when it comes to chemical plants and demand is off there.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. I had two questions. First, just want to connect two of the responses earlier. The comments around 8% to 10% growth next year, do you need the areas in your Intermediates business to stabilize for that to happen? Or you've seen enough lever and thought you can get to 8% even if the current pressures spill over into next year and the bottoming out process is pushed out?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're assuming that the world stays similar to the way it is today. So, oil stays in the 40s, economy continues to grow slowly and there is a modest improvement in oil prices next year relative to this year, but not anything material. And with those conditions, we believe Chemical Intermediates can grow earnings over this year. You have to remember that you got a net $0.30 of share tailwind of the hedge, when you back out currency that's $0.40 of propane hedges coming off and a $0.10 headwind in currency, net $0.30, and a lot of that, that tailwind flows in to Chemical Intermediates, 80% roughly. So, you've got that tailwind. And you've got what we think is a bottoming out situation right now in pricing and behavior by our competitors. And so, we're not assuming some dramatic recovery next year.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And if I could add, don't forget, we've also announced the additional cost actions because given the challenges of Fibers potentially being down 10% to 20% next year, we don't want to sit idle. And so, we're taking the additional cost actions plus, we expect good strong free cash flow next year and the ability to deploy that in a balanced way across debt and share repurchases.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And secondly, if and when energy markets recover, what do you see is the lag effect for your business to recover? And is your operating leverage in any way diminished by the cost-out actions you've taken?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The cost actions certainly don't diminish anything. We are very committed to innovation. The only way we actually deliver long-term growth, long-term margins for our shareholders is innovate. That's true, I think, of any company in this industry, if you don't innovate, your products get commoditized. That's just a fact of life. So, our cost reductions are not \u2013 we have a very bright line where we're not going to cross that. But we are going to push our cost reductions to the limit. And I'd also note, we are already at very low cost. And we already stretched our Functional scale capability tremendously with the large number of acquisitions we've done. So, we feel good about where we are, but you can always push for more, and that's what we're going to do.","When it comes to the overall market dynamics as we go into next year, I think we're set up well to grow our businesses through volume and mix in the specialties, and hold our margins. And I think, Chemical Intermediates, the situation, we hope is stabilizing, as long as oil doesn't take another big step down.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Good morning. Mark, you talked about C2 chain being weak. I have a question on C3 chain. Propylene prices were generally stable in second quarter, around $0.30. Are the propylene derivatives still falling, or have you seen some stabilization? Can you just talk generally about the C3 chain?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the C3 chain, I think we've talked about it to some degree already which is, propylene prices seem to have stabilized right now, but they're not improving as oil improved, as much as propane did. So you've seen some compression in that spread. And if you look at it year-over-year, obviously, there is tremendous compression in propylene to propane spread versus a year ago in the second quarter, as well as how we view the next couple of quarters.","But I think that over time, it will go back to a more normal relationship. Propylene is a little bit artificially depressed by all the excess supply of PDH out there. But end of the day, propylene price is going to get set out of Asia, particularly probably China, and it's going to either be PDH, methanol, or to olefins or NAFTA, all of them connected to oil. So, once we get enough derivative capacity out there to turn all this propylene into something, I think you start getting back to some more normal relationships of propylene to propane, with wherever oil turns out to be.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","You talked about your portfolio transformation. A lot of investors think the portfolio is a bit too complicated for them to understand. I know you're divesting ethylene. The longer this transformation takes, your multiple is getting impacted in the meantime. So, can you give us a sense of timing on what you're thinking about this transformation, and when do you think you can sort of feel like you've done it?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So, roughly, this year, two-thirds of earnings will come from AM and AFP, which is a dramatic change, if you look at who we are today versus five years ago. So, I think we've made huge progress on altering our portfolio and it was intentional, as I said. Obviously, we didn't expect the accelerated pressure in Fibers and Chemical Intermediates we're experiencing at the moment, So I thought I had a little more time to sort of grow the specialties relative to those two segments. But I do think we're doing everything we can, and we're cutting costs aggressively to offset the margin compression we're facing in Fibers and CI as much as we can. And I think oil will recover to some degree at some point, and that will give us a big tailwind relative to some of these businesses.","So I think \u2013 this is a really tough year for us, obviously. I'm not happy about it. We're doing everything we can, on every front, to make it as good as possible. But right now, we got to organically grow. We got to divest what we can and returning cash to shareholders. And I think that is going to be a compelling story, if you look at how we can perform in that context relative to this year going forward and relative to, I think, many of our peers. So, we're on the right track. We just got to keep driving it.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, fellows. Three questions on tow, if I could. First is, you talk about being low cost, which I think everybody would grant you. But bigger question is, how steep do you think the cost curve is, so you guys versus, say, the plant that sits at the 90th percentile of the cost curve, how big is that delta? Second question would be, how much has the low methanol prices changed the cost dynamic for your competitors, and therefore the dynamics in tow? And then the last one is, selling half of your JV back to Solvay, on the surface of it, giving a smaller competitor more capacity doesn't seem logical. So, could you walk through the logic of doing that deal?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll take the first two, Curt will take the last one. So, in regards to the shape of the curve, we are definitely the lowest cost player. And to answer your question, the curve has flattened out a bit, because \u2013 while we're based on coal, our competitors are based on natural gas and methanol that drives their cost structure. And certainly, those prices have come down. So, in this year, it's feeling a little bit sort of flattened out relative to the past.","As you look forward, coal's going to probably stay pretty low in the U.S., and natural gas prices are already moving up, and methanol prices will certainly move up with oil as well. So, I think the curve is actually going to steepen relative to us from this year going forward, is our view of sort of how that cost curve's changed and is going to go back to being steeper as we move forward.","I'm not going to get into details of the steepness of the curve. What I can tell you though is, there's plenty of high-cost assets out there that are discrete standalone assets. And if someone wanted to improve their earnings and their cost position to serve their customers, that's the choice that they have to work through.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the flake joint venture, as you know, we enjoyed the benefits of that flake joint venture for a number of years, a good partner, a good asset. But given our debottlenecking of our own low-cost flake assets and the shutdown of Workington, we're now balanced. So we didn't need that capacity off that joint venture. So, really, we agreed to sell our share to that joint venture.","I think it's a good outcome for both parties, because we'd be able to match our flake to our tow capacities around the world. It gives them a low-cost flake asset. I assume that gives them some options to think about, but you need to ask them about that.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Ron, let's make the next question the last one, please.","Operator","Perfect. And we'll take our last question from Mr. Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much. Guys, in the Chemical Intermediates, I mean, pretty jarring results to nearly make no money. I'm just curious if you look across that portfolio, it seems like there's several businesses that should be reasonably good. So, are there some reasonable loss makers in there at the moment?","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Bob, I think we've called that ethylene enough and obviously that one is pretty challenged in the current economic situation. It's also important to keep in mind that while we're certainly not happy about the hedge with low oil that the margins in this business will probably be double if you extract the hedge out of this segment.","So, it's certainly not good and we're not happy about it. But if you look at operating earnings before financing activity, it's quite a bit better. And we'll, by that reason, get better as the hedge rolls off over the next two years.","But, certainly, we're under pressure in bulk ethylene. That's the only sort of one that is sort of in a challenged situation. The others are just much lower margins than what we'd like it to be. And as I said, plasticizers, is an example of the place that's under a lot of pressure hence our antidumping case.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Bob, if I could...","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","(01:02:25).","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry, Bob, just to remind you. The second quarter results do include roughly $35 million of maintenance cost. So that's a little unusual for the second quarter trend. That's why you'll see sequential improvement in this Chemical Intermediates through the rest of the year.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I know you guys have a slightly different feedstock slate than, say, your average U.S. cracker which can cause some challenges. Is there anything unique about your contract structure either in ethylene or across your portfolio that would be different than sort of a typical company?","Curtis E. Espeland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, not really. I mean, again, we have \u2013 no unique, (01:02:58) we're just a buyer of propane in the marketplace, same with ethylene. We have a certain slate of product mix in the crackers. There's some flexibility but we have some limitations there. Longer term, if there's a party interested in our crackers, there's amount of capital you could deploy to make that more ethylene-based, and that's the kind of conversations we're having with the people interested in our excess ethylene position today.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Mark J. Costa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So. I'm just going to make one final comment and let Greg wrap-up. While we're certainly not happy with our performance in the second quarter and revising guidance down for this year, I think that we are extremely happy with our strategy and what we're trying to do. For a long time, we've known that we should be growing our specialties both innovative ways as well as acquisitions. We're doing that and it has improved the quality of our portfolio and the strength of this company dramatically from where we were five years ago and we're going to continue doing that.","We're also going to do everything we can to reduce cost, offset these short-term challenges, being responsible for delivering value for our shareholders both in short and the long term at the same time. And so, you're going to see us drive executions as hard as we can. You're going to see push results as hard as we can in this very tough environment. And we feel good about our way to fight our way through this and deliver growth next year.","Gregory A. Riddle - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Okay.

Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on Eastman's website, www.eastman.com.","We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay, thank you, Mara. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO; Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Morgan, Manager, Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I'll cover 4 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's third quarter 2012 financial results news release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for full year 2011 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2012.","Second, earnings per share and operating earnings referenced in this presentation exclude Solutia acquisition financing, transaction, integration and inventory costs and charges, as well as asset impairments and restructuring charges net. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the Solutia acquisition transaction, financing, integration and inventory costs and charges and the asset impairment restructuring charges net, are available in our third quarter financial results news release and the tables accompanying the release available in the Investors section of our website, eastman.com.","Third, this presentation includes sales revenue and operating earnings on a pro forma combined basis, assuming the acquisition of Solutia have been completed prior to third quarter 2011, that compares post-acquisition results to pre-acquisition pro forma combined results. For more information on pro forma combined results, see the Solutia acquisition section in our third quarter financial results news release.","Also, on October 15, we furnished to the SEC a Form 8-K with pro forma combined historical financial information for our new segments. In the said 8-K, you will find sales revenue, operating earnings and depreciation and amortization for 2009 through the first half of 2012 for our new segments.","And lastly, we have posted the slides that accompany our remarks this morning on our website in the presentation and events section.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Rogers","Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3.","As is my normal practice, I will start by holding us accountable for our key outlook statements. As you're aware, we were able to close the Solutia acquisition on July 2, meeting the midyear commitment we made to you back in January when the deal was announced. Let me reiterate how excited we are to have Solutia as part of the Eastman and how confident we are in the value this transaction will create both in the near and long term. We will go into greater detail during our upcoming Investor Day, highlighting why these businesses are so attractive and fit so well with our strategy. In his section, Curt will also give a brief update on how the integration is progressing as well as provide a summary of the transaction from the standpoint of the opening balance sheet.","Next, back in July, we indicated our expectation was for full year 2012 EPS to be approximately $5.30, and we slightly raised that expectation and I'll talk more about that in a moment. And lastly, we indicated we expected to generate $1 billion of free cash in 2012 and 2013 combined. Again, we are on track to deliver on this commitment.","While I don't want to give too much away out of the great story we will share with you on November 5, what I will say today is that, given all of the portfolio work we have done over the last several years, including the Solutia acquisition, we now have a portfolio of businesses that we expect to produce solid, consistent earnings growth and cash generation for years to come.","On Slide 4, I'll hit the Eastman corporate results. You can see, sales revenue on a pro forma basis declined slightly as lower selling prices primarily due to lower raws and energy costs were partially offset by higher sales volume in most segments. Pro forma combined operating earnings increased due to lower raw material and energy costs and higher sales volume, partially offset by the lower selling prices.","Third quarter EPS was $1.57, which is a record for our company, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses during a challenging economic environment. I will also point out that we had a lower-than-expected tax rate during the quarter, which Curt will discuss in his section.","Moving next to Slide 5. And as this is the first time we presented results under the new structure. In each of the segment sections, I will take a moment to remind you the major components of each business. Of course, we will give you a much more thorough overview in 10 days, during our Investor Day.","Beginning with Additives & Functional Products. This segment consists of the rubber materials product lines from Solutia's former Technical Specialties segment and the specialty polymers and solvents product lines of the Eastman's former CASPI segment.","Sales revenue for Additives & Functional Products was relatively stable, down 1%, as higher volume in solvents were offset by lower selling prices due to lower raw material and energy cost, particularly for propane. Operating earnings were up substantially as higher volume and lower raw material and energy costs more than offset those lower selling prices. We expect the Additives & Functional Products segment to deliver strong results in Q4, albeit with a typical seasonal decline in volume.","Next on Slide 6. The Adhesives & Plasticizers segment consists of the adhesives product lines formerly in the CASPI segment and the plasticizer product lines formerly in the PCI segment.","Sales revenue was unchanged, with offsetting factors. Volume increased as we continue to realize the benefits of customer substitution from phthalate plasticizers to Eastman's broad portfolio of non-phthalate plasticizers, largely offsetting the increased volume with lower selling prices in response to lower raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings increased as higher sales volume and lower raw material and energy costs more than offset those negative lower pricing -- lower prices. We expect the Adhesives & Plasticizers segment results to decline somewhat in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality.","On Slide 7 is the Advanced Materials segment. This consists of Eastman's former Specialty Plastics segment and Solutia's former Performance Films and Advanced Interlayers segments.","Sales revenue was unchanged as higher volume was offset by the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower selling prices. Operating earnings declined primarily due to lower sales volume in the Advanced Interlayers product lines due to the weakness in Europe and the negative impact of lower capacity utilization. In the fourth quarter, we expect Advanced Materials earnings to decline due to normal seasonality and decline in demand, particularly in Europe and Asia and our efforts to reduce our inventories.","Specialty Fluids and Intermediates is on Slide 8. This segment consists of the specialty fluids product lines from Solutia's former Technical Specialties segment and the oxo and acetyl intermediates product lines from the PCI segment.","Sales revenue declined 10% as lower selling prices were partially offset by higher sales volume. And the lower selling prices were primarily in our olefin derivative product lines and in response to lower raw material and energy costs. For example, propane and ethane prices declined by 1\/3 or more in the third quarter 2012 compared with third quarter 2011. As with Additives & Functional Products and Adhesives & Plasticizers, the Specialty Fluids and Intermediates segment receives about 1\/3 of our propylene spread benefit and the majority of our ethylene spread benefit.","Operating earnings increased substantially as lower raw material and energy costs and the benefit of our favorable olefins position more than offset lower selling prices. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the Specialty Fluids and Intermediates are expected to reflect continued solid volume but also a seasonally higher propane cost.","On Slide 9 is Fibers. And as you might expect, we did not change this segment. Fibers sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp. Operating earnings were flat as higher selling prices were largely offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Fourth quarter earnings for Fibers are expected to continue to be strong.","And finally on Slide 10. As we enter the seasonally slower fourth quarter, the global economic outlook continues to remain challenging. Our view is that Europe will remain stable at a recessionary level. In Asia Pacific, particularly in China, growth has slowed, but we are not seeing any signs of further weakening. And we expect the U.S. to remain solid as it has all year.","We are expecting higher raw material and energy costs towards the end of the year. For example, we expect propane prices to increase as we move into winter as propane is used for heating, particularly in the Northeast. We have extended the shutdown of one of our crackers in Longview, Texas, by approximately 3 weeks to the middle of November, due to a need for additional maintenance on unit equipment, and this is expected to have a slight negative impact on results in the quarter. And given our outlook for a stable economy, we expect our businesses will remain strong, as they have throughout 2012.","As a result, we are slightly increasing our 2012 earnings per share expectations to a range of $5.30 to $5.40. And this would be more than 10% over our 2011 EPS and would be the third year in a row of double-digit earnings growth for Eastman. I expect that trend will continue going into 2013 and look forward to sharing more with you during our Investor Day on November 5.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 12 by reviewing our solid cash performance in the third quarter.","Operating cash was $353 million driven by solid net earnings. Free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $197 million. Capital expenditures were $120 million during the quarter. For the year, we are reducing our expectations for capital expenditures to approximately $450 million. And of course, during the quarter, we paid our dividend of $36 million. This continued solid performance keeps us on track to meet our commitment of generating over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2012 and 2013 combined.","Next on Slide 13 are some detail on our tax rate for the quarter. It came in below the 34% we projected, primarily due to 2 factors. First, we settled income tax audits both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. during the quarter. These resulted in approximately $8 million of benefit. In addition, we benefited from the reversal of tax reserves due to the expiration of relevant statute of limitations, and this was about a $5 million benefit in the quarter. These factors won't recur in the fourth quarter, and as a result, we are expecting our fourth quarter rate to be approximately 34%. For the year, we expect our tax rate will be approximately 33%. And for 2013, you should expect that the rate will be lower, and I'll give you more details on that during our Investor Day discussions.","On Slide 14 is an update on the Solutia integration. We made good progress since the deal was closed on July 2. We have completed our opening balance sheet and much of that is now reflected in our results. Our new segment structure is now in place and work has been underway since the deal closed to implement the structure. And I must say, our newly aligned businesses have been operating very effectively, as demonstrated in our results in the third quarter. As Jim mentioned earlier, we will cover each segment and their respective strategies when we hold our Investor Day.","One of our most important priorities is to continue to retain key talent from this acquisition, and we've been successful to date. The feedback from our new employees have been very positive, and their professionalism continues to be outstanding. We also continue to make good progress with our functional consolidation of areas, including finance, HR, IT and supply chain, et cetera.","The bottom line:  We have made great progress on the integration and we remain very confident we will achieve the synergies that we've discussed with you in the past.","I'll end on Slide 15 with one last reminder that we are hosting an Investor Day on Monday, November 5. We're again holding the event at the Midtown Sentry Center at -- in New York at Third Avenue and 48th Streets. We will begin with lunch at noon and expect to conclude around 4:30. Through the day, we will share with you our vision and our growth plans, showcase the depths of our product lines and our product innovations and give you a chance to interact with the senior leaders of Eastman. I look forward to seeing you there.","And with that, Greg, I'll turn it back over to you.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay, thanks. Mara, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We go first to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, some talk about the MLP structures for olefin assets. Can you talk about your thinking about dropping down some of your olefin assets into an MLP structure?","James P. Rogers","Yes, we actually noticed that, so thanks for bringing it up. It gives me a chance to talk about what we've been able to do in Texas. Then I'm going to turn it over to Curt to get specific on MLPs. But just a quick review: I'm fairly proud of our track record on our crackers and what we've done. We got a jump on that, restarting crackers, when we saw how the world was changing and we've been benefiting from that for a while. And then we got a really good contract with Enterprise, which takes care of our internal needs and gets us as producer economics. So that got us up to the point where we've taken care of ourself and then we could look and say, \"Is there further value we can create?\" And judging by inbound calls that mainly Curt has to take, my sense is the world thinks there is more value we can create there. And so then the IRS came out with this letter -- and let me flip it over to Curt.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. David, so we're aware of the July 2 ruling letter. Like many in the industry, we're still evaluating what this might mean for Eastman as a source of value creation. It's a little harder to think it through completely with our existing operating assets given the integrated nature of our plants, but we're still doing that. It clearly becomes an additional factor to consider with our nonoperating assets like the idle cracker that we have sitting in Longview, Texas, or even the potential future investment in the olefin converting unit that we've discussed previously. And as Jim mentioned, it's fair to say we've had a variety of interest expressed by others in these options even before that ruling came out. But it's really too early to exactly determine what the best way to create value here. I have a lot of confidence in the business team that manages these assets. And Eastman will be judicious in our evaluation.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And just on the operating businesses, Jim, Curt, can you talk about how Crystex performed in the quarter?","James P. Rogers","Yes. I think it was fine. I mean -- let me put that in context for you, though. In other words, it was similar to year-over-year and similar to last quarter. And if you think about the marketplace they're in -- in fact, not just Crystex, a number of our product lines, and not just Solutia either, guys -- our heritage businesses. I mean, it is a tough world out there. Europe is definitely in  recession. I mean, I guess there's pockets of strength, like Germany, but definitely a recession in Europe. Asia softened up quite a bit during the year. Even North America, as much as we say it looks good on a relative basis, it's really nothing to brag about traditionally when I look back at past years and how strong we have run in the past. So Crystex, Saflex, our own polymers.  I mean I think they're doing well in what looks like very down markets. And I guess the proof's in the pudding: with everything we got going on, macroeconomics, doing a big integration of a large acquisition like Solutia and we still post record earnings. I'm very proud of the guys.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just last, Jim. Can you quantify the impact of the extended cracker downtime and the inventory reduction in Advanced Materials in Q4?","James P. Rogers","Yes. And I'm glad you raised that. I mean, I've put it in my comments because I read some of the early reports from you guys and you're all kind of scratching your head, \"What about the fourth quarter?\" It sounds like you're actually taking us down. And so we got bit. It's not huge. It'll be, I would guess, less than $0.10; of course, we're not back up and running that either, so -- but it's not, like I say, a big number, but it's enough to take a little of the bloom off the rose or whatever. So again, I think back and I say yes. But at the start of the year, if you told me which way the macroeconomic world was going to go and that you would end up with some -- a cracker issue at the end of the year and you'd still be able to add to your forecast and what you said you would do versus having to come down like some of the other folks have had to do, I feel pretty good about the strength of our businesses. But yes, it's going to bite us for probably less than $0.10.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Morgan Stanley for a question from Vincent Andrews.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you give us your view on propane? Obviously, you expected it, like most people would, to go up because of the winter, but there's a -- pieces out there that it's actually going to move meaningfully higher regardless of the winter. So what are your thoughts?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I guess we're not in the latter camp, at least not yet, so we're still just thinking seasonally on propane. Obviously, it came off quite a bit year-over-year. And again, just for everybody on the call who may not be as deep into this because it's not that big a part of our business anymore, but we're really interested in that spread over the propane, ethane through our derivative products. And we tried to factor in all the movements we can see when we gave you that fourth quarter guidance, that there might be a little squeeze on that spread in the fourth quarter and that's why we shook out where we are. We'll talk more about next year, but I can just tell you I don't see it hurting us next year, let's put it that way. I think we'll continue with the kind of strength we had in that spread this year into next year.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, could you talk a little bit about Saflex? I know it's an annual contracting business. And obviously, European autos have been weak this year, so how do you feel about volume and price in that business going into next year?","James P. Rogers","Yes, it probably just a little too early to talk about it. Actually, we have Mark Costa in Europe right now chatting with a few of those customers, getting to know them a little better, talking about relationships, longer-term game plans, which is the way we like to work with our customers. We're obviously a major key supplier with a very strong product line. I think there was some ground loss last year by the Solutia team as they looked at trade-offs between Europe and Asia. We're going to try and be smarter about that this year. But I won't be able to give you any more color. Probably even on Investor Day, it will be hard to give more color on that unless Mark's got something he can share with us coming back from Europe.","Operator","And our next question will come from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk -- I mean, obviously great results, but can you talk a little bit about your volumes by geography in the third quarter and what your expectations are?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I guess. I'm doing this from memory, and the guys will help me out because I told Greg ahead of time, if I got a regional question, he was the man because he's got this stuff nailed. But I know volumes are up in Asia and that was probably -- attribute that to our Fibers business. Latin -- and well, I shouldn't go to Latin America. Let me turn it over to Greg rather than me trying to do it. Greg?","Gregory A. Riddle","Yes. So in Asia, certainly we had a good quarter. I'd say that was probably driven by the Fibers acetate tow. We also had a good quarter in Specialty Plastics in Asia, maybe a little bit down in Specialty Fluids and Intermediates. If you think about North America, North America was down but that was -- on the revenue side, it was down, but that was more of a pricing story. Volumes were kind of flattish, maybe up a little bit in North America. And then as you would have expected, we did see some down volumes in Europe given the economic situation there.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And you would anticipate those trends to play out in 4Q? Are the bottoming or...","James P. Rogers","I think the -- one of the bigger trends in 4Q is just going to be the seasonal impact on us, Frank. I've been here long enough to learn that that's not to be underestimated. So I guess most of the business typically come off in the fourth quarter. And I guess, as I listen to other companies talk, we really don't have much different to say about the regions of the world and what we see on the end market demand and others. I just -- I appreciate the fact that our portfolio of businesses is diverse enough across customers, markets, geographies, et cetera, that when something seems to be weak, like European autos, we got enough other places to pick up the slack and continue growing the earnings.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned in the Adhesives & Plasticizers segment that pricing followed raws down. Can you talk about the ability or inability to hang onto pricing in that segment?","James P. Rogers","It's similar to a number of segments that it's -- in many areas, it's a spread game. There's -- in adhesives in particular, when the market is being quite tight, you haven been able to hold onto spread, and you've seen spreads increase, not just for us but competitors as well in the adhesives market and strong demand for those hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins that go into diapers, et cetera. And so that has been a good business, not only for us but for our customers, typically. Plasticizers, I would say, just my experience is a little more transparency there, and so you're a little more likely for pricing to move with the raws. But I would say, overall, again, it's a spread game, and that's what we play.","Operator","We now go to Edlain Rodriguez with Lazard Capital.","Edlain S. Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Jim, just a quick follow-up on the pricing issue. So for the fourth quarter, as we expect prices to move -- I mean, raw materials to go up, like propane, do you expect to see prices for many of those products moving up as well? Or is there a lag in when you're able to do that?","James P. Rogers","Yes, it's a little bit of a lag. So that's -- I think I shot a quick comment in there earlier that there'll probably be a little squeeze in the fourth quarter. You know what I mean?  We had a little benefit in the third so you probably get squeezed in the fourth. I try not to worry too much about it quarter to quarter and that's why I stepped back and said this was a very good year for that spread. In particular, the ethylene spread was very good this year. And next year, I don't -- it may come in different parts, different quarters, but next year, I would guess the spread will continue to be a real strength for Eastman.","Edlain S. Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just another question on the integration of Solutia. I mean, now that you have it under your belt, like, how comfortable are you with the synergy numbers you gave prior to the closing of the deal? And any progress on that, any update on that?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Curt's accusing me of having amnesia because, somehow, the $100 million we promised is turning into a floor and we're looking for higher numbers. But let me turn it over to Curt because he -- Curt is the lead on the integration.","Curtis E. Espeland","So let's just remind ourselves of the 3 buckets and let me just talk through it briefly. The first bucket is taxes. We feel very confident that we'll capture the tax synergies we discussed, both in the form of using the NOLs, 1\/3 of which we'll use over the next 3 years, as well as implementing tax strategies that'll get us towards that 31% tax rate. On the cost synergies, we have broken those cost synergies down into 3 categories:  The first about 1\/3 being corporate cost that go away day one, and we've achieved those. Secondly, functional costs where we have redundancies. We've captured some of those. More require -- others that we have identified really need it as we go through implementation of systems going into the 2013 year. But if you look at the cost synergies combined, I would guess by the end of the year, of that $100 million, we're probably going to be halfway there on a run rate basis. I would also like to highlight just the business synergies. And there's really, as we talked about business synergies, they're a little longer term but I still like the opportunities that are there. They're the long-term revenue synergies we talk about, like in Advanced Materials, that'll give opportunities for those businesses to figure out how to bring better value to our customers. Secondly, I also think there's going to be an increase in scale and capabilities of manufacturing and technology. That's going to accelerate some of our product development of our gen-2 acoustic product lines, given our polymer science capabilities as well as we look to improve the reliability and cost operations, pursue debottlenecks, everything else, at these sites because Eastman's good at that. And then lastly, I also think we will continue to accelerate the development of commercial capabilities such as contracting and pricing. So when you put those all together, I feel very good about the achievement of the cost synergies and the long-term potential in this transaction.","Edlain S. Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And just quickly on cash flow. I mean, you continue to generate a very strong cash flow. Acquisitions are probably off the table for now because of Solutia. Can you remind us what the priority for cash is, going forward, again?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I'll let Curt do that in a second. But just on acquisitions: You're right in terms of where our priorities are. And let's generate the cash, let's get this thing under our belt, pay down some debt. Having said that, we have the financial strength. We have the bandwidth that, if there was something that was just exceptional, we don't have to let it go by without getting our dog in a hunt. But I mean, the odds are that the way we would set the hurdles would be so high for us to find something interesting enough that we would want to get involved with a small bolt-on, and I do mean small. I mean, it would be nothing of size. Odds are, it's going to get just the way you laid out, which is we'll generate the cash, we'll pay down the debt and then we'll look around for other ways to grow. And do you want to just comment on use of the cash?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. So uses of cash, our priority is, our investment-grade credit rating; we remain committed to that. So we will have a level of deleveraging as we finish up this year and as we go on towards the end of next year. And our commitment is roughly to pay down $1 billion of debt during this time frame. But as we do that and as we demonstrate progress on that, then that does allow us to look across the different buckets of capital allocation. Bolt-on strategic acquisitions Jim talked about, we have the ability to look at, even looking at share repurchases and when is it time to start thinking about that, at least to offset dilution. So we have -- we will have options to think about as we get a start to next year and make progress on our deleveraging.","Operator","And we now go to P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","[Technical Difficulty]","James P. Rogers","Hey, P.J., we're going to -- you need to get near the phone. Your line's bad.","Gregory A. Riddle","Yes, we -- P.J., we can't hear you.","Operator","We go now to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to delve a little bit into the Additives & Functional Products volumes. Can you break down a little bit where you're seeing the volume growth, if there's any sort of niches within that business that are particularly strong? And then the second thing, can we clarify: When you say that you think 2013 will be up at least 10% from 2012, just to be clear on the base, is that just off of your report to EPS or off of a pro forma, including Solutia, for the first part of the year?","James P. Rogers","Yes, so let me take it in pieces. I mean, the -- quite a bit of volume strength and the strength in the solvents market right now. And I assume, not just us but you're seeing that with the competitors. I think we have a bit of advantage because we are so North American based. And so you can really see the flow-through of our spread and then kind of how we segmented our market and North America is the place to be for that. So that is a lot of the strength that you see in that area. In terms of the 10% up, I mean, basically we're saying it should have -- it's more than 10%. We're saying it should a 6% in front of it next year. And so that's our -- that's what we're shooting for.","Curtis E. Espeland","And that's something -- to get to that greater-than-6% is, basically, you're off of that 5 30-ish type of base, 5 30, 5 40 base. It gets some benefit of having Solutia full year integration benefits, but then also you're looking for growth within those businesses.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And there's isn't any real tax swing that's helping there; that's just off of the organic side, correct?","Curtis E. Espeland","There'll be some tax benefits. We'll -- as I mentioned in my comments, we'll not be at a 34%, 33% tax rate going into next year. We expect a lower tax rate. So there'll be some benefit of a lower tax rate.","Operator","And we'll go again to P.J. Juvekar.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you discuss demand for Solutia's Crystex product given the slowing tire demand? I guess a couple of tire companies have come out and lowered their forecast. So between the outlook going forward and then quickly, is solar a non-core business for you?","James P. Rogers","What was the last part of the question?","Curtis E. Espeland","Is solar non-core...","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is solar business -- is that a non-core business?","James P. Rogers","Yes, so on Crystex, I mentioned before that it's -- I would call it kind of steady right now with a -- at a -- let's say, a reduced level, if I can put it that way, so when I looked year-over-year and sequentially, not huge changes. That's another area we're in the middle of discussions for next year. I think, P.J., in the long run -- and this may sound a bit conceited, but I think our business guys are going to be a little smarter about that marketplace and so we're in negotiations now. I don't want to add a lot more color, but I'm bullish on that business, in particular our position and what we can do with our cost position and our scale, et cetera, long term. So that's definitely a very good business. I love the fact that we're across all the tire guys, all the regions replacement versus OEM, et cetera. I mean, we've got a good exposure there. I look at the results and think about what's going on in the tire market around the world right now, and just you can kind of salivate on what it's going to be like when there's a recovery in the transportation sector in tires. So again, we'll see if we have some more color on it, but fantastic business with long-term, good forecast for that business. On the photovoltaic business, I guess that's gotten some press from others earlier this week or last week. It would be really hard for me to say that's core for Eastman. I think that, long term, there's value there. It's hard for me to believe there isn't somebody else who would see more value or that it would be more core for than Eastman. But we haven't made any decisions on that yet, and when we do, we'll let you know. You might remember, I did have that report up to Curt so that the P&L guys did not have to spend time and be distracted by what's a fairly small business for us.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And then quickly, Jim, you mentioned that you're going to take inventories down in maybe you're -- like Performance Films. Is that a fourth quarter comment? Or do you believe that you can run Solutia assets with lower inventories?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Actually, the comment was more around the Specialty Plastics business. Although -- so to be honest to you, between now and year end, I'm going to be looking at it across the whole company. I mean, by now, you guys are starting to know us. We, somewhat conservative we try and remove all the hurdles, road blocks that are hitting our targets. I very much want to have next year's number have the 6 in front of it. I want us to be able to run well next year. I think, just with all the uncertainty, financial cliff, et cetera, it's prudent not to walk into year end with excessive inventories. I think we'll be smart about it. There are some place on the raws where we actually want to build inventories because I can see what's happening pricing wise. Finish good inventories; it's usually better if you're lower, but you have to pay attention to where you're going to have turnarounds, et cetera. So we're willing to make the sacrifice on operating rates a little bit to watch our inventories, but it's not a blanket statement. What I said earlier was really pertaining more to Specialty Plastics than anything else.","Operator","We now go to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, I was wondering if you could talk a little more, explore this fixation on olefins and spreads. And it seems a little bit odd to me, but can you tell us from the pro forma Eastman what percent of revenues might come from ethylene and propylene derivatives? And then within that subset, how many products do you have that are like polyethylene or sort of first-level derivatives where there's pretty quick pass-through versus more negotiated pricing with your customers?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Let me make a general comment, then maybe either Curt or Greg may want to hop in. It's not a big part of our business anymore. And with Solutia, it's obviously become a smaller piece. I can't ignore it. It's been a real tailwind for Eastman, so as much as I would rather talk about the longer-term things and our derivative products and where we're growing the company, et cetera, it is clearly a benefit to have crackers in Texas. And we laid out which segments share some of that benefits, some years better than others. But again, to me it's not the main driver for why you'd want to be in Eastman or what our performance has been and in terms of total shareholder performance, which goes all the way back to '09. But maybe, Curt or Greg, do you want to just size it for the guys?","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes, yes. The only other thing -- I don't know that we can -- we should size it today, but I mean we're going to have an Investor Day in just a few days, as we've mentioned, and obviously, this will be a topic that will be discussed at that day.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe an angle around that: I think you guys mentioned some caution about propane into the winter. But if I look at the strip price today, it's basically a flat line all the way through winter right around the dollar, which is just about where propane is today. So is there enough liquidity in that market where you could derisk your fears about propane -- near-term propane pricing?","James P. Rogers","Yes. And don't think of it as a fear per se, we're just trying to tell you what we think could possibly happen. It's -- you're pretty safe going into a winter saying propane may go up. We do do some hedging. We factored in what we know about the lag in pricing in our expectations when we gave that guidance. So I'm not looking for people to get real worried about the spread near term. We're just trying to be prudent in saying, hey, that would be a logical expectation that propane can move up at the end of the year and you're -- you probably wouldn't have a chance to follow us well with your pricing. And we're are also -- we are prudent in terms of we do the hedge raws. We hedge currency, we hedge interest rates.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You made one comment on the tire markets, which I found kind of interesting, about needing some enthusiasm there. But I guess, if I look at the replacement markets, particularly in Asia where the car park is finally getting to the age where there will be sort of a first round of replacement -- or replacement tires outpacing OEM and volume.  Can you have it down Europe but an up total Eastman because of the growth in the other markets, in those kind of end market?","James P. Rogers","I would think so. I mean, we can go back and look at it, but I would think so. I mean, remember, somehow, Europe overall is -- because we did Solutia, somehow, people think we have huge exposure...","[Technical Difficulty]","Gregory A. Riddle","And Bob, do you still got mute?","James P. Rogers","Yes, that's Bob's. Somehow people all of a sudden are more worried about Europe whatever. I mean, it's still like less than 1\/4 of our sales for the company overall in Europe. It is more important for the tire market, clearly. We know the big guys are there in Europe and that's good business for us. But again, you got to think longer term around the globe. And you're absolutely right to point to Asia and, frankly, North America, South America. I mean, again, I'd take a longer-term view and I'm thinking these businesses can perform the way they are right now with the way the world is. We got some serious upside ahead of us.","Operator","And now we go to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Some of your competitors in filter tow are rationalizing capacity. Are there any opportunities for volume gains in the context of that?","James P. Rogers","Well, I think, the biggest impact on volume for us in tow will be when our JV comes up in China. So you'll see some increase there. But again, take a little bit longer-term view of the fibers market, fairly steady market. You got that growth in Asia offsetting the rest of the world, basically. And I like our position, I like having an asset in Korea, I like having a JV in China. I love the cost position that we have here in Kingsport and that we can serve our European customers from what we've got in England in Workington. It's been a fairly steady market. I'd say most of the players in the industry have been quite disciplined. I don't expect any of that to change. And what's hard for you to see, I guess, when you look at the numbers is some of the numbers move around inside our business. Like this past quarter, yarn was fairly weak, as you might imagine, given what's going on in clothing retail, et cetera, and tow was quite strong, so -- but overall, I expect fairly steady shares with us, picking up a little bit because of the China JV.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Your general working capital management was pretty terrific in the quarter. Did you drop your operating rates in the third quarter relative to the second to get your inventories all in line? Or did your operating rates really not change very much versus the second quarter?","James P. Rogers","Operating rates did come down third quarter over second quarter by a little bit. Again, it blows my mind that -- I mean, we were in the 80s, I'll say that much, or at least for both the heritage business. And as you might imagine, the Solutia business would have been lower than Eastman's level. And yet we set record earnings. And the best I've ever seen this company do, operating-rate wise, is about 92%, 93% in the quarter. And so again, I realize that there's been investments made. We're living with that kind of fixed cost, fixed burn right now, but I got the capacity to grow on a lot of areas, deliver record earnings, not fully utilizing all of my capacity across all the lines. So that part feels pretty good to me. To tie the utilization rate to inventories is probably giving us too much credit. I would say part of it had to do with just the raws coming down. And I'll let Curt comment.","Curtis E. Espeland","Actually, Jeff, I -- just to be -- to make sure we're completely transparent. So if you look at the cash flow statement on Table 5, you see inventory actually being a source of cash flow. But it -- just keep in mind purchase accounting: We rolled up inventories $75 million and turned around and sold it. So $75 million of that benefit that you're seeing is actually because of that inventory turn. If you take that $75 million off of that inventory and we actually increased inventories in the quarter.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. You're spending quite a lot on developing businesses relative to last year. Is that turning out to be a good investment or a less good investment?","James P. Rogers","Overall a good investment, but it's also a lever, Jeff. I told you before our high priority in having a 6 in front of next year's number. So we pretty much only work on things that we think have long-term value, but we can control the pace on which we work on things. So as we see the world slow down, for example, we've talked internally about -- we could slow down on our perennial wood product. We don't have to keep to spend up at the level it is. We could slide that out a little bit. Other areas, like our microfibers, I think it's going to be full speed ahead. So yes, I think we're spending the money prudently. We can gate how fast we spend that money based upon the economy and the opportunities we see. And no bones about it: We got to be disciplined. We can't fall in love with something if something's not cutting it. We got to be willing to move on. But it is good, we're trying to set up some long-term growth and you got to spend some money to do that. But I'll just say it one more time: We can control the rate at which we spend if we need to.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, I think Curt said that he had immediately gotten corporate costs out. And so that means there's, call it, I don't know, $65 million of costs still to come out. And it looks like you think that you're going to get, I don't know, another $15 million in the fourth quarter. If you had to look at your segments, where's the $65 million going? How do you allocate the $65 million across your segments? And how do you allocate the $15 million for the fourth quarter?","James P. Rogers","And I got a bunch of VP GMs waiting for Curt to answer this. Answer this question, and you've got to answer it before we set our targets for next year.","Curtis E. Espeland","Look, Jeff, I mean that's an art, not a science, as you well know. As I mentioned, we'll probably be at least a 50% run rate on that $100 million. So we're probably going to be, on a run rate basis around that $50 million. The corporate cost tends to get shared amongst the group, most noticeably the 2 large businesses, when Solutia Crystex and the Saflex product lines -- but again, what you're doing with that synergies you're also then leveraging the infrastructure you have at Eastman, which gets shared by all the group. But I'd say a good portion of it will be shown up in Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products, and the rest kind of split amongst the groups as we get more of those synergies next year on the cost.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I --- Curt, is it -- would it be a simple benchmark just to say revenue would be -- for someone outside the company, revenue would be a good way to look at it in terms of a rough share...","Curtis E. Espeland","If you're talking about just corporate costs, revenue would be a rough shares, so it's functional...","James P. Rogers","So Curt, for modeling purposes, if they just want it by revenue: It's not bad.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","A question about your Additives & Functional Products. In the release, you mentioned some competitor manufacturing outages helped with the volume. Is this a market share gain? And as those outages come off, will you lose that volume, or do you think you may hold onto it?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I'll let Greg jump on that.","Gregory A. Riddle","Yes. So this -- it was really in the solvents product lines and that's really some capacity that was down as a result of hurricane Isaac around August, and so obviously that's back up. But that was really what we were referencing in that reference.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then it seems like Latin America continues to show significant strength for you relative to peers. And I know, obviously, you got some filter tow -- or fiber, excuse me, going through Mexico. So is it mainly the Mexican business that's driving those results, or there's other businesses in there too that are doing well?","James P. Rogers","No. And I don't think of Fibers as being a big player for us in Latin America, really. So it's more Brazil would be the biggest, then Mexico. There's a time at which that was reversed, and now they're -- and then it was 1\/3, 1\/3 and 1\/3 for the rest of Latin America. Now it's probably Brazil is slightly bigger. I think we have an excellent management team down there. We get -- probably a better mix of products gets sold in the Latin America. In general, probably more specialties get put down there. Greg, you want to add...","Gregory A. Riddle","We did a small acquisition down there as well.","James P. Rogers","Well, if you're just talking about growth in revenue, yes, we did do a plasticizer acquisition in Brazil. But overall, Latin America has been a good market for us. It's just not as -- I'd love for it to be a bigger percentage of our business.","Lee Bressler","Got it. And then finally, would you update us on the Tritan expansion? Is that -- are the volumes fully sold out there? And just how the plant is operating.","James P. Rogers","No, not -- I never expect it to be sold out this quickly. When you got one of those big 30,000-ton lines, it usually would take a couple of years to fill out. We got a little spoiled with the first line that it filled out so quickly. We had some favorable tailwinds with bisphenol A3, et cetera. This will be a more traditional fill-out -- in fact, maybe even a little slower just given how the economy is going. I would say, overall, the acceptance of Tritan is still quite strong. And when we get to Investors Day, you're going to see a slide that shows a bunch of brands that have bought into Tritan and it's -- you're going to love that slide.","Operator","We now take a question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","When you look ahead to 2013, can you talk about the puts and takes? So you'll have the JV coming up in tow in China. You talked about some benefit this year in the solvents from the hurricane. Can you just kind of walk through the laundry list of things that might be pluses and negatives as we look next year year-over-year that happened this year that won't happen next year?","James P. Rogers","And Duffy, I can and will and we will do it 10 days from now. So the story at the Investors Day will be much more about 2013, actually out to 2015, and we'll hit it then. I -- the guidance I'm giving today is we still expect the 6 in front of the number.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then if you look, that CapEx that you've reduced here just recently, can you walk through what are those things that you're foregoing at this point? And kind of was it just macro environments that drove those decisions?","James P. Rogers","I think what you have there is a set of business guys and manufacturing teams that are being disciplined with the economic outlook out there. So I think we're just kind of slowing the pace of some of the investments that we have out there. There's no one single project at this point that we singled out. We are taking our time to study and evaluate the Kuantan expansions in Malaysia. We're thinking through the timing of our expansion such as the Texas City. But a lot of it is just more economic and just being cautious where -- when we should spend the capital.","Operator","We now move to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, if I put the Fibers business on the side as an unchanged segment, if you will, and consider the other 4, where do you think trailing 12-month margins would compare to normalized levels? So that is to say, are there any of these 4 segments that you think are materially above or below what you would consider kind of a prospective normalized level?","James P. Rogers","Let me get Curt or Greg to help me on this. But just -- I can tell you, to start, I don't see the macroeconomic environment to be anything like what I would call a normal level. I do think we're worse than what I hoped the average economy is going to be over the next 10 years. The States, maybe not so. I mean, the States is decent. It's -- you have to start getting into the segment by segment, so to the extent we have businesses that have housing related or transportation related, you got to believe that's below normal environment and -- in my mind. And so then you will look at the individual businesses and how they're performing -- and we've given ranges for different businesses in terms of where we think their earnings will be in terms of margins, and then you can compare where we are today. But on the -- Curt, do you want to add where you see things going?.","Curtis E. Espeland","Yes. I think the -- we'll get into the margins. I think the only area that I'd just maybe point out today that is probably below its potential is Advanced Materials. There's been significant investments made in that business line. Some of their end markets are pretty soft. Those investments have been made. We're ready to get the returns off those investments; we just need a better global environment and market environment for the Advanced Materials segment. The rest of them are pretty solid, and we'll get more of that into the Investor Day.","James P. Rogers","Yes. And if you get, within the segments, I mean you can't -- to try and be balanced, solvents is clearly doing quite well right now, which is making up for the rest of that segment that is probably below some kind of average trend line. But I agree with Curt; we can get into it during our Investor Day.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just wanted to come back to the subject of the capital budget. Some of your peers across the industry have made pretty wholesale changes. It sounds from your comments like you'd be making more surgical changes to it, but could you comment on what the level of maintenance CapEx would be for the combined company now, in case you did need to take a more significant change approach there?","James P. Rogers","Yes, I'll let Curt give you that. But I will say, we do like we're on a bit of a different path than some of the other companies. We did a lot of the heavy lifting over the last 3 years in terms of our portfolio. I also think that doing the Solutia acquisition gives us a clear path to how we keep growing earnings double digits. So while others may be out there kind of wondering how they're going to do it and they're not posting record quarters and they're having to kind of scramble and go at it from the cost position, we think we've always been pretty disciplined on cost. I'll just give you one example that I've wanted to squeeze in, I'm going to use your question to do it. But just on things like headcount, we use a phrase around here, \"It's easier not to hire than to fire.\" And so when we announced the Solutia deal, we put a hiring freeze on different functions to free up spots for some of the people to help us get those synergies, et cetera. I mean, we just think a little differently. So we're in growth mode right now. You've seen that we can be disciplined. You see how we acted in '08, '09, how we can handle cash, not just on the capital line but across working capital, our expenses, et cetera. So that has not changed. We're there if the world turns south on us. And with that, Curt, what do we usually say maintenance is?","Curtis E. Espeland","Well, it's a -- heritage Eastman, we used to talk about a $200 million type of number. Heritage Solutia is probably a $50 million, maybe a little bit more type of number. So about $250 million is kind of the profile capital maintenance that we require, plus or minus 10%.","Operator","For our final question, we'll go to Bill Young with ChemSpeak.","William Young","2 quick things. Could you please bring us up-to-date on the progress you -- being made on your new additives for tires? And of course, the Solutia acquisition seems to transact pretty well. And secondly, maybe a little more transparency, if you have it, on the Performance Films area.","James P. Rogers","Yes, let me -- I'll start with Performance Films. I don't know how much more we want to say about the additive for tires other than I think tires are going to be very, very good for us. The -- I think it was already in that line, \"Baseball is going to be very -- been very, very good to me.\" I think tire is going to be very, very good to us. And in fact, let me just hit that now: We're using our technology in a number of ways across a number of markets. Tires is a place we know from the Eastman side, from resins. Obviously, the Solutia product is very big in that marketplace as well. We're finding ways to work together with customers. We think we got something pretty good that we'll talk more about on Investor Day in terms of solving some of the problems the tire makers have and that could be quite attractive. Realize, every time you work on something like this, though, with the product life cycles and how long it takes to get into tires, et cetera, it's not a quick turn-pop. So it takes a little while to get -- to create that value. What was the second part? The...","William Young","Performance Films.","James P. Rogers","Yes, this is one I like. I got to admit, I didn't know much about it. In our part of the world, people don't put a lot of films on their cars. Asia, they do. I think it has some of the best growth prospects in the portfolio. I think it's an area where we underestimated how much Eastman can help in terms of manufacturing operational excellence type stuff, commercial processes. So this is one I like and I we would -- the guys from Solutia who work in this business already appreciate being part of Eastman in terms of the problem-solving.","William Young","Okay. You're having problems in Asia now; you emphasized that before. You said it's a big product in Asia, the Performance Films?","James P. Rogers","Yes. Yes, and I think that business is dependent upon some new auto sales levels that they come off. And that business will be impacted, but there'll be more innovations and more others we could penetrate.","Gregory A. Riddle","Okay. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us this morning. A web replay and a replay in downloadable MP3 format will be available on our website beginning approximately 11 AM this morning. And if you didn't hear, we're having an Investor Day on November 5. We look forward to seeing you there. If you have not RSVP-d, please do so.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Again, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for joining us."]}}
