[Operator instructions.] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, senior vice president of communications and investor relations. Sir, you may begin. ","Vince White","Thank you, and welcome everyone to Devon\u2019s second quarter earnings call and webcast. Today\u2019s call will follow our usual format. I\u2019ll cover a couple of preliminary items, and then our president and CEO, John Richels, will comment on the quarter. Following that, Dave Hager, our chief operating officer, will provide the operations update, and then we\u2019ll have a financial review by our CFO, Jeff Agosta. We\u2019ll follow that up with a Q&A session. ","And I\u2019ll point out that our executive chairman, Larry Nichols, as well as Darryl Smette, who is the head of marketing midstream and supply chain, are both with us today to join in the Q&A. We\u2019ll conclude the call after one hour. ","During the call today, we\u2019re going to update some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results that we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year our revised outlook for the second half of 2013, but we are not planning to issue a new 8K. We will, however, post any updated estimates that we provide during the call today on the guidance page of our website. ","If you go to our website, you can just click on the guidance link, look in the investor relations section, and all of our guidance is summarized there. ","All references today to our plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates are forward-looking statements under US securities law and they are of course subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Many of these are beyond our control. And I\u2019d point out that these statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance. You can see a discussion of the risk factors relating to these estimates in our form 10-K.","Also on today\u2019s call, we will reference certain non-GAAP performance measures and when we do that, we\u2019re required to provide certain related disclosures. Those can be found on Devon\u2019s website.","Before I turn the call over to John, I\u2019ll point out that both earnings and cash flow for the second quarter significantly beat Street estimates. Our non-GAAP earnings climbed to $1.21 per diluted share. That\u2019s more than double the earnings we reported in the year ago period, and it exceeded the Wall Street consensus by about 30%.","Cash flow climbed to $1.4 billion for the quarter, the highest level in the last six quarters, and that also comfortably beat Street expectations. Overall, from both an earnings and cash flow perspective, it was an excellent quarter for Devon.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to President and CEO John Richels. ","John Richels","Thank you, Vince, and good morning everyone. As Vince just mentioned, we had an outstanding second quarter. In addition to benefitting from the substantial improvement in realized prices during the quarter, we exceeded the top end of our production guidance. ","At the same time, our year to date cost metrics are tending towards the low end of the forecast range. This is all strong evidence of the successful execution of our business plan as we continue to grow our high margin oil production. ","Let me begin today by reviewing some of the highlights of the quarter. In the second quarter, we increased company-wide oil production 14% compared to the second quarter of 2012, and 4% compared to last quarter. This growth was driven entirely by high-margin light oil production from our U.S. assets, which increased a robust 36% year over year. ","With the success we\u2019ve had in growing our oil production, we now expect liquids production to exceed 45% of total volumes by year end, and that\u2019s up from just 30% just a few years ago. ","In the second quarter, total company-wide production from our North American asset base is at an all-time record, averaging 698,000 equivalent barrels per day. This exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by 3% and topped the upper end of our forecast range by 8,000 barrels per day.","Based on the results of the first half of the year, we now expect our full year 2013 production to be near the top end of our guidance range for the year. Jeff will cover the production guidance in a little more detail later in the call.","When you examine our operating results in greater detail, you\u2019ll find that we had terrific execution across all of our core focus areas. The most notable growth in the second quarter came from our massive 1.3 million net acre position in the Permian Basin, where oil production increased 32% year over year. In fact, this momentum is continuing into the second half of the year, as our oil production in the Permian will surpass the 50,000 barrels per day milestone.","We\u2019ve also had success expanding our drilling inventory in the Permian. You might recall, in the first quarter, we doubled our Bone Springs inventory from 350 to 700 locations. Today we\u2019re once again doubling our Bone Springs inventory from 700 to 1,400 locations. This represents more than 1,000 future locations that we\u2019ve added of the past year alone, loosening our oil development inventory in the Permian to nearly 4,000 risked locations.","This low risk development inventory will provide significant light oil growth in the Permian for many years to come. In Canada, our portfolio of world-class thermal oil projects continues to generate industry-leading results, with total production from our Jackfish project averaging 53,000 barrels per day in the quarter.","Upon startup of Jackfish 3 next year, we expect aggregate free cash flow from our 3 Jackfish projects to approach $1 billion annually. Furthermore, our development schedule remains on track to increase net production from our oil sands leases to at least 150,000 barrels per day by the end of the decade.","Also, today we\u2019re announcing some exciting results from our new Woodford oil shale play in the Mississippian trend of north central Oklahoma. To date, we\u2019ve identified 1,000 risked locations in this light oil resource play. Dave will provide more details later in the call.","And finally, our Cana Woodford and Barnett shale positions continue to rank among the top shale plays in North America. Currently, our activity is directed to only the most liquids rich portions of these plays. Aggregate oil and NGLs production growth from these two plays rose nearly 40% year over year in the second quarter. These assets and their midstream infrastructure will produce about a billion dollars of free cash flow in 2013.","In addition to our strong operating results, we benefited from the sharp rise in natural gas and Canadian oil prices. Average second quarter gas price realization nearly doubled compared to the second quarter of 2012, and Canadian oil price realizations improved by more than 50% just from the previous quarter.","We also delivered strong cost discipline in the first six months of 2013. While our production is trending above initial expectations, as I mentioned earlier, capital expenditures and pretax cash costs remain comfortably within our full year guidance ranges.","On the liquidity front, year to date we have moved $2 billion of foreign cash back to the U.S. at an estimated tax rate of approximately 5%. In addition, we\u2019ve moved $500 million to Canada on a tax-free basis to fund our growth projects. ","To provide some perspective on the significance of this achievement, recall that after divesting our international assets in 2010 and 2011, we guided toward taxes of about 20%. The lower actual tax rate on the amount repatriated to the U.S. and the tax free transfer to Canada has resulted in an incremental $400 million benefit to Devon shareholders. That\u2019s the equivalent of about $1 per share.","Another positive development is the approval by our board of directors of a plan to form a publicly traded midstream MLP. We expect to file a registration statement with the SEC around the end of the third quarter. As you\u2019re probably aware, pre-offering rules prevent us from providing any additional information at this point, but we believe there\u2019s a great opportunity to unlock the value of our midstream assets for Devon shareholders.","In addition, we\u2019ve recently signed agreements to sell our Bear Paw assets in central Montana, our Thunder Creek midstream assets in Wyoming, and some other minor E&P assets for nearly $300 million. Estimated full year cash flow from these divestiture assets is less than $15 million, and the associated production is essentially all dry gas, averaging around 20 million cubic feet per day.","As you can see, the sale prices for these mature, lower-margin properties are at valuations far superior to that of our current trading multiples, or the multiples we could potentially obtain through an MLP.","These divestitures and our recent midstream MLP announcement are just a couple of examples of our continuing efforts to unlock value in our asset base when we can do so on an accretive basis. Of course, evaluating options to highlight unrecognized value has always been, and continues to be, a priority. However, any action we take must create long term value for our shareholders.","We\u2019ll continue to provide the updates on this front as warranted. At this point, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?","Dave Hager","Thanks, John. Good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin with a quick recap of our second quarter capital expenditures. Exploration and development capital for the second quarter came in at $1.2 billion, bringing our total for the first half of 2013 to $2.7 billion.","Based on our planned activity for the second half of 2013, we\u2019re on track with our full year E&P capital guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. As John mentioned, our teams delivered excellent execution in the second quarter, across our entire North American onshore portfolio.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of these high points. Starting in the Permian, our production averaged a record 76,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. Looking specifically at our Permian oil production, it grew 32% year over year.","Light oil now accounts for 60% of our Permian volumes. The execution of our Permian development program through the first half of the year has been outstanding, and we remain on track to drill more than 300 wells this year.","Our Bone Springs horizontal program in the Delaware Basin is a key driver of our Permian oil growth. We currently have 12 operated rigs working in the play. In the second quarter, we brought 29 Bone Springs wells online, with average 30-day IP rates of 675 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which more than 65% was light oil. ","These results are about 15% better than our type curve expectations. Our continued growing success in Eddy and [Lee] counties, combined with our ongoing geological evaluation, has once again allowed us to increase our inventory. ","As John mentioned, we are doubling our inventory for the second time this year to 1,400 Bone Springs locations. Given this success, our 2014 program has the potential to double our current year activity to about 200 wells, further accelerating growth of this top tier light oil play. ","Shifting to the Midland Basin, we continue to see positive results from the Wolfcamp shale in the southern portion of the Midland Basin. During the second quarter, we spud 34 horizontal Wolfcamp wells and brought 19 online, with initial 30-day production rates as high as 1,000 BOE per day.","Landing and completing these wills in the lower Wolfcamp is yielding positive and consistent results. We believe our fracks in the lower Wolfcamp are extending up through multiple intervals, allowing us to extract additional resource.","In addition, pad drilling and this play is resulting in greater efficiencies and lower costs. In fact, our number of days from spud to rig release has improved nearly 60% since the first quarter of 2012.","Today, we are able to drill our wells in just 11 days, trimming nearly 10% off our budgeted well costs. We have approximately 800 undrilled locations in this light oil resource play, and we\u2019ll be active here for the foreseeable future.","With the recent industry focus on the Wolfcamp, and in light of our 1.3 million net acre position in the Permian Basin, we have fielded multiple questions regarding our total Wolfcamp exposure. Based on our testing across the basin and industry results to date, we have exposure to the Wolfcamp on over a quarter of a million net acres across the Permian.","Beyond our Wolfcamp shale focus in the southern Midland Basin, we have tested other acreage with Wolfcamp potential across the Permian. For instance, in Ector County, where we historically drilled vertical [unintelligible] wells, we have completed two horizontal Wolfcamp wells. Each of these wells had a peak oil rate of about 800 barrels of oil per day. ","In addition, we are currently drilling a horizontal Wolfcamp test on our Delaware Basin acreage in Ward County, where industry activity has recently heated up. As we continue to derisk our acreage position throughout the Permian, we believe our total exposure to the Wolfcamp will likely expand significantly. Our massive acreage position in the Permian Basin, coupled with the multiple pay zones of Wolfcamp, provide us with a significant resource upside.","As John mentioned, we\u2019re today unveiling an exciting new opportunity on our Mississippian trend acreage. We have completed 29 wells to date in the Woodford oil shale with very positive results. Second quarter Woodford results were highlighted by 10 wells with initial production averaging 840 BOE per day and 30-day IPs of more than 500 BOE per day.","We are excited about our Woodford potential for several reasons. First, unlike the Mississippi Lime, the Woodford is a shale formation with resource play characteristics. It sits just below the Miss Lime, and can be up to 150 feet thick across portions of our acreage. It is the source rock for much of our Miss production. The Woodford is less geologically complex, and therefore should have a much higher drillability factor and deliver more consistent results than conventional formations. ","Second, the type curve emerging from the Woodford oil shale looks very similar to our original type curve in the Miss Lime, with 30-day IPs of about 300 BOE per day and [EURs] of about 350,000 BOE. Furthermore, on a program basis, the drill and complete costs for these wells should run about $3 million each. ","Third, initial production is about 80% oil on these Woodford shales. While the EUR is expected to be about one-third gas and about one-third NGLs, this high initial oil content greatly enhances the economics in today\u2019s commodity price environment.","And finally, since Woodford\u2019s geographic footprint overlaps our Miss Lime acreage, the sharing of 3D seismic surface facilities and power and gathering infrastructure will significantly enhance the economics of both plays. On our acreage in the Mississippi and Woodford trend, we have placed about 100 miles of pipeline in service to date, and expect an additional 400 miles in service by year-end.","This critical midstream infrastructure will reduce our operating costs and well backlog, allowing the ramp up in our production. The evaluation of our Woodford potential has also included a successful four-well pilot on 160 spacing. These four wells achieved average 30-day IP rates of roughly 400 BOE per day. ","The Woodford\u2019s ease of drilling also allowed us to drill and complete our first 10,000-foot ladder on the trend. The McNeil 6\/7H was brought online in the second quarter with an average 30-day IP rate of nearly 700 BOE per day.","Based on our positive results to date, we have recently added 60,000 net acres with Woodford potential to our lease hold position in the area. To date, we have derisked about 100,000 out of roughly 400,000 net acres prospective for Woodford oil shale development. This 100,000 net acres represents about 1,000 risked, undrilled locations. ","Combining our Woodford oil shale and Miss Lime results, the second quarter production across the trend averaged 5,000 BOE per day, a 73% increase from the first quarter this year. While we have spud over 200 wells to date, infrastructure limitations, [flaring] restrictions, and wells awaiting completion have limited our production history to 89 operated wells, of which 60 are completed in the Miss Lime.","Our results in the Miss Lime continue to vary, depending on geographic location, reservoir quality, landing zones, and completion techniques, with our best wells far exceeding our type curve. The seismic we have acquired thus far has allowed us to avoid structural geohazards such as faults and [unintelligible] and has allowed us to improve well orientation within the reservoir.","Additional analysis is ongoing to identify correlations between production and the various seismic attributes that can be related back to the geology. As we further refine our [unintelligible] models with the integration of 3D seismic log data and well results, we\u2019re confident we can improve our overall consistency.","Inside our joint venture area, we saw an 80% increase in Woodford 30-day IP rates from our wells drilled with the benefit of seismic. To date, we have acquired 3D seismic over roughly 50% of our acreage inside the joint venture area, and plan to have the remainder of our seismic in this area shot by early next year.","On our acreage to the north, we have a minor amount of seismic already in house, and our acquisition of additional seismic in this area will continue through 2014.","For the remainder of the year, we expect to run 14 operated rigs on our joint venture acreage, where we have the benefit of 3D seismic and one operated rig testing our lease hold to the north. This rig count will keep us on pace to participate in approximately 350 wells for the year.","Given the strength of our Woodford oil shale results, and the fact that Woodford wells secure acreage from the Miss Lime formation as well, we will focus our second half activity on drilling Woodford wells.","This level of activity, combined with the progress we\u2019ve made in building out infrastructure, will allow our net production to approach 15,000 BOE per day by the end of 2013 for the Miss Lime and Woodford oil shale combined.","So, in summary, we are excited about the progress we\u2019re making in the Mississippian Woodford trend, and believe these plays will provide the next leg of large-scale, highly economic oil growth for Devon.","Shifting to our thermal oil projects in northeastern Alberta, second quarter production from our two Jackfish projects averaged roughly 53,000 barrels of oil per day net of royalties. Most importantly, the significant improvement in Canadian oil prices boosted our Jackfish operating margin by nearly 300% quarter over quarter. ","Jackfish 1 production averaged 32,000 barrels per day during the quarter, and continued its trend of excellent plant reliability and efficiency. We reached project payout at Jackfish 1 in June, resulting in a step up in royalty rates to the Alberta government going forward. As a result, in the third quarter, we expect Jackfish 1 production, after royalties, to average between 26,000 to 28,000 barrels per day. ","To further improve output at our Jackfish project, we\u2019re testing a variety of technologies aimed at enhancing plant and reservoir productivity. While still too early to comment on the results of these pilot programs, industry participants, including Devon, expect that over time, improvements in SAGD technology will lead to step changes in efficiency, ultimately boosting production rates well above our nameplate capacity of 35,000 barrels per day.","At Jackfish 2, second quarter production continued to ramp up, averaging an all-time high of 21,400 barrels per day net of royalties. To further assist the ramp up of this project, an additional well pad has been drilled at Jackfish 2 that is currently being tied in, and remains on schedule for first [steam] later this year. ","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we\u2019ll bring the Jackfish 2 plant down for scheduled maintenance beginning in mid-August, and expect the maintenance to take about three weeks. When we restart the plant, it can take up to four weeks to restore production to full capacity. Accordingly, our net third quarter Jackfish 2 production is expected to range an average on the order of 13,000 to 15,000 barrels per day.","At Jackfish 3, we\u2019re ahead of schedule and remain on budget with nearly 70% of the project complete. We now expect first steam in the third quarter of 2014, which is roughly one quarter sooner than we had originally expected.","Also during the quarter, our Rockies oil program in the Powder River basin continued to gain momentum and deliver excellent results. In the second quarter, we brought 7 high-impact oil wells online, targeting the Turner and Parkman formations. Initial 30-day production from these 7 wells averaged 675 BOE per day, of which more than 90% was light oil.","Our Powder River Basin results have driven our overall Rockies oil production up 27% year over year, to 11,000 barrels per day. This recent success in the Powder is attributable to the integration of additional 3D seismic data, coupled with improved completion techniques.","To date, we have identified approximately 600 risked locations across our Powder River Basin acreage, and we expect further good news as we head into the second half of this year and into 2014. ","Moving now to the Cana Woodford shale in western Oklahoma, second quarter production averaged 322 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with oil and NGLs comprising nearly 40% of production. This represents an impressive 48% increase in liquids production year over year. ","During the second quarter, we spud 28 new horizontal Cana Woodford wells. Because of timing issues related to pad drilling, only three were brought online. We are currently in the process of bringing several new pads online. Expect to see strong third quarter production growth at Cana of roughly 10% sequentially.","In addition, we continue to improve drilling efficiency at Cana. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve managed to reduce drilling days by more than 40%. As a result, we now believe that only 10 operated rigs are required for the second half of the year to complete our 150 well program in 2013.","Our planned expansions at Cana and in the Barnett are now complete and fully operational. Both facilities reached record daily [inlet] volumes and NGL production late in the second quarter. As John mentioned, and it\u2019s worth repeating, our Cana and Barnett assets, combined with our midstream infrastructure, will produce around $1 billion of free cash flow in 2013.","So, in summary, we had an outstanding execution in the second quarter across our entire North American onshore portfolio. With solid production results and a growth of inventory of opportunities, we\u2019re poised to deliver impressive oil and liquids growth in 2013 and beyond.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review and outlook. Jeff? ","Jeff Agosta","Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. Today I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our second quarter results and where called for, provide updated guidance.","Beginning with production, as John detailed earlier, our record-setting production averaged 698,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was driven by growth in light oil production from the Permian Basin, coupled with the Mississippian and Woodford oil plays in north central Oklahoma. Total second quarter production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by nearly 3%, and topped the upper end of our forecasted range by 8,0000 barrels per day. ","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to continue to demonstrate year over year growth in our oil volumes, with average daily oil production ranging from 165,000 to 170,000 barrels per day. This implies a year over year growth rate in the high teens. ","Driving this strong oil growth in the third quarter is an expected 40-plus percent increase in oil production from our U.S. operations, far surpassing the impact of higher post-payout royalty rates at Jackfish 1 and the planned turnaround at Jackfish 2 that Dave discussed earlier.","Overall, on a BOE basis, after accounting for growth in NGLs and declines in natural gas, we expect production in the third quarter to range between 680,000 and 695,000 BOE per day. Due to the outperformance of our core development assets year to date, we are increasing our full year production target. This is in spite of selling noncore properties.","We now expect our full year 2013 production to range from 250 million to 254 million BOE, an increase in the midpoint of our full year forecast of 4 million barrels. Breaking down our 2013 outlook by product, high margin oil production is the most significant growth driver, where total company oil production remains on track to increase at a rate of 16% to 19% over last year.","NGL growth is also strong, and on pace to increase at a rate in the low teens for the year. Lastly, our operating teams have done a very good job optimizing base production from our natural gas assets. We now expect 2013 natural gas declines of only 7% compared to our 8-10% forecast.","Looking now at our revenues, in the second quarter, significantly improved natural gas and oil price realizations, combined with higher oil production, drove our E&P upstream revenue to $2.2 billion, 37% higher than the year ago quarter.","Oil sales, not including NGLs, once again accounted for more than 50% of our E&P revenue in the quarter. In the second quarter, our regional pricing by product was generally in line with expectations. ","One noteworthy exception was the dramatic improvement in Canadian oil realizations. For the second quarter, oil price realizations in Canada came in just above the top end of our guidance range, at 66% of WTI, or roughly $62 per barrel. This represents a 52% increase compared to the first quarter. ","This price recovery resulted from higher takeaway capacity provided by improved flow rates on key export pipes, new rail capacity, higher refinery demand, and some delays in production supply growth from industry. ","Based on what we have seen so far in July and August, we expect third quarter Canada oil realizations to range from 65% to 75% of WTI. However, supply and demand dynamics for Canadian crude remained tight, so any disruptions in refining or takeaway capacity could negatively impact pricing.","Looking at natural gas, the only notable change to our guidance is a minor adjustment for the recent widening of [ACO] differentials in Canada. We are now projecting third quarter natural gas realizations in Canada to be between 70% to 80% of Henry Hub. For natural gas liquids, we expect our third quarter realizations to range between 26% to 28% of WTI. ","Turning now to our midstream business, in addition to our strong upstream performance, our marketing and midstream operations also delivered a solid quarter. Our midstream operating profit came in at $121 million in the second quarter, enhancing our company-wide margins by nearly $2 per BOE.","The improvement in natural gas prices and higher utilization of our fractionation facility at Mont Belvieu were the key performance drivers for the quarter. This resulted in second quarter midstream profit exceeding the top end of our implied guidance range.","With the first six months in hand, we now expect our full year marketing and midstream operating profit to come in between $450 and $500 million, an increase of $25 million from our previous guidance.","Shifting now to expenses, we have continued to do a good job of controlling costs across our entire portfolio. For the first half of 2013, most expenses items have trended toward the bottom end, or even below, our guidance range, including LOE, G&A, taxes other than income, and [BD&A].","For the second quarter, the company\u2019s pretax expenses totaled $1.7 billion. On a unit of production basis, pretax expenses declined 2% from Q1, and increased only 1% year over year. By achieving significant scale and core operating areas, coupled with our consistent focus on cost of management, we are positioned with one of the better cost structures in the industry. This is especially impressive given our shift to oilier projects, which are delivering much higher rates of return but are generally more expensive to operate.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, for those of you who model Devon, we expect the payout at Jackfish 1 and turnaround related expenses at Jackfish 2 to increase our LOE to a range of $9 to $9.50 per BOE. However, our full year guidance remains unchanged.","Before we open the call to Q&A, I will conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial position. During the second quarter, our cash flow, after adjusting for balance sheet changes and repatriation tax, totaled $1.4 billion, a 31% increase compared to the second quarter of last year. This cash flow allowed us to comfortably fund our capital demands while maintaining excellent financial strength.","Additionally, we reduced our debt by $2 billion using offshore cash balances. We continue to have one of the best liquidity positions in the E&P sector, with cash and short-term investments of $4.2 billion.","Of these cash balances, approximately $3.6 billion resides in subsidiaries outside North America. Depending upon how our 2013 tax position evolves, and once we firm up plans for 2014, there is the potential to bring another sizable amount of cash back to the U.S. at a tax rate in the mid single digits.","In summary, it was a solid quarter for Devon, both operationally and financially. We posted strong oil production growth, we expanded our margins through growth in light oil, higher price realizations, and strong cost controls, and we maintained our solid financial position.","So with that, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince? ","Vince White","Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question in queue comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. A line is open for you now. ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","Jeff, kudos on the repatriation. I know that\u2019s been a lot of effort for you and your teams, so congrats on that. My first question is regarding the Woodford play, Dave. Understanding it\u2019s early in this play, but I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on the consistency of the well results thus far, perhaps the initial rates of return versus the Mississippian program, and bigger picture, what do you think this could do for Devon if you can prove this position out.","David Hager","Well, we\u2019re pretty excited about this opportunity overall, because I think by the nature of being a shale play, and the fact that it is a source rock for the vast majority of the Mississippian play, by the nature of it, shales tend to be more consistent in nature, and so that has led to greater consistency in well results already. And we\u2019re just at the beginning stages of really characterizing the overall play. ","So we are seeing more consistent results, there\u2019s obviously some variability. Some of the keys we\u2019re looking for, where we can enhance the permeability through fracturing and you see some variability depending on the thickness of the reservoir, but overall, it is a consistent play that produces strong economic results. ","You can see where we\u2019re using, essentially for right now, the same type curve as we\u2019re using for the Mississippian, but it\u2019s going to be a little bit lower well costs. So that\u2019s, obviously, even going to enhance the economics a little bit more.","And as I highlighted, we\u2019re very confident. We derisked 100,000 acres, and we see the potential for up to 400,000 acres of Woodford potential across our 650,000 acre position in the Miss trend. So it\u2019s an exciting play. If it works out to scale, you can do the math, but it can add a lot to our light oil story.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","And do you have the same water issues that you have in the Miss Lime?","David Hager ","No, you don\u2019t have near the water issues you have in the Miss Lime.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","John, one for you. I wanted to ask you, just around strategic alternatives and potential strategic alternatives beyond the MLP, thoughts on other things such as Canada, thinking about strategic alternatives around Canada to unlock some of the value there of your oil sands position.","John Richels ","Without getting into any of the specifics, we\u2019re always looking at ways that we can bring that value forward, and I think our history proves that we\u2019re not afraid of doing that and making bold moves. However, a lot of things that we talk about and reflect on from the outside don\u2019t necessarily add long term value. ","And so we\u2019re very conscious about that, and we\u2019re looking at any opportunities available to us. We\u2019ve always said we\u2019re always considering how to bring value forward, and we\u2019re not leaving any stone unturned in that analysis. But we\u2019re only going to do the things that add long term value and not take action simply for action\u2019s sake. ","Operator","Next in queue we have Doug Leggate with Bank of America. A line is open for you now.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Dave, first to you, perhaps. The Mississippi Lime and the Woodford, are we now basically seeing the Woodford as a primary target for your acreage there? And could you talk about what the implications are in terms of development plan, rig count activity, or rather, I guess, well activity, and ultimately how you might change capital allocation associated with this play.","David Hager ","We like both of them. I think that\u2019s the key. We like the Woodford and we like the Miss Lime. This is not negative on the Miss Lime, it\u2019s just we have additional potential here in the Woodford. I think that\u2019s really the key. The Woodford is a little bit deeper, and it has some of these additional qualities that we described of being a shale with probably more consistent results, a little bit easier to drill, a little lower well costs, all of which are very positive for that. ","And in addition to being deeper, when you drill a Woodford well, you hold all rights above that. And so we\u2019re going to have a tendency to drill more Woodford wells here in the short term to make sure that we get our acreage secured through the Woodford. But ultimately, it\u2019s going to take the rest of this year, I think. ","That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to say consistently, that it\u2019s going to take the rest of this year to really get a clear understanding of what the full potential is on both the Woodford and our Miss acreage, but it\u2019s starting to emerge pretty positive, I can tell you, and it looks like we certainly have a strong leg to our next oil growth within Devon. And so I like where we are, bottom line. It\u2019s just nice to have an additional formation such as the Woodford to really bolster that growth. ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I don\u2019t know if you wanted to take my follow up, but it\u2019s related to the carries, clearly the success in the Powder, the Permian, and the Miss. How are you allocating, and what\u2019s the remaining capital carry you have in the two joint ventures that you have with Sumitomo and Sinopec?","Jeff Agosta","We should benefit to the tune of over $1 billion this year and a billion next year.","John Richels ","And that\u2019s the two JVs combined.","Jeff Agosta ","Yeah, the two combined. But as far as specific to the Rockies and the Miss, that\u2019s got to be upwards of $700 million to $800 million per year.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from the line of Joseph Allman with JPMorgan. Their line is open for you now. ","","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan ","On the Miss Lime, production increased by about 2,200 barrels per day from the first quarter to the second quarter. And you drilled 44 wells in the second quarter, 34 in the first quarter. These are gross wells. So why is the production not ramping up faster there? ","David Hager ","It\u2019s important to remember that so far we\u2019ve only brought a total of 64 wells online in the Miss, total of about 90 or so for the combined Miss and Woodford. And so we have currently, as we speak, we\u2019re building out our infrastructure and we\u2019ll be continuing to build out that infrastructure throughout the third and fourth quarter. So as we get the infrastructure built out, as we complete these additional wells, then we\u2019re going to see the ramp up in production even further.","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan ","And the Miss Woodford, I think your press release indicated that, so you exited the June quarter at 7,000 barrels a day, you exited the March quarter somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,500 barrels a day, you brought on 36 wells in the second quarter, and you mentioned the 10, that averaged 840 or so BOE per day. So that would imply that the other 26 wells actually had a very low rate. So I was just working the math. I\u2019m just trying to understand what the average of those other 26 was.","David Hager ","They\u2019re varied. And it\u2019s important to remember, and I\u2019ll go back to what I said previously, we are still in the testing phase of this. We are landing in various zones within the Miss, and we\u2019re experimenting throughout our acreage. An additional point I need to make is the working interest in a number of these wells. We\u2019re talking about gross wells. And so the working interest in a number of these wells is very low. ","So you really can\u2019t do the math I think you\u2019re trying to do, to figure out the rate. But we are seeing a lot of variability right now, and we\u2019ll continue to see that as we evaluate our acreage here throughout the rest of this year. And then we will really be focusing in on what we think are the best parts of the play. ","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan ","Dave, could you give us the average working interest for the Miss Lime and for the Woodford? I thought it was actually pretty high, with about a 20% royalty.","David Hager ","I think it\u2019s averaging about 30% or so.","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan ","30% working interest average?","David Hager ","Yeah. I might also mention, just to follow up on some of these wells too, we can produce for about 30 days and then we can\u2019t produce them any further, because there are the flaring restrictions we have. So we\u2019ve actually had to shut in some of these wells. So there\u2019s a lot of complicating factors that factor in to why it\u2019s taken a while to ramp. Once we have our facilities in place, that we\u2019re talking about building out here in the second half of the year, that won\u2019t be an issue anymore.","Joseph Allman - JPMorgan ","And John, just on the strategic alternatives, as a follow up, from the language it sounds as if that process has slowed down somewhat internally. I think you were looking at options for the midstream business, and you already announced those, but it sounded previously, I think you said everything was on the table. Now it sounds as if that process has slowed down internally. Is that a proper interpretation?","John Richels ","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s slowed down. I said everything\u2019s on the table, and everything\u2019s still on the table. If we can see opportunities that create long term value and that make sense and are accretive, then we\u2019ll look at them. But I just wanted to make the point that just undertaking activity for activity\u2019s sake doesn\u2019t make sense unless we think it\u2019s really something that\u2019s going to add some value to the stocks. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve changed our view on that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Their line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","Shifting to the Permian, can you talk in more detail about what\u2019s driven the increase in your Bone Springs locations? How much of that is due to incremental Bone Springs zones working, versus you\u2019ve tested a wider acreage, versus spacing, versus EURs, or anything else?","David Hager ","Let me give you a little bit of an idea for what is going on here. It\u2019s primarily, as we test additional acreage. That\u2019s the answer. To give you a little bit of color on the details on this, when you look at the logs of this first and second Bone Springs, they are what we like to typically call railroad tracks, which really means we see very little indication of a deflection of the SP curve, or the resistivity curve, which you typically see in productive formations. ","And so what this really means is these are pretty fine-grained reservoirs, and so you can\u2019t just look at a log and say for certain that these wells are going to be productive. You have to actually go in and test new areas, and then you find out, oh, it\u2019s working. And so based on that fact, then you step out further, and you step out further, and you say that area\u2019s working too. ","So that\u2019s what we\u2019re really doing. We\u2019re stepping out and testing new areas, because it\u2019s just not obvious from the well data that it\u2019s really going to be productive. And what we\u2019re finding is that these areas that just don\u2019t look that impressive by traditional log analysis techniques, when we go out and test them, they\u2019re working really well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","And my follow up goes back to some of the earlier questions. Is the emergence of this Woodford oil opportunity in the Mississippi Lime area meaningful enough where it reduces your appetite for considering or adding oil resource via acquisition from some new play elsewhere?","David Hager ","Well, we\u2019re always going to be very disciplined, I think, if we\u2019re looking at any acquisitions. And so we\u2019re going to, I think, continue to look to see if there are any meaningful, but obviously we haven\u2019t made any deals yet, because we\u2019re being very disciplined from a value standpoint. I think it\u2019s always in our best interest to look, but we\u2019re certainly excited that this adds a lot of strength to our internal oil growth story as well. So I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re going to stop looking. We always see if there\u2019s something meaningful out there, but it certainly gives us a lot more confidence on our internal story. ","Operator","Next in queue we have [Sue Lin] from Robert W. Baird. A line is open for you now.","[Sue Lin] - Robert W. Baird","A quick clarification question about Woodford oil. Is this part of your Sumitomo JV? And also, what is your planned activity for developing this play in \u201913 and \u201914? Could you use part of the [drill carry] from the JV? ","David Hager ","We have 650,000 acres throughout the Mississippian trend. About 150,000 or so of that acreage is within the joint venture, not with Sumitomo, but with Sinopec. And where we\u2019re drilling the bulk of our wells right now is on that acreage that\u2019s within the Sinopec JV, and that has the bulk of the derisked acreage for the Woodford right now. And we see additional prospectivity outside of the joint venture acreage with Sinopec that we\u2019re going to be derisking here throughout the remainder of \u201913 and \u201914.","So right now, as part of the Sinopec JV, and as part of the overall plan, as part of the 350 wells we talked about that we\u2019ll be drilling overall in the play, and it\u2019s within the budget that we\u2019re working with with Sinopec and the JV.","[Sue Lin] - Robert W. Baird","And then the second question is regarding Powder River Basin. Given that the overall results there seem to be pretty good on Parkman and Turner, and you also have 600 risked locations, I was just wondering is this going to become a core area for you guys? Are there any permitting issues to develop this play here?","David Hager ","Well, we\u2019re excited with the results we have. And we\u2019re looking at ways to increase our well activity as we move into 2014. It is BLM land for the most part. Not entirely, but for the most part. There\u2019s a longer permitting process involved in that, so we need to get ahead of the curve as far as permits. We do see the scope for increasing rig activity in 2014. Is it going to grow to the size of the potential that we see in the Miss or the Permian? No, I don\u2019t think so. But is it still going to be a meaningful part of the growth story? Yeah, it can be a significant contributor, I think. Still, it\u2019s probably not going to be of the scale of the Permian and the Miss.","[Sue Lin] - Robert W. Baird","And then my last question is do you have any update for us on Cline, in the Permian?","David Hager","Yeah, on the Cline, we\u2019ve decreased our rig activity right now. We\u2019ve seen a lot of variability on the Cline. And we certainly have our concerns about the Cline, but we\u2019re also getting additional 3D in there. We\u2019re looking at our completion techniques. ","For the short term, we\u2019ve decreased down to two rigs in there, both of which are going to be doing what I call mini developments in Sterling County, seeing how low we can get the well costs to have economic developments there. In the meantime, we\u2019re studying the well results we have to date. We\u2019re getting 3D. And as I said, the results have been pretty mixed so far. So we need to do some studying here before we go back out there with a significant program.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Their line is open for you now. ","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Americas Securities ","A couple for Dave. With the Woodford Mississippian trend that you discussed, you said that you had variable thickness in the Woodford Shale. How variable is it aerially, when you look at all this acreage? Or is it relatively uniform?","David Hager ","It\u2019s reasonably variable. We have some areas we\u2019re not including in our prospective acreage at all, because it\u2019s not present. And so we\u2019ve seen positive well results, down to as low as 40 to 50 feet of Woodford shale. We\u2019ve seen very good well results, and it\u2019s up to 150 feet thick in other areas. So there is some variability across the play. There\u2019s no question about it. But again, we\u2019ve had positive results down to 40 to 50 feet, and so that\u2019s why we see a lot of it as being prospective.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Americas Securities ","When do you think you\u2019ll an HBP mode in terms of capturing all the acreage? This year?","David Hager ","We won\u2019t have it all captured this year. It will take on into 2014, particularly to the acreage to the north. The bulk of the acreage within the joint venture area will get HBP this year, but it will be 2014 to really do the acreage to the north.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Americas Securities ","Next one from me is on the Permian. Have you hit a stage where you\u2019re in a pad mode yet? You\u2019ve talked about your drilling times improving.","David Hager ","Oh yeah, we\u2019re doing pad drilling throughout the Bone Springs, throughout the Wolfcamp shale. We have been for some time. And that\u2019s frankly why some of the ramp up of production has been pretty inconsistent, I guess you\u2019d say. ","But to give you an idea, though, just to fortify our production growth in the second half of the year, to give you one example here, in our Wolfcamp shale area, we fracked about 25 wells in July. They\u2019re coming on here in August. We\u2019re going to frack another 25 wells in August. They\u2019ll come on in September. ","And so that\u2019s what\u2019s really the cause of the nature of pad drilling that the growth has been a little bit lumpy. But now that we\u2019re getting all these wells drilled, completed, and on production, that\u2019s what gives us the confidence. We\u2019re going to have to kind of ramp up what we\u2019re forecasting for the remainder of 2013.","We\u2019re also pad drilling in Bone Springs. Same issue there.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Americas Securities ","Given the results in Bone Springs wells, are you going to increase your EURs there?","David Hager ","They\u2019re running at about 15% above the type curve right now. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll have to talk to the guys and see if they feel confident in doing it all the way. You understood the issue I talked about before. They\u2019ve got to convince themselves those railroad track looking logs are really going to deliver even more. So we\u2019ll see if they can get that confidence. But we\u2019re getting outstanding results.","Operator","Next in queue we have Rehan Rashid with FBR. Their line is open for you now.","Rehan Rashid - FBR ","Just a quick question on Jackfish 2. Once we have the turnaround and the incremental pad in, what should we think about as the run rate? ","David Hager ","We\u2019re probably going to get an incremental on the order of about 8,000 barrels a day or so from the next pad, so once we\u2019re fully back ramped up, I\u2019d say 30,000 to 31,000 barrels a day, somewhere in that order.","Rehan Rashid - FBR ","And this should be by what, middle of next year? ","David Hager ","Yeah, somewhere around there.","Rehan Rashid - FBR ","And just broadly speaking, thoughts around further exploration efforts going on within the enterprise, some broad thoughts on that front? What should we be looking forward to?","David Hager ","Well, we\u2019re always out there looking, and we have a lot of ideas internally. Frankly, this has been a year where we had captured a lot of acreage, and we felt it was the year to evaluate that acreage. And given the success that we\u2019re having on that acreage right now, I think it\u2019s an open question as to how much additional acreage we need to add. Because we\u2019ve got a lot of growth that we\u2019re identifying right now from the acreage we\u2019ve already captured. So if we see some that we think are truly outstanding, we may go out and try to capture those, but we\u2019ve got a lot of growth already from what we have captured.","Operator","You last question in queue comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Their line is open for you now.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice ","I was wondering if we could turn to the Midland Basin Wolfcamp, and those look like some pretty good results that you have there, but I\u2019m curious, I know that at least one of those two Ector wells you did in 2012 was a relatively short lateral. I want to say it was around 3,000 feet. And so I wondered if you could add some detail, first on what your lateral lengths were on these wells that you reported with this quarter. And second, if you could give a breakdown of the 250,000 net acres that you have prospective for the Wolfcamp, how much of that is Delaware and how much of that is Midland. ","David Hager ","On the lateral lengths for the wells in Ector County, we\u2019re currently drilling those about 5,000 foot laterals. Not quite as long as the ones we were doing in the southern Midland Basin. The breakdown of the Wolfcamp shale acreage that we have, it\u2019s about 140,000 acres or so that we think is prospective in the Delaware Basin. Then we have about 65,000 acres or so, I think, perspective down in the southern Midland Basin. And then the rest of it is up in Ector County, and then some other smaller, scattered acreage.","Vince White","John, do you have any closing remarks?","John Richels ","Just want to summarize. Our annual production is going to be at the top end of our guidance, with our U.S. light oil production up 36% year over year. Really importantly, too, year to date cash costs are at the bottom end of the guidance, and our capital expenditures remain comfortably within our original guidance. We\u2019re going to continue to expand our high margin light oil drilling inventory in the Permian, and we\u2019re very excited about the new Woodford oil shale play that David\u2019s discussed a lot today.","So was we move forward, we\u2019re going to continue to be disciplined with our capital, we\u2019re going to continue to preserve our financial flexibility, we\u2019re going to continue to pursue our top strategic objective of maintaining long term growth and cash flow per debt-adjusted share. So thank you very much for joining us today. ","And with that, I guess we\u2019re done.

Christensen - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Operator","Welcome to Devon Energy Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Vincent W. White","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's third quarter 2012 earnings call and webcast. Today's call will follow our usual format. After I make a few preliminary comments, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels. He will provide the overview of the third quarter and his thoughts on the upcoming quarter and year ahead; then Dave Hager, the Head of Exploration and Production, will provide the operations update; and following that, our CFO, Jeff Agosta, will finish up with a review of our financial results and an updated outlook. After Jeff's discussion, we'll have a Q&A session. Our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols; as well as Darryl Smette, the Head of Marketing, Midstream and Supply Chain, are both with us today to help out in the Q&A. And as usual, we'll keep the call to about an hour. A replay of this call will be available later today on our website.","During the call today, we're going to provide an update of some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results that we've seen over the first 9 months of the year and our revised outlook for the fourth quarter. In addition to these updates, we will file an 8-K later today containing the details of the updated fourth quarter estimates. To access this guidance, you can just click on the guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Please note that all references today to our plans, forecast, expectations and future estimates are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we always try to give you the very best information possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. You can find a discussion of risk factors related to our estimates in our Form 10-K. Also, in today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we use these measures, we're required to provide related disclosures which are available on Devon's website.","During the third quarter, we recorded a non-cash property impairment charge of $1.1 billion or about $700 million after-tax. This charge resulted primarily from the lower natural gas prices over the last 12 months. And under full cost accounting rules, the carrying cost of our oil and gas properties is subject to a quarterly ceiling test. I just want to clarify that this write-down was simply an accounting exercise and is not reflective of the fair value of our assets. It does not relate to any specific reserves. It also has no impact on our cash flow or cash balances nor our credit agreements. It's worth noting that this charge is not unique to Devon. Beginning last quarter, that is the second quarter of 2012 and extending into the third quarter, several companies in our peer group have taken impairment charges.","With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to John Richels.","John Richels","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. First of all, the organic conversion of our asset portfolio to a higher oil waiting remains on track as evidenced by our continued growth in oil production. We continue to invest the majority of our capital in high-margin North American oil projects. Over time, these high rate of return projects, combined with the greater capital efficiency that's provided by our joint venture structures, should result in superior growth of cash flow per share adjusted for debt.","Devon's third quarter performance reflects our continuing progress towards this goal, so let me give you a few highlights of the quarter. Driven by better-than-expected price realizations and low overall unit cost, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow per share for the quarter came in well above the mean Street estimates. Company-wide oil production increased 14% over the third quarter of 2011, and this was achieved in spite of scheduled plant maintenance at our Jackfish 1 Oil Sands project. Jackfish 1 maintenance reduced third quarter oil production by about 10,000 barrels per day. Without the impact of the Jackfish turnaround, oil production would have increased more than 20% over the year ago quarter.","Our U.S. oil production, which is our highest margin product, grew 26% in the third quarter, and that was driven largely by our success in the Permian Basin. With the expansion of our Gulf Coast Fractionators facility now complete, our midstream business resumed full operations in the third quarter, and our marketing midstream operating profit reached $109 million, and that's right at the top end of our guidance range.","Devon also delivered strong performance from a cost containment perspective. Third quarter 2012 pretax cash cost per BOE declined 2% from the second quarter, and our recent decision to close our Houston office and consolidate those operations into our Oklahoma City headquarters will result in additional savings beginning in 2013.","In September, we closed our $1.4 billion joint venture arrangement with Sumitomo in the Midland Basin, Wolfcamp and Cline Shale plays. With the closing of this transaction, Devon has now successfully closed 2 exploration joint ventures during 2012 with a total value approaching $4 billion.","We generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow in the third quarter. And when combined with the upfront proceeds from our Sumitomo joint venture and other minor asset sales, total cash inflows reached about $1.9 billion.","On the liquidity front, we exited the month of September with $7.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and a net debt-to-cap ratio of 15%, thereby continuing to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in the peer group. And lastly, with the recent rise in natural gas prices, we have meaningfully added to our 2013 natural gas hedge position.","In the third quarter, we did, however, have some setbacks. Our third quarter top line production came in at 678,000 BOE per day or about 1% below the midpoint of our guidance. The shortfall was driven by 2 key factors: First, we had lower volumes from our liquids-rich gas projects than in our initial plan; and second, the ramp-up of production at our Jackfish 2 project has been slower than expected. Dave and Jeff will cover both of these items in more detail later in the call.","Looking ahead to 2013, we are currently in the process of working through our capital budgeting process. Directionally speaking, we expect next year's E&P capital spend to be significantly less than 2012, driven by a sharp reduction in spending on leasehold capture and exploration. Even with this reduced level of spending, we expect to maintain an oil-focused drilling program with activity levels similar to those of 2012.","We expect to see significantly higher drill-bit activity on our joint venture projects. You'll recall there our partners will fund roughly 80% of total well costs. And in 2013, we will continue to aggressively pursue our Permian Basin opportunities. We'll move our oil sands developments forward in Canada, and we will accelerate activity in our emerging Mississippi line play. As we've done in the past, we will finalize our 2013 budget in the coming months and provide detailed guidance during our fourth quarter call and through a subsequent 8-K filing.","As we sort through various alternatives for capital deployment, we remain unwavering in our commitment to our top strategic objective, that is, to maintain -- to maximize growth in cash flow per share adjusted per debt. We're confident that the disciplined pursuit of this objective will allow us to deliver significant value as we move forward.","In addition, we believe the long-term growth potential of Devon's oil projects, both light sweet crude in the U.S. and heavy oil in Canada, married with an option on natural gas provided by our world-class gas resource plays, differentiates us from the other companies in our sector.","So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager. Dave?","David A. Hager","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to the highlights of the quarter, I'll begin with a quick recap of 2012 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities. E&P spending was $1.7 billion for the third quarter, bringing E&P capital through the first 9 months to $5.3 billion. We expect fourth quarter expenditures for exploration and development to be approximately $1.7 billion, pushing us outside the top end of our full year guidance range by roughly $400 million. Roughly half of this increase is a result of capturing more acreage than previously budgeted in Permian, Mississippian and other oil-focused plays. The balance is related to accelerated activity to evaluate and build out infrastructure on our Mississippian acreages outside of the Sinopec JV. Of course, the $1.3 billion in cash that we've received this year as a result of the JV is not netted against capital expenditures for reporting purposes.","Moving now to area-by-area highlights, starting in the Permian, our Permian production averaged a record 65,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, up 30% over the third quarter of 2011. Looking specifically at our Permian oil production, it grew by 35% over the same period, with light oil now accounting for nearly 60% of our total Permian volumes. We continue to be very active in the basin with 20 operated rigs focused on drilling higher return oil opportunities.","Our Bone Spring horizontal program in New Mexico continues to yield excellent results. We have 6 rigs currently running in the play. In the third quarter, we brought 18 Bone Spring wells online, with average 30-day IP rates of 565 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 80% of which is light oil. We've been very active in the Bone Springs over the past couple of years drilling more than 130 wells, including some 90 wells this year. However, in spite of this high level of activity, we have not burned through our drilling inventory. Through our ongoing geological evaluation, we have been successfully regenerating our opportunities. We have identified 300 remaining risked Bone Springs locations in the second and third Bone Springs formations. In addition, we are currently testing the first Bone Spring potential on a portion of our New Mexico acreage, and the early results were encouraging. If successful, this could add material to our existing multiyear drilling inventory.","Also in the Permian, we continue to have very good results from our 2 rig program targeting the Delaware oil formation. We brought 7 wells online during the third quarter, with an average 30-day IP rate of just over 600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Roughly 80% of this production stream from these wells are also light oil. To date, we have identified approximately 200 additional risk locations in the Delaware, and we are optimistic that with additional geological work, we can expand our drilling inventory here as well.","In the Wolfcamp Shale in the southern Midland Basin, we brought 5 Wolfcamp horizontal wells online in the third quarter. These wells had average 30-day IP rates of 556 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, over 80% is liquids and almost 60% is light oil. These IPs are right in line with our type well profile for this play. Our productions from the Wolfcamp Shale has almost quadrupled since the beginning of the year. And we're continuing to drive down well cost in this play and expect our next few wells to be in the $6.5 million range. The continued improvements we're seeing from both a productivity and cost perspective give us confidence we can achieve consistent economic results in the play. We have almost 100,000 net acres perspective for the Wolfcamp and the Sumitomo JV.","In the Cline Shale area on the Eastern flank of the Midland basin, we have been steadily ramping up drilling activity. I'll remind you that this acreage is prospective for the Wolfcamp and the Mississippian formations in addition to the Cline Shale. We had 3 operated rigs running at the end of the third quarter and just last week, added a fourth rig. We tied in our second Cline horizontal well during the third quarter and saw encouraging results. The Virginia City Cole C 1H located in Sterling County has had a 30-day IP rate of 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Our third Cline horizontal well is just starting to flow back, and we have 5 additional wells in various stages of completion, including one well targeting the Mississippian formation. Consequently, we should have a lot more detail for you in the next quarter. The 556,000 net acres in this area within the Sumitomo joint venture represents thousands of risk locations.","Shifting now to our thermal oil projects in North Eastern Alberta. Third quarter aggregate production from our 2 Jackfish projects averaged 44,300 barrels of oil per day, net of royalties, in the third quarter. As we indicated in our last quarter call, Jackfish 1 was taken down for 3 weeks during the third quarter for scheduled maintenance. Plant operations were restored on September 11. However, it takes a few weeks to fully restore the steam chambers and ramp production back up. Accordingly, fourth quarter production at Jackfish 1 is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day, net of royalties.","Looking ahead to 2013, we now expect to reach payout at Jackfish 1 at some point in the first quarter. The operational success of the project combined with high oil prices have resulted in a fairly short time to payout. With the WTI price in the mid- to upper-80s, we'd expect our post payout royalty at Jackfish 1 to be between 20% and 25% versus our current 5% to 6% pre-payout rate. In spite of the significant step-up in the royalty rate, we expect Jackfish 1 production to average between 25,000 and 27,000 barrels per day in 2013, net of royalties.","At Jackfish 2, third quarter production increased 7% over the second quarter, averaging 19,800 barrels per day, net of royalties. However, it has now become apparent that the maturation of steam chambers on a couple of our initial well pads is progressing at a slower rate than originally expected. This is a result of some localized interbedded shales and sill stones delaying the development of steam chambers. Although these obstacles have slowed steam chamber development, the chambers will eventually develop, enabling the reserves to be fully recovered. However, in order to accelerate production and utilization of our plant, we are currently drilling the first of 2 additional well pads and expect to begin steaming the first pad late next year. Until then, we'd expect our production from Jackfish 2 to average between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels per day, net of royalties, except during the routine plant scheduled -- routine plant turnaround scheduled for 2013.","It's important to understand that even among the highest oil quality oil sands reservoirs like we have on our Jackfish and Pike acreage, it is not uncommon to see some variability within the reservoir. We encountered similar variability at Jackfish 1, but the strength of our earliest wells offset the potential timing issues that can result from reservoir variability. In hindsight, additional wells at the outset of our Jackfish 2 project would have bridged the timing gap and ensure full utilization of plant capacity within the expected time frame.","The delayed ramp-up should impact the total project rate of return of Jackfish 2 by a little less than 3%, with a project return based on current prices of roughly 20%. We will incorporate this lesson into the Jackfish 3 and Pike projects. The cost of adding a couple of spare well pads on this project at start-up is a relatively minor capital acceleration in the scope of the overall project and can help ensure that normal variations in well pad performance do not have the potential to significantly impact production ramp-up.","Jackfish 3 construction continues to progress well, with a project approximately 45% completed at the end of the third quarter, putting us on track for a start-up around year-end 2014. At Pike, we continue to work with our partner on the evaluation of construction execution strategies with the goal of providing greater cost and schedule uncertainty. Given the pressure on labor in the region, we are currently exploring a more modularized approach in use of Jackfish. This would allow more of the labor to be done in a manufacturing facilities rather than the field and should show -- should result in significant efficiencies. We expect to finalize our development plan by the middle of next year. We plan to drill 35 stratigraphic wells and shoot approximately 55 square miles of seismic during the 2012, 2013 winter season.","With the majority of the Pike 1 resource already identified, the data obtained from this year's winter drilling program will substantially complete the evaluation of the first phase of development for Pike. Engineering work is ongoing, and we hope to obtain regulatory approval by the end of 2013. As a reminder, the Pike 1 development project will have gross production capacity of 105 barrels of oil per day, and Devon operates Pike with a 50% working interest.","Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. We brought 25 operated wells online in the third quarter at Cana, with average 30-day IP rates of 6.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 483 barrels of liquids per day. These wells have average EURs of 9.3 billion cubic feet equivalent, making them some of the best wells ever drilled at Cana. These wells are much stronger than the tight curve we presented at our Analyst Day last April, which called for an IP of 4.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day and EURs of 8.3 Bcf equivalent.","In contrast, the Cana wells we drilled during  the second half of last year have underperformed our expectations. Because we are in a regional drought, we use smaller fracs to reduce water consumption. Industry data at that time suggested that we would not sacrifice much in a way of rates or recoveries. However, as we have brought these wells on and observed their performance through the first 3 quarters of this year, we were seeing that the smaller fracs significantly impacted well performance. We now believe the wells drilled in the second half of 2011 have EURs that are only about half of the Cana core type curve.","In early 2012, we added surface water facilities that secured plenty of water for our Cana completion operations, mitigating the impact of the drought. This allowed us to return to our previous stimulation program. And while Devon's third quarter 2012 production from Cana increased 42% over the third quarter of 2011, our volumes at Cana are currently running about 8,700 barrels equivalent per day below our previous expectations, attributable to the performance of the wells drilled in the last half of 2011 and to some variation from plan and the timing of bringing on well pads. Even though it is short of our original forecast, we still expect sequential growth in the fourth quarter Cana production of more than 10%.","We began the third quarter with 15 operated rigs at Cana. After initially moving 3 rigs to the Mississippian oil play in Oklahoma earlier in the third quarter, we later made the decision to move 5 additional rigs to the Miss and ended the quarter with 7 rigs at Cana. The Cana rigs were a logical choice for redeployment in the Miss because of close geographic proximity of the 2 plays makes for a relatively easy and inexpensive move. However, given the strong performance of the 2012 drilling program, it is likely we'll add additional rigs to Cana in 2013.","Shifting to the Barnett Shale in North Texas in the third quarter, we had 10 operated rigs running in the liquids-rich core and the oil window. We tied in 67 wells, driving our average third quarter net production to 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day, up 8% from the year ago quarter.","Moving west to the Texas Panhandle and the Granite Wash area, we continue to see solid results. We brought 7 operated wells online during the third quarter. To date, our drilling is focused primarily on the Granite Wash A and B sands and the Cherokee. However, in the third quarter, we drilled our first operated well in the Hogshooter formation with excellent results. The Brown 8-7H located in Wheeler County had a 30-day average IP rate of nearly 2,200 BOE per day, including 1,688 barrels of light oil and 170 barrels of NGLs.","Subsequent to quarter end, we tied in our second Hogshooter well. The Lott, 3-2H has been online for just 14 days and has averaged 4,400 BOE per day, including 3,200 barrels of oil per day. We currently have 2 additional Hogshooter wells in various stages of drilling and completion. Further geoscience work and drilling is needed to fully assess our potential, but our preliminary work suggest up to 100 additional locations. With this kind of productivity and a drilling complete cost of roughly $8 million, the returns on these wells are very strong.","We plan to move a fourth rig to the Granite Wash later this year. Our Granite Wash production has grown from about 6,700 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2010 to 18,500 BOE per day in the third quarter this year. With the impact of our Hogshooter program, we would expect further volume growth going forward.","On the exploration front, we continue to see encouraging results in the Ferrier corridor of Alberta where Devon has roughly 240,000 net acres perspective for Cardium oil, the liquids-rich glauconite and other lower Cretaceous zones. Given the strong economics from the more than 24 horizontal wells we drilled to date, we are currently evaluating a potential development plan that would include the construction of a gas processing facility. We expect to make a decision as a part of our 2013 capital budgeting process, and we'll keep you updated as we move forward.","In the U.S., we continue to move forward with the evaluation of a number of exploration plays, including those within the Sinopec JV. As we began to gain clarity on which of these plays will effectively compete for capital within our portfolio, we will determine how to monetize the positions we don't plan to pursue. Keep in mind that JV has allowed Devon to look at these plays with very little impact from a net capital perspective.","Let me provide a brief update on the current status. Looking first at the Rockies oil exploration, we've had encouraging results from wells testing several different formations, including an oil well we just completed in the Powder River Basin that has been on production for 7 days, averaging 1,100 barrels of oil per day. A very encouraging result. In the Ohio Utica, as we indicated last quarter, the results from the wells in the western portion of the oil window had been disappointing. We have since shifted our drilling efforts further to the east and expect to have 3 or 4 wells down on this for eastern acreage by year-end.","In the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, we tied in our third and fourth wells in the northern portion of our acreage position during the third quarter. The Murphy 63H located in West Louisiana parish had an average 30-day IP rate of 260 barrels of oil per day from a 4,700 foot lateral. Roughly 40 miles to the east in Tangipahoa Parish, the Thomas 38H was brought online and had a 30-day IP rate of 470 barrels of oil per day from a 4,900 foot lateral. We would need to see improvements in both cost and recoveries to make this an attractive play going forward.","Finally, in the Mississippian oil play located in North Central Oklahoma, we currently have 13 operated rigs running. Devon has 545,000 net acres in the play. We significantly ramped up our drilling activity in the third quarter, drilling both saltwater disposal wells to prepare for full-scale development and a number of producers. We currently have 20 operated Mississippian producers awaiting completion. So we expect to have a more robust update for you next quarter. However, we did tie in the Bontrager 1-28H in the third quarter with an average 30-day IP rate of 545 BOE per day, including 480 barrels of oil per day. These results continue to support a type curve with a 30-day IP of roughly 300 BOE per day and an EUR of 300,000 to 400,000 BOE, at a cost of $3 million to $3.5 million each per well. Our 545,000 net acres represents many years of drilling inventory for us. We currently estimate that the risked resource potential net to Devon at over 800 million of oil equivalent.","In summary, our 2012 capital program continues to drive strong oil production growth, while simultaneously evaluating a wide range of exploration prospects.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will take you through a brief review of our third quarter results and the impact on our outlook for the upcoming quarter. The first item I will cover is production. Our third quarter production totaled 62.4 million oil equivalent barrels or 678,000 BOE per day. This represents a 3% increase compared to the same period last year. The oil side of our business delivered most of our year-over-year growth, outpacing the decline in natural gas. In total, oil production increased 14% over the third quarter of 2011 to an average of 143,000 barrels per day, once again strong year-over-year growth in our Permian and Jackfish project areas drove the performance.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue growing our oil with average daily production approaching 150,000 barrels per day. This implies 2012 oil production growth of almost 20% over last year. We expect to achieve this in spite of the impact from the Jackfish 1 turnaround of about 10,000 barrels per day and the delays in the ramp-up of Jackfish 2 that Dave discussed.","On the gas side, downtime at third-party facilities during the fourth quarter, the impact of the 2011 Cana drilling program that Dave discussed and the underperformance of a Cotton Valley Taylor development program that we are no longer pursuing, will result in a decline in our fourth quarter natural gas production of about 3% compared to third quarter.","Net-net, we now expect company-wide production of oil, gas and NGLs to be essentially flat with this year's third quarter at 670,000 to 680,000 BOE per day.","Now for a brief review of our revenues. In the third quarter, production growth along with improved Canadian heavy oil realizations and higher natural gas prices drove our upstream revenue up by 7% over the prior quarter to $1.7 billion. In aggregate, oil sales, not including NGLs, once again accounted for more than 50% of our total upstream revenue in the quarter, while revenue from methane continues to be minimal at just 4% of total sales.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect regional price differentials to be generally in line with our previous guidance, with a couple of notable exceptions. Better pipeline availability and increased demand for heavier crudes during the first half of the fourth quarter resulted in much lower differentials. We are back in a season of heavy refinery maintenance and downtime and the supply of heavy crude is up, so differentials have temporarily widened again. However, the average fourth quarter realizations will still be better than previously forecasted. We now expect our fourth quarter oil price realizations in Canada to range between 64% and 74% of WTI.","For natural gas liquids, high inventory levels at Mont Belvieu, along with continued growth in NGL supplies, continue to put pressure on NGL realizations. We expect fourth quarter realizations to range from 29% to 34% of WTI.","Looking briefly at the impact of our hedges. In the third quarter, our hedge position delivered cash settlements of $243 million. In total, these cash settlements enhanced our average realized prices by $3.89 per BOE, an uplift of 14% to company-wide realizations. For the fourth quarter, we have approximately 90% of our forecasted oil production locked in with a weighted average floor price of $96 per barrel. We also have more than 80% of our expected gas production in Q4 hedged at a protected price of $3.64.","John mentioned earlier that the recent upward movement in natural gas prices has provided us with a good opportunity to add attractive hedges for next year. For the full year of 2013, we now have roughly 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas hedged with both swaps and costless collars. Of this amount, 518 million cubic feet per day is swapped at an average price of $4.19 per Mcf. The remainder is collared at a ceiling price of $4.33 per Mcf and a floor of $3.53.","These gas hedges, coupled with our 2013 oil hedges of 76,000 barrels per day at a protected price of nearly $97 per barrel, provide a good foundation on the hedging front for next year. For more details on our hedging positions, please visit the guidance section of our website that Vince referenced earlier.","Turning now to our midstream business. Our marketing and midstream unit generated $109 million of operating profit in the third quarter, enhancing our company-wide margins by $1.75 per BOE. Improved gas prices and cost containment efforts help us reach the top end of our guidance range. These solid results were also aided by the resumption of our operations at our Gulf Coast Fractionators facility in Mont Belvieu, following the completion of a recent plant expansion. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our midstream operating profit to range between $90 million and $110 million.","Shifting now to expenses. As John said earlier, we continue to do a good job of controlling costs. In the third quarter, expenses in several categories were lower than guidance, most notably LOE and G&A. In aggregate, our pretax cost were $14.04 per BOE, about 2% lower than last quarter. This is an especially positive result considering our continued focus on higher margin, the higher cost of oil production and the negative volume impact on the quarter of the Jackfish turnaround. Our scale in core operating regions and consistent focus on cost management allow us to maintain one of the most competitive cost structures in the industry.","Moving now to DD&A expense. Our third quarter DD&A expense was $716 million or $11.46 per BOE, right in line with our expectations. Looking forward, given the weakness of natural gas and NGL prices over the past 12 months, there's a chance for an additional but much smaller impairment charge in the fourth quarter. Should this occur, our fourth quarter DD&A rate would not be impacted. For Q4, we now anticipate our DD&A rate to be between $11.30 and $11.50 per BOE.","Cutting to the bottom line. As John mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings, which exclude the asset impairment charge and other items that analyst generally do not attempt to forecast were $0.88 per share, $0.19 higher than the Street's mean estimate. Stronger-than-expected price realizations and lower pretax cash costs were the key drivers of the beat. This level of earnings translated into cash flow per share of $3.01, exceeding the Street's expectations by 7%.","Before we open the call to Q&A, I will conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial position. During the third quarter, our operating cash flow approached $1.4 billion. When you combine that with more than $500 million of proceeds from closing the Sumitomo joint venture and other minor asset sales, our cash inflows for the quarter totaled $1.9 billion. This cash allowed us to comfortably fund a robust capital program while maintaining excellent financial strength. As mentioned earlier, we exited September with a net debt-to-adjusted cap ratio of only 15%, and one of the best liquidity positions in the E&P sector with cash and short-term investments of $7.5 billion. While Devon clearly possesses a great deal of financial strength and flexibility, we are fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our per share growth and cash flow adjusted for debt.","So with that, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?","Vincent W. White","Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wonder if I could ask you, I don't know if you're going to be able to provide a lot of detail on this, but the rig allocation that you have currently, I wonder if you could maybe give us a quick summary as to where you are now. But more importantly, given John's comments about spending being substantially lower next year, I wonder if you could give us an early stear as to how you expect activity to be allocated across your plays next year. Obviously, I'm anticipating it's 100% on liquids again, given the new acreage areas and the success you've had. I'm just trying to get an idea as to how that's going to shake out. And I have got a follow-up, please.","David A. Hager","Sure, Doug. This is Dave Hager. I'll give you an idea for where the rigs are right now and where they'll be next year. It will be just a summary comment before I go into all the numbers. I wouldn't expect a great deal of difference, but we are going to continue to ramp up the Permian activity next year. We're going to be very active in the Mississippian next year. So we have 2 very high-quality oil plays there, and we're going to -- you will see some increases there. But everything else I think would be fairly static with where we are. But to complete the picture for where we are right now, we currently have 20 rigs working in the Permian. Of those 20, about 9 are working in the Bone Springs and Delaware plays, about 5 in the Wolfcamp Shale and the Cline Shale combined, 3 in the Wolfberry and 3 in the Central Basin Platform. We have 10 rigs working in the Barnett, 7 rigs working in Cana, and we'll probably ramp that back up a little bit more next year also. Mississippian, as we said, we have 13 rigs working there. We have a total of 7 rigs working in what we call our southern division, and that includes the work we're currently finishing up in Ohio and Michigan, 3 doing Canadian exploration, 3 doing Granite Wash, and we had mentioned, we're going to be going up to 4 rigs there with the success of our Hogshooter program. 4 in the Rockies, 1 in Lloydminster and 1 other doing conventional work in Canada, for a total of 69 rigs.","John Richels","And Doug, it's John. Just let me put a little bit more color around what Dave said and reflect back to what I was saying earlier. We are going to be cutting back. We do expect our 2013 CapEx program to be cut back but because of the impact of the JVs and the additional capital that comes from those joint ventures, our activity levels, as Dave said, will stay pretty high.","David A. Hager","And the substantial part of the cutback is going to be on the leasehold side, not the drilling side. So we're going to be very active on the drilling side.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. I appreciate that detail. I guess my follow-up is kind of related, and it really comes then to capital allocation and how you think about this very long term. Some of your competitors have talked about they are prepared to allow gas production to slide next year. I'm thinking specifically of EOG and Chesapeake. And on the other hand, if we look at where you're allocating capital outside of the U.S., and obviously, the lower 48 is going pretty well, but Canadian differentials continue to be under pressure and if you listen to what the refiners are saying, they're anticipating that is going to stay that way for quite a while. So I'm just kind of wondering as to now that you -- you've had the exploration success in the lower 48, how do you see balancing capital between Canada, particularly longer term on Pike relative to accelerating the lower 48 until things shake out in terms of where those differentials are going to be because obviously, it's a number we are trying to get our heads around to what is sustainable going forward by way of differentials?","John Richels","Well, Doug, in Canada, as you are probably aware, we are not spending a large amount or not allocating a large amount of our capital into areas -- into the conventional. We had very little activity there. And so almost all of our expenditures in Canada have been towards these heavy oil projects. And as you know, they are very, very long term in nature. So for example, Jackfish 3, I think Dave mentioned, we're about 47% completed or 45% completed on that. That's going to continue over the next couple of years. And as we move into Pike, we'll do our detailed engineering and won't even start that for over a year. And so we're really taking a much, much longer view on that than where the differentials may be over the next couple of years. So I think that we're pretty committed to that program in Canada. We really think that the heavy oil program in Canada -- we really think that Pike and Jackfish are in a very, very good part of the Oil Sands where we can have very good results over time. We will continue to allocate some significant funding to that.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Then on gas drilling, on the production network, if you can care to give a few words about that.","John Richels","Yes, and on the gas side, yes, we're really focusing on the higher-margin products. And so where we're drilling gas, we're drilling liquids-rich gas, trying to drill in the areas where those liquids are -- the ones that are providing the best returns. And if that drops off our gas a little bit, then we're not -- that doesn't concern us.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler from Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Probably a bit early to be asking this with the election just behind us, but can you give us kind of latest thoughts or kind of plans with respect to repatriation of capital? And maybe even in the past, you've talked about divestitures of this Canadian assets that it sounds like you might be moving to development programs. So color on both of those would be very helpful.","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Well, Dave, this is Jeff Agosta. I'll take a crack at the first one there about the repatriation. As we've said repeatedly that we will wait to see how the legislation process plays out. I think that it's prudent to see how any compromise gets made with Congress and the Administration on the tax front. So we're still hopeful that we get some rational tax legislation out of our government, and it's prudent to wait. And I think it's also important to note that our financial flexibility is not at all impeded by that. We're able to borrow in the current short-term markets at very attractive rates. So it just makes sense to wait it out.","John Richels","And on the other side, Dave -- on your other question, we've been -- we're very open to everything that's going to create value. I think we always we have been. We've never been shy about that. We've taken some bold moves, and so we're always looking at ways to increase value. So I can't tell you anything specific, but we're looking at all of our assets and making sure that we manage them in a way that over time creates the most value.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. I appreciate that. And then this kind of follows up, and Jeff maybe touched on it a little bit, but thoughts with respect to cash outflows in terms of either providing increased dividends or share buybacks or -- going to have to think about that relative to legislation and use of capital.","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Dave, we've been very consistent over the past, I don't know, 8, 10 years of increasing our dividend and being very shareholder-friendly through buying back 20% of our outstanding stocks since 2004. We've consistently raised the dividend every year with the exception during the financial crisis in 2009 and 2010 when we were going through our repositioning, and we will continue to look at that. All with the view toward maximizing cash flow per share adjusted for debt.","Vincent W. White","Yes, Dave, this is Vince. I might add that really, the thoughts around the share repurchases are undertaken in conjunction with our capital budgeting process, which is currently underway.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Tameron from Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys talk about -- at the Analyst Day you laid out the 5-year CAGR, 6% to 8%. Can you talk about any change given -- I  know there's been some temporary disruptions, but given some of the disruptions of the production this year, can you -- any change to that longer term?","Vincent W. White","David, I think you're referring to the Analyst Day, we gave an illustration of what our assets could do under a specific set of assumptions. Those assumptions included price outlook, price realizations relative to benchmarks and the performance of our assets. If you look at things that have changed since that date, we've got NGLs, and our expectations for NGLs as a percentage of WTI have come down. I think gas prices have probably ticked up a little bit. Oil prices are a little weaker. And the changes to our portfolio, we've seen the delay in Jackfish ramp-up, should not affect the multiyear period, and we've also seen some good progress and derisking in some of our major oil plays. So all those things go into the mix. I mean ultimately, how much we grow top line depends on how much capital we spend, and we're always trying to optimize the per share growth, not the top line growth, and it's a continually evolving picture.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Okay, and let me follow up, let me go completely unrelated. In the Cline Shale, can you talk about where -- I know you're drilling on that Eastern Shelf, if you will. I assume that's where the Cline Shale -- can you say specifically what area of that acreage you're targeting? And the 5 horizontals you mentioned that are in various stages, can you just talk about where those have been drilled? What counties?","David A. Hager","Sure. The plan is to get a good representation of wells across our entire acreage position so we can evaluate it all. The first 3 wells that we have drilled have been located in Sterling County. Since that time, we have actually gone up and drilled a Mississippian well that I mentioned up in Fisher County where we have quite a bit of acreage as well. And we have a couple wells that we're currently drilling and completing in Mitchell and Nolan County as well. And so if you look at our acreage position, it is -- those are the 4 main counties where we have, at Sterling, Mithcell, Nolan and Fisher, with a little bit in Scurry County as well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the county acreage portion of your CapEx budget, how much is that now up to for 2012? Do you see and\/or expect additional joint ventures to offset at some point some of that? And as we look ahead to next year, it seems like over the last couple of years, there have been a number of upward revisions to your budget for the purposes of acquiring acreage, is there anything different now in terms of thinking about a year from now having a budget that is meaningfully down versus first of 2012?","Vincent W. White","Brian, this is Vince. I'll take the first part of the question. The acreage spend this year is about $1 billion before any recovery through the JVs, that's the gross number. Year-to -- that's through the first 9 months of the year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then there will be another $200 million coming in the fourth quarter, so $1.1 billion -- $1.2 billion?","David A. Hager","Well, we've recovered about $1.3 billion upfront from the 2 JVs this year.","Vincent W. White","No, his question was the incremental spend. We've spent $1 billion in the first 9 months, we've said another $200 million in Q4, is that a fair estimate?","David A. Hager","That's correct.","John Richels","Brian, on the joint ventures, we are developing some additional areas, if they're right for it. I mean, these joint ventures have been very good for us, and we hope good for our partners, and it's something that we will continue to be open to. It certainly improves our capital efficiency. It's something that we would do, and we have allocated a lot to capital or to leasehold over the last couple of years. And when you think about it, as we got out of the international and deepwater and moved onshore, we always said that we would take some of those funds. And I think we got a good return on our investments internationally and in the Gulf of Mexico. And we said we'd take some of those funds and reinvest them in a project onshore to continue to build a good inventory of future growth, particularly on the oil side, and that's what we've been trying to do. So I think it's been a judicious reallocation of proceeds of those dispositions. And now we have a pretty big asset base when you think about it, and we're pretty excited about a number of the areas and optimistic about the number of these areas, not the least of which is the Mississippian and the Cline and some of the things that we're doing in the Rockies. So we've got a lot of running room right now.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And I guess going to Canada and in Jackfish, with the 2 wells or the 2 pads that are kind of having issues, are you confident that, that is just isolated to those 2 areas, or do you see any wider implication for either of the pads that you're drilling or kind of thinking about some of the other leases like Pike?","David A. Hager","We're very confident we understand now what the issues are that created this. And really, you could see it on the logs that there was some interbedded nature to the logs. What was not fully understood until we started producing. And remember, these pads were originally designed and approved from a regulatory standpoint 4 to 5 years ago when -- what was not fully understood is just what were the impact of this interbedded sands and shale have on the initial steam chamber development. So we're confident now. We understand that. We've seen this. We've actually observed it with not only here, but at Jackfish and some other industry projects in the same area. So the fact that this happened, we understand the nature. We're confident we can overcome this. The reserves are there. We're still going to get all the reserves? There's just a delay on these pads and getting the production up to full speed, and we know how to place future pads to avoid these issues.","Jeffrey A. Agosta","And one other thing, Brian, I'll just throw in to what Dave has said is it's important to understand that as we drill additional couple of well pads, all we're doing is moving that capital forward. We're not adding a bunch of capital, and that's because over time we do believe that we'll recover all of the reserves in these first 2 well pads. So it's not like we're adding a bunch more wells, we're just moving them forward.","David A. Hager","And I'd like to add we're very confident still that Jackfish and the Pike areas are really top tier projects. If there was as a mistake that was made, it's just we didn't add enough spare wells initially to make sure that the plant was full. But from a geological perspective, there is no question these are top tier reservoirs in the best part of the SAGD development.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","A question, and this is maybe for Dave. On the LOE coming in lower than expected, is there room for that to continue to go lower, or is it projected to bounce back up? I note that you didn't change your guidance on the LOE, but you can just talk about in general terms?","David A. Hager","I would not expect the LOE to go lower. We are very proud of our performance on LOE because even as we're making the shift to a higher oil percentage as part of our overall production, everybody knows that oil is more expensive to operate than natural gas. And so the fact that we've been able to really mitigate the impact of that through our LOE is good. But because we are continuing to shift to more oil as a higher percentage of our production, I wouldn't anticipate it going lower on a per barrel basis. But we -- it's something we work every day, and we think we're pretty darn good at.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. That's exactly the detail I was looking for. And then the second question, this goes back to Jackfish a bit. As I look back in my notes from the Analyst Day, I think back then you're expecting to go post-payout in late '12 and that's now shifted into '13, and I guess that would make sense because oil prices are a little lower, have been lower than they were then. But does that then give you a little bit higher oil take in Q4 because of that? Or is that even a meaningful piece that we should think about?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","No, we were expecting Brandon -- we were expecting payout -- I'm sorry Charles, we were expecting payout in at right around year end. And so it really doesn't have an impact on fourth quarter expected oil production. And now we expect it to be some point in the first quarter, not exactly sure when. It will depend on oil prices.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Christensen from Buckingham Research.","Robert L. Christensen - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","First question is on a few of the structural things that hurt Canadian differentials and pipeline projects, are you optimistic about more Canadian pipeline projects, Enbridge and Keystone, working in your favor of the next couple of quarters, years? I mean, what intelligence do you have that, that's happening? And then I guess on the demand side, the upper Midwest refineries, are those enlarging, expanding on schedule to close differentials?","Darryl G. Smette","Bob, this is Darryl Smette. Yes, obviously, as we went through this year, we had supply of heavy oil and pipeline capacity, refining capacity pretty well in balance, actually had a little bit more pipeline capacity and refining capacity than we had supply where we had a number of unplanned outages both in terms of refineries and pipelines in the second and third quarter that widened those differentials. They really started to improve in September as some of that unplanned outage come back on in some of the pipeline capacity come back on. So differential, as Jeff mentioned there, starting in September, and there pretty significantly through September, October and into the first part of November. As we got to the middle of November, we have both in the U.S. and Canada about 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity that has went down for turnaround. And so we have again seeing those differentials widened about $10 to $12 a barrel. That refinery maintenance should be completed sometime early in the first part of the first quarter of next year, so we should get that refinery capacity back. In addition to that, we have 2 refineries that are coming onstream, one in December, a Marathon refinery in Detroit is going to bring about 80,000 to 90,000 barrel additional refining capacity. So that's coming on, and then the Whiting Refinery that's converting to heavy oil should be on sometime in the second quarter. That's about 250,000 to 270,000 barrels a day of capacity. So although we're seeing some increase in production in heavy oil, the increase in pipeline refining capacity is actually exceeding what we're seeing in production. So we do think as we get through the first quarter, we will start to see some downward pressure on those differentials. In addition to that, we are actually seeing an increase in rail activity out of Canada. It's actually increased from about 800 rail cars a day up to about 1,100 to 1,200 rail cars today. A lot of that oil is being railed to the west coast and the east coast they is close in that going to the Mid-Continent so we have a combination of things that are looking better as we get through the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year as we get in the second quarter of 2013 and beyond, start to look a lot better.","Robert L. Christensen - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And my second question is -- maybe Vince answers, I don't know, Jeff answers, the cash flow per debt adjusted share, do you have that calculation for the third quarter versus a year ago? Has it been growing, that metric, has it been improving?","Vincent W. White","We're -- first of all, I don't have it in my fingertips. We do monitor that, and the prices have a huge impact over the short term, as well as our product allocation, but I can't give you that comparison right off.","Jeffrey A. Agosta","I would say yes, that due to product prices being much lower in the third quarter of this year than they were last year, it has probably gone down for us and the industry.","Vincent W. White","We've run past the top of the hour, so we're going to respect your time and cut the call off. And as usual, we'll be around the rest of the day. The IR staff will be available to answer any follow-up questions. So thanks for your participation.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations.","Sir, you may begin.","Howard J. Thill - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you, Melissa, and I'd like to wish everyone a good morning as well and welcome you to Devon Energy's third quarter earnings conference call. Hope you've had a chance to review our first quarter earnings release, which includes our forward-looking guidance as well as our detailed ops report.","Also on the call today are Dave Hager, President and CEO, Tony Vaughn, Chief Operating Officer, Tom Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and a few other members of our senior management team.","Finally, I'll remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call will contain forecast plans, expectations, and estimates which are forward-looking statements under US securities law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results might differ materially. For a review of risk factors relating to these statements, please see our Form 10-K.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dave.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone. There is no question that low commodity prices in the first quarter led to tough conditions for Devon and the industry. However, we responded to these challenges by delivering another outstanding operating performance as we continue to take the appropriate steps to deliver significant cost reductions and accelerate efficiency gains across our portfolio.","These successful efforts resulted in us delivering production at the high end of our guidance, driving down both operating costs and G&A down more than 20% year-over-year, and increasing our liquidity to $4.6 billion. This strong execution has improved our full year 2016 outlook with us raising our 2016 production targets by 3%; importantly, without any incremental capital requirements.","Additionally, our cost saving initiatives are well on their way to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow during the year, and commodity prices are running above our base budgeting expectations. Even with a meaningful increase in commodity prices from first quarter lows, our disciplined approach to this environment remains unchanged.","Our top priority is to protect our balance sheet strength by balancing spending requirements with cash flow, and we see no compelling reason to accelerate production at these improved yet still low pricing points. As I touched on earlier, our 2016 E&P capital program remains unchanged and the activity we'll deploy is designed to maximize cash flow generation and maintain operational continuity in our top resource plays.","For us, to consider adding additional activity, we would need to make additional progress on our asset sales, have the ability to hedge at sustainably higher commodity prices, and have comfort that we can secure services and supplies at rationale costs. When these conditions are met, we have no shortage of attractive investment opportunities across our resource-rich portfolio.","Our core assets are concentrated in North America's best basins, and we are getting the most out of these assets with best-in-class execution that has consistently exceeded peer results through higher production rates, lower capital costs, and reduced operating expenses.","While there are several variables to consider when allocating capital, it is likely that we would initially accelerate activity with our top two franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin. Between these two world-class resource plays, we have access to over 1 million net acres and thousands of low-risk development opportunities that are delivering rates of return that rank among the very top of our asset portfolio.","Another strategic imperative for Devon in 2016 is the work we're doing to improve our financial strength through the monetization of $2 billion to $3 billion of non-core assets. In April, we took an important step towards that goal with the announced sale of our Mississippian assets in northern Oklahoma for $200 million.","The data rooms for our remaining non-core upstream assets have been open since early March, and bids are expected by the end of the second quarter. The interest in our Midland, east Texas, and Granite Wash asset packages has been quite strong, and we have great confidence in our ability to sell these assets at attractive prices in 2016.","In Canada, we're also making progress toward the sale of our 50% interest in Access Pipeline. Negotiations are ongoing with discussions centered on contract related considerations. Given the multi-decade lifespan of heavy oil assets, it is important that we judiciously work through these contractual details to ensure both parties are comfortable with the long-term relationship. Overall, we are encouraged by the direction of these conversations, and we still expect to announce a transaction in the first half of this year.","Before we move to Q&A, I want to summarize a few key messages from today's call. Even with the recent uptick in pricing, our top priority remains unchanged \u2013 maintain a strong balance. We are committed to balancing capital requirements with cash flow and enhancing our financial strengths by utilizing upstream asset sale proceeds to reduce debt.","We are laser-focused on the controllable aspects of our business. This is evidenced by our outstanding operational performance in the first quarter and our continued cost control efforts. We have taken aggressive actions to position Devon not only to weather this downturn but to be positioned to take advantage of our world-class resource plays when market conditions incentivize higher activity levels.","And as commodity prices recover, Devon has significant leverage to rising oil, natural gas and NGL prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a Boe basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually. Additionally, this $1 increase in realized price proportionately expands Devon's margins more than nearly every large producer in North America. Couple this with a catalyst-rich deleveraging of the balance sheet from the asset sales and upside from further delineation of the STACK play, Devon is extremely well-positioned for differential stock price performance.","With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A.","Howard J. Thill - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Dave. To ensure that we get as many people as possible on the call, we'd ask you to please limit yourself to one question with an associated follow-up. You may re-prompt to ask additional questions as time permits.","With that, Melissa, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question is from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, I just wanted to start with the STACK update. You've said that the results are bigger, they're oilier and the down-spacing is more interesting, but, obviously, you're capital constrained in terms of the amount of cash that you can put there until perhaps the disposals are executed. So maybe just give us a sense of the type of news flow that you might be able to generate in terms of those three aspects, particularly EURs and down-spacing over the course of this year. Thank you.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","I think Tony Vaughn is going to take a stab at this, Ed.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning, Ed. As we continue to work our footprint in the STACK play, we overwhelmingly have a positive feel about the results that we see. And I think the operating report that we published last night continues to show that our results are above type curve expectations.","The interesting thing about this, with a lot of rock and fluid and pressure variability across the play, in fact, Ed, the whole play is working from the far northeast to the southwest really well. But there's a lot of different characteristics of the play that are changing across that footprint. And if you look at the results that we've had just in the Devon footprint, our range of results have been very tight. Our P10 to P90 ratio is about 2.4, which is very indicative of a lower-risk development-type play.","So, I think as we go forward, we'll continue to see optimization of our completion designs. We're changing the fluids, we're changing the proppant loads, we're changing the number of stages and tightening up on the per-cluster spacing, just like a lot of people in the industry are doing. So that will continue to optimize our results.","We're also engaged in about six different pilots across our footprint, and four of those are being operated by Devon. We already have production data coming at us on two of those pilots that we commented on in the operations report. It's early, but the early indications are on a fairly conservative spacing on a single zone of five wells per section, which we're testing in the Alma, we didn't see interference on the frac work that we were doing.","All the well rates are coming into the type curve if not better. We published a little bit of early information on the Born Free test, which was a staggered type test in the Meramec, and very positive there that we did not see the energy cross from one interval to the next. And ultimately, that would be spaced at about six wells per common zone, potentially 13 in the two that we're testing there. And we also have two additional pilots that we'll test seven and eight wells per section in a common interval.","So I think, as the data flow comes in throughout the year, we'll get more information about spacing. We're participating in some other pilots from some of our non-operated partners there. They'll have information coming in. So, really, for the second half of 2016, I think that spacing question will start being a lot more clear. I think you'll continue to see our performance improve as we optimize the work that we do. But, right now, we're extremely pleased. And as you know, if you look at the location count there, it's just very deep for Devon. And this will be a driver for Devon's future for a long time.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then a quick follow-up on the disposals. The commodity prices have picked up. Has that changed the attitude from buyers, particularly perhaps on the E&P side?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, Tom Mitchell can give you some more details on this. But I can tell you we're very pleased with where we are right now with the process. All indications have been positive so far. We're still in the middle of the process, but we're very confident of our ability to deliver in the range that we have put out there of the $2 billion to $3 billion. Tom, add to that?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Devon Energy Corp.","Not a lot to add to that, Ed. It has been very \u2013 a lot of interest in the process, even more than we had expected and from strong parties, parties that are good for the money. So the commodity price environment has worked in our favor in that regard as well as the liquidity events that we had earlier in the year. So we're well positioned, I think, to do extremely well with the trades.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. A follow up on the question specifically, maybe I missed it but, for shorthand, did you put out a EUR in the over pressured oil window?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Subash, I think we've got a type curve, I'm looking for it right now, that we commented on at the time we acquired the Felix footprint. And we actually had two different type curves, one in the volatile oil window and one in the oil window. Roughly speaking, they're about \u2013 initial rates of about 1,500 Boes per day with an EUR of about 1,400 MBoes.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. I can go back and take a look. My follow-up is the Q2 decline and, I guess, as we come off of Q1 production, basin by basin, a little bit more flavor, if you could, on where you expect to see it. And Canada has been surprisingly strong. I assume there was no royalty benefit, so how you see Canada performing for the rest of the year?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah. To give you an idea, we are seeing quarter-over-quarter oil decline here from our core oil of about 25,000 barrels a day. But I think the most important thing to understand is that when you look out for the second half of the year, we expect our oil production to be flat to slightly higher than the Q2 production as our completion activity resumes in the Eagle Ford and our Jackfish 2 facility ramps up to nameplate capacity. So it is a \u2013 and obviously, overall, we raised our production guidance, and so, overall, it's a very positive story.","We may be seeing a slightly higher decline in Q2 than some of you may have expected just mainly because we have such high rate wells that we delivered, particularly in the Eagle Ford, in the last half of 2015 and with the lack of completion activity here earlier in the year as the completion crews left the field.","But, overall, it's a very positive story. I think it may just have surprised a couple people that we're taking it in the second quarter. But the good news is, as commodity prices improve, hopefully, in the second half of the year, given that we raised our overall guidance, we'd be producing more than what was originally anticipated in the second half when prices will be higher.","So, Tony, do you want to add some more detail to that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, just I think you said it well, Dave. Subash, if you go from Q1 to Q2, Dave commented that our total decline on oil will be about 25,000 barrels of oil per day. We actually have a turnaround schedule for Jackfish 2 in the second quarter, which will account for about 10,000 BOs per day. But if you look at the Delaware Basin and the STACK position on oil production, they're essentially flat over the last portion of the year, the second half of the year.","So, as Dave mentioned, it's a positive story for the company. I think if you look and specifically talk about the Eagle Ford, you'll notice that we had outstanding results in the second half of 2014 and that carried into Q1 of 2015. I'm sorry. Second half of 2015 that carried into the first quarter of 2016. And if you go back and look at that, the pace of activity was about 50 IDs to 55 IDs per quarter. The number of wells we brought on in Q1 of 2016 was only 22 wells, and that happened to be early in the quarter.","So, we ramped down activity along with working that work with a partner there. So, the Eagle Ford has taken a larger \u2013 projected to take a larger drop from Q1 of 2016 to Q2 of 2016. But, again, as we bring \u2013 we've taken a completion holiday there as we bring completion units back into the field in the latter part of Q2, we'll see that production stabilize from Q2 through Q4 in the Eagle Ford. Month to month, it's going to be pretty cyclical just depending on the pace of new wells that we bring on.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Let me just follow up on the prior question on the production profile as it relates to the Eagle Ford. How many of the 90 DUC inventory do you expect to complete from June until year-end?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","In the Eagle Ford, as I mentioned, we were completing about 50 wells to 55 wells per quarter. In Q1, it's about 22 wells and we'll take a holiday through Q2 of no new wells brought on in Q2, but then we'll see, roughly speaking, about 35 wells and about 15 wells in Q3 and Q4. So it's really lumpy. We've got two drilling rigs working in the field. And as we build up a little bit of inventory there, we will tend to work that down with one to one and a half frac crews and maintain a fairly flat DUC inventory from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, just be a little bit lumpy from month to month.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And are those \u2013 those are firm plans with you and your partner? Do they depend upon the crude price or otherwise? I presume not, given your hedges.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","That's our current plan, but I just \u2013 I've got to point out to you that we're \u2013 right now, on the technical side, we're lockstep with BHP. We had the same thought process going forward. So I think that's the plan that we're going to execute on. And of course, if commodity prices change, we've got the ability to be flexible with that.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And what would the production decline from Eagle Ford look like with no additional wells or no additional completions in 2H?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, I think if you look at it, our Q4 to Q4 decline just on the Eagle Ford just on oil is roughly about 30%. That doesn't include a lot of new IDs in the second half of the year. It'll be a little bit more than that. And I think we published in the past that our first year decline on Eagle Ford wells is very high. It's above 50% per year first and second year decline. So, as I mentioned, we had an aggressive activity schedule through 2015 and without continuing that pace of activity, we're just seeing a lot of fairly young immature wells in the high portion of their decline come on right now, and we're not having the new IDs to maintain that total flow rate.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","What Tony described to you as a first year decline rate of 50% for new wells and you would have a number of wells that are not on their first year of production. They'd be in the latter part of the decline curve. And so your number would be probably a little bit less than that on an overall basis.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, guys. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dave, you've talked in the past about \u2013 it's that horrible question about when do you go back to work. But you guys have been a little more specific about requiring the asset sales to be done pretty much irrespective of where the oil price goes. So I just wonder if I could ask you to kind of revisit your thoughts there. And obviously, it's all predicated on your confidence level in getting the asset sales done. So, do you go back to work in an oil price recovery before the asset sales are done or do the asset sales still have to come first?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","The asset sales still have to come first. And now, having said that, I recognize this is a show-me environment, and we understand that very well. But I reiterate our confidence in the asset sales that we are going to get those asset sales executed. Without going into a tremendous amount of detail of the discussions and negotiations, we think that that is something that is working very positively, and we're confident that we're going to get those done in the timeframe that we described. But that is the first priority is to make sure that we do that.","After that, then there are a number of things we'll factor in to increasing our activities; commodity prices, capital costs, operating expenses, many more. But, directionally, you could look for us to start adding incremental activity when oil prices are $50 or higher. Now, that doesn't mean we go back from the two operated rigs to 20 operated rigs immediately at $50. That means we would start adding operated rigs at that point. I said during the comments that the most likely first place that we would add the rigs would be in the Delaware Basin and then the STACK play where, obviously, well results are just outstanding and amongst the best in the industry in both of those places. And so, we would incrementally add rigs as prices increase.","But it would probably take $60 oil or more to really get back to a capital spend level of close to $2 billion versus the $1 billion we're at now, which would, really, with our maintenance capital sitting somewhere between $1.5 billion or $2 billion, that would allow us to flatten the production. Although, frankly, we're not \u2013 our number one priority is not just flattening the production on a 6:1 conversion rate. We're much more interested in, first, the financial strength of the balance sheet, and then, second, making sure that every dollar that we invest is generating strong economic returns.","And we included a graph in the operations report that gives you a feel that, again, we have some of the \u2013 not only are we in some of the best plays in onshore North America, but we're in the heart of some of the best plays. We're in the core of the core of these plays. So, we certainly have, we think, as good of an economic opportunity as anybody out there. But, again, first, it's going to take the asset sales, second, starting adding rigs at $50, again, a small increment then, and then continuing to ramp up as prices increase into our strong plays.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the full answer, Dave. Thank you. My second one's really a quick follow-up to Evan's question on the Eagle Ford. Obviously, your full year guidance presumably had the production for the trajectory that you've shown for the Eagle Ford baked in already. But you did mention in the prepared remarks or in the release that there was some planned downtime on infrastructure. I don't know if I missed that, but can you quantify what the volume impact is of that downtime in Q2 and whether or not it's meaningful? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, there is a minor amount of planned downtime. It's probably on the order of a little less than 5,000 barrels a day overall, but that is part of the impact as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. Perhaps, Tony, I was wondering if you could comment on just overall well results and returns that you're seeing in the over-pressured versus the normally pressured STACK and perhaps where Devon's well results from an operated and non-operated have been concentrated?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks for the question, Arun. I guess if I had to characterize the results that we're seeing, they're very consistent. If you look at our type curve of about that 1,300 Boes to 1,500 Boes per day, we've brought on about five operated wells and five non-operated wells. All of those are at the type curve or better. The footprint, again, when we look at all of the attributes of the STACK play, the project is working all across the play, but the attributes that describe the subsurface are drastically changing.","And the rock composition changes from the northwest to the southeast, the pressure gradient for the whole play is largely over-pressured. It does tend to increase in pressure as you go to the southwestern portion of the field. And then as you move from the northeast to the southwest, you've got a changing fluid composition. All that's working across the field.","If you look at ours, we're seeing type curve type results very consistently. I think the best completion we've brought on this quarter was about 2,100 Boes per day. So we're feeling pretty good about that. We find that the sweet spot that we've identified in our operating report for the STACK play has got the best combination of all those attributes which incorporate depth and cost to complete. So we think that's going to be the high-return portion of the development right now.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","One of the things we \u2013 what I'd probably just add in here, one of the things we tried to clarify by including a map in the operations report is that it's a gradational amount of over-pressure throughout the play. And there's a map, I think, on page seven that shows it very clearly that, essentially, all of our acreage is located in the over-pressured part of the play. It's just the degree to which it is over-pressured, and the degree to which it's over-pressured increases as you move from northeast to southwest.","Now, as you move further to the northeast in our acreage position, you get more into the normal pressured oil window. That can work too. I think, frankly, Newfield has had some good results up there as well and very economic results. But, essentially, all of our acreage is in the over-pressured part of the window, it's just the degree to which it's over-pressured. So if you look at that map, I think that's helpful.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just my follow-up is I was wondering if you could go through the staggered lateral testing in the Eagle Ford. Just maybe comment on that pilot and expectations going forward to develop the Eagle Ford using that spacing type of pattern.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, we're encouraged. We drilled 25 wells on a staggered approach in the Lower Eagle Ford. We've got a 3D earth model there that the technical team has built, and we got an accurate description of where all the well bores have penetrated. And if you're just staying within the Lower Eagle Ford section, whether you're in the upper portion of that interval or the lower portion of that, the results have all been the same. So we have now incorporated the staggered approach into the Lower Eagle Ford, and results will be coming in on the 25 wells in the next couple of quarters. But early indications are that's extremely favorable.","So, we're seeing reservoir pressures that would indicate that we're not seeing interference or influence from each of those wells. One thing that we're going to be testing in the last three quarters of this year will be how to incorporate the Upper Eagle Ford shale into that development. And there's not a lot of shale barriers between that Upper Eagle Ford and the Lower Eagle Ford section, so we're encouraged and I believe BHP is going to be supportive of this work as to pilot an Upper Eagle Ford shale completion along with our staggered approach in the Lower Eagle Ford. And that will be what we think will be ultimately the design that we will go forward for the remaining development of the resource base.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Hi. One on the STACK. How gradational are the members vertically or how well defined are the various members between the upper and the lower? And will this affect \u2013 given the pressure gradients you've already discussed across your acreage, will you have to have kind of multiple pad development plans depending on where you are?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","John, I think we're getting \u2013 we've got a great description of the surface there, and a lot of it's through the vertical wells that had been drilled, a lot of it on the south end of the field have been through the 800 wells that we drilled in our Cana-Woodford project. But we've got a great earth model that we built. We continue to refine that with new data. I think the guys are very comfortable seeing five individual potential landing zones, three of those in the Upper Meramec, two in the lower. I think the technical team is very confident with that.","A lot of the data to-date has been in what we call the Meramec 200 with some data in the Meramec 300. We think we have that well understood. The portions that I think us and the industry are needing to appraise would be the very upper member of the Meramec, what we call the Meramec 100, and also the lowest member in the Lower Meramec, which is the Meramec 500.","And I think if you look at the pressure distribution across the footprint there, I think it's a gradational map. If you take an isobar map of that, it's nothing where you go from normal pressure to high pressure in a short distance. It's just a gradual trend from east to west. So, I think that's being incorporated. You'll handle that with three-string design on the western side of the field. On the shallow and east side of the field, you'll handle with a two-string design, so it will be a little cheaper activity on the east than the west. But it's nothing that's, I think, onerous in terms of the future development concept.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","John, I guess, just to add on, geologically, if you look at the logs, we have a good handle on where each of these zones has developed. That's not really the issue. The issue is more just how productive are each of these zones, what spacing can you do in each of these zones? And, conceptually, if I can just broaden the discussion just a little bit, to give you guys an idea of what we're doing both in the STACK play and the Delaware Basin, we have so many zones of STACK play in there in both of these areas that we are conducting as many of these pilots as we can early on to assess how to properly develop these areas.","It would be real easy right now to just skip the pilots, go in, drill everything on four wells per section in one zone, produce wells with great rates of return, and then wake up three years from now and you've blown through your inventory. That's not what we're doing. We are taking a much more thoughtful approach of understanding the productivity and the spacing in each of these zones so that we can develop each of these areas rather than what may be \u2013 and I'm talking very conceptually here \u2013 what may be instead of four wells to five wells per section in single zone, you could have many more wells per section, perhaps 20 wells, 25 wells, 30 wells per section after you understand the proper spacing in each of these intervals and how many of these you can develop within the same area.","And so that's why it's, we think, is appropriate at this time of lower activity to really do these spacing tests and really understand, because it has a huge impact on the ultimate resource that's going to be recovered in each of these plays and on the value associated with each of these plays. And so that's conceptually where we're trying to go with all these tests.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thanks. That's what I was hoping to hear. My next question is on Canada. Obviously, Jackfish 2 turning around, but with the fires do you anticipate having any issues with what's going on in Fort McMurray now? And that's it for me.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","John, I think just got a report from our operating team last day, and most of the activity that you're talking about is north of Fort McMurray, so there's nothing that we're worried about. We watch it every summer and it's been a dry spring, so that area has tuned into it, and we have turnaround scheduled again in June of this year, so we'll make sure that we're free and clear before we start that activity","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. If I could ask another question on the STACK, I'm curious, after you get your asset sales done, if it would also be an option to perhaps clean up some of the holes in your STACK position. If you look at it, you guys are having great results there and I have to imagine that some of those holes in your footprint have to be more valuable to you than they'd be to other people. So, I guess, I'm asking what would be your appetite for that or is it an opportunity?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Charles, I think that is an opportunity. It's the way all of our technical teams work in these core areas. So, we're continuing to work with some of the offset operators and trying to core up where we can. We like the idea of having the ability to drill longer laterals in all the areas that we work. So we're working with some of our offset partners on more of a holistic scale. We've got a great footprint there, and we've got a lot of running room. So it's not like we need to go out and acquire something of size or materiality, but we will continue to look for opportunities in core just like you mentioned.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Having said that, I want to make clear, Charles, to you and everybody else, we're done with major acquisitions. So what we're talking about here is just trying to core up our acreage in these existing plays, where, as you say, the acreage immediately adjacent to our existing acreage may be more viable to us than others. But as far as major acquisitions, we're done with that.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. So that might take the forum of trades so you can lengthen lateral and share the working interest or something like that.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Absolutely.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. And then if I could ask a question about the Leonard, which I don't think anyone's asked about yet. Could you give us \u2013 so you guys raised your type curve there, and you seem like you're more positive on that than you were a few months ago. Can you put that play in context with the other Delaware Basin plays? I think where my baseline is that the Bone Spring is still the big dog out there followed by the Wolfcamp, but is the Leonard or are the recent results of Leonard changing that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Charles, I think we've reported now on three recent Leonard tests there and we've been extremely happy with that. And you can see this one that we reported on in the operations report is outstanding. It's a two-mile long lateral. It's in the Thistle area. We have, I believe, about 60,000 prospective acres in the Leonard play.","So, in terms of scale, it probably doesn't \u2013 it's not the same magnitude as the 2nd Bone Springs, but in terms of well returns, it's every bit the same thing as the 2nd Bone Springs. And industry has done a really good job of de-risking the Leonard and the Wolfcamp around us. There's been some industry spacing tests that we've got the data on that have helped us understand where we go from here.","Our location camp that we commented on in the past, specifically for the Leonard, has really been directed towards the work that we see in what we call the Leonard B zones. But the A and the C are prospective as well. Industry is actually working in the A and C, and our tests that we commented on have been in the B. So there's the potential to drive the location count up both on a risk and a un-risk basis. And, again, as we start thinking about our development plans to ramp up activity, the Leonard and the 2nd Bone Springs will be at the top of our list in terms of incremental well returns.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful detail. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","One of the points you made that you're looking for to accelerate activity is comfort that you can secure supplies at rationale costs and wanted to see if you could comment on that point. And maybe to try to phrase the question to the degree you were thinking not about $1 billion budget but a $1.5 billion budget, do you think you could execute on that within what you would expect to achieve the returns you're looking for? And what if it were a $2 billion budget, where if anywhere do you see any constraints?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, obviously, the lower the level of incremental activity the more confidence that we have that we can go out and execute at very similar type costs what exists today. And as you probably double the activity, we most likely would be doing that in an environment where we're not the only one that's increasing activity. The rest of the industry would as well and so the ability to do so for the same service costs, given the great reduction that we've seen in service companies in terms of their capability is the availability of services, the availability of people that becomes more challenged.","So I don't think any of us have an absolute answer as to what the implications of that are. But it's just something I can say with great confidence that we'd be assessing very carefully to make sure that we are producing still strong returns on these outstanding assets that we have. So I would anticipate, if we're going to increase from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, there may be some increases associated with that, but they'd probably be much more manageable increases. If we go up to $2 billion, we just have to see. But, again, we're in as good a position as anybody in the industry. This is not a problem that's unique to Devon. This is a problem that's going to exist for everybody as prices recover and service industry attempts to recover and rehire people and retool their industry as well that we're all going to have to be assessing. So, Tony or Darryl, do you guys want to add some more to that?","Darryl G. Smette - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah. This is Darryl. I would say, as we see it right now, the only area where we think if there's a big upturn in activity that would cause us some immediate concerns would be in the stimulation side of the business. We think there's adequate rigs that are available even though they are now stacked but not cannibalized, and we're talking the 1,500 HP rigs. We think there is ample supply of those if we had to double, for example, the industry would double their capital expenditure program.","We think the tubulars are in pretty good shape. While there has been some decrease in the amount of labor that's available, we think, with modest increases, that labor would be back over a period of time, whether that's six months or eight months. The stimulation area is a different animal. Right now, we think that's been cut about 33% in terms of capacity. How long it takes to get that 33% back? We don't know. But that would be the one area that initially would cause us some concern on the cost side of the equation.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's really helpful color. Thank you. My follow-up is on the STACK play. If we think about the changes in pressure regimes, the changes in GORs over a well's life, the strong oil rates that you've shown from at least on an initial production rate basis and your legacy production, how should we expect oil as a percent of the total mix to evolve as we go over the next one to two years?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Brian, I'll tell you, we're watching that pretty close and the STACK play in the Meramec is too young to specifically comment. I will highlight though that all the fluid data that we have seen across the play has been to the optimistic side of our initial interpretation. So, all the new IPs that we're commenting on have oil contents of 60% or greater. We characterize, over the life of this field, that we would see something in the order of about 40%, roughly 40%, 45% oil. I'm not sure how this goes, but we'll have to watch that.","But, so far, across the play, we've been highly encouraged. And I'll tell you that the one anomaly that we've seen has been really testing the far southwest portion of the Meramec there. We've seen oil contents much higher than what we see in the Cana-Woodford, which, really, we haven't talked much about our legacy acreage position in the Woodford. But that really sets that whole couple of hundred thousand acres of ours up for prospective higher yield production in the future. So, really, it's a positive story for the play and specifically for our footprint.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, David. David, is there any scenario under which you don't sell Access? Are we now just at the point of crossing the Ts and dotting the Is on that deal? And is there some alternative, whereby, you would want to keep it? Thanks?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, you're never done until you're done and so it's important to remember here that we're not \u2013 it's not just as simple as perhaps the sale of an E&P asset. We're actually entering into a long-term transportation agreement with the purchaser of this asset. And so, given that, we're establishing a relationship that's going to exist, and we have to make sure that all the provisions in the contract work for both sides.","So that's certainly something that we continue to work through. I can tell you so far that we have been working with a party for quite some time, and we have had additional interest from some other parties as well. So we're very optimistic about where we stand in the overall process with this. It's just a lot of things you have to make sure you get right. And also \u2013 we also have, beyond the tariffs associated with Jackfish itself right now, we obviously have another project sitting up there in the Pike project that we think is as high a quality as the Jackfish project. And this is a project we haven't sanctioned yet, but it's something that perhaps and we'd consider strongly sanctioning in a more normalized commodity price environment.","So that has some bearing on \u2013 and the associated tariffs on that \u2013 on how that would be valued by the potential purchaser. So we're working through all those type things. But I can tell you, discussions are going extremely well on multiple fronts right now. And so, you're never done until you're done, and it's obviously more than just dotting an I and crossing a T, I would say. It's having discussions around some pertinent issues in the contract. But discussions so far have been very, very positive and we still think that it's very realistic to have it done by the end of the first half.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good. Thank you for that. A follow-up which is separate, you mentioned, as you ended your comments, the leverage of Devon to oil prices. Were you talking ex-hedging and can you just go over your hedging strategy again given the way things have changed? Are you intending maybe to carry more leverage to upside in oil prices now or are you going to be aiming for a similar level of protection as you have had previously? Thanks.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, our overall strategy on that, Paul, is unchanged. We target, and it's not an absolute, but we target to be approximately 50% hedged by the point at which we enter any given year. And that's to help underpin the cash flows of the company to give us confidence around the capital spend that we can execute. Now, we have, in historical years, with the exception of coming into 2016, but many other years, we had a very, very successful hedging program. In 2015, as you know, we had well over $2 billion of hedge gains. And so it's a program that's worked very well.","We have added some very attractive Q2 gas hedges now. We have more than 30% of our expected production hedged at around $2.69 per Mcf. And for the remainder of 2016, more than 25% of our oil production is protected primarily through collars with a weighted average ceiling price of $44 and a protective pullover on $39. So, we're going to add, on an opportunistic basis throughout 2016, hedges where we see appropriate.","I can also tell you that we have recently implemented a change where we're going to do a certain level of our hedging program, not the entire program, but a base level of our hedging program on a more programmatic basis, where we will enter in a level of hedges each quarter and we'll probably hedge forward as far as six quarters and do it on a consistent programmatic basis. But we'll still have \u2013 a good portion of the program is going to be done more on an opportunistic basis as we have historically done as well with the overall target to be around 50% hedged as we enter in any given year","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. So, basically, you're retaining that 50% target, you just may change the trading strategy to be more ratable, I guess, to a given extent?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, that \u2013 yeah, a little bit of change. Not a huge change; a little bit. So we're adding some programmatic and a little bit less on the opportunistic side. And, by the way, Paul, on those sensitivities, those are ex-hedges. Those are without hedges.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan from Alembic Global. Your line is open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Just one quick follow-up there on the sensitivities, obviously, so you just clarified that it doesn't include the hedges you guys have laid on, but it does include, I'm assuming, the expense \u2013 the leverage you guys are getting from the expense cuts that you guys have made to-date, I assume, right?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, it would be excluding the hedges that we have layered on. That's correct. And it's really based on the realized price that we are getting.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. So just on a kind of totally different topic, most of the questions have been kind of asked and answered, but what are you guys seeing in the NGL markets? Obviously, you guys have a lot of leverage to that product in the STACK, especially in the whole Cana position and everything. But, obviously, the ethane and propane prices have come back a little bit. Can you just give us your macro thoughts on that overall product category, how you see things going into the second half of 2016 into 2017 with the potential for demand increases?","Darryl G. Smette - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, this is Darryl. And you are exactly right. We have a large component of our production as NGLs, just around 20%. Just some background: about 50% of that is ethane, between 25% and 30% is propane, and the rest are butanes and natural gasoline.","In the macro view, we continue to see that improve, although we still think, in the short-term over the next few months, you're going to see a greater amount of supply than demand. However, that demand is starting to increase as we bring on additional petrochemical plants and we continue to add export capacity via water. That has increased in the last three years from about 200,000 barrels a day, the export capacity, up to about pretty close to 1 million barrels a day.","By the end of this year, early next year, we'll have added another 250,000 barrels a day of export capacity on the water; about half of that is propane, butane and gasolines, about half of that is ethane. So we're starting to see the export opportunities bring supply and demand back into balance, and so we think there's going to be more upward pressure on NGL products over time than we've seen in the last year and a half.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Most have been answered. One final one. On the Barnett, if we were to see a ramp in gas prices, would you \u2013 what would it take to accelerate activity there or would you use that additional cash flow to un-allocate to one of the crude plays?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","David, we look at our entire portfolio. So when we generate incremental cash flow, we look at the entire portfolio. And I would suspect that the entire boat would be lifted. We like the Barnett. We think it's got low-risk opportunities. I think we've commented in the past couple of calls that we really have de-risked and completely understand the vertical re-frac opportunity, and we've got about 30 of the horizontal re-frac opportunities under our belt, and we think we've understood how to do that. We've got a real positive relationship with our EnLink partners there. So we would consider the Barnett. We also have some opportunities in Cana in the drier portion or leaner portion of that property as well that would be just as commercial.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, I get \u2013 okay. Fair enough. Appreciate the answer. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Payne from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","You guys have answered my question on the hedging, but glad to see you're going to be raising that through the rest of the year. Thank you.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you, Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield from GMP Securities. Your line is open.","Derrick Whitfield - GMP Securities LLC","Thank you, and good morning. So, speaking to the STACK Meramec, in your upside case of 14 wells per section on page eight, how many flow units or intervals are you assuming in that density pilot? Is it simply 2, as the chart indicates? And more specifically, is it the Meramec 200 and Meramec 300 intervals?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, it's going to vary. It's a little bit hard to describe. But it depends on where you are in the play as to which of the Meramec zones you're going to develop, because different zones are developed aerially on different parts of the play. And what we're trying to describe in that is whichever is the primary, and it could be the Meramec 200, it could be the Meramec 300, it could be the Meramec 100, whichever the primary testing at eight wells per section. And we're also testing a secondary zone and up to six wells per section. But exactly which interval that is will vary across the play depending on where it's developed geologically.","Derrick Whitfield - GMP Securities LLC","Thanks. And then just order of magnitude, Dave, and I understand it varies with regard to where you are in the play, but how many industry results do we have in the Meramec 100 and Meramec 500? Because that seems to be the least delineated based on your comments?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","I think that's correct. I don't know the exact well count, but we have about 140 data points across industry. We actually have an ownership position in about a hundred of those 140 data points. In fact, we have data in most of the 140 data points. We've operated about \u2013 I think about 30, 35 operations. But, again, it's largely being confined, at this point, to the Meramec 200 and Meramec 300. Order of magnitude, I think, we probably have less than five data points in both the Meramec 100 and the Meramec 500 zones.","Derrick Whitfield - GMP Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamaal Dardar from TPH. Your line is open.","Jamaal Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions were answered, but I just wanted to touch on the Delaware and Wolfcamp. It looks like appraisal drilling will be somewhat limited this year. But just kind of want to think on timing of tests there given some really positive results we've seen, particularly in Lea County. So just wanted to get a sense on your expectations on prospectivity and results in that part of the basin? Thanks.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Jamaal, we have really focused on our work in the 2nd Bone Spring. We continue to find that the 2nd Bone Spring and now the Leonard will be the top incremental returns that we can generate in our portfolio. We really like how industry has de-risked around us, the Wolfcamp. And as you mentioned, it's come up across the Mexico border. We watch all that work.","If you look at the \u2013 or if you consider the future development plan for the STACK column of opportunities, it all hinge on what your outlook is for commodity prices going forward. And so, in the kind of the mid-cycle to low-cycle case, we've got a lot of work to do in the 2nd Bone Spring and the Leonard sands. And as we move from the mid-cycle to the high-cycle, we've got a lot of opportunity in the Wolfcamp that will be incorporated into that. So we're encouraged by the Wolfcamp, we just don't find the commerciality to be as competitive in the Wolfcamp as we do in the Bone Spring and the Leonard.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","But that cycles back to the comment I started to make earlier, just how many different zones that we have here in the Delaware Basin as well as in the STACK play. And what we're trying to do is, get an idea of what the productivity is of each of these zones, what is the optimum spacing in each of these zones, and we're being very thoughtful about our approach to this so that we are fully developing the resource and the value associated with these versus the alternative of just drilling very quickly in one zone and four wells per section or some fairly broad spacing and essentially sub-optimally developing the entire inventory that we have. We're not doing that.","We are being very thoughtful, very careful., because we are sitting on truly world-class resources here in the hearts of some of the best plays and we want to generate as much value as we can long-term from these resources.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Got just one thing to quickly add to that, Dave. We talked to you in the past about the tension and the drive for technical excellence and that has been translated into public data that I think all of you have access to. If you go look at IHS reported information, quarter-to-quarter we've talked about the 90-day IPs that we're generating on our inventory.","It continues to improve and out-compete all of our peer group. If you look at the trend over the last four years, we've gone from kind of a mid-pack performer to 2015 we're number one in terms of 90-day IPs. And that's a combination of the great portfolio that Dave just mentioned, but it's also attributed to the competency of our technical team that we're extremely proud of those results.","Howard J. Thill - Devon Energy Corp.","We are now at the top of the hour, and while we didn't get to every caller, and we apologize for that, we are going to bid you a good day.

This call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you and good morning, everyone.","I hope everyone has had the chance to review our third quarter financial and operational disclosures that were released last night. This data package includes our earnings release, which includes forward-looking guidance, and our detailed operations report.","Also on the call today are: Dave Hager, President and CEO: Tony Vaughn, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Mitchell, Chief Financial Officer; and a few other members of our senior management team.","Also, I would like to remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call today will contain plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially. For a review of risk factors related to these statements, please see our Form 10-K and subsequent 10-Q filings.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you, Scott, and welcome, everyone.","Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drillbit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new wells reaching peak 30-day rates of nearly 2,000 BOE per day. These prolific drilling results were centered in our world-class STACK play, where oil production increased by nearly 40% year over year.","Furthermore, the value of Devon's production continued to be enhanced by substantial cost savings achieved during the quarter. We are now on pace to reduce operating and G&A costs by $1 billion for the full year, which provides an uplift to our margins of nearly $5 per BOE produced.","In addition to our strong operating performance, another important accomplishment for Devon was the recent completion of our $3.2 billion asset divestiture program. These accretive transactions significantly strengthen our investment-grade position. And as a result, our net debt has now declined by 45% since the beginning of the year. To further enhance our financial position going forward, we've also been much more active building out our hedging position with the recent increase in commodity prices.","With a more focused asset base and improved balance sheet, the next step in our strategic plan is to accelerate investment in our world-class onshore resource plays. By the end of next month, we plan to have 10 operated rigs running, focused within our top two franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin.","Looking ahead to 2017, we are still working toward finalizing the details of our operating and capital plans. However, I can tell you that at $55 WTI pricing, our upstream cash flow in 2017, including EnLink distributions, is projected to expand by more than the 100% year over year to around $2.5 billion. Under this scenario, we would steadily ramp up drilling activity over the next several quarters to as many as 15 to 20 operated rigs in the U.S. by year-end 2017. This program would represent upstream capital spending of around $2 billion, allowing us to invest within available cash flow.","On a retained asset basis, this focused investment in higher-margin projects is expected to drive double-digit oil growth in the U.S. in 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, which marks the low point in Devon's production profile. As a result of this growth in oil volumes, top line production of 2017 will range from low to mid-single-digit growth compared to Q4 2016. This range is dependent upon our level of ethane rejection during the year.","Importantly, this capital plan is designed to create operational momentum and much stronger growth rates heading into 2018. At a $60 WTI price point in 2018, our upstream cash flow has the potential to reach $3.5 billion, a greater than 200% increase from today's levels. Under this scenario in 2018, we will continue to aggressively ramp up our drilling programs within the U.S., with the majority of this capital directed toward the STACK and Delaware Basin. This low-risk drilling activity is expected to drive production growth of greater than 30% from our STACK and Delaware Basin assets in 2018. This strong growth would further transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin light oil production in the U.S.","Now I want to be very clear. While we're excited about the outstanding growth prospects that reside within our portfolio, our capital allocation will be focused on value and rates of return, not to pursue top line production growth. And if commodity price volatility continues, our capital programs have significant flexibility, with no long-cycle project commitments and negligible leasehold expiration issues. This flexibility allows us to be nimble and tailor activity to invest directionally within cash flow.","Another strategic imperative for Devon in the upcoming year is to further delineate and better characterize the growing resource base associated with our U.S. resource plays. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of development-ready drilling locations that are highly economic at today's prices.","To advance our understanding of the ultimate recovery and resource potential within these two world-class plays, we have important appraisal work underway. In the STACK, this catalyst-rich activity is concentrated on the Meramec infill spacing pilots and further derisking of the Woodford oil window. In the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale opportunity set continues to expand, and we are now flowing back on our first STACK lateral test that will help shape our view on how to best develop the three prospective landing zones in this oil-rich shale.","2017 will also be a breakout year for our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp program, as we began to actively develop this emerging play. The Wolfcamp will have a material impact to Devon's resource potential in the Delaware, and we are excited about progressing our understanding of the 9,000-plus potential locations we have identified in this play.","The bottom line is that Devon's asset portfolio has never been in better shape than it is today, and I believe that the quality and depth of our opportunity set is unmatched in the industry. We possess thousands of undrilled locations that are extremely well positioned on the North American cost curve. This high rate of return inventory will continue to expand as we derisk the tremendous resource upside associated with our STACK and Delaware Basin assets. With this resource expansion, it could necessitate additional high-grading of our portfolio, monetizing less competitive assets and accelerating the development of our highest rate of return inventory.","So, in summary, before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few key messages from today's call. First, our improved financial positioning now allows us to aggressively accelerate drilling activity across our best-in-class resource plays while continuing to focus on the value and rate of return of each investment. These accelerated drilling plans will drive attractive cash flow growth in 2017 and 2018 compared to today's level, and continue to transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin light oil production in the U.S.","In conjunction with our shift to higher-margin production, do not lose sight of our peer group leading leverage to rising commodity prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a per BOE basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually.","Looking beyond prices, Devon is also catalyst-rich over the next several quarters, as we further delineate the massive resource upside associated with the STACK and Delaware Basin positions. And finally, with the continued growth in the quality and depth of our resource base, we expect to have an overabundance of opportunities. If this is the case, we are very willing to further high-grade our portfolio and deploy additional investment toward the best projects in our portfolio.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott.","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Dave. We will now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up question. If you have further questions, you can reprompt as time permits. With that, operator, we will take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Dave, you mentioned you're evaluating the total inventory as you prepare two core basins to move into development mode in 2017, and that's something that's really supporting a newer 2018 guide here. But the higher-level question, though, is what do you believe the optimal inventory depth should be, maybe on a years of activity basis? It sounds like we should expect a continued rationalization program, if locations grow well beyond those optimal levels. Any thoughts there?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Evan, and that's always a very difficult question to answer exactly. What is the right inventory level? Somewhat akin to the old R-over-P [Reserves-over-Production] ratio we used to talk about for many years. I think you can obviously directionally have so much inventory that you're not maximizing the value of your inventory, or you can have too short of an inventory that there's questions about the long-term growth of the company, so there's certainly a balance point in there.","To name an exact amount of years of inventory is somewhat difficult. I'd say I tend to think probably somewhere on the order of 20 years or so seems about appropriate, but it is certainly a subject that I often actually turn the question back over to some of you guys, to give your feeling. But I can tell you, I'm somewhere in that range, 20 years, 25 years, something like that.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah 15 years, 20 years from our view. A different question on, you provided a year-end 2016 and 2017 rig target levels, or unit levels. I know the board hasn't approved the budget yet. But can you talk about the ramp that's correlated to the move? Is it back-end loaded as you move into development mode, or is it \u2013 what's the ramp pace to the 15 units? And is the five delta something commodity related, or is that maybe asset supported, asset-sales related? Any color there.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Let me walk you through that. So the 10 rigs at year-end 2016 is essentially set, and we are executing that. I think it's important to understand, it's really the 10 rigs plus the completion activity that we are conducting, that's really driving our 2017 volumes. And so that's why we're very excited about the comp on the volumes that we've talked about in the operations report. The ramp up to the 15 to 20 rigs really won't add production in 2017, but that's why we're so excited about 2018 as we do ramp up to that level. That's what's going to provide the even higher growth levels as we move into 2018, led by more than 30% growth in the STACK and the Delaware.","Now the variability around that is really more \u2013 at this point, I'd say more commodity price driven. Although frankly, we do have \u2013 we are committed roughly to live within cash flow. It there's a little bit of variability around that, we're willing to exceed cash flow by a minor amount, perhaps if necessary, supplement with incremental small-scale asset sales. We also, as you know, we've been hedging significantly more, so that's helped underpin and provide more comfort to the cash flows that we'll have in 2017. But the opportunities are there. We're confident that we have the opportunities there. So I'd say the delta is really more commodity price driven than opportunity driven.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","Evan, this is Scott. Just one thing I'd like to add on that too. I would also say it's about productivity as well. If you look at where that capital is going, it's going to be focused in the STACK and Delaware Basin, and those are two of the highest rate of change plays that you're seeing, as far as drilling days and improved completion designs. So I would say that we're getting better and better at that, so that would also have an impact with regards to what that rig ramp would be needed, to deliver the production that we've talked about.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, particularly in the (14:30).","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was trying to say good morning, everybody.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Dave, you've raised the type curves obviously in the STACK, but you have not addressed the issue of the inventory. My recollection is, you were using four wells per section, three upper and one lower, if I recollect. What do you need to see in terms of your density spacing in order to update that backlog, and what's your early thoughts on it, if you can?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Doug, just to be clear, the inventory is going up. There's no question about that. We've had about three successful pilots so far. I think we've tested now one zone up to seven wells per section. That's worked out very well. We have another 10 pilots or so. They're detailed in the operations report, the locations of those pilots. So really it's just a matter of timing, when we feel like we have enough information from each of those pilots to increase the number. But there's no question it's going up. So, Tony, you want to add any details to that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Doug, I think Dave summed it up perfectly. We're working on coming out of 2017 with development in two of our areas central to the work that we've been doing with the pilots. And we've got the detailed data already in-house on the three operated pilots. We're starting to get data in right now on three non-operated pilots. And as Dave mentioned, we've got another six or seven pilots that we're engaged in now. So all that information is helping us inform our 2017 development plans. And I think, as we get more data under our belt, we'll come out and see a material increase to that inventory.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I guess I'll have to be a little more patient. My follow-up, if I may, is I realize oil is heading in the wrong direction again this morning, and who knows what 2017 is going to look like? But you've laid out a trajectory that's got you tripling cash flow basically by 2018 at $60 oil. I'm just curious as to what should we infer by way of your activity level with that level of cash flow? And perhaps in even a higher oil price environment, where does Devon go in terms of activity, or do we flatten out at a targeted growth level at a particular rig level, but maybe return cash to shareholders at some point?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Doug, as you well know, we have a very deep inventory of opportunities, and certainly the two franchise assets that we have are the STACK play and the Delaware Basin play. And so if prices go even higher than that, we certainly can ramp up activity even further there.","We are always going to be mindful, though. I want to emphasize; we're going to be mindful of the returns. So we're not driven by top line production growth. We are driven by getting good returns for every dollar in our capital program, but we feel we have the opportunities we could further drive up activity in both of those areas, plus we have other areas that we are not funding right now as much as could be if we had higher cash flow levels. They already have returned well above the cost of capital, but they just don't compete as well as the Delaware Basin and the STACK.","In the Rockies, we are starting to fund now with one rig. We could add activity there with strong returns. And even the Barnett, and we've laid out some numbers in the operations report how we're driving down the cost there. We think we have a program that we can do both from the horizontal refracs and from additional drilling locations that right now are well above the cost of capital. They're just not as good as the Delaware Basin and STACK, so we are focusing our capital there because they're the highest returns. So we do not have a shortage of opportunities. And so I think if prices are even higher, we'd look at funding some of those opportunities as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","David, I don't want to belabor or take up too much time here, but I want to be clear what I'm asking because one of your competitors is talking about a mid-cycle $55 level. I realize that's totally subjective, but their point is in a higher oil price environment, the industry got itself into bit of a mess by growing too quickly. And they would look upon that as a windfall and would not jerk around their rig count with a view to longer-term sustainable growth. What I'm hearing from you is that you would respond to a higher oil price with higher activity levels. I guess my question is, is that what the industry wants to see? Is high growth just going to keep this oil price in the problem we've got right now, or is there an argument that says work towards a growth level and return any perceived \"windfalls\" to shareholders? I guess that's really what I'm asking.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Doug, it's my view that what got the industry in trouble at the higher commodity prices is that there are a lot of projects that were funded out there that were very marginal projects, and we didn't pay enough attention to the reservoir. We didn't pay enough attention to the fundamental economics. And so I don't think it's so much the activity level in and of itself. It's the fact that this activity level was really going towards projects that didn't provide the returns that they should.","And so I can tell you here at Devon, we are very, very focused on returns, and we're very, very focused on the reservoir and making sure that each project that we do is going to provide good returns. So I don't necessarily think there's a problem on an individual company level as long as you can be confident you can provide good returns. I think what really happened is at $90 oil, a lot of these projects being funded were not providing good returns. We're overcapitalizing some of these fields, frankly, and that's what the big issue was.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer, Dave. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Maybe if I could follow up on STACK activity, can you talk a little bit about how you view the mix of Meramec versus Woodford activity as we're looking at 2017, and any thoughts on what the potential swing in non-op CapEx might look like there?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Excuse me, Ryan, Tony Vaughn here. Our plans are to, as Dave mentioned, we're going to be at \u2013 we're at six rigs coming into this year end, and we've got the capacity to build up that to roughly about 12 rigs. We have plans in the second half of 2017 to engage back into a drilling campaign on another row called the Jacobs Row, and you see that on page 10 of our operating report. So if I had to \u2013 we haven't gone through the budgeting process yet, so I can't say specifically how this will happen. But for the most part, our drilling activity up until about midyear of 2017 will be concentrated in the Meramec. And then in the second half of 2017, we'll take probably roughly about four of those rigs and move them into our Woodford campaign.","If you look at the magnitude of our OBO spending in the STACK play, it's quite substantial. I think we talked to you guys before about the level of participation that we had, not just in operated wells, but we have 430,000 acres in the play. So we have access to a lot of data, a lot of information, and that drives a spend of about $300 million per year from our non-operated exposure.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe I know this is always a hard thing to quantify, but any thoughts on what inning you're in for LOE and G&A cost reductions? The cost reductions over the past 18 months have been extremely impressive. Should we expect to continue to see downward pressure on those, and is there any risk to inflation in either one of those as we see rigs ramp over the next 12 months?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","I'll take the G&A part and I'll let Tony talk about the LOE side. We obviously did a significant reduction in employees earlier in the year, on the order of 25%. It was a big move for us as a company, and it obviously involved some pain, losing some good friends. We did maintain the key operational capability and the key value drivers that can allow us to execute we feel comfortably a $3 billion capital program of about 20 operated rigs. And so we see really that we are at a given \u2013 what we've laid out here is potential for 2017 and 2018 that we are comfortable with the level of G&A in the company, and so I wouldn't expect a significant change on that one way or the other.","Tony may want to talk a little bit about the LOE side of the equation. I think probably we found most of the big gains, but I think that we're always continuing to look more. As the infrastructure increases in some of these fields, there may be some more things that we can do. So, Tony?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Ryan, I think \u2013 I'll tell you I've got to hand it to our operating team both in the field and here in the office. They've taken a very passionate approach to driving cost out of the business, and you can see the improvements that we've made over the last two years. And I think if you were to look at the cost or the price of materials and services, it is starting to level out, starting to flatten out in most of those areas, but that doesn't mean we're still looking for opportunities to continually improve our business.","In some of those areas, we've unbundled or decoupled different components of our operations. As an example, separating the saltwater disposal from the water hauling vendors, that's offered improvements there. We've continued to build out our infrastructure and have more water and pipe now. We have a better power grid system, especially in the Delaware Basin. All that's tending to drive cost down. So probably the tension that we see in the business is coming. We also have by virtue of our sale of the Access Pipeline an increased transportation fee that would be coupled into our LOE costs. But for the most part, our guys are continuing to work LOE in a very passionate approach.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to see if I could discuss a little bit about your thoughts on guidance. You gave us a lot of clues how we should be thinking about 2017 and 2018 in terms of the ops report, but tell me if this is what you're trying to convey. You guided to at least double-digit U.S. oil production growth in 2017 versus the Q4 guidance. I think the guide was 105.5 MBOE per day at the midpoint. And then if we assume Canada is relatively flat from Q4 levels, including maybe a turnaround in Q2, that to me suggests that your overall guidance, soft guide, however you want to call it, would be oil a bit north of 250 MBOE per day versus the Street at 243. Am I thinking about that right? And also, can you give us some sense of what capital it would take to achieve that in 2017?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Let me address first the capital and then I'll have Scott address the detailed question on the volumes. I did say in my opening remarks there that the capital in 2017 we anticipate being around $2 billion of E&P spend. But it is also important to understand that really the volumes in 2017 are being primarily driven by the completion work that we currently have ongoing in specifically the Eagle Ford but also other areas, and then in addition to that, the 10 rigs that we're going to have working by the end of this year.","The incremental capital of going from 15 to 20 rigs, which really rough numbers increases our capital budget that would be at 10 rigs if we stayed flat there for the year, probably about $1.6 billion versus going to 20 rigs would be around $2 billion. That incremental dollar is really driving 2018 volumes, which is why we're really excited just because of the timing of how long it takes to bring these wells on production. So it's not really a matter of $2 billion is needed to drive those 2017 volumes. We could do that at a lower level and it would just impact 2018, but that's again why we're even more excited about the growth potential in 2018. So, Scott?","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","With regards to the production, Arun, I think directionally you're absolutely thinking about that correct. We would expect to be \u2013 when you combine the U.S. and Canada from an oil productive perspective we would expect to be north of 250,000 barrels. So we'll firm up that guidance as we get with our fourth quarter call. We're still working through the detailed operating and capital budgets, but directionally you're absolutely thinking about that correctly. And once again, I do want to emphasize, though, that is absolutely being driven by light oil growth in the U.S. So you're seeing a real time shift to high-margin production for Devon, which is going to significantly enhance our profitability.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you, Scott. And just to follow up, Dave, you commented in your prepared remarks about potentially looking at opportunities, just given the inventory depth to high-grade the overall portfolio. Can you give us a sense of timing and magnitude, and just what you guys are thinking about in terms of potentially monetizing more assets?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","There are a lot of variables that go into this equation. I can tell you, we want to get a greater sense of the inventory, particularly in the STACK and the Delaware Basin, where we are doing these spacing tests in the STACK play, both between the Meramec. You can see also, there's some now \u2013 some Woodford oil potential that's developing underneath the STACK. Want to get a sense for that and how many zones in the Meramec are going to work. We've laid out that we're testing up to eight wells per section in the primary and six in the secondary in the Meramec. Now we're talking about a Woodford zone there.","And then in the Wolfcamp, we talked about the Leonard and testing how many zones in the Leonard may work, as well as the fact that the Wolfcamp is \u2013 we have 9,000 unrisked locations there, and we've moved about 500 or so into the risked locations, and that's going to continue to grow. So that's going to take till \u2013 we'll start getting a better feel for that probably to mid next year. So that's one factor in it.","And then the other big factor in it is really long-term commodity prices, because you can see the leverage to the cash flow that we have from the operations report, the leverage that we have to higher cash flow at higher commodity prices, which is the highest leverage in the industry. And so, where do we think long-term commodity prices are going to level out has a big impact on what cash flow we're going to have, which has a big impact of how many other opportunities that we can fund in other areas that already have potential returns well above the cost of capital, they're just not as big as the Delaware and the STACK. So we want to get a better handle from both of those variables, probably mid-2017 at the earliest, before we make any strategic calls.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, congrats on the risked location update and the cash flow guidance. Just on the Delaware Wolfcamp, you've put in 500 risked locations. It looks like a large majority are in Rattlesnake and the Mi Vida. The 9,000 number, maybe just talk through the work that has to be done to unrisk those, and what EURs you'd expect on the core 500?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Okay. Ed, I think we've just talked about, in the operations report, the Rattlesnake and Mi Vida area, and we've mentioned that we have about 500 risked locations there. But we have a total of about 9,000 unrisked locations across our position in the Delaware Basin. And I'd have to say that industry has done an outstanding job of derisking the play. It's moved from the Texas side of the basin up to the state line, and now north of that state line, so we're utilizing a lot of that information. We do participate in some non-operated activity in there, so we're getting a good feel of the potential in the Wolfcamp.","I think some of the things that we're still anxious to understand, through some of our pilot work that we'll engage in, will be the vertical connectivity between that very thick Wolfcamp column. We know that, out of the 2,000 wells drilled, and we've drilled some on the New Mexico side as well, we just haven't really prosecuted that in our development plan. But we know that from the X-Y through the upper \u2013 through the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, it's all productive. And so it will really be a matter of the development style that we choose to engage in.","I think one of the elements that we're incorporating into our thoughts as we go into 2017 is bringing in an aggressive approach from the Leonard A, B, and C intervals. We've got a stacked pilot engaged right now to help us understand the vertical connectivity. We spent most of our time in the B zone. The industry has spent most of their activity in the C, so we know each of the three intervals are productive.","We're seeing some encouraging results. We're not commenting on that because the data is pretty young right now. We'll come back out and clear up the results of that soon. But we'll incorporate the three intervals in the Leonard with the typical work that we do in the Bone Spring and the two in the southern portion of the two New Mexico counties, and have a pretty aggressive approach into the Wolfcamp in both the Rattlesnake and Mi Vida areas. They'll be the first two areas that we engage the Wolfcamp.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, very fulsome answer. Just on the Eastern Woodford, your well cost is $6 million to $6.5 million, and the EUR is 1,600 MBOE, and it's 25% oil, and that Old Ricky's Ridge well, it's 60% oil. It almost feels like it will be better than the stuff over in Blaine. As Blaine gets deeper, the costs go up. You're getting similar types of EURs. Maybe just a little bit of elaboration in terms of why those well results: A), they're cheaper, and the EURs are so strong, is it the thickness of the reservoir in that particular location?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","I think you're picking up on it. There's a lot of variability in the subsurface portions of the Meramec and the Woodford. The depth does run from the shallow being in the east to the northeast to the southwest, as you described. Also, about midway between the northeast of our position and the far southwest, there are some subsurface intricacies that make us run a third casing string. So as you move up into the Old Ricky's Ridge area, it's a very important data point there that we wanted to highlight simply because the oil cut is 60%. We really hadn't valued that in our thoughts about the Meramec. But as you can see up there, we think there could be a substantial NAV add if you move that high oil cut across the upper portion of our Meramec play. So this really sets us up for that stacked development from the five intervals in the Meramec and the Woodford.","Also unique about Ricky's Ridge, it was a 10,000-foot Woodford test. We incorporated 70 stages in that frac design and pumped about 2,600 pounds per foot of sand. So it was a pretty aggressive attempt to see what we could do there. We're very happy with the results. You can see some of the 90-day IP is solid, but the more important thing is the production profile is flat and much more optimistic than our initial expectations. So I think Ricky's Ridge is an important data point for us to keep her eye on.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","And it's a little bit cheaper over there too because you're shallower to the northeast and get deeper to the southwest. And so that's true both whether you're drilling Meramec or Woodford wells.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I have a question on the STACK. It looks like you're going to be increasing activity in these longer 10,000-foot laterals. Can you give us a sense of how much of your acreage ultimately do you think is amenable to that? And what efforts are ongoing to help block up acreage more so this can become part of the long-term development plan?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Scott, that's a good piece of the business that our business unit is engaged in every day. And so we're working with other operators there to block up and try to provide the most opportunity to drill long laterals. We find that to be the right answer, and especially in this particular play. Data is fairly early on that, but all the long laterals that we have drilled are outperforming initial expectations. We've got a very aggressive type curve that you can see there. So we're very excited about that ability to drill those long laterals. So we think about 2\/3 of our position is currently available to drill the 10,000-footers. And so the majority of our work going into 2017 or at least 2\/3 of that work will really be directed towards the long lateral type work.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Specifically, do you find right now other operators are fairly willing? Are we at the right stage in the STACK for other operators to be willing to help do this and block up their acreage as well as yours?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","I think there's a good dialogue that's just now happening. There's a part of an industry group that we participate in with most of our larger operators in the field. They're working very well together. I think everybody is looking at operatorship. Everybody is looking at their position, trying to make sure that we take a very efficient approach.","So some of the work that you've seen us and heard us talk about with our Cimarex partner in the Woodford has been very accommodating to both the work that Cimarex does and Devon has done, bringing out the most efficient results. And I think we're just now starting to see some of those type of conversations happen with most of the operators there in the Meramec play.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks. And then to follow up on the Mi Vida area again, can you give us a sense of why this has popped onto your focus? Is it some work geologically you have done, or is it more of what you're seeing from industry? Maybe this is looking at it a little bit too closely. But if I look at that map, you've got obviously some acreage outside of that little box that you drew down there. Is there any particular reason that's not included?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","I think the one thing unique about the Mi Vida area is we've got I think about 5,500 to 6,000 net acres there, 8,000 gross roughly. So we've got a nice contiguous position in that portion of the Wolfcamp right there on the border of Reeves and Ward County. So it really sets us up for, again, a more efficient development going forward. So that's really caused us to put that on our radar screen. And we're getting a lot of good competitive data around us. There are some good wells that are being drilled there. Again, we're trying to see and understand the vertical connectivity between that column to understand best how to develop that.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Kissel with Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now open.","Peter Kissel - Scotia Howard Weil","Thanks for taking my questions, maybe just another on the cost side of things, but more on the CapEx side than the OpEx side. In your supplemental presentation, you mentioned that you're proactively securing services to mitigate inflationary pressure in 2017. I was just curious if you could elaborate on that a little bit more, maybe in particular where you see the inflationary pressures and how you're mitigating that.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Hey, Pete. I'm going to introduce Sue Alberti. Sue is our Senior Vice President here that manages our marketing and supply chain groups. She's very well connected, and her group is with our operating team. So I'm going to let Sue describe some of the work that we're doing on the price of our goods and services.","Sue Alberti - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you. I'd like to say, we do think that as commodity prices improve and activity increases, we're looking to \u2013 we will get that inflationary pressure next year. We think that that could be mid to high single digits, especially in the stimulation area. And I'll tell you a few of the things that we're doing to mitigate those cost increases on the capital side. As you said, we talked about proactively securing equipment and crews at competitive prices, and we're locking in rates and terms where it makes sense given our outlook right now. So for example, on the rig side, we've locked in two long-term agreements for these rigs at current market rates.","And then Tony, talking about the LOE, said that we were unbundling the water transport and water disposal. We're doing unbundling on the capital side too in the stimulation area. And we've recently started this where we're contracting separately for pressure pumping, sand, chemicals, and diesel, taking out the markup of the bundling. And while it's new and we don't have a lot of data yet, what we're realizing what we see right now is about a 10% savings from that unbundling. So we probably will look to do maybe more of that, but we're very encouraged with those results.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","I just want to add that Sue talked about probably the high single-digit type service cost increase. Again, we think we can offset that with all these internal efficiencies that we're doing. So she mentioned some of the efforts. There's a lot more than that going on, just the continuing design of the wells. I think Tony may even like to brag on a few wells we drilled recently in the Delaware. I'm not sure if you're going there, Tony, but I see you holding a piece of paper that I think you're proud of.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","I'm trying to let you go in and say your few words and let me get it in here. Pete, I tell you I'm really excited about the work we do, and we've talked a little bit about the passion for the tentacle work that our operating teams do. On the drilling side of the business, we just stood up a Delaware rig and have now drilled three wells from spud to TD. Those used to take 17 days to complete. All three of these are averaging about 10 days now. That's really an approach to an optimized design that we've had the luxury of tying to a lot more subsurface data than we've had in the past.","It's also reflective of really the granular detail towards the execution of our business. And, Pete, I think we've talked to you about the well-con [well control] center there. So we're getting a lot of efficiencies both on the drill side of the business but also on the completion side of the business. And all that passion for data acquisition and integrating that into three-dimensional earth models and picking the right landing zone and designing more optimized or better frac designs, all that is paying off.","And we're also putting a lot of attention into the execution portion of the completion space. We monitor all the operations on the frac. We monitor all of the data on the flowback of the wells in great detail. We have also recently incorporated the coiled tubing drill-out data in our well-con center, so we think that's another potential savings there. So while Sue has mentioned that the industry is going to have some tension on cost, we think from the technical work that we're doing, we've got the ability to offset that in 2017, and very excited about additional enhancements that will be available to us for more of that type of work in the second half of 2017 and 2018.","Peter Kissel - Scotia Howard Weil","Great, Tony. Thank you, that's a great answer. One quick follow-up, more the efficiency side, though. In the STACK in particular, as activity levels continue to increase, what do you see as the biggest gating factors there, maybe for the play in general but also Devon in particular? Is it midstream? Is it water availability? I know the play doesn't produce much water, but is there any concerns you have looking forward for any of those items?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Pete, it's not on takeaway out of the basin. I think Sue could talk to us in a little bit of detail about that. We're not worried about that through 2017 and into 2018. A lot of the pace of activity right now is more associated with just doing good quality work, getting all the pilot work under our belt before we finalize our development plans going forward. And just like we do in all of our areas, we'll have a good build-out of infrastructure there. So we know that, say on the water handling side of the business, there could be a time when we have 20 rigs running just in STACK that there's a heavy demand on water, water handling. We'll be mimicking some of the work that we've done in the Cana-Woodford project and also in the Delaware Basin to make sure that that's very efficient, and our operating costs going forward are low and well thought through. And, Sue, I don't know if you want to add any comments to that.","Sue Alberti - Devon Energy Corp.","Let me add a little bit to what Tony was saying about takeaway. We don't have any short-term concerns regarding for Devon processing or takeaway constraints in the STACK. And we have been working with EnLink to ensure that they will have adequate processing capacity for us on our forecasted production. In addition, we've got firm takeaway for our oil and our NGLs and actually until 2019 at this point.","I would say, though, that longer term when you think about the growth in this area, we think that there needs to be an industry solution for residue gas takeaway, and we're actively working solutions with multiple midstream companies to address this. But given the timeframe when we think that will be needed, we believe that there is enough time in order to get that in place when the growth is met.","Peter Kissel - Scotia Howard Weil","Great, thanks again, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","One thing that we've been thinking about is the industry ramp in the Permian and just thinking about Devon's advantages around securing oil, gas, NGL, and water takeaway capacity with the EnLink relationship. Can you talk some about that over the long term with the 30% ramp in production in 2018 and beyond?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","I think absolutely it's an advantage when we're in growth plays. We have a very close relationship with EnLink. They are our midstream provider in the STACK play, and it gives us great comfort that they are. We have that relationship, so we can have teams working on essentially a daily basis on looking at what the long-term needs are and making sure that they have the right gathering, processing, and takeaway capacity at the right time to ensure that we can execute our capital plan and get our wells hooked up on a timely basis and get that value. So certainly, when you're in the growth mode in a basin, I think a tight relationship with your midstream provider is very important, and we have that with EnLink.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","A secondary thought and question, with your well-level return focus, how do you think about the shift in Devon's corporate return as you become more light oil? Just return on capital employed, or what metric should we use? And have you done any thoughts of well-level economics translating into corporate economics?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","We tend to talk about the incremental well-level economics on these calls. But I can tell you that we actively look also at what we would consider full-cycle returns in each of our key project areas. Just trying to look at return on capital employed when you have all these write-offs is just \u2013 if you're just looking at that, it's hard to get a good calculation off the financials. But we look at it just from a pure rate of return, all cash spent, all cash we're getting back in each of our key plays, to make sure that we're not only delivering on good incremental well-level economics, but we're, from a total investment level, that we're generating good returns on each area we work.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","At mid-cycle...","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","Dave, real quick. Hey, Dave, this is Scott, real quick. To further address that question, you will absolutely start seeing these high rate of return wells in the future years impact our ROCE calculations in a very positive manner. And also, another proxy for that would be on a cash flow per debt-adjusted share basis. It's certainly something that we view will be a very differentiating metric for Devon going forward.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I guess, what do you think that the full-cycle returns are in your STACK and Delaware?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","It's hard to give you that number right now, because the play is still changing so much and how much incremental resource are we going to have over our original assumptions, because the economics of each individual well is improving, and we have a lot more wells than in our original acquisition assumptions. So, it's certainly improving, but to give an absolute number, I think at this point, would be very difficult.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Dave, I'll just add a little bit of a description of what we do on the operating side of the business. On a quarterly basis, we get the senior leaders from across the company together on a by business unit basis, and we do a look-back of the work that we just finished for the quarter, and how that infers the forward look. We also have, I think, a very detailed look-back project from a project basis, but also from an annual investment basis. So I think we do a really good job of ensuring that we have an accountable approach to the work that we do. It's all based on historical results, shaped with a forward, continuous improvement look. So it's a pretty detailed process here in the operating teams.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with TPH. Your line is open.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just going back to the Woodford, I wanted to see if we could get some color or context around your development plans on the Jacobs Row, obviously quite interesting that you plan to utilize 10,000-foot laterals, but trying to get a better sense of maybe the size and scale from a section or well-count perspective that you might have in that development. It seems like it could be a pretty material growth plan for you going into 2018.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Matt, I think we're getting information in on the Hobson Row that will help us understand and infer the magnitude of a performance improvement by going from the normal laterals to the 10,000-foot laterals. So we're going to utilize that to our advantage where we can, as we go into the Jacobs Row.","So, I think over 800 wells now have been drilled and completed and are producing. Each of the new vintage completions that we see, we tend to outperform the past or previous type curves. Costs are continuing to come down, so another step change here, in addition to the Ricky's Ridge. And the increased oil content of our fluid going forward is really just incorporating that 10,000-foot concept into the works. I think the returns on the Woodford play are beginning to shape up as being dramatically better than they have been in the past when it really has been in what we call the core portion of our field.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","And don't hold me to exact number, but there are roughly 60 wells in the Jacobs development.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, and then just a follow-up question. We've talked a lot today about the Delaware and the STACK as your core oil developments. Just curious your thoughts on the Eagle Ford as you potentially return to activity in the play, any opportunity to continue to optimize completion designs as the basin has been in a frozen moment here for the last year or so? And are you changing any of your views on the spacing? I know that you have a new spacing design that you may be testing here, with the diamond formation.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Matt, I tell you, we're real pleased with where we are in the Eagle Ford. And if you go back and look at the pace of our activity, it's greatly slowed down in 2016 versus 2014 and early 2015. In fact, we were bringing on about 70 to 75 wells per quarter in that timeframe. In Q1 of this year, we were down to 22 wells brought on in the quarter. Second quarter there was only five, third quarter was only five. So we've seen the rate drop off there, but it is now stabilized, and we have four frac crews in the field that are lowering our DUC inventory down.","That's being done for a couple of purposes, but the primary purpose is to get information on the staggered lateral approach to the development, which is incorporating the upper Eagle Ford. And that information we're looking forward to having in 2017, which will shape what I think will be an accelerated pace of activity in the second half of 2017, which will have the potential for a material rate impact going into 2018. So, we are looking forward. We are continuing to improve our completion designs.","Historically, we have pumped pretty much roughly a 2,000-pound per lateral foot type of job. We've moved that to more of a hybrid type fluid, and we're increasing the proppant load up to close to 3,000 pounds per lateral foot at this point, so a substantial change to the completions. The wells are just now starting to flow back on a few of those new completions. We're not ready to talk about that, but we're highly encouraged that some of the well rates that you've seen has report in the past we're going to materially beat as we go forward. So that play is setting itself up for what I think will be an accelerated ramp-up in the second half of 2017.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Operator, you can move on to the next.","Operator","And your next question comes from James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. A lot of stuff asked and answered. I just wanted to quickly ask you guys to touch on, if you could. You mentioned it just in passing, the Powder River and they ran your rig back there (58:35), an area that you guys have spoken positively about obviously a number of times in that position over there. Obviously, you're adding the rigs, so you feel pretty good about it. What gets that area a big percentage of a limited capital pie? Is it just that you guys need a longer runway on infrastructure and permitting? I know you're looking at both those things, but what is it and what's the state of play over there right now?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","James, thanks for bringing that up. We've been real pleased with the work that we've done in the Powder River Basin in the past, and we've been operating in that area for quite some time. If you recall, back before commodity prices dropped, we were drilling probably the highest return wells in the portfolio, in especially the Parkman in the Powder River Basin. And so we did take a pause in our activity as commodity prices ramped down and our focus has gone to STACK and Delaware.","We've continued to work the subsurface portion of that. We have an extensive 3-D coverage across that entire basin. So we have what I think will be unparalleled knowledge about the subsurface there. After the acquisition, we doubled our position there, and it's all Tier 1 opportunity connected. And we've got about three rig lines ready to go. It's a matter of managing the portfolio and staying within our cash flow. So we think it's a great an asset. You've seen some transactions happen in the Powder which further confirm what we think the ultimate value in the Powder position will be. So while it won't ever have the scale and materiality that we'll see in the STACK or Delaware, it's got outstanding returns and we're looking forward to showing you additional subsurface results.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon now, a question on the track development plan in the Delaware. Can you talk about the trajectory of wells per pad, say, last year or this year going into next year and what that steady-state number looks like?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Bob, historically and I don't know if it's more than just Devon, but the industry has really been prosecuting two and three-well pads across the Delaware Basin. And the areas where we have a larger contiguous position, we're going to employ this new design concept. And so there are up to about 14 known productive intervals in that Delaware Basin column, Bob. And so when you look at the number of unrisked locations that we've highlighted of 20,000, there's got to be a more compelling development plan going forward to accelerate present value. So that's the concept that we're looking forward to.","The way we're designing the track process, it's highly flexible between what we need to get done in the Delaware, which has some additional challenges with the federal permitting. But the concepted frac will be applied both in the Delaware and STACK on both of those STACK developments. So it's hard to tell you exactly how many wells per pad, but I can see us putting maybe up to 30 wells in a given section. We'll utilize very efficient drilling pads coupled with more of a centralized tank battery, so we'll see quite a few advantages. We've tried to highlight the advantages in our operating report, so you can take a look at that.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But will you do a pilot track sometime in the next years, or how do you get from where you are today to rolling out track?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","We're going to push forward in 2017 employing this concept. We think it will be \u2013 you can call it a pilot, or really just to go forward with the development plan. We think there's a lot of flexibility in this, so we're going to be pushing forward to a more creative solution for our developments going forward.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then a last follow-up, if a look at your 7.5-ish rigs for 4Q, you're calling for about $400 million in CapEx for the quarter. If I just scale that and say you're going to run double those rigs next year, and there are four quarters next year, I get closer to a $3 billion \u2013 $3.2 billion CapEx spend. But you're talking about $2 billion. How should I think about that?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Devon Energy Corp.","Yes, included in the $400 million will be also a larger component of \u2013 it will include the OBO component, plus we have other just leasehold expenditures, things like that, that are not actually Devon-operated drilling rig components. So really when you talk about going to the \u2013 and I've been talking about it on the Street for quite some time that we're going to be a run rate of around $1.6 billion with the 10 operated rigs. So going from 10 to 15 to 20, you're not increasing all these other components that are in our capital program, you're just increasing the operated rig component. And if you do the math on that, say on average it's another 7.5 rigs over 0.5 year or so, maybe that's more like four rigs. So you take four figs and average working interest, you get somewhere around that incremental $400 million to get you around $2 billion.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","[0FH2DB-E Scott Coody]","Thank you and good morning.","I hope everyone has had the chance to review our financial and operational disclosures that were released last night. This data package includes our earnings release, forward-looking guidance, and detailed operations report. Additionally, for the call today, we have slides to supplement our prepared remarks. These slides are available on our website, and we will make sure to refer to the slide number during our prepared remarks so that everyone can follow along.","On today's call, I will cover a few preliminary items and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Hager. Dave will provide his thoughts on the strategic direction of Devon, which we have branded as our 2020 Vision, and commentary on the next steps associated with this multiyear business plan. Following Dave, Tony Vaughn, our Chief Operating Officer, will cover a few key highlights and operating themes that are central to delivering our multiyear development plans. And then we will wrap up our prepared remarks with a review of our financial strategy by Jeff Ritenour, our Chief Financial Officer. Overall, this commentary should last around 15 minutes before heading into Q&A.","I would also like to remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call today will contain plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially. For a review of risk factors, please see our Form 10-K.","And with that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Hager.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you and good morning, everyone.","The second quarter was another strong one for Devon. We are executing at a very high level on the strategic objectives underpinning our three-year business plan, otherwise known as our 2020 Vision. For today's call, my comments will be centered on the significant progress we have made year to date toward our 2020 Vision, and I will also touch on a few of the critical next steps associated with this differentiating multiyear plan.","Turning to slide 2, the next item I'd like to cover today is the outstanding performance of our U.S. resource plays, which has consistently delivered light oil production results above our base plan year to date. This outperformance has been driven by the record-setting well productivity we have achieved across our franchise assets in the Delaware Basin and STACK.","During the second quarter, the momentum from high-rate wells drove U.S. light oil production 12% higher than the previous quarter, exceeding guidance by a wide margin. With the strong well productivity we achieved through the first half of the year, light oil production is on track to advance 16% in 2018. This represents a growth rate that is 200 basis points above our original budget expectations heading into the year.","Overall, we're off to a great start in exceeding the light oil objectives associated with our 2020 Vision. Importantly, we are delivering this incremental production growth within the confines of our original capital budget guidance range.","With our go-forward capital plans, I also believe it is worth highlighting that even with the recent rise in oil prices, we have no plans to add incremental activity in 2018. While we have a very deep inventory of highly attractive growth opportunities within our portfolio, we fundamentally believe that a more measured investment program through all cycles is the correct strategy to manage costs, efficiently expand our business, and the appropriate pathway to deliver attractive corporate-level returns for shareholders.","The next key message I want to convey is that Devon's cash flow generation is trending ahead of our budgeted expectations. In fact, with current strip prices, we expect to increase our upstream cash flow by more than 50% by year end compared to where we started the year. Furthermore, after expected capital requirements, we are in position to generate free cash flow in the second half of the year.","While the advancement of our U.S. oil volumes is certainly a key contributor to this cash flow growth, our operating teams have also done a great job maximizing the value of every barrel we produce. Some of the best work we have done is on the pricing front, where our marketing teams have provided both flow assurance and access to premium pricing on the Gulf Coast for the majority of our U.S. oil production. Tony will discuss this topic in greater detail later in the call. But after including the benefits of firm transportation and attractive regional basis swaps, our light oil realizations year to date are essentially in line with WTI benchmark pricing.","Looking ahead, we are well positioned to maintain this strong pricing in the second half of the year, which is very much in contrast to the weak regional pricing and takeaway constraints that have become a serious issue for many operators.","In addition to strong price realizations, another key factor further supplementing our cash flow growth is the aggressive improvements we are taking to our cost structure. With the actions we have taken year to date, we are now on pace to reduce G&A and interest costs by approximately $475 million on an annualized basis. These substantial savings combined with improved operating costs across our U.S. resource plays will continue to put downward pressure on our per-unit cost through the end of the decade.","With our Delaware Basin and STACK assets rapidly building momentum and operating scale, another critical component of our 2020 Vision is to further high-grade our resource-rich portfolio.","During the quarter, we took a significant step forward with this strategic objective by selling our interest in EnLink Midstream for $3.125 billion. This highly accretive transaction provides a complete exit from our investment in EnLink at a value of 12 times cash flow, a substantial premium to Devon's current trading multiple. With the closing of the EnLink transaction, which occurred in mid-July, combined with other minor asset sales achieved to date, Devon's total proceeds from our divestiture program have now reached $4.2 billion.","The next step in this program is to monetize an additional $1 billion of minor non-core assets across the United States by around year end, which would boost the proceeds from our divestiture program to more than $5 billion.","Consistent with the framework of our disciplined multiyear plan, we are returning these divestiture proceeds to our shareholders in the form of a share repurchase program. In June, our board authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to an industry-leading $4 billion. While Jeff will provide more details on the progress of our share repurchase program later in the call, I will say that our buyback efforts have reached approximately $1 billion through the end of July. And given the value we see in our equity, we plan to accelerate the cadence of our share repurchase activity through the rest of the year.","So to summarize, I could not be more pleased with the execution we have delivered to date on our 2020 Vision. Our light oil production is running ahead of plan. Our margin and cash flow are rapidly expanding. We expect to exceed our $5 billion asset sale target by around year end, and we are returning industry-leading amounts of cash to our shareholders.","Briefly flipping to slide 3, while I will not cover all the details on the slide, I do want to be clear. We are not content with the substantial progress we have made to date. The management team at Devon is laser-focused on optimizing returns and ensuring capital efficiency for our shareholders. We will continue to attack costs and transition our product mix towards higher-margin barrels. We will be disciplined with our capital allocation and generate significant free cash flow. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to high-grade the portfolio, and we will continue to prioritize returning increasing amounts of cash to our shareholders.","And lastly, before turning the call over to Tony, I do want to touch on a topic we've got a lot of questions on recently, and that is our thoughts on BHP's announced sale of its Eagle Ford position. Overall, it is good to see a quality operator like BP acquire this position. We have had extensive experience working with BP in the past, both as partners in projects and on multiple asset sales as well. Since the announcement, we have not had any in-depth conversations with BP, so it's still a bit too premature to provide any commentary regarding the strategic direction of the assets at this point in time. However, for the near term, we do not expect any meaningful change in the activity levels that underpin our guidance for the second half of 2018.","From a portfolio perspective, we do like our Eagle Ford position. DeWitt County is the economic heart of the play, and we have a multiyear drilling inventory that can generate outstanding returns, a stable production profile, and significant free cash flow for Devon. We look forward to discussing the future of the asset with our new partner, BP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for additional commentary on our operations.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you, Dave.","I'd like to begin by covering a few noteworthy operating highlights for the quarter. A great place to start is on slide 4, with our Delaware and STACK assets. These delivered 54% and 41% oil growth respectively year over year. This prolific growth was a driving force behind our U.S. oil production beat in the second quarter.","The strong performance in the quarter was driven by another batch of prolific well results across the U.S. While the massive Boundary Raider wells filled the headlines last quarter, our Cotton Draw program topped the Delaware Basin highlight list in Q2 with a four-well package that achieved a combined 30-day IP rate of 14,000 BOEs per day. We also had several other prolific wells in the Delaware, with our top 10 wells for the quarter averaging 30-day rates greater than 3,000 BOEs per day.","Our other franchise asset, the STACK, also delivered strong operating results in the quarter. Top wells in the play continued to routinely deliver initial production rates in excess of 2,000 BOEs per day, and the efficiencies associated with the Showboat and other initial infill projects are compressing cycle times and driving first production well ahead of planned.","And while we are still in the early days of evaluating the performance of our Showboat infill project in the STACK, we have attained peak project rates. The average well at Showboat, normalized for 10,000-foot laterals, attained 30-day rates of approximately 1,800 BOEs per day. With this upside spacing test, from spud to initial flow rates, this project has largely exceeded expectations. However, based on early observations, it appears this development concept is not optimized for rate of return, and is likely spaced too densely.","With our initial three infill projects, Showboat, Horsefly, and Bernhardt, we are testing 12, 10, and 8 wells per drilling unit. We intend to rapidly deploy the learnings from these initial spacing projects and our extensive library of information to optimize future STACK development plans. When I say optimize, I mean striking an appropriate balance between the rates of return and the net present value with our future activity, with a heavy preference towards enhancing project rate of returns.","Next, I do want to make clear that the strong well productivity achieved during the quarter was complemented by expanding margins through both strong price realizations and improvements in our per-unit operating cost structure. Additionally, we were able to effectively control our capital spending, which declined nearly 10% from the previous quarter.","In Canada, I want to commend the teams on our successful and safe turnaround work at Jackfish 1. While the turnaround efforts identified additional maintenance work requirements that delayed the facility ramp-up into the third quarter, this work will improve future operating efficiencies and allow our production to increase as the second half of the year progresses. All in all, our operations have delivered great results year to date, and we are well positioned to execute on the multiyear operating plans associated with our 2020 Vision.","On slide 5, a key component of this strong execution that should not be overlooked is the operational planning and supply chain efforts to ensure the certainty of services and supplies necessary to deliver on our capital plans. First, I want to highlight that these efforts have largely mitigated industry inflation in 2018 and have allowed us to execute on our capital plans within the confines of our original capital guidance provided late last year.","Furthermore, with the aggressive steps we have taken to decouple historically bundled services combined with our team's utilizing a much more diversified vendor universe, our strategy to achieve the best value for our LOE and capital dollars is working quite well. In fact, the vast majority of our services and supply requirements have been locked in through 2019. We are confident in our ability to keep rising industry costs in check at well below market rates through the end of the decade. This value-oriented approach is only available due to our detailed field development plans for each of our asset areas.","Moving to slide 6, another area where we have done a lot of good work is in our marketing and flow assurance strategy, which provides the majority of our U.S. production direct access to premium Gulf Coast markets.","Specifically in the Delaware Basin, we have been able to price-protect 90% oil volumes through firm transportation and attractive regional basis swaps. From a flow assurance perspective for our in-basin sales, we have contractual guarantees to flow 100,000 barrels per day through our legacy firm sales agreements that extend well into the next decade. All in all, these physical and financial swaps in the Delaware will allow us to maintain price realizations near that of WTI pricing.","We are also well positioned in the STACK play. Through firm transportation on the Marketlink pipeline, approximately 75% of our oil volumes have direct access to premium Gulf Coast pricing. Also, we have firm transport agreements covering the vast majority of our gas production in the STACK. Coupled with basis swaps, we have effectively protected the price on the majority of our gas volumes.","The last area I will touch on is our attractive WCS hedges in Canada. In 2018, we have roughly half our production hedged at $15 off of WTI.","So in summary, with this good upfront planning work from our operations, supply chain, and marketing personnel, we are well positioned to maximize the value of our production in a tight market.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Tony. For my prepared remarks, I will provide an update on the shareholder return initiatives underway at Devon and discuss the next steps in the execution of our financial strategy aligned with our 2020 Vision.","Moving to slide 7, I'd first like to cover how the sale of EnLink impacts Devon's financial statements. With our second quarter reporting, the financial results associated with EnLink will be reclassified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the closing of this transaction, which occurred in mid-July, EnLink's financial results will no longer be consolidated with Devon's upstream business.","To further assist investors with this transition, we have provided pro forma financials in a recent Form 8-K filing to better highlight the historical performance of our go-forward upstream business.","As Dave mentioned earlier, we're returning the sales proceeds from the EnLink transaction to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. In June, our Board of Directors authorized a 300% increase in our share repurchase program to $4 billion. At current pricing, this represents over 15% of our share count and is the largest share repurchase authorization of any E&P company in the industry based on a percentage of market capitalization.","As of today, we have repurchased nearly 5% of our outstanding shares at an average price of $41 per share, bringing the total cost of our program to approximately $1 billion. For the remaining $3 billion of our authorization, we plan to utilize a series of accelerated stock repurchase programs, otherwise known as an ASR. We expect our initial ASR to commence in early August once the blackout period related to our Q2 earnings release expires at the end of this week.","The ASR programs will allow us to repurchase large amounts of our outstanding shares on an expedited basis. In fact, we expect to fully complete our $4 billion share repurchase program during the first half of 2019, well ahead of our board's authorization that extends through the end of the year. Detailed forward-looking guidance on share count is provided in our press release issued last night.","Looking beyond our current $4 billion share repurchase program, we continue to evaluate opportunities to further increase cash returns to our shareholders. With our disciplined multiyear plan, we expect to generate substantial amounts of excess cash at today's commodity prices via our core operations and planned divestiture activity. We'll utilize excess cash to manage to our stated debt targets and expect to approach our board regarding an increase to our share repurchase program.","Lastly, regarding our debt position, we have now successfully reduced our consolidated gross debt to just over $6 billion with the sale of EnLink. This represents a decline in our debt of approximately 40% year to date. And at today's commodity prices, we are within our targeted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 to 1.5 times. With strip prices where they are today, we'd expect this ratio to trend toward the low end of this targeted range over time, further strengthening our investment-grade financial position.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Scott for Q&A.","[0FH2DB-E Scott Coody]","Thanks, Jeff. We will now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have further questions, you can re-prompt as time permits.","With that, operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. . Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Dave, with your share price reaction today, I hope you're going to get busy with the share buybacks. I have two quick asset-related questions, if I may, probably both for Tony. Tony, first of all on Showboat, the work we've done in the past, my understanding was that the Lower Meramec extends out in that northeastern portion of your acreage where the Showboat test has been. I'm just curious if you could give us some color as to how many of the wells that you drilled there were in that Lower Meramec area. Did that influence the average production rate? And what's the read-through as you move into the thicker part of the section with Horsefly and Bernhardt?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks for the question, Doug. In our Showboat project, we had \u2013 about half the wells landed in the Upper Meramec, half in the Lower Meramec. We saw a little bit of an increased performance from the Upper Meramec. And I'm going to turn it over to Wade. And, Wade, if you can give Doug a bit of a description on the subsurface of where Horsefly and Bernhardt would go, that would be great.","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure, will do, Tony. Doug, again, half the wells were in the lower, half in the upper. We actually saw about a 25% performance difference between those in that the upper was much more prolific. You're correct, as you move south and west of Showboat into the core of the play, we see the Lower Meramec targets have even higher productivity. And so as we develop both Horsefly and Bernhardt and other projects like those, we have increased confidence that those zones will work in an infill development scenario. And so although they didn't work as well as we thought they would at Showboat, we still feel like they have great potential across other parts of the play.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Wade, did you get the cost benefits that you were expecting?","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Yes, we broadly have. I think that's the most successful part of Showboat is on a pace and cost perspective, we met or exceeded our expectations. We were 40 days ahead of plan on Showboat. We saw cost reductions relative to our parent wells. We're even seeing more cost performance on the Bernhardt and Horsefly. Those two projects, which are both all 10,000-foot wells, are projected and they're pretty much done at this point to come in between $7.5 million and $7.1 million per well. So we're pretty encouraged about the cost efficiencies we're seeing.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. My second asset-related question, Tony, again, it might be for you, but the Delaware, obviously you have been still drilling random one-off couple of pairs wells all over the place toward Rattlesnake and so on. But it looks to us that as you prepare the program going into 2019, the cadence of the completions is obviously an issue, it looks like, as you move into development mode. But I'm curious if you can just walk us through what role the Delaware plays in the dip in your production in the third quarter and how that might ramp as we go into 2019, particularly given how prolific those wells are. Asked differently, it looks like your 2019 program is going to be some pretty strong wells versus the type curve that you based your 2020 plan on. I'll leave it there, thanks.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Doug, I'm going to start off here. Then I'm going to ask Rick to fill in a little bit of details there. But I think we really haven't been drilling a lot of couple-well random wells in the Delaware. We have been appraising a little bit, and you heard us announce the Boundary Raider wells last quarter, which were quite prolific. But for the most part, probably 70% of our activity in the Delaware is really associated with these multi-zone projects that are going quite well. And so we're reaping a lot of the cost and schedule benefits that Wade just described in the Showboat project. They're also happening in our larger multi-zone projects in the Delaware.","And so while these projects can be a little bit lumpy, we've sized them to have fairly contiguous \u2013 or continuous growth on both oil and cash flow. We're pleased with what we're seeing right now. We're starting to move some of our work in the Delaware from the traditional Second Bone Spring type activity that we've had to the Wolfcamp. And this is really an effort to optimize, again, the developments of the Wolfcamp horizon there.","But you're right. You're going to start seeing \u2013 we saw a little bit of, I say, a slowdown in pace of IDs in Q3. That's what caused a little bit of the softness in our forecast in the Delaware. That really picks up at the end of the third quarter. And into the fourth quarter, we'll have a dramatic increase in ID count going forward. But with that, Doug, I'm going to let Rick describe just some of the work that we're doing.","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Great question, Doug, and this is Rick Gideon. Very much in line with what Tony just said, I'll tell you right now when you look at our ops report, we talk about our Seawolf and Lusitano, Medusa, Fighting Okra, Snapping, and a North Thistle program. So you're seeing that progression into these programs of many different sizes. And what I'll tell you that's based on is the great technical work provided by these teams. It's the understanding of the dependent and independent flow units, whether that be in the Leonard, Bone Spring, or Wolfcamp.","So what I think what you'll see are some different sized programs going forward here that we are seeing outstanding results from the multiple horizons, from the multiple flow units in our spacing, not just horizontally by vertically. You've seen some great well results in the Second Bone that tie directly to better technical understanding, better planning, and quite honestly flawless execution as we move through this. With that, we're able to utilize different flowback techniques, and I think you're starting to see the results of just great teamwork, great planning, great execution, and very good technical understanding.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. I appreciate the full answer. But just to be clear, the Boundary Raider wells, if that's the type of well that constitutes the program in 2019, that's substantially better than the type curve that's set in your current program. Is that correct?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","The Boundary Raider wells are special wells, Doug, and we've got some offsets to drill to the Boundary Raider, which are going to be a really good development, and we're going to be kicking that area off later this year. But as you look at our current operations report, we just reported some really good wells in the Cotton Draw area and the Second Bone Spring. Those are also really good wells. So I'd say in general, our performance from our wells is better than it has been in the past. The subsurface understanding from the technical teams is just outstanding. So this commitment to the data acquisition and being data driven has really paid off for us.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","In general, I think, Doug, the comment is absolutely the Delaware is running ahead of plan.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's the answer I was looking for. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Hey, a follow-up question on Showboat. You did obviously mention there were some I guess a bit stronger declines. Was that related to the parent well being obviously three years old in the area, or was it more the Lower Meramec? And if you could, also comment on what you saw with the Woodford well.","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure, Scott. This is Wade Hutchings again. I think there are three big preliminary insights we've taken from Showboat. The first is the difference in performance between Upper and Lower Meramec, which we just discussed.","The second really relates to your question, and that is a very clear trend that any of the wells in either the upper or the lower that were drilled in the parent well's shadow, those underperformed relative to any of the wells that were in more of what we'd call the greenfield parts of those sections. And underperformance would be reflected at both an IP and even at a decline level.","The third key thing we observed is we're seeing some initial indications that there's more vertical connectivity between these reservoir landing zones than we may have saw in other parts of the play. And so those are really our key preliminary observations so far from Showboat.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Scott, this is Dave. I might add that I think at this point, though, you have to be extremely cautious about extrapolating any results that we have from Showboat to the remainder of the STACK play. It is very early on. We are taking the learnings there and we're adjusting our go-forward development plans in terms of spacing. The ones beyond Bernhardt and Horsefly we're adjusting the spacing, as we think that's the right thing to do in the short term. But it's not clear that that's the only answer that's going on here too.","And so I would certainly be extremely careful that we have had some challenges here at Showboat. We knew we were testing the upper limits of the spacing. That's proved to be true, but we're learning a lot from that. And I think that there's a lot more to learn, and we'll learn a lot more as we proceed through the next several development projects here. But to take the results from Showboat and extrapolate a general learning across the entire play, I think it's very premature to do that.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, understood there. And on the Woodford, did you have a commentary, any comments on the Woodford well?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","So that Woodford well would be one of the furthest north Woodford oil window wells, and right now it's still in a phase where it's still in flowback. So we don't really have a lot of hard conclusions to make on the Woodford prospectivity extent at this point.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, understood. And then in the PRB, it looks like you guys are looking to expand your program next year to maybe four rigs. Can you discuss what you're seeing there and what we should be looking forward to?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Scott, I think again, the work that we're doing, primarily in the Turner, is really providing a lot of good insight. We've done some spacing tests there. We're very pleased with what we're seeing. Every well that we bring on is really some of the higher rate of return wells that we have. So we're starting to define what the development plan will look like. We're also having some positive results in the Niobrara. We haven't commented on that specifically yet, but both of those parts of our program are developing very well.","And so I think what we're trying to infer is later this year we'll not only pick up the second rig, pick up the third rig, and then in 2019 expect to be in full development mode there with increased activity beyond that. So everything that we're seeing in the Powder is developing just to plan.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, so it's definitely in the Turner and both in the Niobrara what you're seeing results that could be \u2013 you could be active on next year?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Primarily. And not to shortchange some of the work that we typically do in the Parkman and the Teapot, those always deliver good results. But really, as we've commented in the past, the Turner is more of a resource opportunity for us, and that's what is being uncovered right now. So that will really drive a lot of the pace of activity in the Powder.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I had a question on your comments trying to unpack this notion of strategic high-grading. If we look two to three years into the future, what assets are you highly certain stay in the portfolio, and what assets do you think could find a home for someone else? And then I have a follow-up.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Hi, Bob. First off, we believe very much in the multi-basin approach, and I think you're really seeing the benefits of that approach right now as we speak. We're having outstanding results in the Delaware Basin. Tony just described some very promising results that we're seeing in the Powder.","Overall, we have a strong inventory in the STACK. We have admittedly had a little bit of disappointment here, not tremendous, but there's a little bit of short-term with Showboat with one development in the STACK, but with 90% of our development still in front of us we're adjusting quickly, and we still have some strong, really strong return opportunities in the Eagle Ford as well. So we believe that this multi-basin approach that allows us to shift capital between several high-return basins is the absolute right approach, and it really optimizes returns versus being overly dependent on one specific play.","But we look at a lot of different things when we look at what may or may not remain in the inventory. We look at what is our overall depth of our development inventory, what's the intrinsic value of the asset that we may be looking to monetize, and what is its production and cash flow contributions. We look at what are the prevailing market conditions out there. And obviously, we have teams that are very engaged and understand the market from both a buy and a sell standpoint extremely well.","And when we identify an opportunity to pull the trigger, we're not afraid to do so. If you look at our history here, we've had about $30 billion worth of transactions over the past decade. I'm not going to telegraph today specifically what may or may not, but those are the key issues that we look at here. We think we have a very strong inventory where we are, and we'll continue to evaluate conditions as we move forward.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So getting a little more granular, when you talk about the spacing tests in the Turner, are you aligning those wellbores parallel or perpendicular to that old Cretaceous Seaway?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Most of those are running in a north-south direction throughout the play. And we're spacing those \u2013 in the areas that we have two horizons in Upper and Lower Turner, there's a staggered pattern. And so it's not just about one horizon. It's understanding the different horizons and what the interaction is between the two.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","In the Eagle Ford, I realize per your comments, you haven't had discussions with the new operator. But what rig count or level of activity do you think would be optimal for Devon in an accelerated case? And if this were to happen, would you reduce capital elsewhere in the portfolio, or would you use your free cash flow or balance sheet to increase activity in the Eagle Ford?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","We're currently running two rigs there, Brian. I think in an optimized scenario, we'd run three rigs. And so frankly, that's not a large incremental capital spend if you look at the overall size of the company as Devon. So it's barely a material question, I guess you'd say, as to whether you'd drop activity elsewhere or use some of the incremental cash flow. If we were going to do that, that would be a 2019 event. We anticipate that would not be a 2018 event that we would change the program.","And those returns, just to refresh everybody, are as strong as anywhere in our portfolio, particularly given the fact that we're getting WTI-plus pricing on those barrels. And we've done a great job with locking in well above the current market pricing in the Delaware Basin, incidentally obviously also in our heavy oil in Canada, but still not as strong as we see in the Eagle Ford. So with those flow rates compared to the costs, they compete extremely well. But we don't see rapidly increasing the capital, but we do see one incremental rig would probably be helpful in 2019.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to the company's CapEx. You reiterated that you expect CapEx to trend towards the top end of guidance. Could you give us a little bit more color on the push and pull there, what you're seeing on the inflationary front, what you've done from an activity perspective relative to your expectations and whether the Permian completion crew on for less time during the second half is helping to keep CapEx in check, and what you think the risk around the top end of guidance is to the upside and downside?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Brian, number one, I think as we mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, our supply chain and our operating teams have got a three-year plan that we are sticking really close to that allows us to go out and secure services for an extended period of time compared to a lot of our peers. So we feel like we have mitigated any of the stress or the inflationary factors that others are probably seeing in the 2018 timeframe. So we're doing some really good work. We're not outspending the cost and schedule management of our projects, as Wade and Rick have already talked about, have been on track. So we're doing really well there.","We think our OBO spend has actually been an increase and a little bit of a surprise to us early this year, and starting to see some benefits from that. So that's really keeping us at the top end of the curve. But I think what you'll see is we had a very hot Q1 and have tapered back a bit, as you noticed, a 10% reduction in Q2, and we'll manage our spend in the second half of the year according to our original plan. And we just think this exercise is good discipline, and it's there to maximize the return of our projects.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Basically, Brian, we're executing our plan a little ahead of schedule. We have a little extra OBO spending. It's not on the cost side because we're managing that extremely well.","And certainly the decision not to add a third frac crew in the Delaware was not driven around trying to stay within capital. It was driven by a returns decision. And so basically, we are able to have one frac crew, I think, Rick, you'd say per four rigs that we have working out there, and we're able to keep up with it. If we added a third frac crew right now for just a few rigs, basically what that would mean is when we come early 2019, we would have two long-term frac crews, one of which probably wouldn't have any work to do given the timing of all of our schedule. So from a return standpoint, that doesn't make sense. And so it makes more sense to stay with the two who can manage the eight rigs. Now we do see going to three frac crews in 2019 as we continue to increase the activity.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of from Subash Chandra from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. The Showboat, I'm just curious if the results there have any impact on the prior exit rate guidance in STACK, or if it has any sort of tangible impact on your growth expectations in the intermediate term.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","I'd say it has no impact on our growth expectations under our Vision 2020. We have enough projects of different types and high quality that this, our Vision 2020 is absolutely totally intact.","Now, could it perhaps have a minor amount of downward pressure? The question might be asked too. Why didn't we raise oil production guidance, I guess, for the remainder of the year? And admittedly, because of the Showboat issues, we thought it was more prudent until we see more data and we get the Bernhardt and Horsefly wells on to not raise production guidance, even though we exceeded it in Q2. So yes, throughout 2018 I would say that that did impact our short-term thinking on raising production guidance.","But we have a very deep inventory of projects throughout the company that the 2020 Vision and our growth that we anticipate in oil production, U.S. light oil production, is absolutely intact. We're seeing outperformance, for instance, as we talked about, in the Delaware Basin. We're seeing some very strong upsides for the Powder River Basin, great returns from the wells we're seeing in the Eagle Ford as well. So maybe a short-term timing impact on production, but absolutely the potential that we chose to guide conservatively with regards to. But no implications at all to the long-term vision of the company.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, I appreciate that answer. My follow up is, I apologize if I missed this in your earlier commentary, the Turner spacing test. So what is that architecture? What is the spacing test exactly? And would this be one of the first spacing tests in the Turner \u2013 in the play?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","This is Rick Gideon again. There have been different spacing tests. And again, I want us to be careful on which part of the field we're in, whether you have an Upper Turner, a Lower Turner, or a Middle Turner. We've tested between two and four wells per section in each of those horizons. And so these latest tests were two wells per horizon or four wells per section and an upper and lower. I think you've seen some competitors do very similar testing. And as I said, we tested at four earlier in the year.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thank you for that clarification. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo from TPH. Your line is open.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Dave and team.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","The first question I wanted to ask is with regards to STACK completions. You mentioned that you're working to mitigate some of the parent well impacts after viewing the initial data on the Showboat project. I was curious if you could talk about some of the completion changes you might be envisioning, if at all, around proppant loading, cluster spacing, and fluid use that might help optimize development on a go-forward perspective.","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Matt, I think we are in the middle of evaluating the specific completion design we had on Showboat and have already taken those learnings and started to apply them even to Bernhardt and Horsefly, which have already been stimulated. And so that's a pretty active process for us.","I would say the broad trend is we are a little bit more of a macro scale. We're looking at specific reservoir targets and their rock properties, and we are beginning to more proactively adjust the stimulation parameters based on each of those reservoir targets. Again, some of that's learnings from Showboat. Some of that's learnings that we saw in other projects.","On maybe a more specific stimulation approach, I would say that what we're doing is we're beginning to apply much more limited entry type approaches. We've tested a few things in Horsefly and Bernhardt that we think have promise around different technologies that allow us to really target exactly what part of the reservoir, what part of the lateral. And a couple of those is we've tested some NCS sleeves in one of these projects that we think actually has a lot of potential for us. So you'll see us continue to evolve that in much more of a reservoir-by-reservoir specific targeted way.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you. And then my follow-up is a question regarding Jackfish. I was wondering if you could provide additional color on the maintenance requirements that were identified that took down Q3 guidance to some extent. And as we look forward to Q4, any color or context around how we should think about the peak rates mentioned in the ops report?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Matt, I've got to remind us, the maturity of our Jackfish 1 project is different than it was probably the last turnaround. In fact, we've been producing J1 over ten years now, so our turnarounds at J1 were more extensive than they had been at some of the younger projects. You've got to remember, we're operating some of these steam lines at 450 to 500 degrees F. So in the process of cooling and heating these lines, we tend to see movement, and those lines are designed to move. We have pipe racks to guide those lines through there.","During the ramp-up period for J1 after the turnaround was over, we saw increased stress in one particular area, so we immediately took the project back down and went through an extensive evaluation and mechanical integrity inspection. And at the same time we were doing that, we took a good look at one of our oil lines as well. And so that really deferred our startup at J1 by about 15 days. It also deferred the startup of a couple of new pads out there. So we're getting a little bit of a slow start in Q3 associated with those couple of events. And then as we ramp the project back up, we fully expect to grow back into something near the historical rates that we've seen in the past.","But again, you've got to always recognize that as these projects mature, there's going to be slightly more maintenance associated with them. And the SOR [Steam\/Oil Ratio] is just slowly starting to creep up. So there's a little bit less steam capacity that we have available to work with. Overall, the projects are working extremely well. And outside of these two unplanned events, we're back to operating as normal.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Biju Perincheril from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, good morning. Dave, looking through your various spacing pilots in the STACK, Delaware, Powder, it looks like the approach you're taking is that the initial projects, the spacing is something on the aggressive side, and then you're working backwards. And I don't know if that's a fair assessment. But if it is, is the idea that you can get to the final answer in fewer iterations, are you getting more information in the pilot that actually has some interaction between wells?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Absolutely, I think you've nailed it. We want to learn early because we recognize in all of these plays that the vast majority of the development is in front of us. And so we have, just as we did, if you go back even a few years ago on completions, and when you may have said historically we're pumping 600 pounds of sand per lateral foot, we could have easily taken the approach to go to 800 or 1,000 and test out what it is there. But we took the approach there that says let's go on to a much higher concentration, up to 3,000 pounds or so, and learn early where the upper limits are, and then we can dial back a little bit.","I think you can take to a large degree that analogy and apply it to what we're doing with our spacing tests. We chose to learn early. Frankly, we also collected a huge amount of data on the Showboat project, which we think is going to help inform us as well. And we recognize that it was aggressive, the spacing, but we'd rather if we were going to have an issue, we'd rather learn that early versus just slowly, incrementally up the spacing and get large \u2013 long distance into the development of the overall play before we really learn what's optimum.","So there's some pain with this process, we admit that. We're feeling it a little bit today. There's no question about that. But we think that overall, that is the right long-term decision, and leads to a higher returns and higher value in the long run.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it, that's very helpful. Do you think at this point if you're looking at STACK or the Delaware that you \u2013 how close do you think you are to that, call it, optimum spacing?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","I'm going to let the guys that are a little bit closer \u2013 I think you're going to hear an answer that's fairly granular. It's going to vary still across the play and across the formations. I don't think there is an easy answer, and I think we're still \u2013 we're learning a lot more, but I think we'll continue to learn, but we've certainly accelerated the learning. So, Wade, do you want to kick it off and maybe Rick will make a comment from the Delaware perspective?","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure. So from a STACK perspective, we are systematically testing multiple density frameworks and spacing stacking frameworks. So as you saw, the next two projects that will come online within a couple of weeks here in August, Bernhardt and Horsefly, are testing slightly lower density than the Showboat.","We have other projects that you'll see over the next six months where we may only test one layer, the Upper Meramec. And so that will vary across the play.","Ultimately, we think as we approach the end of the year, we're going to have a number of operated tests under our belt that will range in spacing anywhere from 6 to 12 wells per section. And from that, we'll be able to essentially narrow down what the go-forward development plan will look like.","But I think to Dave's point, that's unlikely to be just one model for the entire play. We see that these reservoir targets change quality as we move around the play. We know that pressure, conditions, and even fluid windows change. And so we will ultimately have a fairly customized development framework for multiple sub areas of the play. And we think as we approach the start of next year, we'll be in a much more solid place to lay that out, both internally and externally.","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Biju, this is Rick Gideon. For the Delaware, very similar. What I'll tell you is it's dependent, as stated, whether it be in the Todd area, Thistle, Cotton Draw, Rattlesnake, or Potato Basin, the five areas that we talked about.","What I'll tell you also is it ties very much to flow units. It's not just a single horizon. It's not just the spacing. It's the staggered pattern. It's in the Leonard. Whether you have A, B, and C, how many wells does it take to most efficiently drain that and have the highest rate of return while preserving value?","We're probably, in the Bone Spring, we're probably the most mature as we talk about it. Leonard following, and Rattlesnake is where we're doing a lot of the testing right now in the Wolfcamp, which is probably less mature on the spacing. And as we take a look in the Wolfcamp, we have to keep in mind that we're looking at your Third Bone Spring, your Wolfcamp X and Y, your Wolfcamp 110, 120, and 130 as one single flow unit. So as we model that, we have to understand the stimulated rock volume by the types of jobs we're pumping, and what is that horizontal and vertical reaction between those wells.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Biju, this is Tony. I just wanted to highlight too that we probably have on the operated side alone, we probably have a library of 6,000 horizontal wells that we worked in. And the majority of those have had parent\/child relationship issues that we've worked through. We're going to continue to learn in all of these plays. The technology continues to change. The guys are getting smarter. New data just leads to new developments. We're seeing some of the best completions we've made in the Eagle Ford today. We're seeing some of the best completions we made in the Cana-Woodford project towards the end of 850 wells. Same thing in North Texas in the Barnett. We're seeing some of the best wells now after 3,000 or 4,000 wells have been drilled. So this is not a single answer that you're going to hear from us. We're going to continue to learn and grow.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Very helpful, I appreciate that detailed answer. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Based on everything that you said, and thanks for all the detail, it does seem that it's difficult for you, for a couple of reasons, to accelerate in the Eagle Ford or the Delaware much more than the pace you're already running. So I wonder. Does that mean that we're very, very dependent on results coming through in the way you've described? And I totally understand that you're saying that there's 90% of the work still to be done. But do you think that the risk has become higher on the STACK in terms of its importance for you and Vision 2020? Thanks.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","No, Paul. I don't feel that way. We do plan to have an escalating program in the Delaware Basin as we move into 2019. We haven't laid out the specific plans, but I think we're anticipating having on the order of three or four more rigs working out there. That's directionally the way we're thinking right now. We're looking at adding more rigs in the Powder River Basin. Tony talked about that. So no, I don't think that's true. I think that we've had outstanding results in both of those areas as well.","The Eagle Ford we're not counting on for significant growth, but we do think we can stay \u2013 keep production flat there with three rigs, and we think that will be optimum. Having said that, we do anticipate STACK is going to continue to grow as well. So I don't want to talk down the STACK at all because we're learning very quickly and we're adjusting and we anticipate a very successful STACK program going forward. It is going to be an important part of our future.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Understood. Thanks, David. Can I just ask a follow-up, which is totally unrelated really? Has your hedging strategy changed subsequent to Vision 2020? Thanks.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","No, it hasn't. We fundamentally think that, first off, that we want to have a consistent and predictable capital program because we think that having a consistent program where you're not ramping up activity or not ramping it down is how you deliver the highest returns. If you rapidly increase the capital program, you may not be ready from a technical standpoint or an infrastructure standpoint to be able to deliver optimum returns. And if you ramp down the capital program, you lose some of the efficiencies that you get with a certain level of scale on these \u2013 when you have multiple rigs working, for instance, on an individual development. And so you lose some of those efficiencies if you ramp it down significantly.","So with that thought process in mind, we think it's important to underpin the cash flows of the company to make sure that we have a certain level of consistency in cash flows to be able to fund the capital program. And so we are doing this through a systematic program largely, where we're reaching out 18 months and hedging production at any given time. We do leave some room for discretionary hedging as well, but it's all within the context of underpinning the confidence in what prices we're going to receive. Obviously, we're hedging on the differentials too, which has provided quite a bit of benefit for us this year in terms of pricing. But we think that's fundamentally important to deliver consistent, strong returns with our programs.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One thing I was curious about is the importance of sequencing your drilling, then completions, then putting pads on production across the section and then across multiple sections, and any differences that require sequencing between what you've seen in the Delaware, STACK, and now the Powder.","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Hi, David. This is Rick Gideon. Absolutely there's some difference in sequencing, and the teams do a great job on the planning side of this, whether it be with our frac crews, rigs, or other services. It's very dependent on how many horizons you're going after. In the Delaware, we've done some tests where you're hitting six different horizons.","What I'll tell you is through our learnings and understanding the flow units, you'll see some areas, especially in the Delaware, where you'll see some smaller projects where we develop one flow unit, move away and then come back and develop the next flow unit to better utilize our surface facilities and infrastructure within the field, as well as water, et cetera. So I think as we move through this, you're going to continue to see how we change based on spacing, but based on flow units also.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Just to follow up on that, how do you think about the scale of required capital and working capital that is invested and what's required for \u2013 a company the size of Devon can fund it, but maybe smaller companies, that becomes pretty important and pretty meaningful as you think about that fixed horizon development and the number of wells potentially. Have you done any math on how much capital you actually put into the ground before you turn it on production?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","We do. We've done a lot of math on I'd say what is the optimum size development to optimize the rates of return. I think we probably have the capital to fund whatever is the right answer, but we do think that there is an optimum size in many cases to what optimizes the rates of return.","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","This is Wade. I would just jump in real quick and say we're absolutely focused on the fact that time is money, and so we're very much focused on eliminating as much float in the schedule or white space in the schedule as we can. But to Rick's point, this often is a very technical set of judgments. For instance, on the two Showboat sections, there were six pads, and the team had a very specific order of which pads to stimulate and which pads to flow back in what order because of the impact that they would have on surface operations and even subsurface operations. And so it's an area of intense work for us.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's helpful, and just one final. What are your current well costs? You gave us the Delaware \u2013 or you gave us the STACK. What are the Delaware and Eagle Ford current costs?","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Dependent on the horizon in the Delaware again and dependent upon some of these new, we're in the $7 million range on a lot of these down to about $5 million \u2013 $5.5 million on some of the shallower zones. We're very early as we move into the Wolfcamp, but we are seeing progression of that lowering.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","David, the Eagle Ford wells lately, we're putting a little bit larger sand loading in these wells, and they're running about $6.5 million.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thank you.","[0FH2DB-E Scott Coody]","All right, we're now at the top of the hour.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you, Tiffany, and I'd like to wish everyone good morning as well and welcome to our quarterly conference call. As has become our custom, today's call will largely consist of Q&A, so I hope you've had a chance to look through the third quarter earnings release, including the forward-looking guidance, as well as our detailed ops report. Also on the call today are Dave Hager, President and CEO, Tony Vaughn, Executive Vice President of E&P, Tom Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and a few other members of our senior management team.","Finally, I'll remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call will contain plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates, which are forward-looking statements and under U.S. securities law. Those comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results might differ materially. For a review of risk factors relating to these statements, please see our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent 10-Q filings.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone. In the third quarter, Devon continued its trend of outperforming expectations and delivered another excellent performance. Our strategy of operating in North America's best resource plays coupled with a focus on best-in-class execution is generating top-tier results in each of those basins. In our U.S. resource plays, where the majority of capital is being deployed, well performance has consistently exceeded type curve expectations and peer results through higher production rates, lower capital costs, and reduced operating expenses. This operational momentum combined with a strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity positions us as well as anyone to manage through the current industry conditions.","These strong operating results translated into several noteworthy highlights for the quarter, including record oil production. We raised our 2015 oil growth outlook for the second time this year. We controlled costs, with operating expenses coming in significantly below guidance, and we are now on pace to save $1 billion of operating and capital costs in 2015 versus our original guidance expectations.","We expect this outstanding operational performance to continue as we head into 2016. To deliver maximum capital efficiency with today's market conditions, we plan to preserve operational momentum by dynamically allocating capital to the highest returning, lowest risk development opportunities in each of our core resource plays. Although we are still working through the details of our 2016 capital program, directionally we expect our E&P capital spend to range from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Other non-E&P capital requirements and dividends are expected to total around $1 billion next year.","Importantly, we are focused on balancing capital investment with available cash flows. Our capital programs have tremendous flexibility, and we can rapidly respond to market conditions. We have minimal exposure to long-term service contracts. We have no long-cycle project commitments and negligible leasehold expiration issues.","In 2016 the majority of E&P capital will once again be focused in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Anadarko, and Rockies, the plays with the best economics in our portfolio. With the significant improvements we have seen with well productivity and cost efficiencies, we expect this disciplined, oil-focused capital program to generate low single-digit oil growth in 2016.","We will finalize our budget in the coming months and provide detailed guidance with our fourth quarter earnings release. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and investment-grade credit ratings are key factors during this period of depressed commodity prices.","Additionally, we expect distributions from our investment in EnLink to approach $300 million next year, and we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to transact on the sale of Access Pipeline in the first half of 2016. Combined with cash flow from our top-tier upstream assets, we have reliable sources of funding for Devon's 2016 capital program without taking on incremental debt.","So in summary, I am quite pleased with the outstanding results Devon has delivered, and I fully expect this trend of outperformance to continue going forward. We have a great collection of world-class assets, and we will continue to get the most out of these assets with superior execution, and we have one of the more advantaged capital structures in the E&P space. As we continue to execute on our disciplined business plan, we are well positioned to generate outsized returns for our shareholders for many years to come.","With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Thanks, Dave.

Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dave, I wonder if I could pick up on your capital question, first of all. So low single-digit oil growth, you obviously have a tailwind from the momentum you've got in the oil sands. So I'm just trying to understand. Does that low single digit mean that the Lower 48 grows as well, or is the growth predominantly from the oil sands? And I've got a follow-up, please.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Doug. We obviously do have tailwinds as we move forward into 2016 in the oil sands in Canada, but we also have good growth opportunities in the Delaware Basin. We're confident we're going to be growing volumes there in Q4 of 2015, and we see that momentum continuing on into 2016. We're still finalizing our capital allocation, so we're not going to break out the exact numbers at this point. But we still see a lot of great growth opportunities in the U.S. And it's really just a matter of how much capital \u2013 exactly how much capital we put to those programs to see what the growth percentage will be in both areas.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, but just to be clear though, when you talk about low single digit, are you trying to signal to us that the Lower 48 will see oil growth as well as the oil sands?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","All I'm signaling is that overall as a company we're going to have low single-digit oil growth. And we'll break that out for you, Doug, on the Q4 earnings call.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. My follow-up is there's obviously a lot of resource detail, type curves, and so on this quarter. I'd like to home in on one issue, if I may, which is the increase in the unrisked locations, particularly the Wolfcamp, given that you still haven't provided any risked locations there but you have increased the unrisked locations. It's now the biggest backlog, I guess, unrisked backlog in your portfolio. So I'm just trying to understand. What is it going to take for you to start more aggressively allocating capital to that area? And how do the economics stack up, for example, relative to the Delaware and the Bone Spring? And I'll leave it there, thanks.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Good morning, Doug. This is Tony Vaughn here. I'll take a stab at this. Doug, as we've approached our work in the Delaware Basin, we've really highlighted the second Bone Spring and the Delaware Sands as probably being the two most prolific from a rate-of-return perspective. That's where a lot of our focus has been through 2015. We had done enough appraisal work to start building our 2016 program going forward, but you'll still have a nice component of the second Bone Spring with very high returns. We'll probably see us have a little bit more influence from the Leonard interval in 2016. We've got that appraised. You can see in the operating report we've had some good Leonard wells that are coming on. So we'll have a couple of, what I would anticipate anyway, a couple of rig lines dedicated to the Leonard.","We're also contemplating really how to appropriately develop the stacked-pay sands. And the Wolfcamp's got up to four different intervals. We have assessed that. We're getting a lot of industry activity on the Texas side of the basin moving right up to our play. Now we're starting to see the industry \u2013 and then Devon has drilled about four or five Wolfcamp wells this year. So we're understanding the play. We still find that the economics for the Wolfcamp are slightly disadvantaged in comparison to the second Bone Spring, the Delaware, and the Leonard sands just because of the drilling and the complete costs.","So we're incorporating that. I still don't think it will have a large influence on our 2016 activity, with the one exception of when we get towards the latter parts of 2016, we will have \u2013 we will be incorporating, for lack of a better way to put it, more of a super-pad type concept, which will be incorporating the Wolfcamp all the way up through the Delaware Sands and really trying to take a holistic development concept into our business.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Doug, I think the challenge \u2013 I'd just add. We have such strong results and what we think is a little bit better economics in the Bone Spring and now the Leonard and to some degree the Delaware Sands that we haven't been as actively developing the Wolfcamp. We know it's there. I look at it as having a lot of option value out there for us right now. But the resource is there, there's no question. We're just focusing on dollars on the highest return.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's quite a choice there, Dave. Thanks very much indeed.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks and good morning, guys. I was wondering maybe if we could stay on the Delaware for a minute. Can you update us on progress with infrastructure out there and what you all think needs to be done as you go forward in growth? Obviously, the growth that you guys are projecting for 4Q in the Delaware is pretty substantial. Could you just talk about what EnLink is doing there for you guys and what you plan here over the next 12 to 18 months?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think we'll let Tony answer that, and I may add on if there's anything additional.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Okay, I'll be happy to, Dave. Scott, I think it's a great question. As we've talked about in the past, infrastructure in the Delaware Basin has been a challenge. Kind of is specific or more localized in different areas. We've had some substantial relief in that as we've tied in a large portion of what we call our Cotton Draw area into a DCP plant called Zia II. That has allowed us to move a lot more volumes. We're also starting to see a few more right-of-way permit approvals come forward, which is going to allow us to continue to bring wells on. So it's getting better I think in 2016. The outlook is much better. We are doing a really good job of planning our business I think to take advantage of the infrastructure and the permits that we have in place right now.","You know to go back and take a look at our Delaware performance on a standalone basis, it's been a little bit lumpy. And in Q1, our volume growth from Q1 into Q2, it was exceptional. If I remember right, it was over 20% growth just on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Q3, we had less development wells that we brought on. The timing of those wells wasn't positive. And again, the tie-in to the Zia plant caused a lot of starts and stops to our business, so we had a lot of downtime. So really our oil volume growth, we actually saw a little bit of a downturn in Q3 on oil volume growth.","I'll have to remind you, though, that the wells that we continue to bring on are every bit as good as they've been in the past. As we look forward into Q4, we'll have more of an influence from the low-risk development type work that we do in southern Lea and Eddy counties. We've got less impact of infrastructure that's coming to us by the end of the year. And we're working with the BLM. The BLM is still going to be a little bit of a challenge there for permit approvals. But really, just look at the Delaware over the course of the year, and I think we saw something like 30% volume growth from year over year and I think about 50% oil growth. So it's still our most active area and one that we have a lot of emphasis on.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I appreciate that color, thanks. And my follow-up is on the Meramec play. It seems like you guys and the industry as well in general have seen better results, and you all pointed out to I guess lower well cost on top of that. And can you just talk about like how that fits into the portfolio on a rate-of-return basis and where that inventory could go? I mean right now, I think you've talked about 500 risked locations. But ultimately with some downspacing potential, where do you think that could go?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Scott, we're real pleased with the Meramec, as is the industry right now. And we've participated in I believe about 20 wells to date. The industry's got about 100 wells down in the Meramec. I think in a lot of ways, you could look at the Meramec play as already moved through the appraisal process and really is getting into more of the development phase. When we look at the commercial expectation for the Meramec, it really competes in our mind with our top-tier returns from DeWitt County, the Parkman in the Powder River Basin, and also the southern portions of Lea and Eddy County in the heart of the Delaware Basin.","So we think the Meramec is going to be another top-tier asset for us. We've characterized about 500 locations there. In my own mind, that's conservative. And as we drill that out, it will have the potential to greatly improve. So it's going to be one of our go-to areas as we go forward. It's slightly more commercial than, say, the good work that we do in the Woodford right now and the Cana area.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, and will you be willing to provide a multiple on where that 500 locations could go? Are we talking double, triple? What do you think the upside range on that could be?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","I'd probably be hesitant to quantify that right now. I think it's still early in the play for us to do that. And we'll keep some meat on the bone there and communicate as we go forward, but we'll continue to keep you abreast of that. But in my own mind from a technical perspective, I'm highly encouraged that that play will continue to develop for Devon.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Appreciate it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning and congratulations on the strong performance. My first question was your continued LOE cost reduction is quite impressive. Can you rank order what can continue to drive costs down going forward?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","This is Tony again. I'll talk a little bit about that. One of the things, Jeff, that we knew going into the downturn here that LOE would be a little bit sticky and would not drop as rapid as, say, our capital efficiencies could bring. As you can see from our operating report this particular quarter, we've had outstanding results on LOE in terms of both dollars and LOE per BOE. So I think we're really moving right into the portion of the work that we're doing that's offering the most drop in costs right now. We're optimistic that this will be sustainable and will move into 2016.","So specific to your question, I think a lot of the work that we are doing, building out infrastructure in the Delaware Basin, Anadarko Basin, some of the heavily, more intensely capital areas right now are really providing a benefit in our ability to handle water both more efficiently and more cost effectively. So we're handling a lot more fluid these days. And so I'd say water is the big component of that. I'll also say our focus on artificial lift is really having the opportunity to drive costs down now. We're putting a lot more attention to our chemical programs, which is reducing our intervention rate, reducing workover costs going forward.","So we're optimistic; we're not done with our LOE work. We've got a lot of joint efforts between our supply chain group and our technical teams, looking for not only efficiencies, but also taking advantage of the market conditions. So I think I'd look for an improvement as we go into 2016.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","As we focus our dollars really into just more pure development, and so we're concentrating our drilling in specific areas, that's what really allows you in many cases to lower the LOE, where you don't have scattered drilling across a larger area. But instead, you're in a very concentrated geographic location where there are synergies in the infrastructure that you have to put in from well to well. And that's what we're doing largely in 2016, and one of the reasons we're optimistic we can continue to attack the LOE.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thank you for that thorough answer. My other question is, this quarter's operation report on the Leonard Shale expanded on its three-zone potential. Can you give us some idea of what percentage of your 60-acre position has three-zone potential? Does most of it have two-zone potential, and is there any meaningful mix differences between these zones?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","You know what, I can't give you a specific answer for that. I would think in our Leonard, when we look at it, I know a good portion of it has got the two-zone potential, and I think there's some general localized area that had the three-zone potential as well. When we characterize the opportunity going forward in our unrisked locations, we're thinking we could see up to 20 wells per section in three different zones, so high confidence in two intervals with some localized areas of three different intervals in the Leonard.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Do they all pretty much behave the same way in terms of oil mix, NGL, that sort of thing?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, I think it's probably a little early to comment on that. We don't have just a lot of specific data to give you more of a fact-based answer. So it's probably a little bit early to define that.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, that's fair.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","You would think intuitively they probably would because they're very similar depths, but we do need to do some more appraisal to know the answer for sure.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","That's fair. We'll look forward to that. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning and congratulations on all the good stuff that's happening across the company. I just had a question around CapEx, if I may. Your guidance for 4Q E&P is $800 million to $900 million, and you've got $2 billion to $2.5 billion E&P for next year, which is another 30% reduction. I just wanted to get a sense. Obviously, industry deflation has already happened a lot this year. How do you get those costs down further? And maybe give us some sense of how much is deflation and how much is activity from here. Thanks.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","This is Tony. Let me describe I think what you're probably seeing in there. So in Q4, we have what I would classify or call non-repeatable type investments. And we have a fair amount of exploration activity and appraisal activity that really were initiated in the beginning of the quarter and will be essentially closed out by the time we get into 2016. We're doing some appraisal work on the North Texas horizontal refracs. We've got the ability to control that. We also have some non-recurring capital items in Jackfish associated with three new pads, one at J1 and two at J2. So there's a fair amount of spend in Q4 that won't be repeated in 2016.","I would also have to tell you that when you look at the operations report, we commented generally on how many rigs we had running at the close of the quarter. But since then, we've dropped rigs in the Rockies and the Powder down to one. We've dropped down from 10 rigs in the Delaware down to eight and may go to seven. We're still trying to contemplate what our 2016 spend is, but we know that capital spend in 2016 is going to be dramatically different than it is in 2015. We're very aware of that. We've got a good history of performing to our capital forecasts. So we're on top of it, Ed, and we're working it down to be consistent with the business environment that we'll talk more about in the next call.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then coming back to the Delaware, these super-pads are going to be presumably very efficient. So I don't know if you've got a sense of, other than the deflation in the industry, what cost reduction you could get as you go to full development mode of three zones in the Leonard and Bone Spring and other zones.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Ed, we've got a project team that was stood up I think probably a quarter ago, and they're really trying to understand and explore the opportunity there. It's really a lot of different scenarios and variations that they're contemplating, so it's probably early to comment on specifically what our expectation would be. But I think just to describe that, we're getting ready to pilot in the fourth quarter of 2016. We'll be active on a first super-pad, where we'll have up to 12 wells in a quarter section. And as Dave mentioned just a moment ago, the efficiencies gained on that kind of a development are substantial we believe.","So we could start turning our operations to having less permitting obligations or challenges just because our surface disturbance would be much less. We could see the opportunity for batch drilling going forward, not really having to have time associated with substantial rig moves since everything would be on a pad. We would have the ability to do simultaneous operations and have some fracking work going on while we could be producing. So we're trying to understand and define that, and we'll have a keen eye on maximizing present value or returns as we think through that. So it will be a balance between size and scale and efficiency and keeping some predictability in our rate growth and cash flow growth that we'll be focused on.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And just to be clear, the rigs you're dropping in the Delaware, that's really because of efficiency gains, or are you lowering the number of completions?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","It is associated with efficiency gains. And Ed, that's really our growth area and high focused area. We'll keep all the rigs running in the low-risk development areas that are offering the greatest returns. So we're starting to get so much efficiencies out of the rigs that we've got now just from continuous improvement. I guess I'd also say both on the, not only just on the rig activity, but also on our frac crews as well. So the pace of our business is ever increasing, like it always has.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'd say, Ed, that type discussion holds true not only in the Delaware, but also holds true in many of our areas where you've seen throughout our operations report where we have been improving the drilling efficiency significantly. We've done it in the Eagle Ford. We're doing it in the Anadarko Basin and the Cana and the Meramec. So we are getting a lot more productivity per rig. And frankly, we probably need to get away from talking about number of rigs at some point and talk about number of wells that we drill because that's a much better indicator of our activity levels. We're just getting a lot more productivity than previously you see. You just don't need as many rigs to accomplish a program.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Kissel with Howard Weil. Your line is open.","Peter Francis Freeman Kissel - Scotia Howard Weil","Hi, guys. How are you? Thanks for taking my questions. Just to start off with maybe Tony, following on the prior question that you alluded to the answer here, but with regards to Jackfish, what's the total spend level in 2015 now that you're coming close to the end of the year? And looking at 2016, is that $150 million to $200 million still a base case spend level we should be expecting?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","I think, Peter, if I recall right, we're going to spend roughly about $600 million, $650 million in 2015. We're still putting our thoughts together for 2016. But that number will go materially down, probably in the range of something approaching $300 million, maybe a little less than $300 million if I recall.","Peter Francis Freeman Kissel - Scotia Howard Weil","Got you. Okay, thanks, Tony, and then maybe more of a broad-based question. Portfolio optimization, rationalization has been very successful for you guys over the last two years. Can you please just update us on where you stand with the upstream assets, in particular any sales you're looking at, any acquisitions? I know that's a little tricky given your focus on preserving capital at this time. And then maybe how does your ownership of EnLink units factor in here as a source of capital?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Peter. This is Dave. First off, we're very happy with our portfolio. We think that we have really significantly transformed the portfolio over the past few years divesting of the Gulf of Mexico and international, the Canadian conventional, the non-core U.S. So now we really try to focus our assets in the best portion of the best plays in onshore North America, and we think now we have that kind of portfolio. So we're first off very, very satisfied with where we stand.","If we were to look to add anything, and we always are out there evaluating if there's anything worthwhile to consider, if we were to add anything, it would have to be something that would compete for capital internally with our own opportunities, which again are located in the best parts of some of the best plays. And so it would have to be very high quality before we would consider adding anything.","There are always some things that I think, especially right now, that are not attracting capital in our portfolio, significant amounts of capital. And if that condition persists over a number of years, then we will consider moving those assets out of the portfolio. We think we can generate the most value when we are investing funds and are getting returns significantly above the cost of capital. And so if we're not in a position where we think we'll be investing in an area for the foreseeable future, then over time you can see that as a candidate for divestment. That's the philosophy we've always taken and that's the philosophy we'll continue to take.","As far as EnLink as a source of funds, we really like our position in EnLink a lot. We think it's a strong company. We think the company is poised to grow. We have no plans for any current unit sales in EnLink. We look at that asset just as we look at all the other assets in our portfolio.","Peter Francis Freeman Kissel - Scotia Howard Weil","All right, thanks, Dave, and congrats on a great update.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Peter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yes, hi. I was wondering if you could give more detail on the enhanced completions in the Bone Spring, what you did different.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think, John, this is Dave. I'll kick it off to start with. I think the main thing that we have been doing over the past few quarters, you've seen the results, is to really increase the sand concentrations significantly. We went from around 600 pounds of sand per foot a few quarters ago, we experimented up to as high as 3,000 pounds of sand per lateral foot. I think we've backed off now to what we think is the optimum amount of sand, which in most cases in the basin part of the play for the Bone Spring is probably somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 pounds of sand per lateral foot. But I think, Tony, you might have a little bit more detail on that. The main thing is we are really just concentrating on the highest areas and just getting great returns in those areas by concentrating on some of the most productive areas for the Bone Spring.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","I think that's right, Dave. So, John, it's really a combination of a lot of things, but we've got some great work that's ongoing with our subsurface teams. We're integrating all of our data much more rapidly and better with a lot more influence from the data. I think we've told you in the past, we're taking a lot more full-bore cores and pressure, and we've got fiber optics. And so we're having a much better understanding about the subsurface. We're also incorporating that into our frac design and modeling work.","And then finally, I'll point out that the execution of our work on the completion side of the business is also dramatically improving. We've stood up our 24-hour, seven day a week WellCon center probably about 18 months ago, and that now has stations involving all of our frac operations and flowback operations. So we've got a unique \u2013 what I think is a complete package that's driving the results that we see.","I think what I'm most proud about from our technical teams is over the past two quarters, we really own the top completions per public data in all the basins that we're working. So we're really doing a lot of good technical work with good execution that's driving our results up. And so I think if you go back and look at our first quarter of this year, second quarter, we don't have third quarter data in, but we probably have at least the top 50% to top 70% \u2013 75% of the top 10 IPs in the basins we work. So we're doing a lot of good, thoughtful work that's leading to that.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Last one from me is on the Parkman shot of 3-D, when will that actually be usable, first half?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","John, we've got the data in-house, and it's being incorporated into our work right now. We've actually got great 3-D coverage across that entire Parkman\/Turner play. It's influencing what we do. If you go back and look at the work that our technical teams have delivered, we're drilling long laterals there and exceeding our type curve performance. So all that data is yielding some outstanding results.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In the Anadarko Basin, you talked about 60 wells coming online from the Gordon Row area. Can you just refresh us on your working interest there, and then how you think about the production impact over the next few quarters and what the oil versus gas versus NGLs mix is likely to be?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Brian, this is Tony. You're right, we're working on the Gordon Row right now and doing some really good, thoughtful work. We have a rough working interest of 50%. We're in the AMI with Cimarex and working that relationship really well. Our percent oil cut is consistent with what we've been seeing. It's starting to get a little bit more rich, but we're going to see about \u2013 I think we've actually put on our IP at about 80 million-plus \u2013 80 million to 90 million cubic feet per day gross already from the wells that we have delivered into production right now. And I think the ratio of liquids and gas is consistent with what we've been seeing.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","We have our type curves out there, Brian, and we have about 5% condensate on it. I don't have the type curve sitting in front of me. I know it's in all of our investor presentations. So I can't give you the NGL and gas, but I think Scott has it here. It's 40% NGLs and that means about 55% gas. Coody just gave me the word here.",".","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. And then to maybe a little bit more off the beaten path, you highlighted in the ops update the horizontal refrac opportunity in the Barnett Shale. Can you just talk about how committed you are to spending capital on those in the context of all else that's in your portfolio, and whether that lowers the decline rate from the relatively consistent decline that we've been seeing on a sequential basis in the Barnett, or whether it just keeps it at that level?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Brian, we are committed to understanding the opportunity. And so I would say that we're trying to fund enough opportunities or get enough repeatable results in the play to understand what that development opportunity would be. So it's something that we're putting some investment dollars into in Q4 of this year. That will probably carry into Q1, really just trying to define and understand what the refrac opportunity would be, not only in North Texas, but it's a great library for us to understand what it would be across the rest of our portfolio.","So when you look at it, I think we've commented on that it's got meaningful returns. We probably need, at the low gas price that we're seeing now, we'd like to see more gas price to have it compete effectively with some of the other good opportunities that we have. So we're really just trying to understand the opportunity through the appraisal process, and then we'll take a pause and see how that competes.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys, and strong results again. My first question on the Access dropdown, the language was modified to be as early as the first half of 2016. Can you discuss any structuring alternatives? And if unavailable to draw for cash, would that alter your 2016 capital spending in any way?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","We believe that we can drop it. And so we think that we can drop it to EnLink. I have also said that we are taking efforts out there to understand what the market is also for that asset outside of that. But our preferred option is to drop that asset to EnLink, and we believe that we can drop it. Now if their situation would change dramatically, it would really have to change dramatically for this to take place. But if it were to change dramatically, since we're including that in our anticipated cash flow for 2016, then we'd look at adjusting if that situation were to occur. But we think that's a very unlikely outcome. We're very confident that we are going to be able to transact on Access in the first half of 2016.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, I appreciate that. And my second question, it looks like you're taking your Haley pad completion design and applying it across your Cana-Woodford. I know it's a harder question, but how much of the Haley 50% initial performance above the Cana-Woodford type curve can be attributed to better rock quality and how much to completion design? I know it's a hard question. I'm trying to get a sense of how much this performance could transfer to other areas of the basin, like Gordon Row, where you'll be active upcoming here.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Evan, this is Tony. I really think it's got a lot to do with the good subsurface work that the guys are doing, the completion design work that we're doing. We've got enough data points out there where I think we understand the rock really well. We've got it mapped. We've got a earth model over that. So I think the variation and the improvement that we continue to see is really associated with the technical work that both the Devon-Cimarex team jointly have put into our designs.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's the completion design, we think.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, I look forward to seeing those results upcoming.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave and Tony. If I could go back to a little bit more of the bigger picture here with your comments, Dave, about 2016, I believe you've laid out a similar scenario, at least as far back as September, about E&P CapEx of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, and getting you flat to up slightly. Can you talk about how that has changed maybe or evolved over the last few months, if at all? And should we be reading any directionality into your comments this morning about prospects for 2016?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","It should be identical to what I said and have been saying. I said in the second quarter call and I've been saying it when meeting with investors on the road. So don't imply any difference at all. We are exactly where we were. The only exception that I'd say is we keep raising the bar, darn it. We keep moving production into 2015. We keep outperforming here in 2015. So that means we're going to be delivering this on a higher 2015 volume. So that's the only difference that I would say. But we're going to keep outperforming and we plan to keep doing that for a long time.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. So I think I get your point, is that the growth number may be the same, but the absolute level that you're going to achieve with that $2 billion to $2.5 billion keeps moving up.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it, and then another question. You guys, and it's been a theme in the Q&A here that you've had a lot of positive elements all across your U.S. unconventional portfolio. But can you give us a little context or perhaps some insight into how you're thinking about which of these plays or opportunities, which of them rank most high on attractiveness or rate of change in attractiveness and also on materiality to Devon in 2016?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah and I'll have Tony go through that with you, but I'd like to take this chance just to make a comment too, that you have seen obviously tremendous improvements. And we talk a lot about improved, higher sand concentrations and lower drilling costs and all of that. But I want each of you out there to understand. The reason we're doing this is we have the absolute desire to be the best operator in each of our core areas. We talk a lot around here about not being one of the best. We talk about being the best and an intolerance of mediocrity, and those are the words I say to you guys. It's the words I say internally, and I can tell you there's a lot of energy in the company around that entire notion.","And when you have that kind of attitude I think in a company, that's when you really start delivering the kind of results you've been seeing out of the last few quarters. And so that's why we have confidence that we're going to continue to do this. We're not sure exactly what's going to be the next thing that comes down the line to improve our results, but I can tell you we're absolutely focused on being the best applier of whatever it would be. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tony to talk more specific on returns for each of the areas.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Charles, if I just had to categorize generally, I would say our DeWitt County returns in the Eagle Ford are consistently high, as well as the southern portion of our Delaware Basin work, as well as the Parkman in the Rockies. Those have been really what I would call our Tier 1 returns, and that's really where the capital is moving towards. Just slightly behind those returns would be our Cana-Woodford. And again, the Woodford project continues to improve. Our well costs have dropped from $8 million down to about $7 million. And as we talked earlier, the IPs and EURs continue to improve. So the Cana-Woodford project is competing in the portfolio right now.","I think what will emerge with additional data will be this Meramec play. I think it will move into the top tier. It will elbow its way in. So we'll have what I think are four very high returns that are top tier in the U.S. And behind that we'll have the Cana-Woodford, which has got great repeatability, predictability. And behind that are really the projects that are not garnering any funding right now, and that would be the southern Midland Basin. It would be the Mississippian play, Barnett outside of the appraisal work that we're doing on the refrac. So that's how we look at the projects from a return and really generally how we allocate capital.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. And so, Tony, on the question of scale or materiality to you guys, it sounds like you roughly went in order there or the order I would have guessed that really Eagle Ford and Permian are the biggest scale of those high-quality ones, and that the Meramec is \u2013 that's one where the arrow is pointing up the most. Is that the right read?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","I think that's it, Charles. Really, our most intense focus area for 2016 will definitely be the Permian Basin and our work in the Delaware. And of course, the Eagle Ford is going to continue with the work that we've been doing there. What we'd like to see happen is really increasing the materiality in both the Meramec and the Parkman in the Rockies. Those are two good plays that have great returns, as you mentioned, just not quite as material to us today.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's great color, Tony. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning, just a quick follow-up on 2016. I realize there's not full guidance out. But could you guys provide any color on the trajectory throughout the year as it stands now on both oil and gas? And then also if the low single-digit growth, is that exit rate to exit rate, or complete year over year, full year over full year?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","That's full-year 2016 compared to full-year 2015. And we're not to the point yet on this where we're going to be giving quarterly guidance on it, but we're going to cover all that kind of thing in more detail on the Q4 call.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, I thought I would try. Turning now on the operation front to the Eagle Ford, you guys have talked about the staggered development concept as well as the upper Eagle Ford. Could you provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing there, but also what you would need to see to step up activity in that area from those tests?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Paul, I'm glad you mentioned that. That's an exciting project that we have working right now. And our technical team has done some outstanding subsurface work to recognize the opportunity. We've put a lot of data and reservoir characterization work together. We built our models. We believe that the staggered opportunity just inside the lower Eagle Ford offers upside to the resource base that we've talked about. That's in addition to the lower Eagle Ford that we've described in our past couple of calls. So we think the resource base has got the opportunity to grow. We've highlighted that in our operating report now.","I'm pleased to report, while it's early, our first staggered lateral results in our central core area in DeWitt County saw, with a slight offset to an existing producing well, near original reservoir pressure. So I think what we're going to see is the ability to come back and take all of our undrilled areas, go to a staggered approach, increase the ultimate recovery and the total value of the field. And I think we'll also have an opportunity to come back into areas that have already been drilled and lay in some staggered laterals in addition to that. And couple that with the opportunity to put a stacked lateral in the upper Eagle Ford on top of that, I think there's still a lot of resource work that our technical team is excited about right now.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thanks for letting me get back in for one more. I just wanted to clear up one thing real quickly, and that's with regard to the infrastructure expansion in the Eagle Ford. Is that essentially an aspirational number for Devon's future production, or do you see any third-party volumes getting into there?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","The infrastructure volumes we have available, those are the numbers that are actually available. Now whether we realize that volume or not depends on the amount of capital that we put against the program. So we're just showing what the system capacity is in the Eagle Ford for our production. And at this point, we don't have any current plans, I don't think, to put any third-party volumes in that. That's just within the Eagle Ford, and that's our capacity within the DeWitt County, what our capacity is.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for clearing that up.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Jeff, this is Howard. Jeff, we've had a lot of questions on the capacities. The reason we put that in there, not to signal anything else, it's just a matter of what Dave said around commodity price and whether we add additional capital in there, that there is no bottleneck obviously in commodity price and our activity levels.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thanks for clearing that up.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. I turn the conference back over to our presenters.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you, Tiffany, and we appreciate everyone's attention and investment in Devon Energy.

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Scott Coody","Thank you and good morning. Last night, we issued our earnings release, operations report and forward-looking guidance. Those documents can be found on our website at devonenergy.com. Joining me today on the call are Dave Hager, our President and CEO, David Harris, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production; and Jeff Ritenour, our Chief Financial Officer.","Comments on the call today will contain plans, forecasts and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. These comments are subject to assumptions, risks, uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. Please take note of the cautionary language and risk factors provided in our SEC filings and earnings materials.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dave.","David Hager","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is another one of exceptional execution for Devon across all aspects of our business. The bull strategy we announced earlier this year to transform to a high-quality, multi-basin U.S. oil company is working and it's working quite well.","By sharpening our focus on our very best U.S. oil assets, the operating teams at Devon are delivering results that are exceeding expectations. Capital efficient and cost -- capital efficiency and cost reduction targets by a wide margin. This trend of excellence is now well established over multiple quarters and evidenced by several noteworthy accomplishments year-to-date.","First, our returns-oriented focus and strong operational execution is translating into attractive rates of return. Year-to-date, the fully burdened rate of return on our capital program has exceeded 25%, and the cash return on total capital employed is also strong, trending well above 20%.","The attractive returns we have delivered year-to-date are a function of the learnings we attained from appraisal work in prior years. By deploying these learnings to our highly focused development program in 2019, we have made substantial improvements in drilling and completion designs, reduced cycle times and increased well productivity through enhanced subsurface target selection.","This step change improvement in execution has allowed us to raise our oil growth outlook 3 times this year while lowering our capital spending guidance. We have also acted with a sense of urgency to materially improve our cost structure. Our multiyear cost savings initiatives are now on pace to achieve more than 80% of our targeted $780 million in annual cost reductions by year-end.","Importantly, our operational performance and cost reduction success have allowed us to generate free cash flow at levels that are ahead of plan. Coupled with asset sales, we are now on track to generate more than $3 billion of excess cash this year. With this abundant cash flow, we are delivering on our promise to reduce leverage and return capital to shareholders.","Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong at 1x net debt to EBITDA, we have increased our dividend by 13% and are on track to reduce our share count approximately 30% by year-end. As you can see from these highlights, Devon is executing at a very high level on every strategic objective underpinning our strategy.","Our unwavering focus on what we can control is delivering compelling financial and operational results that are demonstrating a positive rate of change unique among our competitors. Clearly, we have accomplished quite a bit this year-to-date, and there is plenty of excitement left in 2019 as our upcoming fourth quarter are full of catalyst-rich events.","The Delaware is set to attain another meaningful step-up in oil production due to several high-impact projects coming online in Q4, headlined by our Cat Scratch Fever 2.0 project. There are also several good things happening in the Powder River Basin. We are raising our oil exit target rate -- exit rate target and our Niobrara appraisal work is unlocking a new resource play for us.","The Eagle Ford will also be worth watching as we have officially reestablished operational momentum with our new partner and expect to bring online more than 25 high-rate wells in the fourth quarter. And lastly, with regard to our Barnett sale process, the bids are in and we continue to advance the process with interested parties. We expect to exit the Barnett by year-end at a price that is consistent with our view of the intrinsic value of the asset.","Looking ahead to 2020, we have conviction in our multiyear plan and expect to progress the operational scale of our business and the highest return areas of our portfolio while delivering growth in free cash flow. With the significant improvements in capital efficiency we have experienced across our asset portfolio, we believe we can achieve the strategic objectives of our multiyear plan with substantially lower capital requirements compared to the original projection we laid out in February of this year.","However, before I get into the details of our 2020 outlook, I want to share with investors our capital allocation priorities for the upcoming year. As always, Devon's top priority will be to fund maintenance capital requirements at quarterly dividend. Once this objective is met, the next step in our capital allocation process is to selectively deploy capital to high-return projects that will efficiently expand the cash flow of the business. Importantly, our plan meets all these capital allocation priorities at a low breakeven funding price of $48 WTI and $250 Henry Hub pricing.","This ultra-low breakeven pricing point provides us with a substantial margin of safety to execute on our capital program while navigating through the inevitable commodity price volatility we will encounter. Should this volatility drive prices higher, we will remain disciplined, and the benefits of any pricing windfall above our conservative base planning scenario will manifest itself in higher levels of free cash flow for shareholders, not higher capital spending. Conversely, should we see price volatility to the downside, we have designed our operating plan to have the flexibility and agility to appropriately react to changes in the macro environment.","Although we are still finalizing the details of our 2020 operating plan, I can tell you we are directionally planning on a capital program in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This level of activity is expected to generate oil growth of 7% to 9% compared to 2019 on a retained asset basis. When you account for the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program, oil growth rates jump into the mid- to high teens on a per share basis.","As I've already emphasized, our 2020 plan is designed to completely fund our capital requirements at an ultra-low WTI breakeven price of $48. Furthermore, this conservative plan provides significant torque to the upside as we can generate free cash flow of $400 million at $55 WTI pricing.","With our updated outlook, I hope this one key message resonates that Devon's capital efficiency continues to trend meaningfully ahead of our multiyear plan. This is evidenced by our cumulative capital spending in 2019 and 2020, which is projected to decline by approximately $400 million or 10% less than the original plan we outlined this February.","Importantly, our oil growth outlook over the same 2-year time frame remains on track with the original plan. While this is a great result, we are not content with the substantial progress we have made. The management team at Devon is laser-focused on optimizing returns and driving capital efficiency for our shareholders. I expect to have more positive updates on this topic in the near future. And the final item I'd like to address is a recent political rhetoric regarding drilling and fracking moratoriums on federal lands. Although we believe substantial obstacles exist for such an idea to be enacted into law, I do want to highlight that only 20% of our total company-wide leasehold resides on federal land. Within our core focus areas, our largest federal acreage holding resides in the Powder River Basin, which accounts for nearly 60% of our leasehold in that operating area.","In the Delaware Basin, roughly half of our acreage is federal and our STACK -- Eagle Ford and STACK assets reside almost entirely on private lands. Regardless of how the politics of this issue will ultimately be resolved, I do want to emphasize that we have been building a deep inventory of federal drilling permits in our highest confidence development areas within the Delaware and Powder River Basin. Furthermore, our diversified multi-basin portfolio provides a flexibility and a depth of inventory within each of our core basins to be nimble and quickly pivot drilling activity to private leasehold that is highly economic and well positioned on the cost curve. While our diversified portfolio positions us well to adapt to a scenario such as this, we fundamentally believe that the basic notion of such campaign rhetoric is fraught with serious economic ramifications. This proposal would unfairly harm the communities that financially benefit from our business activity as well as impact the broader U.S. economy from an inevitable spike in energy costs that would unnecessarily limit GDP growth.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn -- introduce and turn the call over to David Harris. David was recently appointed Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, replacing my good friend, Tony Vaughn, who is retiring from Devon after 20 years of service. Many of you know David. But for those of you who do not, David has been at Devon for more than a decade and is a seasoned and trusted leader who has been instrumental in strengthening Devon into the world-class U.S. oil company it is today. David?","David Harris","Thank you for the introduction, Dave. Together with our talented operating teams here at Devon, I look forward to continuing to execute on the operating strategy that will drive the next financial growth and strong returns for the company. And given our third quarter results and outlook, we continue to hit on all cylinders.","For my prepared remarks today, I will cover the asset-specific highlights that are driving this enterprise-level success. Beginning with our [indiscernible] asset in the Delaware, production continued to rapidly increase in the third quarter, growing 59% on a year-over-year basis. This strong production result was driven by a Leonard Shale oriented program in the quarter, which accounted for roughly half of the 34 new wells that commenced production. Based on learnings from prior projects, our operating teams have refined Leonard development spacing at around 6 wells per drilling unit primarily targeting the Leonard B interval. The execution of these Leonard developments was excellent. Results have exceeded type curve expectations with 30-day rates averaging 2,200 BOEs per day, of which 70% was oil. At an average cost of $7.5 million a well, the returns from this Leonard activity rank among the very best projects we have executed this year.","Looking ahead, the setup for the Delaware Basin in the fourth quarter is very strong. Our diversified development activity across all 5 of our core areas in the state line area continues to progress right on plan, positioning the Delaware for another quarter of strong oil growth. In the aggregate, we expect to bring online more than 30 wells in the fourth quarter with the top catalyst being our 10-well Cat Scratch Fever 2.0 project. Cat Scratch 2.0 directly offsets the record-setting Phase 1 project immediately to the southeast in our world-class Todd area. While geologic mapping indicates that this thin spot thins a bit to the east, we do expect Cat Scratch 2.0 to be special and more prolific than the typical Second Bone Spring project.","Lastly, in the Delaware, another noteworthy trend I would like to highlight is our improving capital efficiency. In the most recent quarter, our drilled and completed feet per day metrics in the Wolfcamp improved 45% and 65% year-over-year, respectively. This positive trend is very important as we expect the majority of our drilling activity to target the Wolfcamp formation next year. These steadily improving cycle times and costs will provide capital efficiency momentum heading into 2020.","The next asset I would like to discuss is the Powder River Basin, one of the top emerging oil growth opportunities in North America. In the third quarter, our full-field development activity targeting the Turner, Parkman and Teapot formations in our Super Mario Area drove oil production 25% higher year-over-year. With this drill bit success, we are raising our 2019 oil exit rate growth target in the Powder River to more than 70% compared to 2018, up from our previous target of greater than 50%. This strong growth is accompanied by structural improvements to our capital efficiency as we attain operating scale in the play.","Specifically, with the Turner formation, our top development target in 2019, we have achieved capital savings of greater than $1 million per well or nearly 20% compared to last year. Another critically important initiative underway in the Powder River is the delineation of our Niobrara shale potential in the basin. Our 200,000 net acre Niobrara position in the core of the oil fairway possesses repeatable resource play characteristics with the potential to be an important growth platform for Devon in 2020 and beyond. Over the past year, industry permitting has accelerated, more than 30 new Niobrara wells have been brought online around our acreage position in Converse and Campbell counties. Specifically for Devon, we are methodically focusing our delineation efforts in the southwest quadrant of our acreage called Atlas West, which has delivered the top oil rates in the basin.","To date, we have brought online 8 operated wells that have averaged 30-day rates as high as 1,500 BOE per day with a 90% oil mix. Further progressing our confidence in this play are 2 spacing tests we commenced production on during the quarter in Atlas West. These spacing tests have shown positive results for the commercial potential of 3 Niobrara wells per section and the ability to develop the Niobrara independently of the deeper Turner interval. By the time of our next call in February, we expect to have several more appraisal wells online further delineating our Atlas West acreage position. With positive operating results we've obtained to date coupled with several encouraging industry data points, it is likely that the Niobrara will compete for increased capital allocation in 2020 with potential for us to double our drilling activity.","And finally, our Eagle Ford and STACK assets are successfully fulfilling their respective roles in our portfolio, providing more than $600 million of free cash flow over the past year. In the Eagle Ford play, the key message I want to convey is that we have officially reestablished operational momentum with our new partner in the play. With peak completion activity for the year occurring in the third quarter, we expect a strong production response in Q4 with more than 25 Eagle Ford wells scheduled to come online. The impact from these high-quality wells is projected to increase our Eagle Ford net production to between 50,000 and 55,000 BOEs per day in the fourth quarter. We're still working on details for the 2020 plan with our partner, but our intent is to target an average of 3- to 4-rig lines. This level of activity would maintain our base production profile and advance our infill and redevelopment work in the lower and upper Eagle Ford while generating meaningful levels of free cash flow for the company.","And lastly, in the STACK, our infill development program continues to deliver strong operational results. Our recent Meramec development space at 4 to 6 wells per unit are exceeding type curve expectations and we have lowered well costs by as much as 30%. We still have a deep drilling inventory in the overpressured oil window of the play. But given recent weakness in gas and NGL prices, we continue to reduce activity in the STACK. In fact, we've recently dropped to 0 rigs in the play as higher returns currently exist within other oilier projects in our portfolio. While STACK activity may be down, it is not indefinitely out. We are actively working to rejuvenate returns in the play to more competitive levels within our portfolio by lowering our D&C costs and through evaluation of partnership and drillco structures.","While I have nothing specific to announce today, I can confirm that we're encouraged by ongoing discussions that are taking place with well-capitalized counterparties.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Ritenour","Thanks, David. I'll spend my time today discussing the progress we've made advancing our financial strategy and detailing the future benefits of our plan. A good place to start is by highlighting our financial performance in the quarter, where Devon's earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.35 per share, exceeding consensus estimates.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $597 million, a 22% increase compared to the year ago period despite lower benchmark pricing. This level of cash flow exceeded capital spending, resulting in free cash flow of $56 million for the quarter. This strong financial performance was underpinned by oil production that exceeded the top end of our guidance, per unit LOE cost improving by 19% year-over-year, G&A and financing costs that were reduced by more than 25% versus the previous year and capital efficiencies that are trending well ahead of our plan.","Turning to the balance sheet. Over the past 3 months, we've made significant progress strengthening our investment-grade financial position. In the quarter, we retired $1.5 billion of senior notes reducing our total debt to $4.3 billion and net financing costs by 25% year-over-year.","Strategically, this debt reduction activity focused on near-term maturities to completely clear Devon's debt maturity runway until late 2025. We are carefully evaluating the next steps in our debt reduction program as we keep a close watch on interest rates and credit spreads. Overall, we are well on our way to achieving the $3 billion debt reduction target. With strip prices where they are today, we expect our net debt to EBITDA ratio to trend towards the low end of our 1 to 1.5x targeted range as we execute on our multiyear plan.","In the third quarter, we were also very active with our share repurchase program completing $550 million of share repurchases in the period. Since the program began in 2018, we've repurchased 147 million shares at a total cost of $4.8 billion, and we are on pace to reduce our outstanding share count 30% by year-end.","In addition to our share repurchase activity, we are also returning cash directly to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend, which we've increased by 50% since 2018. Year-to-date, share repurchases and dividends total over $1.7 billion, representing the cash yield to shareholders of 20% when compared to our current market capitalization. This follows repurchases and dividends in 2018 totaling $3.2 billion or a 35% yield to shareholders.","Moving forward, we expect additional cash returns for our shareholders as our multiyear plan builds momentum. We will continue the use of the dividend and share repurchases to deliver free cash flow to our investors. As Dave touched on in his opening remarks, our 2020 plan is set up for attractive per share growth and free cash flow generation of $400 million at a $55 WTI price deck.","To put this into context, the free cash flow we expect to generate in 2020 is equivalent to 5% of our current market capitalization. We believe this free cash flow yield is very competitive with other sectors in the broader S&P 500 Index that possess valuation multiples far in excess of Devon's supporting the continuation of our share repurchases into the future.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott.","Scott Coody","Thanks, Jeff. We will now open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. With that, operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","I was wondering if you could discuss your plans in the Delaware Basin for 2020. I think this year, you're going to be placing under production about 117 wells. I wanted to see if you can give some thoughts on the program next year, lateral lengths and number of wells. And where do you see well cost on per lateral foot basis in the Delaware?","David Harris","I'll start this off, Arun. It's a bit premature for us to provide any specific guidance as far as the amount of wells or even the cadence of the wells for 2020. We'll keep it to the preliminary guide that we provided at a high level in our earnings materials. But that being said, with regards to our allocation at the Delaware, it's certainly going to be our top funded asset by a wide margin. Proportionately, you would probably directionally expect that level of funding to be similar to what you're seeing this year. And obviously, the PRB and the Eagle Ford would be top funded assets as well within our portfolio.","And as always, with the extended reach laterals, we continue to push towards having longer laterals every year. And if you saw our recent operations report, we're pushing towards 10,000 in virtually every area that we operate. So that's a good news story where the capital efficiency continues to improve.","David Hager","Arun, this is Dave. I may just make one more comment on just the capital efficiency or the cost reduction side. If you go to, obviously, Slide 16 in the operations reported, it really shows how we're continuing to get drilling and completion efficiencies. So we think they are leading the industry in cost per foot -- drilling completion cost per foot, but we're not done. And I can tell you, the way we've guided and built into our 2020 guidance, we are still seeing that we think there's opportunity to do even better, and we're working on some things and having early results that back that up.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just my follow-up. On Slide 5, you guys present your updated guidance on the cost structure. Maybe for you, Jeff. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how you expect the cost structure to trend for the new Devon in 2020. And maybe also provide some thoughts on how do you think realizations or differentials will trend for the three main product groups for the new Devon.","Jeffrey Ritenour","Yes. Arun, you bet. Yes, I would say, generally speaking, we continue to expect per unit cost to trend lower as we move into 2020 really across the board from an LOE and a G&A standpoint. Obviously, the financing cost piece is going to be dependent on the timing of our debt repurchase. But again, that's another area where we would see a continued reduction in our cost structure as we move into 2020.","As it relates to the realizations, I would -- as a general statement, I would say, I would expect it to look a little bit like this year. There's obviously -- it looks like there's going to be continued pressure on WAHA pricing coming out of the Delaware. But with the hedges that we have in place as well as some of the takeaway options we have there, we think we're going to mitigate that to some degree.","Oil pricing coming out of the Delaware, we feel really good about. There's obviously plenty of pipeline capacity there to move the product. And we generally have a pretty balanced approach there, getting about -- 50% of our production is exposed to Gulf Coast pricing and the remainder would get exposed to that Midland area pricing, which right now looks pretty positive. It's actually trading at a premium relative to WTI.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","So my question is on 2020 capital efficiency in the corporate breakeven. You've reported a pretty low 2020 corporate breakeven of $48 WTI. And I believe the original 2019 breakeven was around $46 WTI, but that was at higher gas and NGL prices. So I'm just trying to get a sense of the year-over-year change in capital efficiency on an apples-to-apples basis. So if you were to normalize for pricing, what's the change in the corporate breakeven in 2020 relative to this year?","David Hager","Well, I don't know if I have an absolute number normalized for pricing. I think the easiest way to think about it is look at Slide 9 in the deck where we're saying we're delivering all of the oil growth that we had originally planned over the 2-year time frame. But yet, we're doing it for $400 million less capital versus our original plan. And so obviously, on a normalized basis, if we went back to the original pricing, it would be below $46. I don't know if we have an exact number of what that may be.","Jeffrey Ritenour","Yes. Jeanine, this is Jeff. I actually don't have the absolute number, but Dave described it well. And obviously, the biggest driver of that is the capital efficiency that we're seeing in the Delaware and really across the board in each of our different areas. But the Delaware, obviously, is the biggest component of our capital spend, and that's the biggest driver of that capital efficiency that we're seeing on a multiyear basis.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. And then my follow-up, if I could just dig in to your last comment about the improvement. You mentioned that it's mostly getting driven by the Delaware. But how much of it is also for 2020 driven by just taking capital out of the STACK versus any well cost reductions or any cyclical factors? And I'm not sure -- I think your corporate breakeven is on a hedge basis as well.","David Hager","Yes.","Jeffrey Ritenour","Yes. Jeanine, that's correct. It does include the benefit of hedges, which, for 2020, is relatively minor at this point.","David Hager","David Harris, I think you can answer that.","David Harris","Yes. Jeanine, in terms of capital efficiency, to Jeff's point, we're seeing a lot of progress across the board in the Delaware specifically. On the drilling side, we've changed our wellbore design. We've gone to a slim hole design that we've modified to a slightly larger hole that's allowing much faster drilling times. On the completion side, we continue to relentlessly attack nonproductive time and flat time, moving equipment around and when we're doing zipper fracs. And as we talked to you about before on the facility side, the move from more complex and customized facilities to more standardized and modular designs has driven a real step change in our performance there.","These improvements really aren't just limited to the Delaware though. In the Rockies, we continue to see cost reductions and expected to see material further cost reductions. As we've highlighted in the Turner, we've had a 20% improvement year-over-year and continue to believe that we're going to see similar rate of change in the Niobrara as we continue to derisk that position and move more into development mode. In the STACK, we're seeing capital efficiency improvements from more efficient infill spacing results and improved stimulation designs. Just on the completion side alone, we've seen a 15% decrease in our costs since the beginning of the year, so we're really encouraged by that.","And then obviously, working with a new partner in the Eagle Ford. As you saw in the ops report, we've driven somewhere around $1 million per well out as we've debundled services and worked with more efficient vendors and applied best practices from other parts of our asset base to that asset go forward. So we feel good about the capital efficiencies we're seeing across the entire portfolio and really want to make sure you appreciate it's not just limited to what we're doing in the Delaware.","David Hager","The only thing I'd add, Jeanine, is we are allocating a significant amount of capital to the Delaware and last to the STACK, but don't count the STACK out. I see some work that we're doing internally in the STACK. We're driving down the well cost. We are doing some outstanding technical work in there. And it's just because of the high-quality of our portfolio that we are allocating more to the Delaware. But the STACK is still there. It's not far away from getting funding and it's going to be a significant part of our portfolio for a long time to go, and you're going to see capital allocated to STACK in future years. And it's going to be good, strong returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Philosophically, when you think about production growth, is 7% to 9% what you would see as the more normal oil growth rate if current commodity prices hold? Or do you see acceleration be backing up some of your comments on further cost reductions, reallocation to STACK or other areas?","David Hager","Well, I think the main thing to understand is that we have the capability and the resource that we can deploy capital and generate strong returns at various growth rates. So we aren't really limited by the amount of resource and amount of opportunities with the amount of growth. It is really trying to maximize the capital efficiency of our program as well as to generate competitive growth, along with competitive free cash flow yield. And so we're trying to balance all of those variables.","Given that, we think, as a company, that's appropriate for us to target high single-digit growth rates and mid-single-digit free cash flow yields. And that allows us to invest in very high-return opportunities. So we think, at this point, that's the right decision.","Obviously, we're open to feedback from our shareholders on whether they think that's appropriate as well. But we think it's a strong program that's underpinned by very high-return projects. And we do, again, have the flexibility to grow at higher or lower rates, but we have no shortage of opportunities to do that for a long time.","Brian Singer","Great. And then my follow-up is on your ops report, the Slide #18. You talked about the visibility of several hundred inventory locations in the Todd area. You talked to Cat Scratch Fever 2.0 in the prepared remarks. Can you talk to the characteristics of how the costs and the oil EURs from that broader inventory compare versus what you drilled in 2019 and what you expect to drill in 2020?","David Harris","Brian, this is David. I think we expect it to continue to be an important growth driver for the foreseeable future. You've obviously got a highly charged reservoir there with stacked pay. As we've highlighted on Cat Scratch 2.0, we do see the pace in a bit to the east. And so we wouldn't expect copycat results all the way across it, but we think these are going to be some of the most compelling projects in the Lower 48 for the foreseeable future.","Brian Singer","And can you remind us of the spacing assumptions that you have built in, in that area?","Scott Coody","Brian, we're going to hand this over to John Raines, who heads up our Delaware Basin business unit.","John Raines","Yes. Brian, for the Todd Area, we'll start in the Leonard. So we're just delineating the Leonard at this point, moving from appraisal into development. In other parts of the basin, we've seen six wells per section, and that's what we started with here, but we've got line of sight to upside to potentially 8 wells per section in the Leonard.","Moving to the Second Bone. Historically, we've developed this on 4 wells per section, and that's what we've done from Central Todd going east. This is a bit of a geologically complex area as we move west and southwest in Todd. We're exploring six wells per section. Oxy actually offsets us to the west and they've been successful at six wells per section.","And we've only just begun appraisal in the Wolfcamp here. We're testing multiple landing zones. We've actually tested three different landing zones in the Upper Wolfcamp. I think it's safe to assume that we'd feel good about two landing zones at four wells per section with a strong chance of upside to three landing zones at 12.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Subhash Chandra from Guggenheim Partners.","Subhasish Chandra","I just want to clarify the return of capital commentary, make sure I understood it correctly. Want to understand sort of how you split the buckets, debt, share buybacks and dividend growth with and without the Barnett sale. In particular, I think the presentation alludes to more debt reduction by year-end. Is that presuming the Barnett sale? And then how do we split the return of capital to share buybacks beyond that point?","Jeffrey Ritenour","Yes. This is Jeff. Yes. So no, it does not include the Barnett proceeds. So we are -- we've already obviously executed on $1.7 billion of the $3 billion debt target that we set earlier this year. We've got the cash and the balance sheet today to go ahead and execute the remainder of our $3 billion target. However, what we've seen happen over the last several months is interest rates go lower and the cost of debt go higher. And so we're going to be mindful of that and be opportunistic as we look to repurchase debt in the market. So we don't need those Barnett proceeds obviously to accomplish our debt targets going forward.","Beyond that, that will allow us to utilize the proceeds in the Barnett for additional share repurchases, along with, obviously, the dividend that you highlighted. And certainly, the free cash flow that we expect to generate next year, that will have the potential to be devoted to further share repurchase programs.","Subhasish Chandra","Got you. Okay. And a question -- I think operators are seeking to monetize water assets, seems to be the thing to do. You've highlighted 40 saltwater disposal wells, et cetera. I'm just curious if that is something you might do and what capacity and capacity utilization might be at the moment?","Jeffrey Ritenour","Yes. This is Jeff. That's absolutely something we've looked at and we'll continue to monitor. We feel pretty good with our setup in the Delaware today. We like having control of those assets and the low cost that it brings to our cost structure going forward. But it's certainly something we've been monitoring and watching. And should the right opportunity arise, it's something we would consider. But frankly, where we sit today, we feel pretty good about our setup and certainly the cost structure that we've got.","Subhasish Chandra","Could you share, by any chance, the sort of the disposal capacity and the utilization levels you might be running?","David Harris","Yes. I think roughly 40 -- we've got 40 saltwater disposal wells out in the space. I think if you look at Slide 15, we kind of highlight some of the detail there, about 8 water reuse facilities. So any -- capacity is 120,000 barrels, is the throughput capacity of those facilities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley.","Devin McDermott","So my first question, Dave, is actually following up on your response to one of the questions earlier around the STACK. You noted that it's close to competing for additional capital and likely receive it in future years. I guess first of all, as we think about 2020 with 0 rigs there, kind of what's envisioned in terms of cap allocation there, if any, in the preliminary 2020 plan that you provided? And then as we think about the outlook for the STACK going forward. Assuming no change in commodity prices, gas or NGLs, I guess, what would you need to see in order to make it competitive within the overall portfolio and start allocating more capital back?","David Hager","Well, there's very little capital allocated in the current plan and 2020 is really more carry-in capital from 2019. We're working a number of initiatives. It's not just on the price side that we -- certainly a little bit higher gas and NGL prices would help. We're also -- our teams are doing some outstanding work on the cost side, on the drilling and completion costs and driving down those costs. We're also working on potential joint venture type opportunities there that could bring in some capital to drive higher capital efficiency into it.","So there are several different angles that we're working this from -- in order to allocate capital in the future years. And obviously, we're being patient because we have such a strong portfolio. When we talk a lot about the Delaware, I think we need to talk about the Powder also and the success we're having in Niobrara and now that's going to drive more capital there and higher returns and very high returns there as well with the success we're having.","And I can tell you, in the Eagle Ford also with our new partner, BP, they're very excited about what their -- or BPX, they're are very excited about this asset. I think they see it as one of their key cornerstones of the acquisition they did from BHP into one, they probably want to put a lot of capital too early on. So we just have a lot of high-return opportunities here in front of us. So we're just being patient to work out some of these other issues. And then I'm confident we're going to do it. And then the capital will come to the STACK when the appropriate time comes.","Devin McDermott","Got it. Makes sense. Can you comment on -- go for it.","Jeffrey Ritenour","Sorry, just a few more follow ups, specific thoughts on that. I would point out, as we've talked about this quarter, our lighter space infill projects are performing really well, exceeding both type curve and cost expectations. We do have a significant amount of inventory remaining in the heart of the play. So we do believe we still have a lot of economic resource there to develop. As Dave said, we've got a very high bar internally with the portfolio we have, but we're going to continue to try to bring those -- bring the value of those opportunities forward.","Devin McDermott","Got it. Can you comment on the production profile or decline rate you've assumed through the 2020 guidance? Or is it still too early to say given some of the uncertainty there for the Powder specifically -- or sorry, for the STACK specifically?","Jeffrey Ritenour","Yes. Devin, once again, we'll refrain from providing that at this point in time just because we still have some work on that front. But generally speaking, the last disclosure point we've had on the STACK is on the first year PDP decline. It was in the high 20% on a BOE basis. And it was on an oil basis, it was a high 30% range. So we'll recalibrate that number in conjunction with our reserve outlook -- with our; reserve report and our activity outlook for and have a more specific update for you here in February.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Great update on the Eagle Ford. My question is around that play. Beyond the 4Q and the 25 wells and obviously the growth you have there, I know you don't have the full 2020 out, but just how are you considering that play, as more of a -- still in the near term than a growth driver? Or is it more stable production with a more of a free cash flow generator?","David Harris","Neal, this is David. I think the way we think about it within the context of our portfolio is the latter. It is an important free cash flow generator for us, and we believe we can maintain a profile there that's flat to some slight growth probably. We're -- we've regained operational momentum with our partner. We're going to bring on a big package of wells in Q4. And then as we move into 2020, we've talked about stabilizing somewhere around a rig count of 3 to 4 years. But we do still have quite a bit of resource in place and are testing infill and redevelopment concepts as well as things like the Austin Chalk. So we believe there's still a lot of good work to be done in the play.","David Hager","Now just to reinforce that, what we're finding is there's still a lot of hydrocarbon in place and a lot of reservoir pressure there after our initial development activities take place. And so we're finding success with staggered wells within the Lower Eagle Ford as well as staggering them up in the Upper Eagle Ford between the Lower Eagle Ford completions.","And so it's exciting how it's -- and there's -- it's just a great resource with a lot of pressure and a lot of opportunities that look [indiscernible] remaining. And then the Austin Chalk on top of it is probably a little less certainty as to how big that's going to be at this point. We're changing more to a linear gel type design on our completions there from slick water, and we're optimistic that, that can compete also.","Neal Dingmann","Well, it certainly sounds like a lot of running room. And then moving over equally is positive. It sounds like, to me, I'm looking at Slide -- particularly on Slide 20. In the Nio, you've had some really interesting spacing tests there. I'm just wondering after -- specifically the two successful wells you've had there. Maybe could you just talk about just your thoughts just on overall spacing or at least in that area, how that's changed now after the success?","Jeffrey Ritenour","You bet. Yes, one of the things that we're excited about in the Niobrara is that we're seeing consistent results across a really large area, both from our results as well as from offset operators. And if you think about the 200,000 acres that we talk about in our Atlas West and East area, we have currently -- we talked about the spacing test at three wells per section. We have plans to test four well per section spacing. We've seen offset industry participants testing up to 6 and 7 wells per section. And so we're going to learn more here throughout 2020 that's going to inform with success, what we believe, will be development mode beginning in 2021 for the Niobrara for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Actually, I have a question for Dave, but I'm going to pick up on Neal's point with that Niobrara first. As -- you've given us kind of this cartoon log on '20. And it looks like the B section is more of a classic or carbonate versus the, I guess, the overall shale package. Is that the case? And does that tie into your spacing of it just being 3 or 4 across a unit?","David Hager","Well, there's a couple of what we think are really great advantages that we have in and around our acreage position relative to other areas in the Powder River Basin. The first is from a thermal maturity standpoint, we are clearly in the oil window throughout the geologic column here and that varies. We've done a thermal maturity mapping throughout the basin and that varies. And as you go further to north with some other operators, you're more in a gassy window in the Niobrara.","The other thing that you're pointing out, Charles, is, yes, you do have more of a chalky interval in the particular part of the basin within the Niobrara. And the chalky interval is what gives some brittleness. And that interval is developed around our acreage position and around some other acreage immediately around us but is not developed everywhere in the Powder.","And so we think that brittleness, where it doesn't exist in other areas, it's a little more ductile and done frac as well. Other places, it really fracks well on our acreage. So we think -- and that's one caution I'd give everyone about comparing our Niobrara results, everybody else's Niobrara results too because we do have these unique advantages of being in the oil window and have this chalky interval in there that frankly, we think ours is going to be better because of these geological characteristics. And so far, it's turned out to be true.","Charles Meade","That's great detail, Dave. And then if I could go back to your prepared comments about this unfortunate topic, the jury about federal acreage. And I know you talked a little bit about some of your contingency about being able to go on to private lands. But you might not be surprised to know, I agree with you, it's a bad idea. But national politics are more and more like a demolition derby where wild things happen. And so I wondered if you could talk more about what are the obstacles to implementing a frac ban or a cessation of permits. And what time frame that would play out over in your contingency planning?","David Hager","Well, you can rest assure that we've done a lot of background legal work around this issue. And I don't think it's probably appropriate to go into the details around that work on this call. But I think that at a high level, we would say that we think it is really fraught with serious legal ramifications, the ability to enact that in a short-term basis.","And I think even more importantly though, obviously, is we just think it's going to unfairly harm the communities where we work, the states where we work. We work in an incredibly environmentally responsible manner, our own company does and our industry does. And all this is going to do is to shift -- the demand for the oil is not going to change. It's there on a worldwide basis. And all this would do is to shift the production to areas of the world that -- where there are not as high environmental standards followed.","And so we just think that it is obviously going to be impactful, very impactful to the U.S. economy and as well as our national defense. So we think it's just obviously a bad idea from a number of fronts and it's not good for the U.S., it's not good for the world.","And again, I'm not going to go through the details of the legal issues. But we've studied it pretty deeply, and we think there's a significant time frame to do anything from a purely legal standpoint. Obviously, from a regulatory standpoint, there's a possibility to slow things down. But we've obviously been thinking through that and we have a deep inventory permit to help mitigate that. The targets on -- I think the key point of all this is we have a clear path forward if this were to take place and we've been thinking about it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","Congratulations on the quarter. Dave, I was just wondering, on Slide 17, can you add some color on the drivers of the multiyear capital shift to the Wolfcamp since your Leonard and Bone Spring results have consistently been so...","David Hager","I didn't quite catch that. Could you repeat that, Jeffrey? I'm sorry.","Jeffrey Campbell","Sure. On Slide '17, can you add some color on the drivers of the multiyear capital shift to the Wolfcamp since your Leonard and Bone Spring results have consistently been so successful?","David Harris","This is David. I think we're seeing great results from all 3 of those main intervals. But I think the simple answer is really the capital efficiency. We see -- from development of the Wolfcamp formation, relative to that, the depth of resource and inventory. We have the various landing zones of the Wolfcamp. Those 2 things combined, I think, are really the main drivers of what you're seeing from some of that internal shift of where you'll see that capital deployed within the Delaware.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. Great, that's helpful. And just -- I just was wondering if you could quickly give some of the technical differences between an Eagle Ford refrac versus a redevelopment oil.","David Harris","Yes. It's a great question. I've actually asked the team that. The lingo is a little bit hard to follow. If you think about a refrac, it's just a traditional refrac where you're accessing stranded reserves there. Typically, what we do, the preferred approach -- we've tried a few different approaches, but we pump a liner refrac there to go in and restimulate near wellbore to access those stranded reserves. When we talk about redevelopment, those are new wells that would be drilled in the Upper Eagle Ford. So if you think about what we're doing today in our primary development sections, we're co-developing the Upper Eagle Ford with the Lower Eagle Ford. In units that were delivered prior to that shift, we got undeveloped Upper Eagle Ford. And so we're going back in and essentially, in some sense, kind of infilling Upper Eagle Ford wells, and those are the wells that we talk about as redevelopment.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy.","David Heikkinen","Kind of thinking through, and it seems like given your higher '19 Powder River basin exit rate and you're shifting more capital to your oilier Powder but definitely shifting less capital to your less oily STACK. But you've really got some increase to your 2020 oil CAGR in your hip pocket as it kind of flowed that through the model. I'm trying to lead the witness to 7% to 9% or higher, but it seems like that's a bit of a layup.","David Hager","I don't know. I don't know. I'm trying -- I'm not sure with the sports analogy. You better -- not sure it's the right one, David. It's a layup, maybe a 15-foot jump shot. It's not a long 3 pointer.","David Heikkinen","Okay, fair enough. Unless you're James Harden.","David Hager","There you go. Well, then that's like a layup, yes. but I mean obviously, we feel confident. We've exceeded our expectations the last few quarters. So we're -- we feel really good about the ability to execute on that.","David Heikkinen","And then just on the STACK, can you remind us how much of your capital is outside operated? And are you not consenting your current plan or thinking about not consenting in 2020?","David Hager","Well, there's a -- the out -- and I don't have the exact number. The guys will have it for you here. But it's typically run higher than it has in any of the other business units. But the amount of the outside capital has actually -- our OBO capital has been declining this year significantly as other people move activity outside of the base as well. And typically, we try to find companies that are willing to participate in those projects. So we sell down our interest in those versus nonconsent. So we're trying to get some return on that as well.","Jeffrey Ritenour","Yes. And David, just specifically, we had about $8 million of non-op capital in the third quarter in the STACK. And from a year-to-date perspective, it's been about $30 million or so, although we have seen downward pressure on that, as Dave highlighted, throughout the year.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Scott Coody, I turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.","Scott Coody","Well, I appreciate everyone's interest in Devon today. And if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team, which consists of myself and Chris Carr. Thank you, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Scott Coody","Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining us on the call today. Last night, we issued an earnings release and operations report that cover our results for the year and our forward-looking outlook. We will make references to our operations report during the call today to aid the conversation and these slides can be found on our website at devonenergy.com.","Also joining me on the call today are, Dave Hager, our President and CEO; Jeff Ritenour, our Chief Financial Officer; David Harris, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production; and a few other members of our senior management team.","Comments on the call today will contain plans, forecasts and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. These comments are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. Please take note of the cautionary language and risk factors provided in our SEC filings and earnings materials.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Hager","Thanks, Scott and good morning everyone. For Devon, 2019 can best be defined as a year of exceptional execution and differentiating performance across every aspect of our business. As you can see on slide 5 of our operations report, a critical accomplishment during the year was our timely and tax-efficient transformation to a U.S. oil business. Even with the challenging market conditions, we successfully completed our portfolio simplification objectives in only 10 months and we're able to exit noncore assets at highly accretive valuations.","Furthermore, by sharpening our focus on Devon's world-class U.S. oil assets, we delivered a step change improvement in corporate level rates of return, achieved enhanced capital efficiencies, expanded our margins, reduced leverage and returned industry-leading amounts of capital to shareholders. All in all, it was a great year. But let me be clear, we are just getting started and the investment case for Devon has never been stronger.","Looking ahead to 2020, our strategic framework for success and disciplined capital priorities remain unchanged. These priorities are outlined on slide 10 of our operations report. As always, Devon's top priorities will be to fund the maintenance capital requirements of our business and the quarterly dividend. Once these objectives are met, next step in our capital allocation process is to selectively deploy capital to high-return projects that will efficiently expand the cash flow of our business.","Importantly, our 2020 plan meets all of these capital allocation priorities at low breakeven funding levels, even after accounting for the recent weaknesses in gas and NGL strip pricing. Should this volatility drive prices higher, we will remain disciplined and the benefits of any pricing windfall above our conservative base planning scenario will manifest itself in higher levels of free cash flow for shareholders, not higher capital spending. Conversely, should we see price volatility to the downside, we've designed our operating plan to have the flexibility and agility to reassess the capital program and react to any structural changes in the macro environment.","Now, let's run through some of the specifics of our 2020 operating plan, which you can see on slide 11. The key takeaway from this slide is that, due to capital efficiencies, we are lowering the top end of our upstream capital guidance in 2020 by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion. Furthermore, the impact of this investment program in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by a reallocation of capital from the STACK, a liquids-rich combo play to the Delaware, the top oil play in all of North America. This shift in capital allocation will increase spending in the Delaware Basin by approximately 15% year-over-year and Delaware will now account for approximately 60% of total capital investment for the year.","Another important distinction of our 2020 program is that, the reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin will be deployed exclusively towards accelerating Wolfcamp development activity. This is significant because, our Wolfcamp activity exhibited the most substantial capital efficiency improvement of any opportunity in our portfolio in the back half of 2019.","With this increased capital allocation, the Wolfcamp will now account for two-thirds of our Delaware activity, providing a visible capital efficiency tailwind that will accrue to our benefit throughout 2020 and carry forward into 2021 as well.","While the 2020 capital program is concentrated in the Delaware Basin, I would be remiss not to mention the exciting catalyst-rich program we have planned for the Powder River Basin. With the appraisal success we achieved in the Niobrara in 2019, we plan to double our activity levels in this emerging resource play over the upcoming year.","A key objective of the Niobrara program in 2020 is to derisk and to prepare a portion of our 200,000 net acres for full development by early next year. And lastly, with our Eagle Ford and STACK assets, it will be business as usual, with the operating team laser-focused on executing on their capital programs efficiently, managing base production and maximizing free cash flow for the company.","Turning your attention to Slide 12. Based on the strong operational momentum of our business, we are raising Devon's per share growth outlook for 2020. Not surprisingly, this improved outlook is underpinned by the outstanding well performance we are experiencing in the Delaware Basin. As a result, we are now increasing the lower end of our oil growth outlook by 50 basis points to a range of 7.5% to 9% compared to 2019.","And to reiterate, this higher growth rate is matched with lower capital spending expectations as well. To maximize the value of this production, we have aggressively acted over the past year to materially improve our corporate cost structure. The success of this ongoing initiative is evidenced by Devon's G&A costs projected to be reduced by 25% year-over-year.","And lastly, while Jeff will speak to this later in the call, the per share impact of this improved 2020 outlook will be further magnified by our new $1 billion share repurchase program and yesterday's announcement to increase the quarterly dividend by 22%.","Moving to Slide 13. While 2020 is setting out to be a great year for Devon, another critical message I want to convey is that the differentiated operating performance achieved in 2019 is sustainable longer term. At Devon, we absolutely have the right personnel, financial strength and inventory depth to deliver both attractive growth rates and increased amounts of free cash flow in 2021 and beyond.","While it is too early to provide official guidance for 2021, our thoughtful and pragmatic approach to the business will remain the same. Our Delaware-centric capital program will remain focused on steady activity levels that deliver the right balance between returns, capital efficiencies, growth rates and free cash flow.","With this disciplined financial framework, we believe investors can directionally expect a mid- to high single-digit oil growth rate in 2021 for a relatively stable amount of capital investment. A noteworthy driver of this preliminary outlook is the positive rate of change we expect to realize from our transition to higher Wolfcamp development activity.","Looking beyond the next few years given the quality of our inventory, I believe a sustainable long-term oil growth rate in the mid-single-digit range feels an appropriate rate to expand our business while generating increasing amounts of free cash flow that can effectively compete with any sector in the market.","Slide 14 showcases the free cash flow our business can deliver through 2021. As you can see in the gray box at the top of the slide, Devon's improved operating outlook lowers a breakeven funding level of our operating plan in 2020 and 2021 from our previous disclosure last November. The combination of higher oil growth rate and improved cost structure and a stronger hedge book, now allow us to fully fund our capital program at $46.50 WTI and $2 Henry Hub pricing and Mont Belvieu realizations of less than 30% of WTI.","While we are pleased with these improvements in breakeven funding, which meaningfully improves our position on the U.S. cost curve, we are not stopping here. To be successful in this unforgiving environment, you must roll up your sleeves, get your hands dirty and on a daily basis look for ways to reduce costs by controlling the controllables. And at Devon, that is exactly what we're focused on.","So, in summary, Devon's multi-basin oil business is built to last. And our disciplined capital plans are designed to deliver compelling amounts of free cash flow and an attractive growth in our per share metrics for the foreseeable future.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to review our financial strategy. And detail how we plan to allocate the excess cash flow, from our business.","Jeff Ritenour","Thanks, Dave. At Devon, we believe our financial strategy and underlying balance sheet strength are significant competitive advantages.","The extreme commodity price volatility, we've experienced over the last year, is a constant reminder that the strong balance sheet. And effective risk management programs are critical to the long-term success, of an E&P company.","Core to our financial strategy, is the emphasis on building a high-margin asset base. Devon's advantaged asset base is very well positioned, on North America's marginal cost curve.","The high-grading of our asset portfolio over the last several years, and the disciplined allocation of capital to our highest return opportunities, is working to lower the breakeven pricing for the company.","As Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, and as outlined on slide 14, our improved operating outlook, has lowered the breakeven funding level of our operating plan in 2020 and 2021, from our previous disclosure last November.","This allows us to provide shareholders with free cash flow, even in, challenged commodity price environments. To further expand our margin of safety, we are actively deploying proven and progressive risk management. And supply chain practices to optimize our financial results.","The example of this includes our disciplined hedging program, which uses a combination of systematic and discretionary hedges, to effectively mitigate pricing volatility. We have over 40% of our 2020 projected oil production, hedged at an average floor of $53 per barrel, well over our funding breakeven pricing of $46.50 per barrel.","In addition, our supply chain team has shifted the majority of our contracted services to shorter-term, over the last year, allowing us to take advantage of the deflationary environment. And providing flexibility should market conditions change. Demand changes and activity to preserve free cash flow.","In combination with our high liquidity and low leverage, these prudent risk management and supply chain practices, allow us to optimize planning efforts and enhance our capital allocation decisions, in periods of uncertainty.","Now turning your attention to slide 8 of our operations report, I plan to briefly cover the details of our financial position, where we have built a tremendous amount of flexibility.","An important strategic priority over the last year has been the repayment of debt, to further strengthen our investment-grade financial position. We made significant progress towards this initiative in 2019, as we retired $1.7 billion of senior notes, which reduced our debt ratio to around 1 times, net debt-to-EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis.","Importantly, this deleveraging activity, completely cleared Devon's outstanding debt maturity runway, until late 2025 extending the weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio to more than 18 years.","While our balance sheet is in great shape, and we have tremendous flexibility, we're not done making improvements. In the fourth quarter, Devon generated $171 million of free cash flow. And we exited the year with $1.8 billion of cash on hand.","Furthermore, Devon's cash balances will increase, upon close in mid-April, with our $770 million, Barnett Shale divestiture. We are keeping a close watch on, interest rates and credit spreads, as we evaluate the next potential steps in our debt repurchase plan.","Current market dynamics have driven redemption premiums substantially higher. But we are prepared to be patient and opportunistic to repurchase additional debt should the market move to our benefit.","Pivoting your attention to the left hand of slide 9, another top financial priority for Devon is returning capital to shareholders in the form of an increasing dividend. Overall, from a dividend policy perspective, we are targeting a payout ratio of 5% to 10% of operating cash flow, at our base planning scenario of $50 WTI pricing.","Additionally, we believe consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend, provides for a very attractive and competitive result, when compared to our E&P peers and other large-cap companies, across the broader S&P 500.","Our $46.50 per barrel breakeven underpins this policy, and supports growth in the dividend over time. Given the strength of our projected 2020 financial outlook and reduced breakeven, we were pleased to announce last night, that our Board has approved a 22% increase in Devon's quarterly dividend.","This shareholder-friendly action is consistent with our target payout ratios, and is aligned with our commitment to steadily grow the dividend over time to a level that is highly competitive with other sectors in the market.","As you can see on the right-hand side of slide 9 in addition to our dividend, we are also returning cash to shareholders through Devon's industry-leading share repurchase program. Since our program began in 2018, we've repurchased 147 million shares at a total cost of $4.8 billion. Our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion program last December paving the way for additional repurchases in 2020 and total -- and a total reduction in Devon's outstanding share count of approximately 35% by year-end.","This is not only the most active program in the E&P space, but it also outpaces the activity of any company regardless of sector in the S&P 500. We have been aggressively buying our shares over the last year at levels ranging from $20 to $25 per share. Given our view of the attractive valuation of our shares compared to the intrinsic value of the company, you can expect more of the same from us in 2020.","In summary, the disciplined financial model we are using to operate the company is working and checks all the boxes necessary for long-term success. We have a strong financial position with a low breakeven funding level and our business can generate excess cash flow in any commodity price environment. We have excellent liquidity and strong balance sheet with very low leverage ratios and we're rewarding our shareholders with a return of cash through our dividend and share repurchase program.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David Harris to cover our operating performance and outlook.","David Harris","Thanks, Jeff. The fourth quarter was another strong one operationally for Devon that can best be described by oil production once again exceeding guidance and capital spending coming in 6% below forecast. This trend of operational excellence has now been established over multiple quarters and is a testament to the high level of performance each of our asset teams in effectively fulfilling their respective roles in our business. For my prepared comments today, I plan to cover the asset-specific highlights that are driving this positive business momentum and provide some insights and observations regarding our outlook for 2020.","As you can see on slide 16 of the operations report, our world-class Delaware Basin asset is the capital-efficient growth engine driving Devon's operational outperformance. In the fourth quarter, net production from the Delaware continued to increase rapidly growing 82% on a year-over-year basis. This strong growth was driven by 36 high-impact wells brought online in the quarter that were diversified across all five core areas in the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Leonard formations. These strong wells achieved average 30-day rates of 2,800 BOEs per day of which 70% was oil at an average cost of around 75 million -- $7.5 million per well. The overall returns from our fourth quarter program in the Delaware Basin were simply outstanding.","Looking specifically at the project level detail for the quarter. Our much anticipated Cat Scratch 2.0 project did not disappoint. This 10-well project which developed a second Bone Spring sweet spot exceeded our pre-drill expectations by reaching average 30-day rates of 3,000 BOEs per well or 425 BOEs per 1,000 feet of lateral. While the Cat Scratch results were certainly impressive, I believe the top thematic takeaway for the fourth quarter activity is the operational momentum we are establishing with our Wolfcamp program.","As you can see on the map at the right side of slide 16, we brought online three impactful Wolfcamp projects during the quarter to help further validate the commerciality of multiple Wolfcamp landing zones across the basin of Southeast New Mexico. Of particular note was our highly successful seven-well Spud Muffin project in the Potato Basin area in Eddy County in which we co-developed the third Bone Spring and Upper Wolfcamp intervals.","While industry has been active for some time in the Potato Basin area, the Spud Muffin project was our initial operated test in this area. And given the well productivity we experienced, this will be an area that definitely works its way into the Delaware Basin capital allocation mix going forward, which further deepens our resource-rich opportunity set in this franchise asset.","As Dave touched on in his opening remarks, the setup of the Delaware Basin in 2020 is exciting. Our diversified development programs across our five core areas position us for another year of exceptionally strong oil growth. In total, we expect to invest around $1 billion of capital in the Delaware that will result in approximately 130 operated spuds. Of this activity, we are allocating nearly 65% to the Wolfcamp formation, which essentially represents a doubling of Wolfcamp activity year-over-year.","To reiterate comments from earlier in the call, this shift in Delaware capital allocation to the Wolfcamp is impactful given the substantial capital efficiency improvements we've achieved in the second half of 2019. In fact in the most recent quarter, our drilled and completed feet-per-day metrics in the Wolfcamp improved 48% and 62% year-over-year, respectively. These steadily improving cycle times and costs provide a capital efficiency tailwind heading into 2020.","The next asset I would like to discuss is the Powder River Basin, an important emerging oil growth opportunity in our portfolio. In the fourth quarter our development-focused program commenced production on 19 new wells that drove net production more than 50% higher year-over-year. Importantly, this oil-weighted production growth was accompanied by a step change improvement in capital efficiency.","Specifically looking at the Turner formation, which was our top development target in 2019 the team did a fantastic job of substantially reducing cycle times and recognizing savings of more than $1 million per well as well cost pushed towards $6 million per well by year end.","As I look ahead to the upcoming year, our highest priority in the Powder River Basin is the delineation of our Niobrara potential. Our Niobrara position consisting of 200,000 net acres in the core of the play's chalk window has repeatable resource play characteristics and the potential to be an important growth driver for Devon longer term. Over the past two years, results from our Niobrara appraisal work have confirmed this potential with 11 operated wells now online and the average 30-day rates from these oil-prone wells reaching as high as 1,500 BOEs per day.","Further progressing the team's confidence, our initial spacing test brought online in the second half of 2019 would suggest the commercial potential for at least three to four wells per section. These tests have also confirmed our ability to develop the Niobrara independent of the deeper Turner interval.","Based on positive operating results obtained to-date, we are doubling our Niobrara activity in 2020 to approximately 15 wells. With this increased capital allocation, we are methodically focusing our delineation efforts in the Southwest quadrant of our acreage, which we call Atlas West and has delivered some of the highest oil rates in the basin. With additional success, we believe it's possible to ready a portion of our Atlas West acreage for full field development in 2021.","And finally, our Eagle Ford and STACK assets are successfully fulfilling their strategically important roles in our portfolio providing nearly $600 million of free cash flow over the past year. Specifically in the Eagle Ford, the key message I want to convey is that we have reestablished operational momentum in the play with our new partner, exiting the year producing around 53,000 BOEs per day.","Our fourth quarter operations were impacted by a well control event related to surface equipment. This situation has been resolved but it did result in estimated downtime of 9,000 BOEs per day in the quarter and remediation costs in the quarter of approximately $7 million.","Looking ahead to 2020, we expect to maintain strong operational continuity in the Eagle Ford running an average of three to four rig lines through most of the year. This disciplined and capital-efficient plan is expected to deliver a modest increase in our production volumes on a year-over-year basis while staying true to the role of generating significant amounts of free cash flow.","Lastly in the STACK, we are excited about our recently announced Dow joint venture. With the Dow deal we have monetized half of our working interest in 133 undrilled locations in exchange for a $100 million drilling carry over the next four years. This innovative agreement will help us bring forward value in the STACK, while delivering carry-enhanced returns that compete effectively for capital within our portfolio.","In addition to the benefits of a drilling carry, our returns are also expected to be enhanced by lower well cost from focused infill drilling and from midstream incentive rates that substantially improve per unit operating cost for each new well brought online.","Initial activity from the Dow joint venture will begin in the second quarter of 2020 with a two-rig program developing the 18-well Jacobs Row in Northern Canadian County. First production from the Jacobs Row is forecast to occur in early 2021. While we will continue to look for smart ways to enhance the value of our STACK position, we are quite pleased with the initial step we have taken with Dow.","That concludes my prepared remarks. And I would like to turn the call back over to Scott.","Scott Coody","Thanks David. We'll now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. This allows us to get to more of your questions on the call today. With that operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Good morning. Dave the 2020 capital allocation obviously 60% going to the Delaware, 20% to Powder, 17% to the Eagle Ford and 3% in the STACK. And the STACK CapEx is down from call it a 16% mix last year. How comfortable are you with the complement -- complementary assets in the portfolio to the Delaware? And how are you thinking about inorganic opportunities as we did see a favorable reaction to the WPX Felix transaction, which was announced a few weeks ago?","Dave Hager ","Sure Arun. Yeah, first off, we are very comfortable with the capital allocation we have and frankly the shift of capital from the STACK to the Delaware is the primary reason that you're going to see the growth that we have described in 2021 in general terms, why that is sustainable over a longer period of time, because if you think about it conceptually it takes nine to 12 months for first production to come from capital.","And so really for the most part the capital that we're spending in 2020 where we've shifted some of that capital to the Delaware is being reflected in 2021 production results, which is driving that oil growth rate. And that is sustainable for many, many years with the deep inventory of opportunities that we have in the Delaware Basin. So that's fundamentally why we're going to see the kind of growth rates that we're describing here for a long time.","Now given that that we are comfortable and we are driving higher capital efficiencies internally, we're driving higher levels of cash flow and focused on returning that value to shareholders through increased capital efficiencies and the higher cash flow that we're generating, we have no need to do an acquisition.","Now are we looking at opportunities? Absolutely. That -- we are in the deal flow. We're always going to be in a deal flow. We think that's part of our job. But we are going to be incredibly disciplined around any decision regarding that because of the strength of our internal portfolio that we have and the confidence that we have that we're going to be able to continue to drive higher cash flow through the oil growth and increased capital efficiencies.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And I had one operating question. I know there's been a lot of excitement around the Cat Scratch area Todd. We did want to see if you could maybe elaborate on the initial delineation success in the Potato Basin. I think your pad is just south of Oxy's height and length 14-well program. So I was wondering if you could talk about some of the implications of these delineation results and perhaps capital allocation on a go-forward basis in this fifth part of your Delaware Basin portfolio.","David Harris ","Arun, this is David Harris. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're really excited about the Potato Basin areas. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is an area where some other companies including Oxy as you mentioned have been active for a little while.","Spud Muffin is our first operated test. We brought seven wells online there and they far exceeded our expectations for that area. And so we think we're going to see increasing activity out there not just from an industry perspective, but you'll increasingly see it compete for capital within our portfolio.","I think if you look in the operations report at kind of how we've allocated capital throughout the year, it's going to be roughly about 20% of our capital or so going forward. And so it's one of the things that we like about the Delaware position that we have in the five core areas. We're diversified across the basin of Southeast New Mexico and think that that will continue to be an exciting area for us going forward.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks for those comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Actually I'm wondering if I could just follow-up on Arun's question on the Delaware inventory. Dave, we haven't really heard you talk about inventory depth in quite a while at least not in terms of numbers in your slide deck. So, I just wondered if you could give us an update as to how that risk development inventory looks, particularly in the Delaware.","And if I may this bolt-on a part B to that, we haven't really heard a lot of people talk much about interference or parent-child issues since I guess about a year ago. So I just want to make sure that we're -- you guys are comfortable with the spacing that you're developing the Delaware at this point.","Dave Hager","Yeah. Thanks Doug. Well, frankly we have the inventory slide in our corporate deck I think everything up until this presentation. There's no big news. We just had a lot of other information we wanted to cover on in this operations report. So, we didn't have it in there. But there's -- and David Harris can give you a little bit more detail on this, but we have a very deep inventory in the Delaware Basin that is going to compete for capital for many, many years. And that's going to be the underpinning of the growth in the company.","Now when we say we have that kind of inventory, we are obviously thinking about issues such as what is the right spacing, parent-child relationships, et cetera. That's all incorporated in that. Now, I think you may in the future and we're constantly refreshing this, our feelings on this, you may see at some point that the actual number of locations may change.","But that's because we're driving to longer and longer laterals all the time, and so it may take less wells to deliver the same resource. But -- which is again part of the capital efficiency drive that we're on as a company. But the resource is really not -- I don't think is going to be changing significantly. So David, do you want to add any beyond that?","David Harris","Yeah. You bet. I guess one thing I would add specifically in addition to some of the things that Dave noted, from a capital efficiency perspective as we laid out the roughly 2,000 wells of risked Delaware inventory last year and we're going to bring on about 130 spuds or so this year, so that's about 15 years of inventory. As Dave said, we have a long, long runway of high-quality things to do.","One of the things that we really haven't reflected go forward that we think will continue to improve the quality of that inventory is the capital efficiency and the step change that we're seeing. There's -- when you're able to reduce your cost and cycle times as material as we have been and think we'll be able to continue to do, and as you're able to enhance the productivity of your well certainly that's going to have a positive impact as you roll forward and think about the development of that resource base going forward.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate the answers, fellows. I want to maybe jump to a question for Jeff, if I may. It's got a bit of a Delaware question embedded in it. But Jeff you talked about the 5% to 10% payout ratio for dividends. Can you talk about what the right mix -- I actually just want to think about how you think about the right mix of cash returns. The long-term mid-cycle or mid-single-digit growth I should say, is kind of a new number. Is that an output of the planning process? Is that a target? How do you mix all those things together? And I guess I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Jeff Ritenour","Yeah. Doug I would say it's more of an output. It's a balance. We've had a balance for all the different targets and metrics that we've been talking about from a growth standpoint, from the payout ratio and the dividend. Actually I would back up and say, what underpins all of that is that lowering that breakeven funding level for us. So you heard us talk about the $46.50 for 2021.","We're working obviously to lower that every day. And that's really going to underpin our financial strategy going forward as we add high-margin assets to the portfolio through the capital allocation that we've talked about more so to the Delaware on a go-forward basis. So, when we think about how that competes relative -- not only to our sector, but I would point you to the broader S&P 500 sector, we've looked at what is the kind of free cash flow yield that looks competitive.","We think it's probably something in the 5% to 10% range. You marry that with what you -- what our dividend should look like and how competitive that is not only again to the S&P -- excuse me, to the E&P sector, but the broader S&P 500. And then we try to marry all that together and spit out what we think is a pretty competitive game plan not just from growth but on all those free cash flow metrics as well.","Doug Leggate","So Jeff to be clear you're tapping the spending or are you targeting a growth rate?","Jeff Ritenour","Yes. It's really a returns-based focus. So we start from the ground up in building our game plan and portfolio and we allocate as much capital as we can to the highest-return products and everything else just falls out of that.","Doug Leggate","All right. Thanks so much, guys.","Jeff Ritenour","And we measure that against the broader competitive landscape to make sure that we're in line and competitive with our peers and then the broader S&P 500.","Dave Hager","Doug I guess, what we're trying to say here is we look at a combination of returns, growth and free cash flow generation and try to optimize at a level that is the best for all three of those metrics. And so it's not an absolute one or the other. It's an interactive look at those variables and see what we think makes the most sense overall.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Thanks. I got it. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate the \u2013 answer the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Dave Hager","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai","My first question is on the updated corporate breakeven. So your two-year now is averaging $46.50 WTI and $2 Henry Hub. Can you just talk about how the breakeven in 2021 compares to 2020? And any changes you have to the assumptions that are embedded into that?","I guess kind of what we're getting at is that the 2020 breakeven benefit from momentum in 2019 and hedges and that's true for a lot of E&Ps right now but there's also some offsets as well for you guys too. But the average $46.50 over two years seems to imply an improvement in 2021. So just any color that you would have on that would be great beyond just the timing of the Wolfcamp activity?","Jeff Ritenour","Yes. Jeanine you're spot on. That's exactly right. It does imply improved breakeven in 2021 versus 2020. You're right. We do get \u2013 we have taken the benefit of the hedges that we have in place as it relates to 2020 but I'll point you back to some comments Dave made earlier, which is a function of our capital program. The capital that we're spending and the allocation to the Delaware and specifically the Wolfcamp in 2020 is what's really driving that improved capital efficiency in 2021. And so it's just increasing our ability to lower that breakeven in future years.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. And then my second question is on dividend coverage. We've seen a lot of increases so far this earnings season. And when Devon thinks about dividend growth and the risk\/reward associated with that, on what WTI price are you comfortable with in terms of dividend coverage on an unhedged basis?","Jeff Ritenour","Yes. We \u2013 Jeanine, as we said in our prepared remarks and I think we've talked about in the past, we've tried to build the business around a $50 oil and kind of $2 gas price. So that's where we start with our base business plan and then evaluate obviously the different market dynamics as we go through each year with our Board to determine where the \u2013 where the dividend ultimately lands. But as we \u2013 as I discussed in my prepared remarks, what underlies our policy, our dividend policy is that 5% to 10% kind of payout ratio, which we think is very competitive with the peer group and the broader S&P 500.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hi, good morning.","David Harris","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Two questions. Hi, Dave. Dave, can you maybe share if there's any information about the Atlas West data you moved into the full development? What kind of resource potential number of prospect inventory that kind of information that maybe we \u2013 you can share with us?","David Harris","Paul, this is David Harris. If I understood the question correctly you were asking about resource potential and potential inventory in our Atlas West area is that correct?","Paul Cheng","That's correct that you were talking about, if the 2020 delineation to be successful as expected then you will move into development in 2021. So I mean, how big is this development plan? Or that is the area that we are talking about?","David Harris","Yes. So when we talk about Atlas West and Atlas East, it's our entire 200,000 acre position in the northern part of Converse County. So as a reminder that doesn't include any of our acreage up in Campbell, where other operators have been active in the Niobrara.","As we think about that position, it's probably early before we move into development to really give you specific resource sort of numbers. But if you just did some pretty simple math at kind of the three-well spacing, which we think is kind of the bottom end of where we'd be that likely points you to something in the neighborhood of about 500 locations.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Great. And","David Harris","And\u2026","Paul Cheng","Yeah. I\u2019m sorry.","David Harris","I was just going to clarify that that's -- those would be two-mile locations.","Paul Cheng","Right. And then that's including both Atlas West and Atlas East or just Atlas West?","David Harris","Both.","Paul Cheng","Both. Okay. The second question is that in the event when you guys just looking at any inorganic opportunity, what financial and operating matrix that will be used in the valuation? And what type of minimum matrix that you need before you would even consider? So we're trying to understand the process there. How that works?","Dave Hager","Well, the first -- yeah, and again the most important thing to think about on this is what I said earlier in response to I think Doug's question is that we have a great game plan internally to start with. So we feel no need to do any inorganic type activity at all.","Now as I said, we are in a deal flow, but we're going to be extremely disciplined. Frankly, we're in a deal flow for a couple other publics that transacted recently including the -- or a couple of deals including the Felix deal that transacted recently. So we're there and we understand what's going on overall.","But to give you some idea for the criteria that we look at for any sort of M&A activity, we wanted to first off to be accretive to our financial metrics on a per-share basis. Second, it also has to fit strategically within the framework of our asset portfolio. So that it an area frankly where we can realize some sort of synergies beyond what are -- the way that is being executed right now whether that be G&A synergies, LOE synergies or capital efficiency synergies -- do we feel that we have a better way to develop these assets than are currently being developed.","And then it have to compete for capital allocation within our portfolio as well. So those are some of the highest. A lot of say -- probably also one you might add would be margin expansion. Obviously, we're looking for ways that we can expand our margins overall as a company, and again, are there ways that we can reduce the cost overall of the combined entities.","So that's overall the type criteria that we look at. Again, it's -- we're going to be -- remain extremely disciplined around these, because we think we absolutely have a strong strategy as it is. We have a strong asset base and we have the right people internally to execute on that these opportunities. And so we'll see if anything comes along to fit those criteria or not, but if it's -- if it doesn't that's fine because we feel very confident in our strategy.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Portillo of TPH. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matt Portillo","Good morning.","Dave Hager","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Portillo","My first question relates to STACK capital allocation. Just given the depressed natural gas and NGL environment at the moment, could you provide some color on how you're thinking about rates of return in the STACK JV at strip? And is there a price at which you might consider delaying development until you see an improvement in the forward curve, while pulling forward more free cash flow generation in 2020?","David Harris","Matt, this is David Harris. Yeah. In terms of STACK activity with Dow, as we've highlighted the first phase of the work that we're going to do with them is in the Jacobs Row, which is a Woodford Row development similar to some of the ones that we've done before. These are very predictable projects, and we're going to be looking at starting that project in the second quarter likely in the May time frame, which just given the size of the project likely means that the production isn't coming on until the first part of 2021.","As we've modeled that, even at the strip today where we currently sit that initial project in the Jacobs Row represents a fully burdened rate of return of about 20%. So, given the predictability of that project, we feel good about that project internally.","With respect to competing for capital obviously we have a partner. We want to stay aligned with them and so we'll continue to be mindful of the commodity price environment as we go forward and have the right kind of dialogue that you would expect as we think about forward decisions around the program.","Matt Portillo","Great. And then just a follow-up question on capital allocation. The PRB is still receiving a large portion of the development capital and looking back over the last two years on a capital efficiency basis, definitely appears that it's lagging the Delaware to some degree, but you're progressing a couple of different initiatives especially on appraisal. Just curious as you guys think about the 2020 program for the PRB, are there some indicators on the horizon that might show a step change in capital efficiency metrics this year as it relates to that asset? And then over time, if you don't see a material change in capital efficiency, is there the potential to reallocate more capital to the Delaware Basin?","David Harris","Yes. This is David again. Yes. I think the punchline answer to your question from a capital efficiency perspective you've already kind of hit on just in terms of the little earlier stage, nature of the assets, some of the appraisal work we're doing. So clearly we've got some science and data acquisition capital there as we're seeking to best understand the resource and how to move it into full-field development. And so I think throughout 2020 and into 2021, particularly with the Niobrara as we move into more of a development mode, we think you'll see a step change in that capital efficiency as we start to mature that asset.","Dave Hager","You've seen the changes in the Wolfcamp as an idea of how much we've been able to drive down drilling costs and completion costs once we go into full development mode and we haven't done any of that yet in the Niobrara. And so at this point, it's just really appraisal mode. So I don't know if the numbers are going to be identical to that or not, but I -- there is definitely -- teams have internal goals I can tell you that are pretty aggressive around cost reduction that they can achieve. Once we get into full development mode and great confidence, we're going to be able to do that. But right now the focus has been as David said more on the appraisal and understanding the resource. But once we get into the development mode then things can change pretty quickly.","Matt Portillo","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Downey of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brian Downey","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a follow-up on that one. So if you do move Atlas West and the PRB towards development in 2021, I'm curious broad-strokes that your flattish total 2021 CapEx level isn't how that may shift based on capital level allocation from elsewhere in 2021?","Dave Hager","Probably not a significant shift. We'd just be able to do more activity much more efficiently, but not a significant overall shift in the capital allocation.","Brian Downey","Okay. And then I had a question on your outlook to 2021. I was curious what service cost environment is currently contemplated in your updated 2020 CapEx guidance versus perhaps what pricing you saw in 4Q 2019, and then what if any deltas you're assuming on pricing or further efficiencies in the 2021 CapEx commentary?","Jeff Ritenour","Yes. No. This is Jeff. We have built in some of the efficiencies that we saw in the second half of 2019 and in the fourth quarter of 2019 into the program. But as it relates to service costs inflation or deflation, we really left that flat. So we have seen some -- continue to see some deflationary environment on some of the services, so it could be a potential tailwind for us in 2020. But generally speaking, we've just assumed that that would be flat for the year.","Brian Downey","And is that flat from...","David Harris","And Brian just let me add a few other tidbits. You were asking about other nuances that may impact the modeling of that. And one thing you have to be mindful of is what the differentials we just carried forward kind of the current state that we're seeing right now into 2021. Where there could be upside on that is obviously is the Permian highway or Whistler comes online, you could potentially see some substantially improved realizations, but we did not build that in. And then also we saw the -- our LOE costs continue to go down as well in 2021, especially after some MBC payments roll off in the STACK. That will be a nice tailwind for us. And one other item you want to notice, we expect our G&A cost to continue to gravitate towards that $350 million target. So that would be another improvement you should account for when you're trying to calibrate to our estimates. Sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off there, but I'll let you ask your next question.","Brian Downey","Yes. No problem. Just to clarify on the flat service price comment. Is that flat from 4Q, flat from 2019 levels? Just want to make sure I'm clear on what the baseline is there.","Jeff Ritenour","Flat from full year.","Brian Downey","Okay. Perfect. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning all. Dave, my first question is for you or Jeff around your financing. Specifically, the recent drilling partnership with Dow, is this something that we could see in additional areas in the STACK or potentially other plays?","Dave Hager","Well, we have a great relationship with Dow. And we started our relationship in the Barnett actually with them with a similar type deal. This is a little bit larger deal. And so -- and we think this is going to work very well. And so, there may be potential for Dow somewhere else. There's also -- we're looking at some opportunities around OBO capital that are not going to fit our return criteria, whether there's opportunities to bring in a partner for some of those opportunities rather than just go non-consent on those wells, but actually have someone else come in and execute a program associated with that. So, that's -- that is another type deal that we're out there working on right now. There's a possibility in the future. And I'm not talking about with Dow at this point, but it could be with other partners.","Neal Dingmann","Interesting. Okay. And then, my follow-up my second question is on your shareholder return. You all have been aggressive in the last several months with stock repurchases. And I'm just wondering, would you all share some details on how you all think about capital allocation between these repurchases and the growth of dividends. And more specifically, I was just wondering about if you would continue to aggressively repurchase this much stock. Do you base it on what your yields or growth levels are? Just wondering, how you sort of balance those things. Thank you.","Dave Hager","Well, I'll just start off saying, we want to have a dividend and Jeff's outlined the 5% to 10% of cash from operations. We don't want to have a dividend that is sustainable and can grow through time and so we are I think a measured approach there. We have about a 2% yield right now I think where we're currently trading. But it's something that should be sustainable and grow through time.","Jeff, can go through the numbers, the cash we have and the cash we're going to be bringing in and why we feel, we can continue to be aggressive on that side. We've set out our capital program. Again, we optimized that capital program already on the basis of how we think about our -- the returns on the program, the capital efficiency this generated, the growth rate that we feel is appropriate and the free cash flow that that will generate. So that's essentially established. So then, you go back to the free cash flow that we -- or the cash that we have as a company. And bottom line, we have the cash. Jeff can go through that and we think we're significantly undervalued. So it's a great investment opportunity.","Jeff Ritenour","Yes. So Dave, you summed it up well. The only thing I would add is some specifics around the cash balances. We talked about this a little bit in the opening remarks, but we have about $1.8 billion of cash at year-end. We'll add to that with the Barnett divestiture, the $770 million roughly. And so, as Dave articulated, we feel like we can accomplish our financial objectives both on the debt repurchase and with $1 billion share repurchase program that our Board has approved for this year. So, we feel really good about our ability to continue returning cash to shareholders via the dividend and the share repurchase this year.","Neal Dingmann","That will make sense. Thank you, both.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kevin MacCurdy","Hey good morning. Just looking at slide 16, do you have the oil mix breakdown between the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs? And was the Spud Muffin mix different than other pads?","Jeff Ritenour","And you're asking about the oil mix with regards to -- could you give us a little bit more detail? Specifically, are you looking for the quarter or just the projects that we brought on for the quarter?","Kevin MacCurdy","Yes, the projects that you brought on for the quarter in slide 16 the overall oil rate.","Jeff Ritenour","Okay. Yes. It's going to be about -- for the 30-day rates that we achieved in the quarter. It's going to be about 70% oil for those projects. Some are a little bit above that and some are a little bit above, but that's a good way to think about it.","Kevin MacCurdy","And do you have the mix between the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs just thinking about as the program goes more towards the Wolfcamp next year?","Jeff Ritenour","Just scanning the numbers here, directionally they look about the same. So, they're around that 70% mark. So there's be -- big differentiation there on a 30-day rate or an EUR basis for that matter between the Wolfcamp and the Bone Spring.","Kevin MacCurdy","Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up the Eagle Ford capital was a pleasant surprise. Do you have what the current well costs are there?","David Harris","This is David Harris. They're about $6 million plus or minus.","Kevin MacCurdy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Jeff Ritenour","And just as a point of clarification. That's for about -- given the configuration of that development that's for about a 6,000 foot lateral.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Dave you and your whole team there. I have just a couple of questions on the Delaware. The first one of the big things last quarter which is -- seems like it's dissipated here was the concern around federal land. And so it seems like that has -- it's at least receded this part of the conversation. But can you give us your view whether it's a -- whether it's kind of receded as an operational concern for you guys and if it's something that we should continue to focus on?","David Harris","Well, it's something that we're certainly aware of and we follow but we feel that we have a good plan and can adjust as appropriate. And I don't want to get into all the various legal arguments so -- on what could or could not take place. We've -- I can tell you we've studied it pretty extensively. And we think from a practical standpoint the most likely thing that could happen would be a slowdown in the permitting process with the BLM.","And in preparation for that we are building an inventory of permits. The permits just so you know on federal land are actually two-year permits and then you can apply for a two-year extension on the permits. That's the max that anybody can get. And so we're building up our permit inventory if that eventuality would take place. Under the Obama administration, it took about 18 months or so to get a permit. Under the Trump administration, it's more like 6 months to get a permit and so we're preparing for that. But again that's one of the advantages of also having a multi-basin portfolio too is that we can reallocate capital away from federal lands.","But in the meantime we're growing up the inventory if the permitting process does slow down. And again I know there's talk of other things that are more dramatic than that and we don't have time to get into all that from a legal discussion here on the call, but I think we've looked at a lot of those issues. And this is what we think is by far the most likely scenario that we should prepare for.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thanks for that Dave. And then I just want to touch on one other base with respect to the shift to the Wolfcamp and the better capital efficiency. So I think you've said that you've that -- you made note earlier in the call about how you really worked hard to get your drilling times and your D&C costs down on the Wolfcamp and the Delaware Basin.","But the other piece of that puzzle the well productivity can you just recap for us what if anything is changed or what you've learned over the last year or the last six months that is the other part of the puzzle that is going to power this step higher in capital efficiency as you shift to the Wolfcamp in the Delaware?","Dave Hager","Yes. And first off Charles if you look at slide 18 you'll show -- we showed the drilling and completion costs. For the Wolfcamp wells we had $880 per foot. I think that compares extremely well against what some other people are talking about probably even today and that's again just the Wolfcamp. And if we looked at our entire well mix it would -- of the Delaware Basin it'd be even a much lower dollar per foot. And so just keep that in mind when you hear some other numbers out there that -- about the on the efficiency side.","On the productivity side I think we're finding and we've learned a lot about the Wolfcamp. I'll tell you who can probably get a little bit more detail. David why don't you run with it here? I got a few ideas but I think you probably have better ones than I do. So take that off.","David Harris","Yes. You bet. I think at the core of it over the last several years as we've increased our technical focus we are really doing integrated reservoir modeling from a multidisciplinary approach and what that's led to is a high-grade of landing zones and targets. And so I think that's probably -- as much as anything that's the biggest driver that you're seeing from a productivity standpoint is the higher-end technical work we're doing.","We're targeting the best parts of these landing zones. Our geo-steering capabilities is something we've invested in over the -- several years ago starting several years ago keeping those wells in zone substantially through that entire lateral. All those things add up on a cumulative basis to kind of -- to drive the step change performance that you've seen from a productivity perspective.","Charles Meade","Thank you for the color, David.","Scott Coody","Well I see we're at the top of the hour. So I appreciate everyone's interest in Devon today. And if you have any further questions please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any time which consists of myself and Chris Carr. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Vince White","Thank you, and welcome everybody to Devon\u2019s first quarter earnings call and webcast. Today\u2019s call will follow our usual format. I\u2019ll cover a couple of preliminary items, and then our President and CEO, John Richels, will provide his comments. Following that, Dave Hager, the Head of Exploration will provide an operations update, and then Jeff Agosta, our CFO, will finish with a review of our financial results, as well as some specific guidance for the upcoming quarter.","After Jeff\u2019s discussion, we will have our Q&A session, and we\u2019ve got Darryl Smette, the head of marketing midstream and supply chain with us today to help in the Q&A. We\u2019ll conclude the call after about an hour, but as usual, the Investor Relations team will be available for any follow-up for the rest of the day.","During the call today, we\u2019ll make some minor changes to our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. However, we will not be issuing a revised 8K because our outlook for the remainder of the year does fall within the ranges that we provided in the former 8K filed in February.","To access a comprehensive summary of our current guidance, you can go to Devonenergy.com and click on the guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of our website.","Please note that all references today to plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates are considered forward-looking statements under US securities law and are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and to see a discussion of the risk factors relating to these estimates, you can reference our various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also in today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll reference certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we use these measures, we\u2019re required to provide the related disclosures and they can be found on Devon\u2019s website as well.","Before I turn the call over to John, I want to briefly comment on the 1.9 billion non-cash asset impairment charge taken during the first quarter, which resulted from a full-cost accounting ceiling test. The fact that we have an impairment charge in this quarter, in spite of stronger gas prices, seems counterintuitive at first glance. However, when you examine the mechanics of the ceiling test, it begins to make sense.","In the second quarter of last year, several of our gassy large cap piers that are on the full cost method of accounting took significant impairment charges because of declining gas prices. However, Devon\u2019s relatively large oil and NGLs component and our reserve base protected us from having a write-down in last year\u2019s second quarter, and reduced the magnitude of our write-downs in the second half of last year.","In the first quarter of this year, weakness in US NGLs prices and Canadian oil price realizations removed some of the cushion that was previously provided. When taken in aggregate, including our first quarter charge announced today, all of the large cap companies utilizing the full-cost method have taken write-downs of similar relative magnitude. The impairment charge, just as a reminder, the impairment charge has no impact on cash flow, cash balances or our credit agreements, and is certainly not indicative of the future cash flows we expect to generate from our assets.","When you exclude the asset impairment charge and other items analysts typically exclude from estimates, our non-GAAP earnings and cash flow for the quarter were $0.66 and $2.85 per share on a diluted basis, respectively. Higher than forecasted production and lower pre-tax costs were the key drivers that allowed us to comfortably exceed Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the quarter.","With those items out of the way, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Richels.","John Richels","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered very solid operating results across all of our core development assets. The conversion of our portfolio mix to a higher oil weighting remains on track and that\u2019s evidenced by the strong growth in oil production during the quarter. More importantly, the projects driving this growth are delivering very attractive rates of return. So now, let me just go over a few highlights.","During the first quarter, we increased company-wide oil production 8%, compared to the last quarter, and 14% higher than the first quarter of 2012. This growth was led by our US oil production, which increased 23% year-over-year, driven largely by continued success in the Permian Basin. With the aggressive transition of our North American onshore portfolio mix, oil and liquids production has now reached 41% of total volumes, which is up from 30% just a few years ago.","These products now account for two-thirds of our sales revenue. We\u2019ve also made important progress in de-risking our Mississippian and Rockies oil acreage with impressive results during the quarter, providing good visibility to the next leg of oil growth at Devon. You\u2019ll hear more about both the Mississippian and the Rockies oil results from Dave in just a few moments.","With the recent upswing in pricing, we have meaningfully added to our oil and gas hedge position for this year and next year. This includes attractive basis swaps for our Canadian heavy oil production for the remainder of this year. We also enhanced our margins during the quarter by controlling costs. In fact, pre-tax cash costs per BOE actually declined 4% from the prior quarter.","And finally, in March, we announced a 10% increase in our cash dividend. This is the eighth time we\u2019ve increased our dividend since 2004, and extends a long history of returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of course, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape with a net debt-to-cap ratio of only 22% and $6.5 billion of cash on hand.","As we have previously discussed, $6.1 billion of our cash resides in foreign subsidiaries and there are some tax ramifications associated with the repatriation of that cash to the US. However, recent changes to our tax position now afford us the opportunity to immediately repatriate approximately $2 billion of our foreign cash with minimal additional tax. Jeff will speak to this in more detail later in the call.","One of the most discussed items in the industry right now is the improvement in natural gas prices with both the current Henry hub trading month and the longer dated strip now above $4 per MCF. The relative strength in natural gas prices is attributable to both the increase in heating demand from a late winter, along with evidence that the growth in US natural gas supply is beginning to slow significantly. These factors have helped reduce gas storage levels to just below the trailing five-year average.","The recent uplift in natural gas prices could have a significant impact on our financial results in upcoming quarters. While the improved sentiment around gas prices is certainly encouraging, we\u2019re not modifying our 2013 capital plans at this time. Even with our natural gas assets being located across some of the lowest cost shale plays in North America, returns continue to be more attractive on the oil and liquids rich side of our portfolio versus dry gas drilling.","In addition to improving cash flows from higher natural gas pricing, we also expect to benefit in the upcoming months from improved price realizations on our Canadian oil production. For the past several quarters, Canadian oil price realizations have been very volatile and have averaged well below the historical range, due to tight regional supply and demand dynamics.","While we expect price volatility to persist for the next 12 months, we\u2019ve recently seen a big recovery in Canadian heavy oil price realizations. Western Canadian Select blended pricing has dramatically improved from a low of approximately 50% of WTI in mid January, to as high as 85% of WTI in recent weeks. This improvement in Canadian oil pricing is in response to increased takeaway capacity and the delay in the startup of new production from Exxon\u2019s curl project.","As with changes in natural gas pricing, our leverage to higher Canadian heavy crude pricing is quite meaningful. In spite of the clear visibility of improving cash flows, Devon\u2019s valuation remains at a meaningful discount to our North American onshore peers. As we discussed in our last call, we are examining and considering any and every option to highlight unrecognized asset value to the market and bring that value forward for our shareholders.","However, any action we take must create sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. Keep in mind, each of these potential alternatives has unique complexities that require careful consideration. They include operational complexities, regulatory issues, contractual obligations, relative asset valuations, and tax implications, just to name a few.","As we discussed last quarter, one option being evaluated is the creation of a midstream master limited partnership. We\u2019re nearing our \u2013 the completion of our evaluation and we expect to reach a final go\/no-go decision before the end of this quarter. Pre-offering rules prohibit us from providing any additional information at this point.","In addition to the midstream MLP, we are continuing, in earnest, the review of several additional potential actions and expect to complete these evaluations by year end. So to sum it up, we continue to successfully execute our business plan, as evidenced by our solid quarterly operating results and, specifically, by the continuation of strong oil production growth.","Our continued success in the Permian, the Mississippian trends, and the Rockies has enhanced the visibility of our long-term oil and liquids growth profile. Our balanced asset portfolio provides our shareholders high margin oil growth and a significant option value on improving natural gas prices from our vast inventory of undrilled locations in the high-quality natural gas plays. And, finally, we\u2019re committed to optimizing shareholder returns and are evaluating every option to unlock value in our company.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed highlight of our details.","Dave Hager","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s begin with a quick recap of our first quarter capital expenditures. Exploration development capital for the first quarter totaled $1.5 billion, in line with our previous guidance. Keep in mind, our first quarter expenditures will be the high point for the year due to our winter programs in Canada and the declining activity levels in the Barnett. We fully expect to be within the full year guidance range provided in our February 8K filing.","As John indicated earlier, our first quarter capital program was centered on our highest margin oil and liquids opportunities and generated positive results. We\u2019re off to a good start this year and the solid year-over-year oil and liquids production growth in the Permian Basin, Jackfish and Cana. We also continue to move forward with the evaluation of de-risking of our various emerging plays.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the first quarter highlights. Starting in the Permian Basin, our Permian Basin production averaged a record 68,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. Looking specifically at our Permian oil production, it grew 24% over the same period of last year, with wide oil accounting for 60% of our Permian volumes.","In the first quarter, we ran 29 operating rigs focused on Permian oil development opportunities. As we told you in February, we had a large number of wells awaiting completion at year end, which was a result of higher activity levels that began in the fourth quarter of last year.","We are currently working through these well completions and expect to see strong second quarter oil production growth in the Permian Basin of roughly 15% sequentially, and will continue to deliver strong growth throughout the remainder of the year. Overall, we are on track to grow basin-wide oil production nearly 40% in 2013.","A key driver of our Permian oil growth continues to be our Bone Springs horizontal program in New Mexico. We currently have 10 operating rigs working in the play. In the first quarter, we brought 20 Bone Spring wells on line, with average 30-day IP rates of 590 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, more than 70% was light oil. While the majority of our activity in the area is focused on our Bone Springs program, we also have an ongoing Delaware program targeting light oil.","In the first quarter, we tied in four new Delaware horizontals, highlighted by the Caswell 23-fed DH that had a 30-day IP rate of 440 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 360 barrels of oil. Our combined drilling inventory in the Bone Springs and Delaware currently represents over 1,300 remaining locations, and more than 300 million barrels of net risk resource potential to Devon.","Now shifting to our JV with Sumitomo, exploration drilling continues across the partnership\u2019s 556,000 net acres on the eastern flank of the Midland basin and along the Eastern Shelf. In the first quarter, we drilled eight wells across our multi-county position targeting the Cline Shale. We have data on roughly 30 horizontal wells completed by Devon and industry, to date.","The results vary widely, from 30-day IPs ranging from less than 50 BOE per day, to over 800 BOE per day. We believe that drilling without the benefit of 3D seismic is contributing to the variability in results. We are in the process of acquiring 3D seismic in the area and expect to begin incorporating our findings into our program later this year.","In addition, we continue to experiment with different completion techniques and landing zones in an effort to improve results. In the second quarter, we will begin drilling on our first five-well pad in Sterling County, with an eye towards gaining operational efficiencies and reducing costs.","Later this year, we also plan to test a horizontal Wolfcamp potential on a portion of our Cline acreage. Keep in mind, our operation is spread over a seven-county area encompassing approximately 5,000 square miles and we are still in the early stages of evaluation.","We continue to see good results from our five-rig program in the Wolfcamp Shale in the Southern Midland Basin. During the first quarter, we spun 18 new horizontal Wolfcamp wells, but because of timing issues related to pad drilling, only four were brought online. These four wells were tied in with 30-day IP rates that support our price for the area with an EUR of 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well.","To date, we have brought online a total of 30 operated Wolfcamp Shale wells and have established approximately 800 undrilled locations in this oil resource play. At this point, we are confident characterizing our Southern Midland Basin Wolfcamp shale as a highly economic, repeatable development play.","In summary, Devon\u2019s 1.3 million net acres in the Permian represents one of the largest and best quality acreage positions in the industry. We continue to be one of the most active Permian drillers and we expect to grow our basin-wide oil production nearly 40% in 2013. With our inventory of thousands of undrilled locations remaining in the Bone Springs, the Delaware, and the Wolfcamp Shale, we expect high growth rate from our Permian oil properties for many years to come.","Shifting to our thermal oil projects in northeastern Alberta, aggregate first quarter production from our two Jackfish projects averaged approximately 54,000 barrels of oil per day net of royalties. Jackfish 1 accounted for 33,000 barrels per day of this total and continued this trend of excellent plant reliability and efficiency. The exact timing of payout at Jackfish 1 continues to fluctuate with changing heavy oil prices and differentials, but our current expectation is for payouts to occur sometime in the second half of this year.","Also at Jackfish 1, we\u2019re testing a variety of productivity enhancements, including the use of solvents and natural gas co-injection. Our first pilot program on these new fronts kick off in the first quarter. If successful, these technologies will likely apply to our other thermal oil assets. We will be monitoring the results of these pilot programs over the course of the year to determine the degree of success and the optimal path forward regarding their use at other locations.","At Jackfish 2, first quarter production increased to an average of 21,000 barrels per day net of royalties. We have completed the wells on an additional well pad at Jackfish 2. Insulation of pad facilities will continue through the summer, followed by commissioning and first steam scheduled for late in the fourth quarter. At Jackfish 3, we\u2019re moving forward on schedule and on budget, with approximately 60% of the project now complete. This puts us on track for a startup around year-end 2014.","At Pike, we wrapped up our winter drilling program during the first quarter. We drilled 34 stereographic core wells and acquired some 55 square miles of seismic. This program essentially completes the evaluation of the first phase of the Pike development, confirming a high-quality reservoir similar to that of our Jackfish projects.","We expect to receive our regulatory approval on Pike around year-end and we continue to work with our partner on the design of the 105,000 barrel per day Pike 1 development. We operate Pike with a 50% working interest, with BP owning the other 50%.","As a reminder, we expect our portfolio to sag the assets to drive Devon\u2019s net thermal oil production to at least 150,000 barrels per day by the end of the decade, representing a compound annual growth rate in the high teens.","Also in Canada, we told you last quarter about our plans to move forward with a development project in the Ferrier corridor area in Western Alberta. This is an area where Devon has roughly 240,000 net acres prospective for the cardium oil and liquid-rich zones, including the glauconite. The first stage of development is focused on about a third of our acreage position, where Devon has an inventory of more than 200 locations, with net resource potential in excess of 100 million barrels of oil equivalent.","Liquid production from its first phase of the development is expected to account for roughly 50% of total production. As a result, we\u2019re constructing a gas processing facility with an inlet capacity of 100 million a day and liquid processing capacity of approximately 13,000 barrels per day. Construction of the facility began in March and is expected to be complete by mid 2014. We will begin ramping up our drilling activity late this year with a six-rig program planned for the fourth quarter.","Moving now to the Cana Woodford shale in Western Oklahoma. In the first quarter, we had 14 operated rigs running. We continue to achieve outstanding results from our focused drilling program in the liquid-rich core. During the quarter, we brought 28 operated wells online with average 30-day IP rates of 5.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 470 barrels of liquids per day. These results continue to rank among the best in the play, to date, and continue to exceed our type curve expectation.","First quarter production averaged 340 million cubic feet equivalent per day, a 26% increase over the year-ago quarter. Cana\u2019s first quarter production growth was led by oil and NGL growth of 78% year-over-year, to 5,000 barrels of oil and 18,000 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. Shifting to the Barnett shale in north Texas, in the first quarter our liquids-rich focus drilling program in the core of the play continued to generate competitive returns.","First quarter net production averaged 1.4 BCF equivalent per day, a slight increase over the previous quarter. Liquids production increased 5% year-over-year to 55,000 barrels per day. Our full-year production guidance assumes a 4% year-over-year decline for the Barnett, but we continue to be impressed with the performance of our base production.","Our efforts to mitigate the declines through initiatives such as reducing line pressures and increased use of automation are paying dividends. With their recent strengthening in natural gas prices, we expect to generate nearly 600 million of free cash flow in the Barnett, in 2013. As John mentioned, we continue to monitor the gas markets very closely. Should the outlet \u2013 outlook for gas prices continue to improve, we can easily shift activity to the Barnett and take advantage of the thousands of rift locations we have in our undrilled inventories.","Finally, to the final development drilling area I\u2019ll cover today, in the Granite Wash area we\u2019re continuing to see solid results. We brought seven operated wells online during the first quarter, including two operated Hogshooter wells with an average 30-day production rate of 1,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 1,100 barrels per day of oil and liquids.","Subsequent to the quarter end, we tied in another Hogshooter well, the lot 1-9, located in Wheeler County. The lot 1-9 has been online for just 15 days and has averaged 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including nearly 2,000 barrels of oil per day.","On the exploration front, from our 600,000 net-acre position in the Mississippian to north central Oklahoma, we have some very encouraging results to report. In the first quarter, we brought 24 wells online, bringing our total operated well count in the play up to 53 producing wells. To date, the majority of our activity has been focused in Noble, Payne and Logan counties, within the joint venture with Sinopec, in which they carry the majority of our capital cost.","At quarter end, we had approximately 71 wells in various stages of completion or tie-in, due to the timing of pad drilling and related infrastructure build-out. It is important to note that because of constraints in the gas-gathering infrastructure and maintenance restrictions, production rates for many of our new wells have been limited. However, even with the constrained flow rates, our results from this play continue to support or exceed our target economics.","Recently, we have seen several wells that have been producing between seven and 30 days, with rates from 600 to over 1,100 barrels of oil per day. That is not barrels equivalent. That is the oil production only. In addition, these wells produce significant volumes of high BTU gas. To date, we are also seeing a higher component of propane and heavier liquids in the NGL barrel, as compared to other liquids-rich plays.","Our recent well results confirm our belief in the important of 3D seismic in the area. With the incorporate \u2013 with the incorporation of 3D seismic into our geological modeling and our selection of drilling locations, we are beginning to see significant improvement in well results.","Our recent success has confirmed our plans to concentrate our activity in areas where we have incorporated 3D seismic into our program. In addition to the benefits of 3D seismic, we have strong evidence our improving completion techniques are resulting in higher EURs.","In summary, strong results from the Mississippian trend confirm our belief that this area will provide the next leg of large-scale \u2013 large scale highly economic oil growth for Devon. And finally, our Rockies oil exploration program delivered encouraging results in the first quarter. Within our Powder River Basin acreage in northeast Wyoming, we brought five oil wells online during the quarter targeting the Turner, Frontier and Parkman formations.","Initial 30-day production from these five wells averaged 540 BOE per day. Following the end of the quarter, we commenced production on two additional high-rate oil wells. After a few weeks of production, these wells, targeting the Parkman and Turner, were averaging 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 960 barrels of oil. Our four-rig program in the Rockies will focus on exploiting our success in the powder river throughout 2013. To date we have identified approximately 600 risk locations across these three formations and we expect this inventory to grow as we continue to de-risk this emerging opportunity.","So, in summary, our 2013 capital program is off to a great start. With solid production results in our cornerstone areas and a significant inventory of emerging oil opportunities, we are poised to deliver solid oil and liquids growth in 2013 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for a financial review and outlook, Jeff.","Jeff Agosta","Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Today, I would \u2013 take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our first quarter results and, where called for, provide updated guidance.","Beginning with production, our first quarter production was very strong, averaging 687,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This exceeded the upper end of our guidance range by a few thousand barrels per day. Solid execution across all of our core development regions drove the strong performance. Most importantly, on the oil side of our business, we again delivered excellent growth.","For the quarter, oil production averaged 162,000 barrels per day, setting an all-time high from our North American asset base and coming in at the top of our guidance range for the quarter. Led by robust growth in the Permian Basin, our US oil production grew 23% compared to the first quarter of 2012.","Looking to the second quarter, we expect growth in the Permian and Mississippian trend to boost total oil production by about 4% sequentially, to a range of 163 to 173,000 barrels per day. NGL production for the second quarter will be essentially flat with the Q1, due to the timing of bringing on wells in our liquids-rich plays.","After taking into account expected declines in natural gas, we expect total company-wide production in the second quarter on a barrel of oil equivalent basis to range between 670 and 690,000 BOE per day. For the second half of the year, oil and liquids growth will accelerate as a result of pad tie-ins and a plan expansion at Cana, a plant expansion in the Barnett, and the impact of the ramp-up in the Permian and Mississippian trend.","Moving to price realizations, as John mentioned earlier, we expect Canadian oil realizations to be volatile, but to improve going forward. Although our realized oil price in Canada averaged only 43% of the WTI benchmark during the quarter, this result was right in line with the guidance we provided. The weak pricing was driven by abnormally high crude storage levels carried over from late 2012, due to down time at multiple refineries and restricted flow rates on key export pipelines.","These temporary bottlenecks have improved as we have moved into the second quarter. In fact, the Western Canadian Select differential in April narrowed to $23 below WTI. In the May contract, it tightened even further to a discount of only $14 per barrel. As result of this improved pricing, we now expect our second quarter Canadian oil price realizations to range from 55 to 65% of WTI.","Looking briefly at our hedging activity, since our last update at year-end, we have added oil hedges. For the balance of 2013, we have entered into contracts to hedge 135,000 barrels per day, which is just under 80% of our forecasted oil production. Of this total, 70,000 barrels per day are swapped at a weighted average price of $100 per barrel. The remaining 65,000 barrels per day utilizes costless callers, with a weighted average ceiling of $112 per barrel and a floor of 90. Additionally, we have taken advantage of the improved outlook in Canadian heavy oil pricing to add regional basis swaps.","For the remainder of the year, we have 35,000 barrels per day swapped at a discount to WTI of $22 per barrel. The recent rise in natural gas prices has also provided us the opportunity to add to our natural gas hedge position.","For the remaining three quarters of 2013, we have protected 1.7 billion cubic feet per day, representing approximately 75% of our expected natural gas production. Of this total, roughly one BCF per day is swapped at a weighted average price of $4.09. Of the remaining 700 million cubic feet per day utilizes costless callers, with a weighted average ceiling of $4.19 and a floor of $3.55.","For 2014, we now have 900 million cubic feet per day hedged with a weighted average floor price of $4.34. For more details on our hedging position, please visit the guidance section of our website that Vince referenced earlier.","Now, turning briefly to our midstream business, our marketing and midstream operations generated $125 million of operating profit in the first quarter, enhancing our company-wide margins by more than $2 per BOE. Improved natural gas prices and strong cost management helped us exceed the high end of our implied guidance range and increased operating profit by 12% compared to the first quarter of last year.","With a more favorable gas price outlook for the rest of the year, we are well positioned to achieve our full-year forecast of 425 to 475 million midstream operating profit.","Now looking at expenses, in the first quarter, we continued to do a good job controlling costs. Costs in several categories were lower than guidance, most notably, LOE and G&A.","In aggregate, our total pre-tax cash costs were $14.54 per BOE. Or about 4% lower than last quarter. This result is especially impressive given our focus on higher margin oil production, which is generally more expensive to produce. Having achieved significant scale in our core operating areas, coupled with our consistent focus on cost management, we are positioned with one of the better cost structures in the industry.","So moving to the bottom line, our non-GAAP earnings were $0.66 per share, exceeding Wall Street expectations by 20%. This level of earnings translated into cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.2 billion or $2.85 per share, also exceeding the street\u2019s expectations.","We exited March with cash and short-term investments of $6.5 billion and a net debt to adjusted cap ratio of 22%. Of this $6.5 billion of cash, about 6.1 billion continues to reside in foreign subsidiaries. As we have previously discussed, we\u2019re able to move the foreign cash to Canada without incurring additional taxes. In fact, by mid-year, we will have moved approximately $500 million to Canada to help fund ongoing activity.","Conversely, moving the foreign cash to the US can result in additional taxes, depending upon our tax position at the time. However, based on our recent activity levels and evolving tax attributes, it appears the tax NOLs, in conjunction with our foreign tax credits, can be used to offset taxes due to the repatriation of our foreign cash back to the US. As a result, we will be moving approximately $2 billion of our foreign cash back to the US with minimal additional taxes.","As we move through the year and get additional clarity on our future tax position, we believe there may be the potential to bring back another sizeable amount of cash to the US later this year or in 2014 on a tax-efficient basis.","Once this cash becomes available to use within the US, our first action would be to immediately repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Beyond that, we will allocate capital as we always have by assessing the relative attractiveness of E&P expenditures versus share repurchases and debt repayments, in an effort to optimize growth and cash flow per share adjusted for debt.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vince for Q&A. Vince.","John Richels","Thanks, Jeff. As a reminder, during the question-and-answer session, we\u2019ll ask each participant to limit their question to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. And, with that, Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning, everybody. Hopefully two \u2013 two quick ones. Jeff, on the repatriation of the cash, could you just help us why you don\u2019t have a little more conviction in going directly to share buybacks with the cash given what your share price is? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Jeff Agosta","Well, the immediate thing to do is to repay our commercial paper, we\u2019ve got a large amount of that, over $3 billion of commercial paper. We\u2019ll assess the viability of a share buyback in due course, like we normally do.","John Richels","Doug, it\u2019s John. Let me add one thing. One of the points we\u2019ve been trying to make for some time is we haven\u2019t constrained the types of things we thought were proper allocations of capital just by where the cash resided and you\u2019re very familiar with this, not everyone on the call is quite as familiar so let me take two seconds just to kind of go back to the history because you recall what we did is we got a little over $10 billion for the sale of our offshore assets.","That was about 7.9 or $8 billion after tax. First thing we did is we returned 40% of it or a little over 40%, almost 50% to our shareholders through a share buyback and since that time have been investing the remaining funds into this transition of our \u2013 our portfolio to higher oil-based properties.","So, and light oil properties. So it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t been allocating that and it\u2019s just been sitting there. I think that\u2019s an important thing to realize. And we really haven\u2019t been constrained in our ability to allocate that capital given the fact that there has been no negative carry between borrowings in the US and the amount that we\u2019ve been earning on those funds offshore just because of the low-interest rate environment so I just thought I\u2019d throw that clarification out there.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that, I guess, John, in light of your efforts you\u2019ve given your acknowledgment of where the share price is relative to where you think it should be I\u2019m just a little surprised you\u2019re not getting more aggressive on the opportunity to buy back your stock the these levels, I guess that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.","John Richels","Well, one other thing there, Doug, is that, you know, we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been moving down the road here on these light oil projects that we think are very \u2013 give us very, very good rates of return. And it\u2019s early days for some of these projects. And it\u2019s very hard to kind of move around, you know, stop pursuing that program and move to a share repurchase and back and forth so we have some large oil opportunities in this company that\u2019s going to require significant levels of capital expenditure over the next while.","So we\u2019ll continue to look at that and, as you know, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been shy about that at all and we\u2019ve bought back more stock than anybody in our peer group and so we\u2019ll continue to look at it very carefully.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that. My follow-up is for David, I expect it\u2019s for David. David, the oil rates coming out of the Mississippian line, can you just give us a little bit more help as to where you see the tight curves now in those areas particularly as you move north into the Vitruvian acreage because 600,000 barrels of oil sounds like it\u2019s even better than some of the established players in that area and production rates would be helpful, thanks.","Dave Hager","Yeah, Doug. We\u2019re not going to get into too much specifics on where we\u2019re getting what rates, for competitive reasons, we\u2019ve invested a lot of money and effort into 3-D seismic which we think has given us a competitive edge and so for competitive reasons I\u2019m not going to discuss too much about this, but in general, we are staying with our tight curves that we have established before, we are seeing, though, obviously, some wells that are significantly above our tight curve that I highlighted in my section of the call.","This that we think is directly attributable to the 3-D seismic and the additional science we\u2019re doing in the area. We are still saying that overall that over the life of the well, that about 40% of the production will be oil, about 20% NGLs and the remaining natural gas.","Now, early on you get a much higher percentage of the production, that is oil, and it tends to become more gassy through time. But, of course that\u2019s a good thing because it means you get your value back more quickly.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. I\u2019ll let someone else jump on. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Mead with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles Mead \u2013 Johnson Rice","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. With regards to the tax-free repatriation, I\u2019m curious, is this \u2013 has there been some movement on the regulatory front, or is this more a function of sharpening your pencil and getting creative with legal structures? And when you talk about the possibility of repatriating the additional 4 billion in a tax-efficient manner, I\u2019m curious, does that mean 0% or does that mean, you know, below some threshold of, you know, X percent?","Jeff Agosta","Charles, this is Jeff. Just to clarify when we talk about the first 2 billion being moved back we didn\u2019t say tax-free, it\u2019s with minimal additional taxes. You know, think in terms of mid single digits percentages of cash taxes.","Charles Mead \u2013 Johnson Rice","Got it.","Jeff Agosta","And it is \u2013 Devon fact-specific. There were no regulatory changes and there are no clever legal structures being utilized. As to any amounts that we would repatriate in the future, of course, we would want to make sure that it was a tax-efficient repatriation. So it would \u2013 it\u2019s not likely to be the full 4 billion but it could be another sizeable amount, similar to what we\u2019re doing currently. But that is, again, going to be Devon fact-specific and it\u2019s going to depend on our future tax profile.","Charles Mead \u2013 Johnson Rice","Got it, thank you, Jeff, and if that counts as one question, I\u2019d like one follow-up, if I could with Dave. Dave, I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on the horizontal Wolfcamp wells that you drilled along the lines of the length of the laterals, where in the zone that you are \u2013 that you\u2019re landing those and if you could, offer a comparison with what you\u2019re doing in the Delaware basin with Bone Springs in Delaware both in terms of how mature the plays are and where you think they might sort out on attractiveness.","Dave Hager","Well, they\u2019re both very attractive plays to start with. They both have strong rates of return, whether you\u2019re talking about the Delaware or the horizontal Wolfcamp play. We have been targeting our wells in the horizontal Wolfcamp play to be on the order of 7500-foot to 8,000-foot lateral length, we think that\u2019s important for the overall economics.","We also have been landing zones \u2013 it depends a little bit geographically where you\u2019re talking about here but we \u2013 we land more in the lower Wolfcamp but we also land some in the middle Wolfcamp as well, when we land in the lower Wolfcamp we think we\u2019re actually communicating up to the middle Wolfcamp in many cases anyway, so but we found that to be the best and I think we\u2019re the first company, frankly, to start landing wells in the lower Wolfcamp and led the way on that, so another example of Devon taking the lead on it.","We just have \u2013 we\u2019re now characterizing the Wolfcamp as a development play. We have enough wells out there with a lot of repeatability of results that we\u2019re very confident that we have, we set 800 locations in the Wolfcamp and we have 1300 locations between the Bone Springs and the Delaware, so right there over 2,000 location so that\u2019s what underpins our growth and I can characterize them as essentially in the development mode at this point.","Charles Mead \u2013 Johnson Rice","Great. Thank you for the added detail, Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of (inaudible) with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Jeff, I was wondering if we could go over the guidance real quick. I was a little bit surprised that, you know, you guided the 670 to 690 given some of the comments in the call script. You did 687 this quarter, you guys talked about 15% of growth in the Permian on the oil side which would put you, you know, at 693 plus some, you know, momentum in the Cana as well as the Mississippian so I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate on what some of the minuses could be as you go into Q2.","Jeff Agosta","Sure I\u2019ll take a stab at it and let others jump in as well. It\u2019s mostly the gas decline that causes the BOEs. I think if you look at it on a barrel of oil equivalent basis just because we\u2019re coming off such a high percentage gas production on a BOE basis and the decline in natural gas, also the NGLs are going to be muted growth in the second quarter just due to the timing of tie-in of new well pads.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Jeff Agosta","I don\u2019t know, Dave.","John Richels","That\u2019s exactly right. Let me take the opportunity to answer a question you didn\u2019t ask. Some people have been saying, well, your Permian growth has been fairly flat the last couple quarters, what about your \u2013 you\u2019re projecting 40% over the year and we are \u2013 the answer there is pad drilling.","We have for instance right now about 20 wells and we\u2019ve been bringing on or currently bringing online within the Permian and so we\u2019re going to be significantly ramping up our production in the second, third and fourth quarter. You saw in the quarter we drilled 19 wells, only completed four, so we\u2019re working our way through that backlog right now, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to really drive the Permian oil growth. We\u2019ve reviewed it and we\u2019re very confident on that growth throughout the year.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s helpful. John, I just wanted to see if you could, you know, talk about \u2013 you mentioned you\u2019re going through the evaluation of the midstream process today. Understanding you can\u2019t get into too many of the details I was wondering at a high-level you\u2019re talking about some of the pros and cons and what will drive the ultimate decisions on whether to move forward or not.","John Richels","You know, we\u2019ve got to be very careful about what we\u2019re saying. We\u2019ve pretty much been wood-shredded by our securities lawyers on \u2013 on this. But some of the things that we\u2019re going through, and we\u2019ve talked about this openly, is \u2013 is, you know, when you first look at it on the back of a piece of paper, it looks \u2013 these things \u2013 you develop a certain outlook for it and then you\u2019ve got to get a lot of details. And some of them are specific.","We\u2019ve got to get through all of our contracts and how they\u2019re going to work under \u2013 if we went to an MLP and some of the operational complexities, the tax complexities and that type of thing so we\u2019re just kind of working our way through that and I hate to hold you off on that, but we really think we will have had the opportunity to do some really detailed work as we need to with a transaction of this size and be able to come out with a \u2013 with a final goal or \u2013 go or no-go decision here by the end of the quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Fair enough. Thanks a lot","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Bernstein Research","Yeah, I had a question on the Barnett you talked about potentially as gas price rises you can see more incremental activity there. How long would it take you to get a supply response if you put a rig back in the Barnett next month?","John Richels","Well, if we start drilling in the Barnett we are essentially pad drilling in there, so it\u2019s on the order of four to six months, really, before you complete the pads, all the drilling, complete all the completions on them before you even bring those wells on production and, of course, it\u2019s important to remember we\u2019re dealing with a very large base production in the Barnett right now of 1.4 BCF equivalent per day.","So one of the things we\u2019re really focused on is optimizing that base production because \u2013 and that\u2019s where I was highlighting during my comments of how we think we\u2019re doing a good job of maximizing that base production. So that\u2019s really frankly just as important at this point as putting more rigs back to work.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Bernstein Research","Okay. And the follow-up, do you guys have an internal view of where your share price should be?","Vince White","This is Vince. We do have an internal view and I would say that we generally believe that it\u2019s the market\u2019s place to set our stock price based on our performance ands and we\u2019ve been told by a lot of participants in the market that we aren\u2019t getting the value of the underlying assets reflected in our current share price.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Bernstein Research","And so if you have an extra $100 million to invest, do you look at basically what MPV you\u2019d create with a drill bit versus what MPV you\u2019d create in buying back shares, is that the logic of that thought process?","Vince White","We do model that out over time. This goes back to what John was saying earlier. We look at the expected returns or impact on cash flow per net adjusted share from incremental on the property base versus the impact of buying shares.","And while as John said we can\u2019t really zig and zag a lot, we strapped on some large acreage positions in light oil plays, we\u2019re having some pretty good early success in those plays and as we move forward in those they\u2019re likely going to afford us the opportunity to invest large amounts of capital at high rates of return. So if they play out the way that we believe they will, this produces the optimum outcome.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Bernstein Research","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Morning, guys.","John Richels","Morning, David.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Real quickly, when you talk about the Permian and the amount of capital that it can absorb over time you have done a JV and a portion of it, is something like a JV still on the table and would that potentially be why maybe production guidance remained the same for the balance of \u201813 even though Q1 dramatically outperformed and Q2 looks positioned well plus you are going to work through drilled uncompleted wells, pad drilling kicking in, in the second half, Barnett flattish, just trying to understand exactly what\u2019s happening with guidance and then the propensity for a JV.","John Richels","Well, you know, Dave, we tend to \u2013 you know, the previous joint ventures that we did, we tended more to earlier exploration plays earlier phase plays and the reason for that is because in addition to the \u2013 just the uplift you get on an \u2013 from an economic point of view, you\u2019re also bringing someone in at an early stage to help to defray some of the risk or help to mitigate some of these risk and you don\u2019t always know how some of these things are working.","When you get to a play that\u2019s more in the development stage, whether it\u2019s the Permian or some of the other plays, at that time it becomes much more just a financing technique. And the financing from a joint venture is quite a bit more expensive than our cost of capital.","And so, you know, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve done it from an operational perspective in the past, not as a method of financing our operations because it is a more expensive way to finance those operations. So I\u2019m not sure that these plays that are in the development stage are the right ones or at least we haven\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t pursued that in the past.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Okay, appreciate that clarification and then maybe a little bit more specifically looking at the Powder River basin results, can you talk about length of laterals, design of the wells, et cetera, I mean obviously the results from those wells in the four-rig program are pretty darned impressive.","Dave Hager","You\u2019re right David, this is David, the results were impressive and have really given us renewed confidence that we can have a lower risk development opportunity with a lot of locations out there. The well design, I don\u2019t have the specifics on them, but we\u2019re typically drilling those around 4500, 5,000-foot laterals, pretty typical for the \u2013 for the area.","And so there\u2019s nothing particularly unique, I would say, about the drilling and the completion side. What we\u2019ve really been able to do is just high grade the acreage significantly where from a geological standpoint where each of these plays work, and that\u2019s the key to it so we\u2019ve done a lot of detailed technical work to figure that out and over the course of the past year or two and now we\u2019re starting to see the results of it.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Great, well, I appreciate the clarification, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you, good morning.","John Richels","Good morning, Brian.","Jeff Agosta","Good morning.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","In the Permian Basin in the Cline field specifically how far east have you now pushed your drilling and you mentioned there\u2019s a decent volatility partly because of a lack of seismic, but how do your well results compare as you go east versus what you and the industry have seen from the wells to the \u2013 to the west?","John Richels","Well, we\u2019ve drilled wells throughout our acreage position. We started off more to the southwest in sterling county, we have pushed further to the north, as far up as fisher county, as well as Noland county, so we\u2019re testing some throughout the acreage position. But keep in mind, though, we\u2019re testing a very, very large area, it\u2019s about 80 by 100 miles so even though you may have a well throughout that acreage position.","If you don\u2019t have the benefit of 3-D, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve necessarily landed the well and drilling horizontally in the optimum position so just having one or two wells across an entire acreage position doesn\u2019t really confirm or condemn an area.","You need to get a lot more \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re seeing it in the miss where the 3-Ds are important and the miss \u2013and we think the s-D is going to be important in the Cline as well. In General, our well results have been little bit better to the southwest side so far, but it\u2019s early on and that can change as we get more technical data and more well results.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks. And my follow-up is with regards to asset sales and CapEx trajectory if we look at your cash flow statement CapEx for the quarter it was very similar to the last couple of quarters. Can you refresh us on CapEx trajectory through the remainder of year and how acreage acquisitions are trending so far versus what\u2019s baked into your guidance.","Jeff Agosta","There\u2019s about $2 million, Brian, baked into our guidance for acreage, and I would say that hasn\u2019t really changed dramatically and we\u2019re on track and I would say our CapEx this next quarter is going to be down a bit from \u2013 on the E and P side by about $200 million and it should trend down quarter by quarter as we go throughout the year to be at the midpoint of our guidance range.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you.","Jeff Agosta","You bet, Brian.","John Richels","We\u2019ve got time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, glad I made it in. Couple questions. The cash repatriation, I\u2019m sorry, the shields on those, the tax shields, are those the same instruments you\u2019d be using if you did hypothetically an MLP or asset sale or something along those lines. Is that like the same tax shield?","Jeff Agosta","If we did a large, a very large US-based asset sale then yes. As far as the MLP, it\u2019s \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t have much of an impact on that.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","OK, thanks, that\u2019s helpful.","Jeff Agosta","You bet.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","And then secondly, on the acquisition \u2013 everyone talks about\u2013 Can you talk about your outlook for acquisitions, I know that\u2019s been a constant theme floating on the markets for \u2013 for a while. Can you tell us, refresh us where you\u2019re at on that?","John Richels","Well, Dave, on acquisitions, as you know, we \u2013 we \u2013 we\u2019ve been pretty active over the years, may be an understatement, I guess, but we certainly haven\u2019t been out there for the last while \u2013 you know, really acquisitions look pretty expensive over the last few years, when you take a look at acquisitions in any of the areas that we might want to be in.","I would say that our view right now, and this is not a scientific analysis, but it\u2019s an intuitive analysis, is that we\u2019re moving into a time when there\u2019s more products on the market and it\u2019s more of a buyer\u2019s market if I can call it than sellers\u2019 market that we\u2019ve been going through the last few years.","We continue \u2013 we always look at things and any decision we\u2019re going to make, though, in that regard, again, is going to be a decision on what the impact is on debt adjusted cash flow per share as opposed to investing in a large asset base, buying back our stock and doing the other things. But, you know, I think there\u2019s \u2013 I think that we\u2019re moving into a little different market than we\u2019ve been in for the last while.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","I would agree with that. Thanks, John, thanks for the caller.","John Richels","Thank you, folks, we appreciate your joining us today. And as Vince said for those who didn\u2019t get your questions in, our Investor Relations folks will be available all day. We\u2019re continuing \u2013 we\u2019re excited about the execution of our business plan.","We\u2019re moving in a direction of continuing our strong oil production growth, got great visibility of our long-term oil and liquids growth profile, and we continue to provide our shareholders with a very high margin of oil growth with significant option value on improved natural gas prices and improving Canadian heavy oil price differentials. So we will look forward to talking with you again at the next call and thanks very much for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Vincent W. White","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everybody, to today's first quarter 2012 earnings call and webcast. Today's call will follow the usual format. I'll start with a few preliminary items and then turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels for his overview. Then Dave Hager, Head of Exploration and Production, will provide the operations update. And following that, our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Agosta, will finish up with a review of our financial results. We'll conclude with a Q&A period, and as usual, we'll ask you to keep your questions limited to one and one follow-up, and we'll hold the call to about an hour. Also with us today is Larry Nichols, our Executive Chairman, as well as other members of Devon's senior management team to help out with the Q&A session.","A replay of this call will be available today later on through a link on our homepage. As usual, our call will contain some forward-looking estimates. And we will be refining some of those in our call today, but we are not planning to issue a new 8-K. We will, however, post those changes to the guidance page of our website. To find that, just click on the Guidance link found in the Investor Relations portion of the Devon website. ","Please note that all references today to our plans, forecast, expectations and estimates are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we always strive to give you the very best information possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. We urge you to review the discussion of risk factors and uncertainties that we provide in our SEC Form 10-K filing, provided that is. Also in today's call, we'll reference certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we use these measures, we're required to provide related disclosures. Those are also available on the Devon website. ","The First Call mean estimate for Devon's earnings for the first quarter was $1.43 per share. However, at the midpoint of the guidance we provided, you would've expected our first quarter earnings to come in at $1.35 a share or $0.08 below The Street estimates. However, our actual first quarter non-GAAP results came in at $1.05 per share or $0.30 below our guidance. This was most almost entirely due to unusually wide differentials on Canadian oil and U.S. NGLs. Jeff will cover both of these, as well as our expected future price differentials in detail later in the call. With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Richels","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Although, as Vince mentioned, wide differentials had a significant negative impact on earnings, we delivered another very solid quarter from an operational perspective. ","Our North American onshore production reached an all-time record, averaging 694,000 equivalent barrels per day in the first quarter. This represents a 10% increase over the year-ago quarter and that was led by a 26% growth in oil production. On a sequential quarter basis, a 7% increase in oil and NGLs production more than offset a 1% decrease in natural gas production. ","We continue to bolster our future oil potential by assembling significant acreage positions in additional new oil plays, and we continue to do a very good job of controlling costs. Pretax costs -- or pretax cash costs per unit of production increased only 1% from the last quarter of 2011. And even in an environment of weak commodity prices, we delivered net earnings of $393 million and cash flow of $1.4 billion. ","Devon's financial position remains rock solid. We ended the quarter with the $7.1 billion of cash on hand, and we continue to have one of the lowest debt-to-cap ratios in the industry. This financial strength is especially important given current natural gas prices. The economics of drilling dry gas wells are unattractive, and reduced cash flow from lower pricing makes sustaining investment and higher-margin oil- and liquids-rich gas more difficult for many. Our financial strength allows us to continue to fund a robust E&P capital program directed entirely towards oil- and liquids-rich opportunities. The economics of these projects are enhanced by low royalties, reasonable operating costs and by our midstream operations. In aggregate, our 2012 drilling activity will deliver oil production growth in excess of 20% and double-digit growth in NGLs. And more importantly, the projects driving this growth are delivering very attractive rates of return. ","Even if the current pricing environment were to persist indefinitely, our existing base of oil- and liquids-rich projects provides us many years of profitable growth. To put this into perspective, roughly half of our 16.2 billion barrels of risked resource is oil and NGLs, with crude oil accounting for nearly 5 billion barrels of this total resource. So our resource base provides the ability to shift investment to the most lucrative opportunities depending on market conditions. ","Our solid financial position is also allowing us to aggressively build up the light oil portion of our inventory. We've been very successful in adding significant oil-focused acreage positions at very attractive entry cost. Our biggest addition is our recently unveiled Cline Shale oil play to the 500,000 net acre position that we've assembled in the Permian Basin and that was assembled at very reasonable cost. We're also building a large, concentrated position in another oil prospect that's not yet ripe for disclosure. As of today, we have commitments for or have closed on 250,000 net acres in this undisclosed position, with an ultimate target of about 500,000 net acres. Our new ventures unit is well-staffed, and it's adequately funded to continually evaluate greenfield opportunities across North America, as well as to identify untapped potential on our existing acreage base. ","As 2012 progresses, you'll see more of the fruits of these efforts. Due to the significant success that we're enjoying in identifying and capturing resource potential, we are open to taking on partners to help us develop our new exploration plays. While we could easily pursue these opportunities on our own, bringing in a partner enhances our overall risk-reward profile. As evidenced by our $2.5 billion Sinopec transaction, joint ventures offer the opportunity to accelerate activity, improve capital efficiency and mitigate risk. And most importantly, this type of transaction supports our primary strategic objective of maximizing cash flow per debt adjusted share. The combination of our financial strength, our low-risk development inventory and our growing new ventures portfolio underpin our oil production growth. As a result, in our view, Devon provides a differentiated opportunity for investors in the E&P space. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed review of our operating highlights. Dave?","David A. Hager","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Given the in-depth update we provided just a month ago at our Analyst Day, I'll keep my comments fairly brief this morning. Let's begin with a quick recap of first quarter capital expenditures. E&P capital for the first quarter was $1.6 billion, including undeveloped acreage acquisitions. Operationally, we're off to an outstanding start this year with record production from each of our 4 cornerstone developed product areas: Jackfish, the Permian Basin, the Barnett and Cana. We also continue to move forward with evaluating and derisking the upside potential in our various emerging and new ventures plays. ","Now let's take a closer look at some of the first quarter highlights. Starting with our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta, aggregate production from our 2 producing Jackfish projects averaged a record 46,000 barrels per day, net of royalties, in the first quarter. Jackfish 1 accounted for 30,000 barrels per day as its total, and continued its trend of excellent plant reliability and efficiency. At Jackfish 2, production continues to ramp up, and we're currently producing more than 21,000 barrels per day after royalties. We continue to expect to reach facility capacity at Jackfish 2 somewhere around year end. Jackfish 3 construction is also progressing well, with roughly 30% of the project complete, putting us on track for a late 2014 start-up. ","At Pike, we wrapped-up our winter drilling program during the first quarter. We drilled 131 stratigraphic core wells and acquired some 50 square miles of 3D seismic. Although we're still working with our partner to finalize the Pike 1 development plan, we expect to file an application for regulatory approval for the first phase of Pike late this summer for a project of up to 105,000 barrels per day of production. We operate Pike with a 50% working interest. Between Jackfish and Pike, we expect these projects to drive Devon's net thermal oil production to more than 150,000 barrels per day by the end of the decade. ","Moving now to Permian Basin. Our total net production averaged a record 56,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, up 28% over the first quarter of 2011. Permian oil production grew 32% over the same period last year, and light oil now accounts for nearly 60% of our total volumes. Our Permian oil play is currently represents some of the highest return opportunities in our portfolio. Since year-end, we have continued to ramp up activity with the addition of 5 new rigs. We currently have a total of 21 operated rigs running in the basin, and expect to add additional rigs by year-end. ","Looking at a couple of Permian plays in a bit more detail. First, in the Bone Spring play, we continue to see outstanding results from our Bone Spring horizontal program in both New Mexico and Texas. In the first quarter, we completed 16 Bone Spring wells with an average 30-day IP rates of 580 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our actual results in this play continue to outperform our analog well model. ","In the Wolfcamp Shale in the southern Midland Basin, we're continuing to fine-tune our drilling and completion techniques. We brought 2 Wolfcamp horizontal wells online in the first quarter, with 30-day average IP rates of 440 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Perhaps even more exciting is the result of a Wolfcamp horizontal well we drilled on our Wolfberry acreage in Ector County. This well is located some 80 miles to the Northwest of the southern Midland Basin, where the Wolfcamp play has been heating up. After 20 days of production, the Everett [ph] 17H is producing about 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While additional mapping and drilling is needed to better characterize the resource potential, our well, combined with another recent industry well in the area, suggests the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play could extend to the Northwest. This would significantly increase our resource potential in the play. ","As we mentioned during our recent Analyst Day, there are many uncharacterized zones underlying our Permian acreage, and this is one example. We will keep you updated as we learn more. During our recent Analyst Day presentation, we also unveiled a large position that we have established in the Cline Shale on the Eastern flank of the Midland Basin. We are currently drilling a Cline well in Sterling County, the first of 15 wells we have planned for this year to assess our potential in the play. The depth and breadth of our existing Permian position is driving our Permian production growth rate at a rate of more than 20% per year. In addition, we are continuing to supplement this position by aggressively pursuing new opportunities in the Permian. ","Moving now to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. In spite of a temporary third-party facility outage that reduced our first quarter production by about 4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, as well as a large increase in uncompleted wells due to pad drilling, Devon still achieved an all-time production record at Cana. First quarter 2012 production increased 67% over the year-ago quarter and 8% over the fourth quarter of 2012. First quarter Cana liquids production grew even more, up 80% over the year-ago quarter, to 3,500 barrels of oil and 9,500 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. Also of note at Cana, we recently finished drilling our first 10,000-foot lateral, and expect to begin a 20-stage completion on this well later this year. We are currently drilling a second long lateral well in Cana. These wells will cost on the order of 20% to 30% more than a typical Cana-Woodford well. However, we expect to see an increase in per-well recoveries in the 60% to 80% range, further enhancing our Cana economics. ","Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In the first quarter, we continue to achieve excellent results with pad drilling. We brought 25 wells online from our Lake Benbrook pad, with 30-day average IP rates of 4.9 million equivalent feet of production per day, including 330 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. This helped drive first quarter net production from the Barnett to a record 1.37 Bcf equivalent per day. This included 52,500 barrels of liquids per day, up 23% from first quarter 2011. ","Moving north to the Texas Panhandle. In the Granite Wash Play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and Granite Wash wells. We brought 6 operated Granite Wash wells online during the first quarter. The 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged over 1,650 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 220 barrels of oil and 470 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. On the exploration front, we recently closed a Sinopec JV and continue to move forward with the de-risking of the 5 plays involved. Given the recent in-depth update provided at our Analyst Day, we have very little today in the way of incremental information. However, I will briefly review the current status for each of these opportunities. In the Mississippian oil play, located in North Central Oklahoma where the partnership has assembled 230,000 net acres, we are encouraged with the results of our first well. The Matthews 1H had a 30-day IP rate of 590 oil equivalent barrels per day, and is among the best wells reported in the play to date. We currently have 2 rigs running and 2 wells completing. We expect to drill or participate in roughly 50 wells on this acreage by year-end. It including tests of additional formations. ","In our Rockies oil exploration, as we previously indicated, we're testing a number of objectives in the Powder River and DJ Basins. Our first well in the Turner formation had a 30-day IP rate of 433 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We're currently drilling wells, testing 2 additional formations, the Mowry in the Powder River Basin, and the Codell in the DJ Basin. In the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, we drilled our first 2 wells in the southern portion of our acreage position. As discussed during our recent update, results of the first 2 wells were somewhat disappointing. We have since moved our 2 operated rigs north and have 2 wells currently drilling and a third well that is roughly halfway through completion operations. These 3 wells will be the first to test our northern acreage position. ","In Michigan, we are currently completing our first horizontal well in the A1 carbonate. We also just finished setting casing on our second well, the Wiley 1H, and we should begin completing that well in a couple of weeks. As we have previously indicated, the A1 is a highly pressurized zone with a significant fracture system, so understanding how these characteristics impact commerciality will be key going forward. ","And finally, in Ohio, Utica, we just completed our first horizontal well, the Eichelberger 1H in Ashland County. We are now beginning to flow the well back. In addition, we drilled a second well that's awaiting completion and are currently drilling our third well in the play. We should have all 3 wells online by the end of the second quarter. ","So in summary, our 2012 capital program is off to a great start. With record production in each of our 4 cornerstone development areas, we are poised to deliver outstanding liquids growth. We have a more than 20% growth in oil. We continue to see encouraging results from a number of our exploration plays, as well as efficiently capture new acreage positions that will provide the next leg of oil and liquids growth in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our first quarter results. For today's call, I will limit my comments to those items that require additional commentary that are outside our forecasted guidance range. ","Starting with production. In the first quarter of 2012, our reported production totaled 63.1 million oil equivalent barrels or 694,000 BOE per day. This record result was at the high end of the forecasted range we provided in our fourth quarter call. As John said, this represented 10% growth rate over the first quarter of 2011, driven by a 26% increase in oil production. The Permian Basin, Jackfish, Cana-Woodford and Barnett Shale all delivered record production in the first quarter. Looking at the second quarter, we expect growth in the Permian Basin and Jackfish to boost oil production by about 5% sequentially and roughly 25% year-over-year. However, expected declines in natural gas production will limit our total second quarter production to a range of 685,000 to 695,000 BOE per day, so essentially flat with the first quarter. ","Third and fourth quarter oil production will be up in spite of the impact of a scheduled plant turnaround at the Jackfish 1 facility. We expect overall top line growth in the second half of the year as oil, NGL volume growth outpace any declines we may have in natural gas production. For the full year, we remain very comfortable with our previous guidance range. We are on track to produce in the range of 253 million to 257 million BOE in 2012. This will be driven by oil and NGL production growth of nearly 20%, shifting our overall production mix to 40% liquids by year-end. ","Looking at price realizations. As both Vince and John mentioned, unusually wide differentials had a significant impact on our first quarter results. In Canada, oil realizations came in at 61% of the WTI benchmark or a full 7 percentage points below the midpoint of our forecasted range. Weak refining margins as a result of mild winter weather and high refined product inventories led several refiners to simultaneously perform plant turnarounds. Concurrently, one of the major heavy oil refineries had an unscheduled outage. Finally, the first quarter start-up of a 130,000-barrel a day refinery that was converted to heavy oil ramped up much slower than we anticipated. As a result, Access Western Blend differentials widened from about $24 a barrel in January to more than $42 a barrel in March. Unfortunately, the wide March differentials persisted into April with Access Western Blend trading at roughly $42 a barrel under WTI. However, with many of the turnarounds complete and the converted refinery now running at capacity, that differential has come down to $26 in May. Also based on the first 2 trading days establishing June realizations, differentials to WTI are less than $20 now. ","Looking ahead, we expect our Canadian oil price realizations to average 60% to 66% of WTI for the second quarter, and 62% to 68% for the second half of the year. Price differentials for natural gas liquids were also much wider than expected. In the first quarter, our NGL realizations came in at 34% of WTI benchmark prices, also about 7 percentage points below the midpoint of our guidance range. Several petrochemical plant turnarounds in the Gulf Coast region reduced first quarter ethane and propane demand in excess of 120,000 barrels per day. This represents roughly 10% of U.S. petrochemical demand for NGLs. Additionally, very low natural gas prices and high inventories of propane, as a result of the unusually warm winter, also put downward pressure on NGL prices. This weakness has extended into the second quarter, and we now expect our second quarter realizations to range between 32% to 38% of WTI. Late in the second quarter of this year, many of the petrochemical plants will complete their turnarounds and the conversion of an existing plant to ethane and propane feedstock will add up to 60,000 barrels per day of incremental demand. As a result, NGL realization should recover to the point where our second half 2012 NGL prices should average between 34% and 40% of WTI. ","Looking briefly at our hedges. In the first quarter, our hedge position delivered cash settlements of $158 million. In total, these cash settlements enhanced Devon's average realized price by $2.50 per barrel, an uplift of 8% to company-wide realizations. Since our update at year-end, we have continued to bolster our hedge position for both oil and natural gas. On the gas side of the business, we increased our 2012 hedge position to approximately 1 Bcf per day. This represents about 40% of our expected production for the remainder of the year with a weighted average protected price of $4.42 per Mcf. The strong oil markets have also provided a good opportunity to add attractive hedges. For 2012, we have 109,000 barrels per day hedged, or about 70% of forecasted production with a weighted average floor price of $95 per barrel. For 2013, we have 72,000 barrels per day hedged with various swaps and costless collars. Of this amount, 31,000 barrels were swapped at a weighted average price of $104, with the balance collared at a weighted average ceiling of $117 and a floor of $91. If you would like more details on our hedging position, please visit the guidance section of our website that Vince referenced earlier. ","Turning now to our marketing and midstream operations. Our first quarter operating profit totaled $112 million, enhancing our company-wide margin by $1.78 per BOE. Looking ahead, downtime related to an expansion of our Gulf Coast fractionators facility in Mont Belvieu will limit our midstream operating profit to a range of $70 million to $90 million in the second quarter. Once this expansion is complete, we expect our midstream operating profit will rebound to a range of $110 million to $140 million per quarter in the second half of the year. However, based on the weakness we are seeing in the first half of the year, we now expect our marketing and midstream profit to be about $50 million below our previous guidance. ","Moving to expenses. As John said, we continue to do a good job of controlling cost. Cash expenses were generally in line with our guidance. However, noncash DD&A came in at $680 million or $10.78 per barrel, about $0.13 above the high end of our guidance range. Over time, our DD&A rate continued to gravitate toward our average mining and development costs. With our current focus on higher returning, but higher cost oil projects, we expect our DD&A rate to migrate higher in upcoming quarters. In the second quarter, we expect our DD&A rate to range between $10.80 and $11 per barrel. ","Looking specifically at cash costs. Pretax cash costs in the first quarter totaled $13.80 per BOE, a 1% increase compared to last quarter. By achieving significant scale in core operating areas, coupled with our consistent focus on cost management, we are positioned with one of the better cost structures in the industry. This is especially impressive given our shift to more oil projects, which are generally more expensive to produce. The final expense I will touch on is income taxes. After backing out the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates, our adjusted first quarter 2012 income tax rate was 32% of pretax earnings. The adjusted rate is comprised of a 3% current rate and a 29% deferred rate, right in line with our guidance. In today's earnings release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates. ","I'll conclude with a quick review of our financial position. In the first quarter, our operating cash flow before balance sheet changes totaled $1.4 billion. On a per share basis, cash flow increased 3% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Early in the second quarter, with the closing of the Sinopec transaction, we received roughly $900 million in cash. As we stand today, our cash and short-term investments totaled $7.7 billion and our net debt is just $2.5 billion. Pro forma for the close of this transaction, our net debt to cap at the end of the first quarter was less than 12%. Clearly, from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we remain exceptionally strong. At this point, I'll turn the call back to John. John?","John Richels","Thanks, Jeff. Well, in summary folks, while the first quarter earnings were negatively impacted by unusually low price realizations, our positive operating results reflect the continued execution of our business plan. We delivered year-over-year oil production growth of 26%. We were very successful in bolstering our drilling activity with significant oil-focused leasehold capture. We comfortably funded our robust capital program while maintaining a strong financial position. We did a very good job of controlling costs in a rising industry cost environment, and as we've said many times in the past, we remain fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our cash flow growth on a per debt adjusted share basis. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for our Q&A.","Vincent W. White","Operator, we are ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jessica Chipman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Thank you for all the color on NGL pricing. I have one question related to that. At the Analyst Day, you showed Barnett returns at about 17%, assuming $250 gas, $100 oil and NGL realizations at 47% of WTI, can you talk about how your returns are impacted by lower NGL realizations that we're seeing today? And is there any chance you would rethink your Barnett plans until NGL realizations improve?","John Richels","Jessica, we have taken a look at it. And then I guess, the quick answer is, we won't change our view as long as the economics remain positive. We did just stress test. That was actually subsequent to our Analyst Day, we stress tested both the Barnett and Cana, because they're both liquids-rich gas projects, for our ongoing capital allocations. And of course, when we're doing that, probably goes without saying, what we're really looking at is a program moving forward and a drilling program moving forward, and that's more dependent on 2013 prices than it is where we are today. But just to run some sensitivities, I'll give you a few numbers here. At a $2 realized price, so let's get back to what we're actually getting, rather than these benchmark prices. The $2 realized price and about a $33 realized natural gas liquids price, and if you factor in the midstream uplift that we get, which of course is integral to those operations, so we have to consider both of them, we see a high-teens rate of return in the Barnett Shale and somewhere around the mid-20s rate of return in Cana, which in either case, is way above our cost of capital, obviously. If you look at next year and think about what the -- and by the way, we don't think that the $2 realized price was what we're going to see in 2013 and beyond, but we did that to get a sensitivity. If you look at 2013 and prices that are probably more realistic, and take for example, a $3 realized price, now that would be just about where the strip is today. I think the strip's about $3.50 or something, so a $3 realized price is probably pretty close. And again, a $33 NGL price, with the midstream uplift, that gets you to about a 20% rate of return in the Barnett, and close to 30% rate of return in Cana. So we're still pretty comfortable with those kinds of rates of return, particularly with the scale that we have in those plays. But we're constantly looking at that because with our deep portfolio, we can move our funds around to where we can make the most money for our shareholders, and so we're always watching that.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Just a second question to you on capital spend. It looks like the run rate based on Q1 spend is actually lower than your total 2012 capital budget. Is there any chance you think you might be able to keep CapEx below budgeted levels?","Vincent W. White","Well as John says, we're constantly looking at the results of our budget, and it's certainly possible. But I'd point out that we've been assembling some large acreage positions that will hit principally in the second quarter. So we think, right now, we're still running about true to our forecast for capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Following up real quickly on that acreage comment and tying into your Analyst Day where you indicated you'd like to increase your position into this line. Is it safe for us to assume that, that's where that capital is being deployed that Vince just mentioned? And any indications you could give us around price per acre in that play would be very helpful.","Vincent W. White","Yes, first, it's not safe to assume, while we would like to increase our position in the midst, we have not disclosed where those incremental acreage acquisitions are. And any place that we want to increase our acreage position, we aren't really willing to talk about specific transactions and the cost trends in that acreage.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, sorry. I had to give it a try. And then just looking at the Wolfcamp results on the Avid [ph] 17H well, can you talk a little bit about cost and design and where that's targeted over time?","David A. Hager","Yes, hi Dave, this is Dave Hager. This is a -- to give you an idea on cost, and again, this is the first well that we've drilled over in our Wolfberry area. This is actually, in the what we call our Odessa South area of the Midland Basin. It's really, geographically, if you want to know where that's located, it's in the far southeast corner of Ector County, and that well looks like it's going to cost somewhere around $5 million or so. It looks like we're going to have probably on the order -- it's very early, so it's really, we only have about 20 days or so. But we're estimating somewhere around 300,000 barrels net EUR on that. And we have, in that particular well, completed it in the Wolfcamp B interval. That's really where much of the activity has taken place with the industry. We have in back in our main core Wolfcamp shale, we have completed some in the Wolfcamp A, as well as some in the, we think the C and D zones also in our perspective. But we played it conservative with this first well. It's 80 miles away from our production state in the Wolfcamp B.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And any just color on lateral length frac stages, and then where that cost could trend?","David A. Hager","I don't have, I don't think, the number of frac stages sitting in front of me right now. But we've completed, I believe very similarly to how we did our other Wolfcamp Shale wells. So I think, again, that we're still on, very much on the learning curve on our Wolfcamp Shale wells. It was a 3,800-foot horizontal on that particular well. But we're still -- I would have to lump that in with the rest of the Wolfcamp Shale. But we're still on the learning curve, and we showed at the Resource Update how we're continuing to improve on the cost side of it. And we stated there, we think the key is to get out as far laterally as we can, 7,000-foot plus on the lateral length. And so this is really encouraging results, I think, given that this is only 3,800-foot lateral, and future wells with experience in this area maybe even to be able to take out significantly further and get even better EURs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just following up on that question on the Wolfcamp well in Ector County, when you got into the interval itself, into the Wolfcamp B, how did geologic characteristics there compare with what you have seen in the wells you've drilled 80 miles away to the Southeast?","David A. Hager","Well, we think it drilled and completed very similarly to what we saw to the Southeast.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So is it your view then that the bulk of kind of what you have in between, which I know is a bit more focused on the Southeast, it is going to be perspective, and or do you see any differences based on what you've seen so far?","David A. Hager","Well, it's a 6-inch hole 80 miles away, so there's a lot of ground in between. So there's -- we're certainly encouraged, I think, as I said in my comments, we need to do more study. And we need to drill some more wells, but we're certainly very encouraged by our initial well. And that it could add a significant new Wolfcamp resource on our Wolfberry acreage. But again, this is the first well. So I don't want over-characterize this, but it's certainly encouraging, what we've seen so far.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's fair. Is that well on pump at this time?","David A. Hager","No.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then separately on the CapEx trajectory, how should we expect the next couple of quarters here relative to the, I guess, $2.1 billion or so that showed up in the cash flow statement for CapEx. You highlighted I think earlier that you should see acreage acquisitions pick up here in the second quarter. But when we think about the next few quarters, should we see similar trends or higher trends overall relative to Q1?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Brian, it's Jeff. We would expect to see a little bit more lumpiness in the second quarter, but more of a, more normalized in the third and fourth quarter, consistent with what we saw in the first.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, on the Tuscaloosa, I think you mentioned you moved the rigs north here, testing a couple, 2 to 3 wells. Do you see any differences so far or even in your base case on the geological characteristics there versus the wells that you've drilled already in the South?","David A. Hager","Well, it's a little bit early, I think, to draw any conclusions to that. We do think that we're seeing some of that evidenced at the acreage to the North is, looks like it may be more -- a little bit more frac-able. But again, this is very early, and we're talking about just a very few number of wells across a multicounty area. So I would be hesitant, geologically, to draw too many conclusions till we get more data. But that's, if you want a very early indication, I can say that. But again, I don't consider that real definitive at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. Granite Wash, can you talk about what you're chasing there, and what zones do you hit for those, like you gave some numbers of 650 BOE, or 1,650 BOE?","David A. Hager","Well, we're chasing, primarily, the Cherokee and Granite Wash A with those completions. We do have additional potential in the deeper Granite Wash zones. We have quite a bit of a potential associated with those. The wells we're drilling right now are chasing primarily the Cherokee and the Granite Wash A.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on NGL pricing, and I don't know if it's Jeff, whoever answered the question about NGL, is there anything you can do on the hedge front? I mean, do you try to put on dirty hedges to protect that, or how do you go about doing that? If you choose to?","Darryl G. Smette","Yes, this is Darryl Smette. We really have not been very active on financially hedging our NGL position. And that typically has been what we perceive to be lack of liquidity in the NGL market. Now that might change as we go forward, as more NGLs come on the market. But right now, we think there's been lack of liquidity, so we think there's going to be a lot of variation. And we also look at the back end of, whether it's 1-year, 2-year or 3-year, we see a tremendous decrease in price in those outer years. So we have not been very active. Although we do have a few hedges in place on natural gas lean, but it's minor. So until we become comfortable, quite frankly, with the liquidity, and until we see what we believe are reasonable market prices in the outer years, we probably won't be very active in the financial hedges on NGL.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple also. One on financials and I guess, the other operational. Just on the hedging, it looks like you guys have been really very successful in being able to lure in additional gas hedges at pretty attractive prices, considering where the strip is. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit of a color as to what was going on there in terms of, are you doing something different? Or is it still a fairly liquid market? What is the mechanism whereby you've been able to continue to lock in those prices, and I have an operational follow-up, please.","Darryl G. Smette","This is Darryl again. I'd like to say, we're just great, but I think, no probably, we're probably just a little bit lucky. What we try to do is anticipate where the markets are going to go, and recognize there's going to be a lot of volatility and that volatility may allow for some prices to be there for a short period of time so that people that are looking at it all the time. But we typically would do will become comfortable with the prices that we're willing to accept, and we give approval to our people who are watching this 24\/7. And so when the prices for whatever period of time, they're on the screen and we can commence transactions, they're prepared with approval to do that. So we try to plan ahead. We give our people authorizations. We have people manning the screens 24\/7, so we feel pretty good that when they're only there for a period of time, we're able to do something, because there's nothing magic in it other than that, Doug.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So these are pretty clean swaps and callers. There's no call sales or any front-line going on?","Darryl G. Smette","We have a few calls for 2013, 2014 on oil that I think are $120 for about, I don't know, 10,000 barrels a day. And I think $5 on the gas side, which allowed us to lock in a $450 price for 2013 on gas. But that's all the calls that we have going forward.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So a very minor amount.","Darryl G. Smette","Yes, very minor amount. We tend to-- we tend to play pretty straight with simple type of transactions you can do and try not to complicate it too much. Our experience has been when you try to complicate it too much, that it tends to confuse a lot of people, including us, sometimes. But it seems every time we get into some confusing types of transactions, we're always a little leery whether we really understand what we're doing, so we try to keep it pretty simple.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, thanks for the clarity. My operational follow-up is, I think David, you touched on a little bit of the exploration phase, but I wonder if I could just dig a little bit more into the Utica. Obviously, we're watching this very closely to see how your acreage play turns out. I'm just wondering if you could give us a kind of line of sight of what we can expect out of the Utica in terms of activity levels, well results and maybe clarify if you are still adding to your acreage position out there now.","David A. Hager","Yes, right now, we've drilled our -- as I said, our first well, and we're completing our first well started to flow back on the Eichelberger well. This is really on the Western side of Ashland County, which we believe is kind of right in the peak of the oil, the heart of the oil play, I would say. So -- and it is a significant test. And obviously, we recognize the oil part has some risk associated with it, but I went through on the Resource Update why we think we have good permeability and it has a good chance to work. The second well that we've drilled out there, the Richman Farms is a little bit to the Northeast, it's in Southwest Medina County. It's probably, from an oil standpoint, is probably not -- we don't anticipate it being in a lot different position than where the first well is. And then we're going to be -- the third well we're drilling is called the Sinsabaugh [ph] Well, and it's located significantly to the South there in far -- Southern Knox County or Northern Lincoln County in there. And it still, though, is going to be very much in the oil window. After we -- after those 3 wells, we're actually going to release that rig for some period of time. And then we're going to go back and pick up a higher horsepower rig that's required to drill our acreage a little bit further to the East, to which we think is closer to the liquids-rich window. And so we'll we picking up activity further to the East, more in Coshocton County, Guernsey County, it's in that area. And I might mention that we're also participating in the completion of a well where the intervest is operating the RHDK well that's in far Northwest Guernsey County and they're moving forward with the completion of that well. We are not, at this point, adding additional acreage. We want to see the results of what these wells are. We're happy with our position. Obviously, the further you move east then our acreage position becomes more liquid-rich, and probably a lower risk, but not necessarily the economics would work great if the oil window works well, and that's what we just need to find out for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Magner with Macquarie.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Can you give us a breakdown of the NGL mix and how much of that's been sold at Conway versus Mont Belvieu?","Darryl G. Smette","Yes, this is Darryl again. Just to give you an overall mix for Devon, we have about 8% to 10% of our NGLs in Canada. Have about 10% of our NGLs that are primarily in the Rocky Mountains that are marketed at Conway or sold at Conway. The rest, the other 80%, 82% whether that's Mid-Continent from Cana, Bridgeport, Northridge and most of our Permian Basin find a home in -- at Mont Belvieu. In terms of mix, we have about 57% to 58% of our product is ethane. About 23% or thereabouts is propane. The remainder is ISO normal and natural gasoline. We tend to be a little bit more ethane than a lot, or some of the other plays. A couple of reasons for that. One is that most of our facilities are rather new-facility cryogenic plants and they're very efficient, and therefore, we get a deeper cut on the ethane than a lot of the older plants that are either refrigeration or some of the cryo plants were put in place 10, 12 years ago. The second part of that is that, in some of our plays God just put more propane in our mix. So those are kind of the 2 drivers.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","And I guess, given some of those details, can you just give us, I guess, some outlook for what you all are seeing in terms of near-term prices and how market fundamentals between those 2 pricing points might change or evolve or improve in Mount Belvieu?","Darryl G. Smette","Yes, sure will. We really have not seen much change in the prices for the products through April and May. As we see a lot of the petrochemical plants come back online, and we do have the one conversion that's being put in place that Jeff talked about, the scale had about, I don't know 50,000, 60,000 barrels of demand. We expect we're going to start seeing the product prices increase both for propane and ethane. Probably not to the extent that we saw last year. Because of the very, very mild winter we have a tremendous buildup in propane supply. And probably 14 million, 15 million barrels more than we historically have. So we're probably going to see propane not rebound as fast as we're going to see some of the other products. We get to the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter, we should see those product prices go up. As we look for the rest of the year, we're probably going to be somewhere in the 34% to 40% on a cumulative basis when you put all the products together. As we look into 2013, we have a number of fractionators that are coming on. And so we see product prices that are -- probably stay strong into the first half of 2013 as we get through the second have of 2013 into 2014 with all the additional frac coming on, with not a corresponding increase in petrochemical plant yet, we could be some -- under some pressure there, and we tried to model all of our projects with the -- a discount to NGL products as we get to the second half of 2013 and into '14.","Vincent W. White","Joe, this is Vince. I just might add that in line with what Darryl said, Jeff in the call modified our guidance for NGLs realizations for the second quarter to between 32% and 38% of WTI. And for the second half of 2012, 34% to 40% of WTI.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Yes, I picked up on those. I was just curious about some of the underlying changes there. In terms of new ventures, can you just, I guess, remind us how the Cline Shale differs or I guess is being categorized more of a development play versus exploration against some of the other, the 5 other new ventures programs?","Darryl G. Smette","Well, I don't know if I'd classify it as a pure development play, because there is obviously some risk associated with it. But some comments, there have been some other industry wells that have been drilled, primarily in Glasscock County just immediately to the West of a lot of our acreage position. And remind what I said at the Resource Update that a lot of those wells were drilled with 4,000-foot laterals where our models are built off of longer laterals on the order of 7,000, 7,500 feet. So we're anticipating higher EURs, higher IPs and higher EURs than what have been seen by the wells that have been drilled to date. But there are probably about 25 wells out there. So that gives you some confidence. And then if you look at it, there's probably been over 10,000 wells have been drilled through the Cline Shale for other intervals historically. And so that's given us a great deal of well control. But again, I don't want to mislead and say there's not risk. I think every time you enter one of these new plays, you have some risk associated with it, and that's another reason why we would consider also bringing in a partner on this play, but we really like the position, and we also see some prospectivity in other intervals. I won't go into a lot of detail on that, but we see prospects in other intervals, so it's more than just a pure Cline play.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harry Mateer with the Barclays.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jeff, couple of questions for you on the balance sheet. I guess, first, if you can just remind us how much of that cash balance is offshore? And then second, on the debt side, your short-term debts continue to go up, as you guys have been spending cash flow, I know you still have a lot of cash, but what's the -- what's sort of the plan for the rest of the year with that short-term debt balance? Do you anticipate coming to the bond market? And I guess, related to that, can you just talk about your $750 million revolver drawer during the quarter?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Sure. I'll start with the last one first. As we were issuing commercial papers, we were approaching the $4 billion mark on commercial paper. We were finding that the incremental demand was harder and harder to find, so we elected to draw down a little bit on the revolver just to alleviate the pressure on our commercial paper program. This -- the other question about our cash balances, and I'm sorry, I'm jumping around here. I'm just doing by recall here, but the cash balance is -- the $7.7 billion that I mentioned in the call that we have now, most of that, about $6.8 billion is outside of the United States with the remainder a result of our closing of the Sinopec transaction in late April. We will be leaving that in a tax partnership account. I hate to get into all these details, but it's sitting in a tax partnership account that we'll leave there. And then later in the early third quarter, we will be pulling that, a large portion of that out and paying down short-term borrowing balances. And the extent of that will be close to $600 million, which is basically our basis in the assets that we contributed to the tax partnership with Sinopec. And then as far as our overall liquidity goes, I mean, we're continuously monitoring that, and it will depend upon -- any access to the bond market would depend upon spending levels and short-term funding needs. But we've got a tremendous amount of liquidity and an ability to fund our U.S. business without any problems at all.","Vincent W. White","At that -- this point, the question queue is empty, so we'll terminate the call. Thank you for participating.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Howard Thill","","Thank you, Connor, and good morning. I too would like to welcome everyone to Devon\u2019s third quarter analyst and investor call. I am Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations for Devon Energy. Also on the call today are John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Hager, Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally we have a number of other Devon executives in the room with us.","If you haven\u2019t had a chance to listen to the management commentary, you can find that along with the associated slides and our new operations report at devonenergy.com. Additionally, starting with this quarter\u2019s results, we have included our forward-looking guidance in the earnings release. I hope you've had a chance to review those documents as today\u2019s call will largely consist of questions and answers.","Finally, I\u2019d remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call may contain plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates which are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. Our comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainty that could cause our results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Additionally, information on risk factors that could cause results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements made today is available in our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs included under the caption Risk Factors.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels.","John Richels","","Well, thank you, Howard and good morning, everyone. As you all have seen, Devon delivered exceptional performance during the third quarter. We achieved record oil production which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 6,000 barrels a day. With that strong execution, we increased our 2014 production outlook -- our growth outlook by about 300 basis points from 11% previously to 14%. And very importantly, that increase came with no change in our 2014 capital spending profile. We also increased our profitability with pretax cash margins expanding by 20% year-over-year and exceeded Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations by $0.10. And lastly, we completed the final leg of our strategic repositioning with the closing of our U.S. non-core asset sales. So overall, it was an excellent performance for Devon and we expect a strong operational momentum that we delivered to continue into 2015.","While we\u2019re closely watching developments in the commodity markets, we\u2019re extremely well positioned to fund our 2015 capital program. We\u2019ve got one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, we\u2019re very well hedged and we have visible opportunities for continued drop downs to our midstream business. This places us in a position to continue to invest in our portfolio of high rate of return projects in many of the best U.S. resource plays.","So with that, as Howard said, today\u2019s call was going to be a Q&A call basically. And I'd just like to actually congratulate Howard and his team for the change and I hope that you all found it helpful. But we've tried to put out the very best information that we could. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Howard for Q&A.","Howard Thill","Thanks, John. And before we get started, I\u2019d just like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question with an associated follow up so that we can get as many people on the call as possible. And you can re-queue for additional questions as time permits. And so, Connor, with that, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","So, I wonder if I could take a couple. First of all, you\u2019ve still not taken any steps to increase your inventory in the Delaware Basin. I realize you\u2019ve taken type curves up so on, but just kind of curious as to what is it going to take for us to see the greater confidence level as you de-risk that play? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Dave Hager","","This is Dave Hager. We are doing downspacing pilots in the first half of 2015. When we see the results of those downspacing pilots in the second Bone Spring, we anticipate that our inventory will increase. If you obviously look at our presentation and our investor book, it shows that we\u2019re currently just using four or five wells per section. And so we think there is upside particularly in the second Bone Spring to this and we\u2019ll test it with these downspacing pilots.","I'll remind you also that in our 5,000 locations, we haven\u2019t counted anything for the Wolfcamp. We think that\u2019s going to work and we think it's going to work well, but we think the economics are stronger in the second Bone Spring. So, we\u2019re going to concentrate our evaluation there initially and then let the industry do some of the de-risking in the Wolfcamp and the Leonard Shale.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, Dave, I should have been more specific. I think I really was just talking more to the Wolfcamp than the Bone Spring, because that's the area that's still TBA. And after the numbers that we saw from you this morning, it would seem that they were starting to kind of suggest in a very similar area to yourselves that they have got a lot -- a much greater confidence. I am just wondering what is it going to take for you guys to get to the same point?","Dave Hager","Well, we are drilling -- actually we drilled our first Wolfcamp Shale well in Loving County just on the Texas side. We\u2019re currently flowing back that well as we speak, so we'll have results for that. And in next quarter's call we\u2019ll be analyzing all of the industry data and be providing numbers. Again, we have the acreage. It's not a question where do we have the acreage, it's just the matter of us analyzing the industry results and then providing you guidance around that based on the industry results. So, we\u2019re very confident it's going to work and so our overall inventory is going to go up. It's just that we want to see a little more results. And again, we think the economics are a little bit stronger in the second Bone Spring. We have more of the second Bone Spring than some of our industry peers just given where our acreage is actually located. But the second Bone Spring is a little bit shallower, it's a little less expensive to drill and it's a little more oily. And so all of that cause the economics in the second Bone Spring to be a little better, but that\u2019s not to say it's not a good strong opportunity in the Wolfcamp and we\u2019re glad EOG is having success. It just makes our acreage look that much better.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow-up, if I may, Dave, is kind of related. And I guess before I get into this, I should say that the new disclosure and the conference call before and everything else is really terrific. So thank you for making our lives easier. But my question really is more about the increase in the type curve in the Bone Spring. So, the IP rates obviously have been up significantly, but the type, the actual EUR did not appear to move. I think you put a plus on it as opposed to changing the numbers. So I am just wondering if you could, if I am missing something there or if you could help us understand what your realized aspirations are as you look at that?","Dave Hager","We probably could have put a plus, plus, plus on that, to be honest with you, Doug, because we feel very good about that as we get additional data and we get more production data on these wells that the EURs will increase. We just want to see more production history before we say exactly what the new EURs will be. But I can tell you so far what we\u2019re seeing is these wells are coming on at significantly higher rates and they are essentially paralleling the old type curve. They are not falling off more rapidly. So there is -- we feel very confident that the EURs are going to increase. We just want to get more data on these wells before we actually come out with what the increase will be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Maybe to stick with the Northern Delaware Basin for now, just a little bit more color on some of those downspacing pilots. Obviously four to five wells, you seem pretty confident and you're going to eight. Can you just give us a little bit of color what you're looking for there? Is it just maximizing recovery and should we expect because those reservoirs drain pretty well, is it going to communicate a little bit or do you think that those eight wells could be fairly independent?","Dave Hager","Well, obviously that\u2019s what we need to find out with these downspacing pilots. But what we\u2019re looking for is do we have good economic opportunities with these downspacing pilots and so do they generate returns that are competitive within our portfolio that we would want to drill these downspace wells. We think that particularly the most opportunity does set in the second Bone Spring for this downspacing opportunity and that\u2019s what again, as I have highlighted already that those are the best economics in the Northern Delaware Basin anyway. So if we have down spacing opportunities, our belief is that they will compete very well within our portfolio. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re really looking to see is just what kind of -- obviously there may be a little bit of degradation of performance, we don\u2019t know. But with these larger fracs that we have \u2013 again, the whole idea is to create more complex fracture networks immediately around the wellbore, but not to have them reach out as far so you that can create these downspacing opportunities where you can do the same thing on a downspacing basis and have very strong returns. That\u2019s the theory of where we\u2019re going. We think it\u2019s going to work. We just want to see the proof with the actual pilots.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And is your acreage such that you could do a lot of this in pad development? Are you blocking up where this could be a pretty good thing where -- I don\u2019t know what the right number is, but what do you envision wellbore...?","Dave Hager","Well, we\u2019re doing a lot of the pad development already and we can continue to do a lot of this with pad development. Now, the specifics of how we would develop the downspace pads, I mean I have to defer. We may have to just build additional pads and take them into incremental facilities on the same acreage there. I think that\u2019s our plan right now. But frankly, we need to get a handle early on how much -- there is not only downspacing opportunities in the second Bone Spring, but if you go back to our investor presentation, we have slides there that we have showed that also on some of these areas we have Delaware sand potential, we have Leonard sand potential and we have Wolfcamp, not all of them on all of the same acreage. But we have some areas where multiple formations are prospected.","We actually have even additional zones within the second Bone Spring that we\u2019re not sure that we\u2019re fully exploiting at this point either, an upper sand in the second Bone Spring, we\u2019re testing that as well. So, there is not only downspacing opportunities, but there are stacked lateral opportunities in the Delaware Basin that again could significantly increase our inventory. And we need to get a handle for how many wells per section that might be ultimately and so we\u2019re doing some pilot testing around that. But the four or five wells per section, when you look at our stack basis, may be significantly higher than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice & Company","A lot of good stuff you guys have this quarter. But if I could just go back to the earlier question on the Bone Spring. I wonder if you can add a little bit to the narrative of you\u2019ve changed your completion design and how much maybe that -- whether those, I believe it was about 13 new wells in the quarter that led to this updated type curve, whether those were using that 1,500, 2,500 pounds per lateral foot that you reference in your new completion design or whether those were before this recent [Multiple Speakers]?","Dave Hager","Our old completion design was really around 600 pounds per linear foot. We are now testing, as we said, up to 2,500 pounds of sand per linear foot. So far we have pumped between 25 and 30 jobs in the 1,500 to 2,500 pounds per linear foot range. Of those, we have actual well results on about half of those. Now, some of those have just not been on very long at all. And so we\u2019re still monitoring others we have 30 days plus. But the bulk of the well results you\u2019re seeing in Q3 do not have the larger, thus far from a production standpoint, actual production, do not have the larger jobs in there. And that\u2019s why one reason we have confidence our volumes can continue to grow in the future.","Now, what is the actual sand size is in our type curve. I can tell you it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s less than 1,500 pounds of sand per linear foot. And so we think that if these jobs work on a consistent basis, there is additional upside to our type curve in future quarters. But we need to see those results first and see that on more wells to really be able to say exactly how much that would be.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice & Company","Dave, that was an excellent answer. You actually saved me from having to ask a follow up because I was going to ask you about what the future holds up. Let me, if I could, go in a slightly different direction for my follow up, a lot of which you talks about in the Eagle Ford. Or one of the things you talk about in Eagle Ford was the optimization of choke management once you put those wells on production. That makes sense with you guys being -- you\u2019re taking new operatorship at that point. But is there a chance for a similar sort of completion optimization in putting up higher sand loading on those Eagle Ford completions as well?","","Dave Hager","We\u2019re working with our partner BHP on that right now. Absolutely, we think there is -- we\u2019re working with a revision of a completion design on that. We're not prepared to go into a lot of detail as we speak right now. But we can tell you that there is -- we think there is upside associated with that when we get more results with our revised completion site. We\u2019ve already made modifications to it, but we\u2019d like to see more results before we actually go out with anything.","I'll also mention here, Tommy here mentioned another good thing to mention. We have done the larger revised completion design in Lavaca County where we actually operate and you\u2019re seeing the IPs on those. The other thing I might mention on this choke management is that we have so far most of the choke management work we\u2019ve done, we\u2019re doing on a very engineered basis, that has been done primarily on older existing wells that have already had significant decline. The real upside here which we\u2019re not seeing yet in the production numbers and which are upside to the type curve also is when we start applying this very engineered approach to new wells, to new completions and so that\u2019s upside that we have not yet quantified for you but we think exists with the inventory. And we\u2019re starting to roll that in to -- again on a managed basis, managing well pressures to make sure we\u2019re maximizing rates of return and we\u2019re not degrading performance. But we\u2019re starting to do this on an engineered approach with new wells. And so there's still big upside potential if it works as well as we think it will on new wells.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","","I wanted to see if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on some of the commentary around 2015, E&P capital being at similar levels to '14. And just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of color, because you are accelerating in Cana, you a full year of Eagle Ford spend in '15 versus '14 and you are accelerating come completion activity and you\u2019re ramping in the Delaware as well. So just wanted to see if you can give us some comfort level with next year\u2019s CapEx.","John Richels","Arun, as you know, we\u2019re still pouring next year\u2019s budget. I mean we\u2019re just working on it now and we\u2019ll be coming out with it over the next little while. You\u2019re right, we\u2019re changing the number of rigs that we have working in some of the areas and all the things you point out are correct. But part of what we\u2019re doing is just shifting our focus to the highest rate of return areas. So for example, we expect next year that the number of rigs that we have working in the Miss will probably go down and some areas in the southern Midland basin may go down and we\u2019ll shift those rigs over to some of these other areas. So we feel pretty confident at this time that the kind of growth that we\u2019ve talked about, the 20% to 25% oil growth in 2015 is achievable in a budget that is similar to what we had in 2014, which I think is a really positive development for us.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","And perhaps another factor, just perhaps reduced spending at Jackfish on a year-over-year basis?","John Richels","Well, that as well. Certainly we have less spending at Jackfish. As we mentioned, we\u2019re going to do some appraisal work and some additional engineering work on Pike, be probably $250 million. But with the completion of Jackfish 3 and relatively low maintenance capital on that whole Jackfish complex, we\u2019ll see our expenditures come down there as well.","Dave Hager","Arun, this is Dave. A reminder too, what I have been talking about with these previous answers I have been giving, we\u2019re getting a lot more efficient and so we don\u2019t have to add as much capital, because we\u2019re getting much higher IPs and we think we\u2019re getting higher EURs in a number of these plays. And so it\u2019s not all about adding rigs. We add rigs when we need to. But if we can get it rather out of better completions and much more efficient way with higher rates of return, that\u2019s a better way to go and we think we\u2019re accomplishing that in a number of our plays.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","So just in summary, so the efficiency gains that you\u2019re seeing are going to offset maybe higher activity levels, plus the impact of some of the carriers wearing off, is that fair?","John Richels","Right. That\u2019s certainly part of it.","Dave Hager","We have not seen it going up. Again, we stand by what we said on the capital though, it's going to be very similar to -- we can have these kind of growth rates with very similar capital as we had in 2014 and those were the reasons why.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","And my follow-up question is just regarding EnLink. Just wanted to see, John, if you could articulate maybe your thoughts and ways to maximize value from this strategic partnership with EnLink. And perhaps you could just remind us how this now improves Devon\u2019s overall capital efficiency and some of the cash flows you get on a recurring basis from dividends.","John Richels","Well, you hit on a couple of important points. Over the past several years we\u2019ve had a fair amount of capital that we've put into our midstream operations. And with the transfer of assets to EnLink, that obligation or that responsibility for that expenditure goes to EnLink. So that just leaves more of our cash flow available for our development projects, which is a good thing. We also had -- given that EnLink has very stable fixed contracts for the most part, we have a fairly reliable cash flow stream that comes to us from EnLink. And as we look at the future, we\u2019ve got a great asset there. The day we transfer our assets into the new entity that formed EnLink, it had a market value of about $4.8 billion today. It's somewhere up around $9 billion. And as I said earlier, we have a very visible growth profile as we continue to develop the assets that our management team at EnLink have brought to the table. They're got a lot of organic growth opportunities. But we have continuing drop downs both from the general partner to the limited partner and from possibility of facilities drop downs from Devon to EnLink. So all of those things point towards more efficiency on our part, more capital efficiency on Devon\u2019s part because of the increased cash flow that's going into our development projects and an increasing valuation for EnLink over the next while. So, all-in-all a real positive development for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Research. Your line is open.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","","One question as I think about Pike and the $250 million of the spend next year, how does that fit into any partnership sell down or joint venture thoughts between now and kind of fourth quarter '15 when you remake your Board consideration?","John Richels","Well, as you know, David, on Pike, we\u2019ve got, we\u2019re a 50% owner of Pike and are non-operative partners with BP with a 50% interest as well. So, this work that we\u2019re doing is very necessary work in order for us to really understand the project and know what the capital costs are going to be and to fully delineate the area with the additional stratigraphic test flow. So, this is work that\u2019s absolutely necessary for us to do and it doesn\u2019t really change anything that we might do going forward. I think we\u2019ll get this work done over the year and then take it back to our Board for consideration in late in 2015.","And then we have the full impact on -- it really has no impact on exactly how Pike rolls out overtime, because this is work that -- this is a great looking project in what looks to be the sweet spot of the oil sands for SAGD developments. So it's something that we absolutely need to get our arms around and then we\u2019ll take that to our Board for consideration probably late in '15.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then in the Eagle Ford, I thought your comments and you highlighted in, again reiterating Doug\u2019s comments, the operation report is really helpful and kind of bold and italicized, kind of stands out. So the potential for new type curve improvements in new wells around optimized production practices relative to your quarter-over-quarter growth rates and your 100,000 barrel a day at least target in '15. How should we think about a sustained growth rate in the Eagle Ford with kind of new type curves, improvements and it just seems like your quarter-over-quarter growth rates accelerate given the pull down of backlog for the next couple of quarters? Is that a fair assumption to think you're accelerating growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter?","John Richels","Yes, I think just probably a pretty fair assumption, Dave. We\u2019re really pleased with the way the things are working out and we do see with these new completions that we\u2019re working on right now as well as our production optimization activities that we\u2019re doing, we see that things are continuing to improve, I would say. So, we haven\u2019t come out with an affinity guidance regarding 2015, so I am being careful not to say too much. But I can tell you things are on the positive rather than on the neutral or negative and so we feel really good about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","","Again, thanks very much for the additional disclosure, we always greatly appreciate that. A very high level strategy question. Hearing you talk and describe the way things are going, it sounds like the move in oil prices really hasn\u2019t changed anything. Is there anything that has changed in your view of future strategy as a result of the $25 drop in the barrel oil prices?","Unidentified Company Representative","First of all, when we\u2019re implementing our strategy, as you know, we\u2019re looking at longer-term prices, not with the spot prices today. And frankly, the longer-term prices haven\u2019t changed that much from where they were when we developed the strategy and when we made the moves to so significantly transform our portfolio. So, we put ourselves in the position today of having an asset base that has very good rates of return that can generate high margins where we can have robust growth and that has a lot of flexibility for the future in terms of oil or liquids rich gas. So, it really -- the spot price, the change in the spot price hasn\u2019t really affected our view of what we might do.","And as we get into 2015, I think the very strong position that we are in is \u2013 we've got one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, we\u2019re very well hedged already for 2015. We've got over 50% of our productions hedged at a oil price of $91 a barrel. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of price protection from that point of view. And with the additional financial levers that we have with the drop downs that we\u2019re talking about and other, we've put ourselves into a very, very good position even if prices stay a little bit soft in the near term. But as you can appreciate, as we get into 2015 and we start executing that '15 program, we\u2019re really more interested in what oil prices are towards the end of '15 and '16 and '17, because that\u2019s when that production comes on and when you really drive the returns on the additional work that we\u2019ve done. So, we feel very good about the strategy. We feel very good about the portfolio and the opportunity set that we've created for the next several years.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","On gas markets, could you just update us on what you see out there on natural gas as we head into winter?","Darryl Smette","This is Darryl. And obviously, we had -- we started out 2014 with a very severe winter weather, drove gas prices up. As we went through December, we\u2019ve seen additional production come on stream which was anticipated probably a little bit more than we originally thought especially out of the Utica and the Marcellus and then a very mild summer compared to the last couple that we\u2019ve had. But as we go into 2015, while we do see a continued increase in supply, we also are starting to see some increase in demand, we think. Most of that will come in the second half of the year and into 2016 with some additional capacity coming on with petrochemical plants, electric generation, more exports to Mexico.","So we\u2019re still fairly comfortable that over the longer term we\u2019re going to see prices that range between $3.50 and $5. And as we look right now, there is probably going to be a $3.75 to $4.25 price for 2015. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with those numbers. Those are numbers that we\u2019ve used in all of our economic evaluations for the last two or three years. So, just as John said on the oil side, there has really been no surprise to us in terms of what gas prices have been and how we\u2019ve modeled the projects we\u2019ve had before us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","We definitely appreciate the ops reports, thanks so much for that. Can you talk to your needs for infrastructure investment, particularly in the Eagle Ford and the Permian over the next couple of years? And how that level of investments defers, if at all, from what is being made in 2014?","John Richels","Let\u2019s let Darryl answer that question. He is the expert on it.","Darryl Smette","Brian, and when you\u2019re talking about infrastructure, I assume you\u2019re talking about what I\u2019ll call marketing or midstream infrastructure. Is that correct?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Actually, let me be clear, because that\u2019s a good point. I was thinking more to support your E&P growth. So processing to support directly support your production growth plans, any sand expansions or logistics expansion, water, et cetera, as opposed to what would be done by the midstream subsidiary for third parties.","Darryl Smette","Well, I\u2019ll let Dave talk about water. But just in terms of, let\u2019s take the Eagle Ford first. Our acreage, except for the Lavaca County, both on the gas side and the oil gathering side, is dedicated under a long-term contracts with third party midstream companies. Under those contracts, they have obligations to increase capacity as we increase production in both cases. We so far have been them perform, although we did have some gathering issues on the liquids side. Once we acquired from GeoSouthern, they worked very diligently to correct those issues and each day that gets better. So we expect in terms of takeaway both on the oil and the gas and the liquids side in the Eagle Ford that that won\u2019t really be an issue for us.","Turning to the Permian, we\u2019re in a lot of different areas. But what we have here is a little bit of a similar story and that a lot of our acreage that we have here has previously been committed to third parties. Now there are some opportunities in some areas for us to do independent work. But for the most part our acreage is dedicated to third parties. And we\u2019ve worked with them consistently over the last two or three years to make sure that we have facilities in place when we develop our wells.","Now, we do not anticipate through at least 2015 and into 2016, we do not think there is going to be any takeaway capacity problems either on the gas side or the oil side or any processing issues. Now that could change if we get much better results than we anticipate. But right now, we feel pretty comfortable where we are there.","We do have some issues on some Devon facilities, gathering facilities, where we undersized those facilities based on the success we\u2019ve had. And so we\u2019re now in the process of going back to those facilities and increasing capacity on those and that process is ongoing. We think most of that\u2019s going to be completed by the end of the first quarter, maybe into the second quarter of 2015. But we feel pretty comfortable where we are from a midstream type perspective in both of those areas.","Dave Hager","Brian, I might just -- this is Dave -- I might just talk briefly about from the sand and the water standpoint. Before I do, I might just make a more global comment here that we have put a real emphasis internally in the company on what we call project management, which really is to make sure that we\u2019re doing good long-term planning addressing all the issues that you\u2019re describing. And so that\u2019s a real focus within the company. We\u2019re not just out there drilling wells, we\u2019re looking down the road two, three, four, five years and making sure we\u2019re addressing all those issues that you\u2019re bringing up.","Regarding the sands side of the business, we think that we\u2019re -- I am not going to say it\u2019s not tight, it has been tight. But at the same time we think that we have the ability through our relationships with the service companies to get the sands there for the wells. The tightest have been in the Permian Basin obviously and historically the most difficult part is what we call the last mile, which is really the trucking to the location. Now that has been somewhat improved here in the past couple of months or so. But overall, we think it\u2019s going to be tight. But we think that given the strength of the company and the strength of our relationship with our service providers and the bigger service providers particularly that we use the most, we can handle that.","On the water side, we do not see any significant issue there at all. We\u2019re bringing in water actually from outside from the north into the -- near our activities located in the Delaware Basin. We don\u2019t see any significant issue and we\u2019ve been planning for that. So we\u2019re in good shape.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","","And my follow-up is actually a follow-up to David Heikkinen's question earlier with regard to the Eagle Ford and the potential for type curve improvements next year. Can you just add some color on what you\u2019re thinking about spacing in DeWitt County? And whether there is the simultaneous potential for downspacing and a type curve improvement whether the spacing is set and so it would just be a type curve improvement or one of the other?","Dave Hager","Well we\u2019re drilling on average at about 50 to 60 acre spacing. Now that is composed of 40 acre spacing in the more oily parts of the play and then 80 acre spacing where it gets a little bit more gassy towards the southern end of our acreage position. On an average, it\u2019s around the 50 to 60 acre spacing currently.","Now, do I, in theory, see some potential upside for the same type thing we\u2019re talking about in the Delaware basin where we could with these more advanced and more complex fracs that we\u2019re not reaching out as far? Do I see some downspacing potential in theory? I think it may exist. But frankly, we\u2019re less -- let me put it this way. We\u2019re less mature in our discussion process with our partner regarding that potential right now than we are in other initiatives. And so, first thing we do is get these better completion designs working real efficiently. I think we do, then we may be able to make some progress on downspacing also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","","Dave, with respect to the shale wells with greater frac completion intensity, are you just waiting for time to recognize the improvements, are you doing any science, any monitoring, micro-seismic or traces or anything?","John Richels","","We\u2019re doing quite a bit. I\u2019ll tell you what, I am going to turn the call over to our Head of E&P, Tony Vaughn, who can give you an even more detailed response to this, John. He\u2019s really close to this, so I'll let him talk you about it a little bit.","Tony Vaughn","","John, I think you lead into a good conversation. In general, we\u2019re being much more bullish in acquiring a lot more data than we had in the past. And I think some of the things that have differentiated Devon from some of our other companies that we compete against are just that. And so we\u2019re taking cores, pressures, temperatures, we\u2019re using fiber optics in a lot of our wells around the company. We also have a well [conn] 24 hours, seven day a week, 365 center that really monitors all of our execution activities very closely. So the attention to detail is much higher. We\u2019ve stood up a lot of our integrated reservoir optimization teams to take this data, incorporate more technical work into it. It's really providing a lot more abilities for us to model both the reservoir, model the frac design work that we do.","So yes, the long answer is yes, we\u2019re taking a lot more information, we\u2019re monitoring the data, we\u2019re micro-seismic and in some cases through fiber optics. It\u2019s really causing us to see the real specifics about where our injected volumes are going, what\u2019s really providing benefit and what is not. So actually I think some of the questions that have started to call out was more -- and I think Dave hit on it very well -- was more about optimization and that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019re at.","So we\u2019re seeing prove rates, recoveries and returns on almost all of our area and I think Cana was a great standalone example of taking a project that really wasn't competing in our portfolio from a commercial standpoint and through much more improved debt acquisition and technical work has turned it into a project that we are anticipating funding in a much more aggressive fashion in '15.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","My next one is for John. With the free cash flow from Jackfish, obviously you could fund Pike. But in the event that that\u2019s not going to be a project that\u2019s ramping up immediately, would you repatriate $1 billion a year to the U.S.?","John Richels","","Well, we sure want to try to do it, John, in the most capital or a tax-efficient manner that we could. And frankly, I will point out to you, even if we go ahead and fund Pike, we\u2019re still going to have a bunch of free cash flow in Canada, because it's not taking out the Pike project, if they were to go ahead, it wouldn\u2019t take up $1 billion of your EBIT. So, we\u2019re going to have some free cash flow and my guess is that we will bring that back. We\u2019ll try to do it as tax efficiently as we can and deploy that here in the U.S.","We haven\u2019t -- in the past, we've sometimes left those funds offshore or in Canada because we have not had to change or alter our capital spending plans as a result of where cash is. I mean, we've got enough balance sheet flexibility, as you know, and enough liquidity that we're not constraining our capital decisions in the U.S. by where the cash is. So, that all points to trying to bring that cash back in the most tax-efficient way and not hurting it back because it's really not going to change our behavior in any event as long as we have the financial strength and liquidity that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brother Investment Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brother Investment Research","","I\u2019d like to add to the commentary on the ops report, which I\u2019ve already told Howard, which I think is very good. But I also want to thank you for this expanded Q&A. My first question is on the Delaware Bone Spring. Can you talk a little bit about how much the enhanced completion method is increasing the per well completion costs on average versus the previous completion methods? And can you provide any color on the return uplift that you alluded to in the ops report from these larger completions?","Unidentified Company Representative","The incremental cost is around $1 million, give or take, for the larger fracs. Obviously it depends on whether it's 1,500 pounds of sand or 2,500 pounds of sand, but it's per linear foot. But that\u2019s a good estimate for what it is. So far, and again we haven\u2019t come out with the potential higher EURs, I can tell you that based on the very preliminary data that we\u2019ve seen that the enhancements in the rate of return are somewhere between significant and staggering. And they are outstanding and certainly justify the incremental $1 million cost. And so we just want to get a little bit more confidence in that before we roll out all those numbers.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brother Investment Research","The other question I want to ask was with regard to the Eagle Ford. Could you provide some color on how you built such a large inventory through the third quarter '14 that you alluded to in the report? And going forward, what is the sort of inventory number you prefer to see?","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, it just has to do -- the inventory that has built up, it just has to do with the fact that we obviously -- and this part of the business again managed through BHP historically, but they just have been drilling wells and they haven\u2019t had enough completion crews to quite keep up with the number of wells that they've drilled. Now that is why we have agreed to increase the number of frac crews and actually they have agreed to have Devon operate two of those frac crews. So, we were increasing from five to nine, so two of those nine will actually be operated by Devon and we anticipate they will take the number of uncompleted wells down by approximately 50%, from around 120 to somewhere around 60 wells somewhere at the end of Q4. And that\u2019s one of the things that does also give us the confidence not only we\u2019re going to see good production increases in Q4, but that\u2019s going to sustain itself through the first part of '15 as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","A quick question. Obviously, your domestic portfolio has improved tremendously over the past year or so. And just wondering was that -- has there been any change in how you are thinking about the oil sands business, where does that stack up relative to your domestic business now?","John Richels","Biju, the oil sands business has some very positive characteristics that are different from some of the rest of our business. And we\u2019ve always said that we thought that overtime we were going to provide the best returns and the most solid returns to our shareholders by having a diversified portfolio. And we never wanted to be just the gas company or just an oil company. And so to have \u2013 we like that mix between natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil and the mix between light oil and heavy oil as a positive one because they trade very differently and have very different characteristics.","What we\u2019ve been seeing with our heavy oil business is that the margins have increased significantly over time. And part of that is the reduction in the differentials as more certainty has risen around the Canadian oil sands business with regard to takeaway capacity and that\u2019s likely to continue.","So our view of the future from a differential perspective is that it\u2019s going to continue. It\u2019s going to become more stable, less volatile over time and that it\u2019s going to be lower than it has been historically and that\u2019s as a result of Energy East and Keystone XL which will come on at some point in time and Flanagan and all of the pipelines that are being built, rail now being a significant part and probably a permanent part of the takeaway capacity. So, it\u2019s a very good business. As a matter of fact, in this quarter, our operating margin from Jackfish was somewhere just shy at $40 a barrel. So it\u2019s a pretty good business.","And so as we look forward, to have a piece of our portfolio and this type of asset that has basically no decline for 25 years, relatively low maintenance capital is a nice piece to have. So, it's still firmly part of our business. And I will say that, and you\u2019ve heard me say this, Biju, that when we got into this business, we recognized that if we were going to be in this heavy oil business, we had to be in the top quartile or a top decile project or we can\u2019t make money otherwise. And we are fortunate our guys did a great job and we picked a project area that is really in the top part of this industry. And so it\u2019s a real strong part of our business going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Your line is open.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities","Two quick question on the Medina well and other four upper Eagle Ford wells that will be spud by year end. First, are you using enhanced completion designs on those wells? And do you plan to apply the same choke management system that you\u2019ve tried in the lower Eagle Ford?","Dave Hager","Yes and yes.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities","And just as a follow up, you\u2019ve talked about how these wells are located in the thickest part of the upper Eagle Ford and certainly thicker than the area to the Northeast where there have been some very good well results by other operators. My question is, what sort of IP rates or 30-day rates would you expect from these wells? And if the wells are successful, how many upper Eagle Ford locations could you potentially add to your overall inventory in the Eagle Ford?","Dave Hager","Well, I don\u2019t want to -- it\u2019s not even about initial IP or 30 day rates. It\u2019s about the sustainability of those rates and what kind of EURs we need ultimately from those wells. So I don\u2019t have a specific number that I am going to lay out there for that to judge success or lack of success on those. But we\u2019ll be obviously watching the first few months of performance.","How much there is? We\u2019re not quite ready or I don\u2019t think we have enough information really to say how much additional resource or how many locations we have. We need to see some success here. This is a different type of formation geologically also. This isn\u2019t a shale this is a marl, which is a type of carbonate reservoir and actually has a little bit of primary porosity to it. So it\u2019s going to behave significantly different than a shale reservoir well. And we need to see more results to really say what kind of spacing we could have if we works to see how many locations.","I will point out, I think you\u2019re probably well aware that obviously there have been some wells drilled to the Northeast by other operators, Penn Virginia and others, but I think also if you move to the Southwest, there have been other companies, I think specifically Marathon has been drilling wells for the same interval. This is not the upper Eagle Ford shale. Some might call this the lowest-most Austin Chalk. But we\u2019ve chosen for historical marketing reasons I say to call it the Eagle Ford rather than the Austin Chalk. But it\u2019s actually a marl section that\u2019s above the upper Eagle Ford shale.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to John Richels, CEO, for closing comments.","John Richels","Thank you. And let me just make a couple of comments and I\u2019ll turn it over to Howard just for a couple of comments as well. But I just want to say a couple of things. Thank you for hanging in with us for this long call and we got some great questions. But just want to pass on our thoughts here.","We\u2019ve seen a significant transformation in our asset portfolio over the past year. So we have a great portfolio today with high margin assets and a portfolio that has years of visible growth. So today we are laser focused on execution and that\u2019s what\u2019s helped us deliver a great quarter for the third quarter of 2014, allowed us to raise our full year production targets and we\u2019re not taking our foot off the gas. This strong operational momentum is going to continue into 2015 as we continue to grow our oil production and our cash flow. And again, notably, I think we\u2019re doing that in a very capital efficient manner. We\u2019re well positioned to fund our 2015 capital program with our strong financial position. And lastly, while we clearly possess a great deal of financial strength, we are fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our growth in cash flow per share adjusted for debt.","So with that, again, thank you for hanging in. And I\u2019ll just turn it back to Howard.","Howard Thill","Thanks, John. And I\u2019d like to echo John\u2019s thoughts. We appreciate all your support. I also appreciate the kind words on ops report and the other changes. I want to throw out some thank yous to Scott, Shea, Chris and the rest of the team that have done an outstanding effort to bring this forward. And if you have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to give any one of us a call. We look forward to seeing you out on the road. Have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Scott Coody","Thank you and good morning. For the call today, we have slides to supplement our prepared remarks. Our slides for the call along with our press release and detailed operations report are available on our website.","Some of our comments on the call today will contain plans, forecasts and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially. Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager, our President and CEO.","Dave Hager","Thank you and good morning, everyone. I am very excited to talk to you today about our announcement last night to complete Devon's transformation to a high-return U.S. oil growth company.","Before we get started, I want to take a few minutes to set the stage for today's discussion. Today, we are unveiling a new Devon. We've been signaling strongly to the market for some time that when our U.S. oil assets achieve operating scale, exiting Canada and the Barnett as our path forward.","What we present to you today is a culmination of an exhaustive strategic and operational review, the results we believe will put Devon in a position to be upper-echelon performer, driving durable improvements and shareholder value. We have the assets, and we have the team to do this. In short, we are aggressively reshaping Devon to win and we will win.","Turning to Slide 2, this transformational move is consistent with our long-term strategic plan and will allow the Company to focus on its world-class oil assets in the Delaware Basin, STACK, Eagle Ford and Powder River Basin. To accomplish this portfolio simplification, our Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue strategic alternatives to separate the Canadian and Barnett Shale assets from our retained U.S. oil business.","We have hired advisors in evaluating multiple methods of separation for these assets including a potential sale or spinoff, and we expect to complete this separation process by the end of 2019.","Additionally, with Devon's narrowed focus as a U.S. oil business, we are committed to transforming our culture and cost structure to compete head-to-head with the best in the business. We are acting with a sense of urgency to materially improve our entire cost structure by delivering at least $780 million in sustainable annual cost savings.","With our go-forward business and position to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow at today's pricing, I am also excited to announce that we're advancing our shareholder return initiatives by upsizing our industry-leading share repurchase program to $5 billion and increasing our quarterly dividend payment by 13%.","Turning to Slide 3. This exhibit showcases our transformation from a diversified worldwide Company to a highly focused U.S. oil producer today. The key takeaway here is that we have an extensive track record of successfully executing on our portfolio simplification initiatives with more than $30 billion of asset sales over the last decade. ","The strategic rationale for taking this final step in our transformation and our announcement today is quite simple. With our U.S. oil business reaching sufficient operating scale to deliver advantaged returns, sustainable long-term growth and a generation of free cash flow, the timing is now appropriate to accelerate value creation for our shareholders by exiting our Canadian and Barnett Shale positions.","As you can see on Slide 4, the simplification of our portfolio unleashed the potential of our U.S. oil assets, which possess scale and reside in the very best plays and the best plays in the U.S. \u2013 in the best parts of the best plays in the U.S. To be clear, the information laid out here is for our go-forward business and represents the results of our four retained oil basins.","The charts exclude results from Canada and the Barnett along with minor non-core assets for sale in the U.S., but exclude the benefits of cost saving targets. It is these world-class oil positions with low break-evens, which provide new Devon the flexibility to generate free cash flow and deliver sustainable long-term growth.","This is evidenced by the chart at the top of the slide that showcases our top-tier well productivity. On initial 90-day production rates, our average well has exceeded virtually every top competitor in the U.S. Everyone likes to highlight their best wells and we do it too.","However, this slide captures every well for Devon and peers. This is true transparency. Devon is right at the top, even including the year when we faced challenges optimizing spacing in our STACK play. Just think about it. If we were at the top even with the STACK challenge we faced in 2018, I wonder what happened to everyone below us.","This good news story does not end with well productivity. As you can see on the bottom of the slide, new Devon streamed on U.S. oil portfolio will also deliver substantially improved oil rates, a lower per unit cost structure and higher operating margins that will translate into superior returns on capital employed.","Moving to Slide 5, while our U.S. oil assets have many advantaged characteristics, we are not finished improving our business. We are aggressively reshaping our organization with a singular focus on our simplified U.S. oil portfolio to unlock the potential of new Devon. As you can see on the top left chart, we expect our U.S. oil business to achieve at least $780 million in sustainable annual cost savings by 2021 versus our 2018 baseline.","Our cost reduction plan includes a range of actions to achieve more efficient field-level operations, lower drilling and completion costs, and better alignment of personnel with the go-forward business.","To be clear, these lower drilling completion costs are structural and the 2019 plan assumes flat year-over-year service and supply costs. To the extent, we see deflation in service on supply costs that would be additive to the plan.","Importantly, we are acting with a sense of urgency on these initiatives and we are already executing on plans to achieve at least 70% of these cost reductions this year. Our efforts to reduce cost go beyond just dollars and cents and represent a meaningful shift in our culture to more streamlined leadership, more reliance on technical expertise and an intense focus on delivering top-tier returns on our investment.","The value creation of these changes are material and impactful for our shareholders equating to a PV10 over the next 10 years of approximately $4.5 billion or more than $10 per share.","Turning to Slide 6, in addition to higher asset quality and an improved cost structure, Devon's unwavering commitment to a disciplined returns-oriented growth strategy will drive additional value creation for our shareholders. As we have highlighted in the past, the leadership team at Devon fundamentally believes that a steadier and more measured investment program through all cycles is the best path to optimize corporate-level returns, sustainably grow our business and generate free cash flow and reward our shareholders with increased amounts of cash returns.","Importantly, this disciplined approach to the business will allow Devon to achieve all our capital allocation priorities at a flat $46 WTI price deck, while delivering a mid-teens growth rate in light-oil production.","To be clear, this includes all of our capital expenditures, not just some of our capital as suggested by others in the industry in their definition of free cash flow within recent presentations. Inclusive of all capital and recurring expenses, Devon is poised to grow oil at a mid-teens rate within cash flow at $46 WTI. The benefits of higher commodity prices above $46 oil will drive higher levels of free cash flow for Devon shareholders, not higher capital activity.","Now, let's run through some of the operational highlights and specifics of the 2019 program. As we look ahead to 2019, on Slide 7, we expect our disciplined growth strategy to deliver strong results. For New Devon, we plan to invest approximately $1.9 billion of E&P capital with half of this capital concentrated on low-risk developments in the economic core of our world-class Delaware Basin assets.","The other half of our capital will be evenly split between high-return, low-risk oil projects in the STACK, Eagle Ford and Powder River Basin. Although well over 90% of our capital is focused on low-risk development, we will strategically allocate capital to mature our upside opportunities in the Niobrara, the Austin Chalk and other key plays.","The capital efficiency associated with this plan is fantastic, allowing us to drill 15% more wells compared to 2018 for roughly 10% less capital investment. Key drivers of this improved capital efficiency are substantially lower facility costs across our retained U.S. asset portfolio, improved cycle times associated with our Wolfcamp program in the Delaware and optimized up-space development program in the STACK and a dedicated frac crew in the Powder River Basin.","To reemphasize what I noted on a previous side, all of New Devon's capital requirements in 2019 are funded within operating cash flow at $46 WTI pricing assuming flat service and supply costs versus 2018.","Turning to Slide 8, this level of capital investment is expected to drive light-oil production growth for New Devon of 13% to 18% in 2019. Importantly, the trajectory of New Devon's oil production profile is expected to steadily advance throughout the year and exit 2019 at rates more than 20% higher than the 2018 average.","Coupled with our share repurchase program that is on pace to reduce our share count by nearly 30%, Devon is positioned to deliver some of the most advantaged per share growth rates in the industry. While our 2019 business outlook is very strong, we will build upon that success in the future by expanding profitability and improving the returns Devon is capable delivering on a multiyear basis.","On Slide 9, we lay out multiyear targets, which highlight the peer-leading capital efficiency of the company. It really highlights what New Devon can deliver. First, we expect capital requirements over the next three years to be fully funded with an operating cash flow at a $46 WTI price point, while growing our light-oil production by around 12% to 17% per year over the same time period.","As a direct result of our disciplined returns-based growth strategy at $55 WTI, which is near the current strip pricing, New Devon will generate a cumulative free cash flow of $1.6 billion through 2021. The profitability of our barrels will be enhanced through the aggressive improvement of our cost structure, which is expected to yield at least $780 million of annualized savings. ","From a balance sheet perspective, new Devon will maintain a low leverage profile by targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.0 times to 1.5 times.","Slide 10 outlines the free cash flow our business is capable of delivering at various pricing points. As I've already emphasized, this plan is designed to completely fund our three-year capital requirements at an ultra-low WTI break-even price of $46 while providing an attractive mid-teens growth rate.","And as I touched on a previous slide, at today's 36 months strip price of around $55 WTI pricing, the new Devon is capable of delivering a three-year cumulative free cash flow of $1.6 billion. This is equivalent to nearly 15% of our market capitalization at today's share price and represents a very competitive free cash flow yield to investors while still providing an attractive oil production growth rate.","Importantly, this measure free cash flow yield includes the cash flow from new Devon only and isn't adjusted for the cash flow or value of Canada, the Barnett or other minor U.S. non-core assets for sale.","Now, I'll quickly cover a few operating highlights from the fourth quarter. Slide 11 highlights the impressive momentum in the Delaware. Oil production is up 49% year-over-year and has already advanced another 14% in January compared to the fourth quarter.","Our well results continue to improve sequentially, reflecting the quality and depth of inventory across our large acreage position in the economic heart of the basin. This will continue into 2019 with our focused Wolfcamp program and an additional development in the Bone Spring near our basin-leading Boundary Raider wells.","Slide 12 outlines the substantial progress we have made optimizing infill spacing developments in the STACK. The success of our up-space development drove oil production 9% higher in the quarter versus the third quarter.","As important as the strong rates are the significant capital efficiencies in these infill developments. The drilling and completion costs of our infill wells are coming in at approximately 30% lower than the parent wells, a positive step change in capital efficiency. The improved capital efficiency, well STACK generate free cash flow of around $300 million in 2019 at today's prices.","Slide 13 covers Eagle Ford, where we expect to add a third rig in 2019. Beyond the prolific lower Eagle Ford wells have driven our development program in previous years, an important program for us this year is our Austin Chalk appraisal.","Our five-well program along with industry-leading offset activity could derisk more than 200 locations. With regard to 2018 results, this asset continue to perform at a very high level contributing more than $515 million of free cash flow. For the quarter, positive results were driven by 15 lower Eagle Ford wells averaging 30-day IPs of 3,700 BOE per day highlighting the quality of the position.","Slide 14 provides an update on the Powder River Basin where we entered 2019 with significant momentum. January oil production rates were up 25% versus the fourth quarter. Importantly, we expect this momentum to continue as we double our activity levels in 2019 to four rigs and have a dedicated frac crew.","The expected 2019 exit-to-exit oil growth rate for these emerging opportunities is greater than 50%. The program will prioritize the Turner. It will also advance the Niobrara program building on the early success seen in 2018.","Turning to Slide 15, Devon's differentiated investment story only gets better. We believe our top-tier U.S. oil business trades at a substantial discount to comparable high-quality peers on a number of metrics. We have included a simple comparison on an enterprise value to EBITDA basis to demonstrate this point.","As you can see, the analysis implies new Devon creates a very attractive valuation and suggests that investors have further upside with the separation of our Canadian, Barnett and other marketed assets.","Bottom line is that we see a tremendous investment opportunity in Devon and we have put our money where our mouth is by aggressively buying back our stock over the past year. Devon represents a unique value proposition in E&P sector that is recognized by the Company and our Board has authorized another increase to our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. We will be actively buying back shares at this attractive valuation.","So, in summary, why should you own Devon? First, core of the core positions in the best U.S. oil plays, low breakevens of $46 WTI with a mid-teens oil growth rate. We are committed to capital-efficient growth and returning capital to shareholders. And finally with new Devon, you have a unique opportunity to own a top-tier E&P at an incredibly attractive valuation.","Scott Coody","Thanks Dave. We will now open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram","Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe outline confidence in achieving the $780 million of cost savings with 70% by year-end particularly on the G&A line item. And I'm also hoping that you can kind of address on Slide 9 the free cash flow targets that you achieve because in the footnotes, you're saying that the cost savings are fully realized at the beginning of 2019. So just wondering if you could help reconcile that slide as well.","Dave Hager","Yes, Arun, good morning. We are extremely confident on achieving at least $780 million of annualized cost savings. We have activities ongoing right now that are moving us toward achieving those results. We have results or things that we're doing on the drilling and completion side, we outlined some of the key items there. I think if you look at the deck back on Slide 17, it highlights some of the increased capital efficiency around facility costs and I mentioned Wolfcamp drilling cost, and STACK infill design, dedicated frac crew in the Powder River Basin, et cetera.","We are working on the LOE side right now. The interest expense is obviously contingent upon the asset sale. And we're confident that we're going to do that. But I think very importantly on the G&A side and that we have said that we will achieve approximately 70% of those savings by the end of this year; I can tell you that we have already started our activity on that front and there is going to be additional activity in the very near future. And we have a plan. We've started the execution of that plan and we're very confident that we're going to get those results. Jeff you want to...","Arun Jayaram","Just on that Slide 9 or 10, you go through the cumulative free cash flow of $1.6 billion. But just trying to understand when you're assuming \u2013 what you're assuming for cost savings for that target.","Dave Hager","Jeff is going to answer for us Arun.","JeffRitenour","Yes, Arun, this is Jeff. As we outlined on the slide with the cost savings about 70% of that's going to come in the first year. But keep in mind we've tried to build a 2019 that's clean. So we've assumed that we're starting to get the impact of those cost savings in the 2019 time frame. ","As you know, that's going to be dependent on, as Dave highlighted, interest cost, for example, is going to be a function of the asset sale proceeds. So, until we actually get the asset sold, you're obviously not going to be able to pay down the debt and recognize some of those interest costs. But we tried to show you a clean 2019 look.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just my follow-up, Jeff, can you walk us through potential proceeds, the tax efficiency of the sales of the Barnett and Canada and perhaps the PV10 value of both of those assets for the 10-K?","JeffRitenour","Sure, Arun. Well, as you might guess, we're not going to prejudge our processes that we have ongoing in each of those assets. But as you're well aware, there have been multiple transactions in Canada, in the SAGD space over the last couple of years.","Certainly, there's several publicly traded companies with quality SAGD assets in that space but I think folks can look to get a sense of the value proposition. On the Barnett side, again, have been fewer transactions obviously here of recent, we did obviously sell our Johnson County package last year. I would point out to you, however, that this package is much larger and has a larger weighting toward liquid. So those are things to keep in mind as you think about the value proposition.","From a tax standpoint, as I think you probably had talked to Scott a little bit last night and he's probably shared some of this with you already, but our expectation is, we will not have any cash taxes in 2019 related to the divestiture of either of these assets. That's a function of the bases that we have in both of those assets.","Structure of the ultimate transaction is ultimately going to determine the tax implications. But under any scenario, we really don't believe there's going to be significant tax impact. Again, that's a function of the bases that we have in the assets, as well as the tax attributes that we have in hand today. So for example, at year-end, we had just under $400 million of NOLs in the U.S. So, you put all that together and we think we're going to have a pretty tax-efficient separation of both of these assets.","Dave Hager","I may just add a little detail around the G&A, because I suspect others are going to have this same question about it. So if you start with a run or a 2018 G&A of $650 million, we're saying we're going to achieve $300 million of G&A savings. And let me kind of break that down for you so you get an idea in the different categories.","We have already identified and already have completed about $35 million of efficiency gains versus the 2018 annual numbers. So our run rate currently is around 615. We expect another $100 million associated with the divestiture-related exits and specifically the G&A associated with Canada and the Barnett directly related to that.","We're targeting additionally about $75 million of non-workforce-related reductions in G&A. And there are a number of areas that that's going to come from. But we've identified specific areas where we think that we can target savings. We're spending more than we want. But there are certainly some areas even like the technology area, we think our costs are high and we're working to reduce those, optimizing our third-party labor, a number of areas are non-specific to, that are not workforce-related, and we do target about $90 million of workforce reductions.","So and the bulk of that will be done in 2019 as well. So that gives you a little more detail hopefully to see how we get there.","Arun Jayaram","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Your next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Dave, I wonder if or maybe Jeff, I'm not sure who wants to take this, but can you give us an idea what you think the run rate cash flow is associated with the oil sands business and the Barnett business? Because, obviously, as you pointed out in your slide deck, the oil business, the main core business is of a scale now that it can self-fund its growth, but previously I think one of the issues that prevented an exit from these was that they generated substantial free cash. So what should we be thinking as kind of run rate cash flow that is associated to these two?","Dave Hager","I think Jeff can handle it, but obviously in Canada, it's been quite variable. The cash flow that's been generated from that given the differentials. But Jeff can give you more specific numbers.","JeffRitenour","Yes. Doug, as just Dave pointed out, it's a little bit challenging at the moment just given the volatility that we saw in the differentials in the fourth quarter. But we're certainly on a go-forward basis thinking about more normalized differentials from a WCS standpoint. There's obviously other complexity given the curtailments and everything else that's going on in the space.","But if you think about our base business and steady-state production, you're probably in that $400 million to $500 million range from an EBITDA standpoint for the asset. On the Barnett, I believe in 2018 that asset did around $200 million and $250 million of cash flow, and so it should be in that same ballpark going forward.","Doug Leggate","All right. And we are not many miles away. Thank you for that. My follow-up is really more on the go-forward plan. Dave, the performance in the Boundary area and the Delaware obviously has been quite impressive. I think you still hold the record wells up there. But as I look across the going into Cotton Draw and some of the other areas that you tested initial wells in the fourth quarter, the whole area looks like it has stepped up in terms of productivity. So I guess I'm curious what should we be thinking now in terms of the standard well design that's behind your go-forward program given that the Delaware is dominating the drilling plan? I'm really thinking more about the quality of that 2000 location inventory; how variable is that relative to 2019 fund would look like and I'll leave it there? Thanks.","Dave Hager","Well, we've obviously had a significant step change in productivity with the Delaware Basin. As we've moved out of the appraisal activity and now we're more into the full development activity in the Delaware Basin. So we're being able to target the right zones and the right areas and that has led to this productivity improvement. That's going to continue some. I think the other thing you're going to see, as I alluded to, you're going to start to see the costs come down significantly on the Wolfcamp program. So, Tony, I don't know you if you want to go \u2013 you can go through a little more specifics on the well expectations by formation?","Tony Vaughn","Doug, in the Wolfcamp, you know, we're going to spend about \u2013 we're going to drill about 45% of our activity will be in the Wolfcamp in 2019. And as Dave mentioned, having great success there on the well performance side but also on the cost efficiency side of our business. Some of the good well performance is also translating up into our Todd area which is pretty far north for Wolfcamp activity and seeing some really outstanding results there. ","But if we look at the typical 8,500-foot Wolfcamp well, our D&C costs right now are estimated someplace between $9 million and $11 million per well; recognize that we're in a transition state right now where the more repetitions we have that's coming down the learnings are accelerating quite rapidly.","The 30-day IPs we're estimating to be about 2,500 BOEs per day and ultimate recoveries are we're estimating to be upwards of about 1.4 million barrels per well. You also have followed our activity in the Bone Springs and we continue to do very good thoughtful work there with outstanding results, high returns.","And there we're spending about $6 million to $7 million per well. IP is a little bit less in the Wolfcamp, a little bit less than 2,000 BOEs per day and ultimate recoveries is about 1 million barrels per well. And Leonard is also a great story line there as well. Costs are in that same range as the Bone Spring's well. The 30-day IPs are about 1,500 BOEs per day and the ultimate recoveries are also about 1 million barrels per well.","So we're quite pleased with all the activity that we have in the Delaware. I got to compliment our technical staff, at this point Doug, since we're talking about the Delaware. They've done a very nice job building out the infrastructure for that entire area. I think you've heard us talking the past about the magnitude of water that we move through our existing infrastructure, which is about 90% to 95%.","So the guys are doing just really quality work and I think this is all predicated, not really initialized from the initial work where we locked up our acreage in the areas that we knew we wanted to focus. And that has proven out to be extremely valuable decision from three years ago.","Doug Leggate","Tony, just to be clear before I jump off, so the chart showing the 2018 program, on the 2018 Boundary Raider program, is the implication that your 2000 locations, do you expect to be able to continue to follow that kind of profile?","Dave Hager","We're going to put John. John is Head of our Delaware Business Unit and John has been a part of all the transformation work that we're doing in the Delaware.","John Raines","Yes. Doug, what I would say is, when you look at our 2019 program, the activity is pretty evenly split over what I'd call our big four core areas. With the Potato Basin, with our Spud Muffin project, we're adding a fifth core area this year. And these four or five core areas I guess now would be what I would characterize as geographically and geologically diverse.","So what Tony just walked through was essentially a blended average of our production profile. When you look at the Boundary Raider area in particular, in 2019, we're offsetting the Boundary Raiders with about 20 wells, and we have a bit higher expectations for those wells; it's called our cat scratch fever development program. So as compared to the blended average, we have higher expectations for these wells.","What I would caution you is that the Boundary Raider wells are the biggest wells in the history of the Delaware Basin, so we're not going to build a type curve off those two wells, but we do have extremely high expectations for this program.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate for the answer, guys. I have to meet a guy that named Spud Muffin, but we will leave out for another day. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Your next question is from Phillip Jungwirth with the BMO. Your line is open.","Phillip Jungwirth","Thanks. Good morning.","Dave Hager","Good morning.","Phillip Jungwirth","In the past, you've always talked about wanting a mid-cycle price for Canada. And now with a more definitive time line around separation, how much will market condition continue to play a role here? And what gives you confidence that the assets can transact at an attractive price?","Dave Hager","Well, we're not going to give these assets \u2013 this asset away. This is a high-quality asset. There is in top 10% of all SAGD assets out there. Assets like this don't come to market every day and we think that that's going to be recognized by the potential purchasers that will \u2013 how high-quality asset this is. And I think frankly there are a number of people who are looking at this business for the long-term and understand that and will understand that the differentials can swing widely.","But they do have some confidence that eventually we are going to have more pipeline infrastructure out there and we'll be able to price it appropriately. So you're not going to see \u2013 we're not going to give it away. But I think the other thing that I would remind you and that's important I remind you to go back and look once again at \u2013 on the operations report at Slide 11 where it shows that even with no value ascribed to the Barnett and Canada, we're still trading at a discount.","So in a way, you're getting free option on this. Now that doesn't mean we're going to give it away for free because we think it is a valuable asset. But when you look at the share price I think that's important thing to keep in mind.","Phillip Jungwirth","Great. And then on the option for spin, curious if you had any initial thoughts on pro forma leverage, G&A allocation and whether you would expect Devon to retain any equity ownership in the new company.","Jeff Ritenour","This is Jeff. We're in early days of just working through all that with our advisors, so I don't have definitive answers for you on each of those points but our current expectation is a complete exit. So not to say that we won't consider structures where Devon does keep some sort of equity ownership but our current thought is a complete spin to shareholders.","Phillip Jungwirth","Right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Morris with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Robert Morris","Thank you and Dave congratulations on pending transformation.","Dave Hager","Thanks Rob.","Robert Morris","Question on the STACK here I know versus what that you laid out in November. It appears you're cutting some capital out of the STACK and that results in a pretty sharp downtick in activity there this year versus last year. Can you give us a little bit of color or thought around why you're cutting capital out of that area versus the other core areas now?","Dave Hager","Well, I'd say that overall we obviously allocate the capital to where we see the highest returns. Now we do have some very high-quality program that we're going to be executing in the STACK in the volatile oil window and we feel good about that. But I think with the \u2013 you start with the overall desire to certainly live within cash flow and to generate some level of free cash flow with the breakevens of $46 you can see that we're poised to do that.","But given that and given where we want the overall capital budget to be, you start ticking through the areas and the Delaware is performing just outstanding. We want to keep our momentum going there. The Powder River Basin, we think it's important to expand from two to four rigs to be able to go into development on the Turner and fully appraise the Niobrara activity.","The Eagle Ford, we've gone to three rigs in partnership with our new partner, BP, and potentially adding a fourth rig later this year. And so we have a relationship there, so we feel that's appropriate. So that really makes it come back to the STACK and STACK is really the one that has the most flexibility for the pace of the program. And so given the learnings we have and we want to concentrate on the core of the volatile oil window that's the one that we feel that we should adjust capital.","Robert Morris","Okay that's good answer. Appreciate that. With regard to capital allocation, I see that you're targeting 25 horizontal refresh in the Eagle Ford this year. Can you give us a sense of sort of the costs of those, what the economics are in doing those and the uplift in the EUR of production trend in those refracs?","Tony Vaughn","Bob, this is Tony again. We are \u2013 we've got about 19 planned for 2019. We're having great success with our refrac program especially high-end success with our liner refracs. And there we're spending about $4 million per well. When we tried to go without liner and without trying to add new perfs and direct our injection with a plug-and-perf system we can save about $1.5 million and get back to something closer to about $2.5 million.","Order of magnitude, we're seeing on uplift. It depends on well to well, but we're seeing an uplift of about 1,000 barrels of oil per day uplift from the wells that have been fracked \u2013 refracked with the liner system. The total capital again is about $4 million and the expected rate of return is really at the high end of our portfolio risk.","And if you look at the cheaper refracs that we've done just bull heading the fluid and prop it down; gets similar-type response and economics there at lesser cost, but the IPs are a little bit less at about 700 initially. And again a little bit more volatility in some of the results we've had to date. But for the most part we're excited about this and find it to be one of the higher-end components of our portfolio.","Robert Morris","That's great. And just lastly, what would you estimate the inventory you have of refrac candidates now?","Tony Vaughn","We've got about 700 refrac opportunities in the field on an unrisked basis. So as we continue to prosecute this and get more data, we'll just keep marking through that list.","Robert Morris","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Maybe a follow-up, first of all, I mean, if you're able to execute on planned monetization efforts, your potential and your commitment to shareholder cash returns are clearly set you apart from your U.S. onshore pure-play peers while still growing double-digit oil volumes. Can you talk about how you think about free cash flow generation of the goal, whether you have specific targets relative to peers or relative to the broader market or how you look to manage free cash flow generation relative to organic growth over the longer term?","Jeff Ritenour","Hi, Ryan, this is Jeff. I think as I started out I would point you to one of the things that we're really focused on is just maintaining steady state of activity in our base operations. And as we've talked about today, we feel really comfortable that we can do that at $46 kind of break-even price that we've laid out. We aren't specifically targeting a specific yield or an absolute dollar number, but really more focused on maintaining that momentum in our operational programs and then focused on the cost control that we've outlined today. And then beyond that the free cash flow frankly is just going to fall out of that game plan.","Dave Hager","I think Ryan, our basic philosophy is to have a consistent measured approach to capital investment. We find that we generate the highest returns when we do not dramatically increase or decrease our capital spending. And so you can look for us and that's one of the strengths obviously advantages of having a strong balance sheet also allows you to weather fluctuations in commodity prices.","And so we \u2013 you can see us, we may flex it up and down slightly but we try not to do it too much because if you do you start losing returns. You become much less efficient. So you can look for us to stay measured in our approach on capital investment. And as Jeff said as free cash flow is generated above that approach, we see that available to return to shareholders.","Ryan Todd","I appreciate that color. And maybe a question on the PRB unit, a pretty significant increase year-on-year in activity. Can you talk about where you see those assets in terms of confidence level on development maturity as you move toward more of a development program there how you feel about in terms of how much you've been able to derisk and how you think that activity level may evolve in the next few years?","Dave Hager","I would say \u2013 Tony is going to give you the detail but the big picture is the Turner is moving into full development and we are appraising the Niobrara for potential full development in 2020. But Tony can lay more details on that.","Tony Vaughn","And that's right, Dave. Ryan, we're quite excited about the Powder River Basin position. We've been operating in the basin for quite some time and fully understand the subsurface of the basin. You recall that we expanded our position a couple of years ago and the team has done a really thoughtful job of derisking the Turner.","We've continued to manage our Turner appraisal process understanding spacing as Dave mentioned are now moving into the development phase of that. So very high confidence on the results that we've seen in the Turner, we also continue to run about a rig line associated with the shallower zones in department and the Teapot in there is a great filler for some of the Turner activity.","Those type of results have been outstanding. And I think if you looked at the operating reports on the detailed information there, we brought on about nine wells at the second half of December; came on a little bit late because we don't operating two rigs there. We did not have the ability to handle a dedicated frac fleet.","So it was deferred just a little bit, moved most of our new performance from those nine wells into January. But the well results were outstanding; fit right nicely into our expectations. As Dave mentioned, we're increasing our activity. We're at three rigs right now and by April we'll have the fourth rig running and we'll also have our dedicated frac fleet there.","And what that significance of that means in terms of the cost savings there, our technical team has done a really good job and they believe they can work about $1 million per well out of our costs simply by having enough of a relationship between the four rigs to keep the one frac fleet busy. So we're very optimistic about the development work we're doing there. What's also very intriguing to us right now is the work that we're doing in the Niobrara and we've reported on three outstanding wells in the Niobrara. Those are holding up really nicely fit well into our subsurface model.","We're continuing to appraise that in 2019. And in fact, on our Atlas East program, we're going to watch that develop in 2019. And by the end of 2019, if all this drills out as we expect to we'll be into development mode around the Atlas East portion of our base in there and have the capabilities to even increase rig count past that for Niobrara development.","And if you remember, the Niobrara is a source rock for the upper portion of the column there in the Powder River Basin. There were certainly behave more like a ubiquitous unconventional formation like we're used to prosecuting. So a lot of upside coming our way in the Powder River Basin.","Dave Hager","Ryan, I can tell you just a second just to highlight \u2013 step back and highlight. What I think is a very important point about the New Devon. And it's really showing in a series of three slides there in the operations report, not the one accompanying the \u2013 my comments, not the management commentary, but the operational report and Slides 4, 5, and 6. And Slide 4 shows that we have assets in four of the best U.S. onshore basins.","And we don't just have assets in four of the best U.S. onshore basins, we have \u2013 when you look at the acreage position, our acreage is truly located in the best parts of each of those four basins. And that manifests itself directly on Slide 5 with those well productivity results. And a little provocative in my comments there, but it is amazing to me that we're so transparent with everything.","We talk about base missteps we have at Showboat and the STACK and all that, but it just makes you wonder. I mean, we talked about that and the negatives there, but look at where we stack up. We are stacked up even including that at the top of the 90-day IP charts. So that is that's transparency and that's also showing that we're in the best parts of those basins. And then when you continue on Page 6, we have depth.","So we've got acreage in the best part of it and we also have depth in the best part of it. And that's why we are so excited about this New Devon because we think this positions us to compete at the top echelon of the U.S. onshore unconventional companies.","Tony Vaughn","Ryan, you're on the phone, this is Tony. I misspoke. It's not Atlas East, it's our western portion of our development called, Atlas West.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate all that color.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Bob Brackett","A question on the sale potentially of Barnett and Canada, Do you have any \u2013 have you been approached by buyers? Do you have any sort of notional bids on those yet? Or will those come out of a data room process?","Dave Hager","Those will come out of a data room process. We just hope to have the data room completed by \u2013 on Canada by the end of the first quarter; Barnett second quarter. And so that we'll get bids in.","Bob Brackett","Okay. And then a follow-up on the refrac question earlier for the Eagle Ford. Do you have a notion of the EURs of those refracs? And are those refracs included in your inventory of high-return locations?","Tony Vaughn","Bob, I'm just looking at some of the notes here. This would be about 150 MBOE to 200 MBOE per refrac.","Bob Brackett","And are those counted as inventory locations?","Tony Vaughn","No, they are not.","Bob Brackett","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. Sticking with the Eagle Ford, you talked about the refrac program and you also talked about stabilizing volumes by year-end and potentially growing in 2020. Is that mainly just a function of the three-rig program i.e. greater activity or beyond the refracs? Are there other measures that are contributing to that stabilization and potential growth?","Dave Hager","I think it would be primarily due \u2013 three rigs basically production plan in the Eagle Ford. And so the anticipation that we may have a fourth rig in the Eagle Ford which should be somewhat predicated on the success of the appraisal work in the Austin Chalk.","Brian Singer","The fourth rig would basically only come in if the Austin Chalk were successful in other words?","Dave Hager","Yes.","Brian Singer","Got you. Great. And one quick question with regards to the Barnett Shale. Would the transportation piece be a part of the sale? Or would you be retaining transportation or paying or having to settle on transportation contracts?","Jeff Ritenour","Yes, Brian, this is Jeff. That's still to be determined. We have worked through that with the potential buyer. I will point out to you though the MVC is obviously that we've lived with in the Barnett dropped off here at 2018. So you've seen a big step-up in the resulting cash flows as a result of that.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Dave and whole team there.","Dave Hager","Good morning, Charles.","Charles Meade","I appreciate the, I guess, your posture in all your comments today. You've got a good and a new story to tell. But I wanted to go back to a couple of your earlier responses in Q&A about the Canadian assets. And I recognize that you guys are going to be circumspect as you're in the sales process.","But I just want to make sure I understand what you do want to tell us. So you've said in your slides in and operations report, you say it's free cash flow above $50 WTI. But did I hear right that you expect the annual EBITDA in the range of $400 million to $500 million for Canada? And if so what is the implied WTI price in that assumption?","Jeff Ritenour","Charles, this is Jeff. Yes, the WTI price that we assumed in that is kind of a $55 oil.","Charles Meade","Got it, got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could go back and ask a question about those boundary Raider wells. And I recognize it's just two wells and you can't move a type curve based on it. But I'd go back to a few quarters ago when you said that's pretty outstanding wells in the STACK area.","And the story was there that you predicted that the wells will be more productive because there was \u2013 you anticipated a change in lithology. And I'm wondering if that was the case also with these Boundary Raider wells that you expected different lithology that would be more productive going in and how these wells, which are really outstanding wells \u2013 how they fit with your previous expectations?","Dave Hager","Yes. Well, maybe we have John Raines discuss it here a little bit more detail. I think we all anticipated to be good wells based on our understanding of the lithology and the thickness of the particular zones. We're targeting that we all think they're going to be as good as they were. I think they may have been a little bit of a surprise they were that good. But I think we do have a good handle for what's going on lithologically there.","And that's why we expect this next batch oil to be really strong. Now are they going to be as strong as those two wells or maybe not that quite strong but they'll be strong wells. So John you want to add to that?","John Raines","Yes. This is John. Just a touch of detail on that. We actually drilled the parent well in the Boundary Raider area back a few years ago and discovered the lithology. There's a bit of a structural high there. You've got some exceptionally clean sand in the Second Bone Spring. But the reality is as we marched east with our cat scratch fever program we don't have us much well control in the Second Bone Spring.","So for us to predict Boundary Raider like results would probably be a bit foolish, but like everybody said we expect big things from the cat scratch program and look forward to bringing those wells on.","Charles Meade","Thanks for that detail, John. And thanks, Dave.","Dave Hager","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Grigel with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Paul Grigel","Hi, good morning. What's the underlying PDP decline rate of the New Devon U.S. onshore business moving forward?","Jeff Ritenour","Hi, Paul we're pulling this number together right now, but directionally, it looks like to us with regards it's about 30% year one on a BOE basis and oil is going to be a little bit higher than that. So that's going to be for the New Devon. So that would exclude the Barnett and Canada.","Paul Grigel","Okay perfect. Thank you. And then I guess following up on the Powder River, you mentioned on the infrastructure not being an issue in 2019 as you move to four rigs. How should we think about either oil or gas takeaway or other logistical infrastructure items as you move maybe and later into 2019 or into 2020, should the Niobrara go into development mode as well?","Jeff Ritenour","Yes. This is Jeff, Paul. We don't expect to see any issues in the near term \u2013 excuse me, 2019, 2020 or 2021 from a transportation standpoint or takeaway standpoint.","Paul Grigel","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question is from John Aschenbeck with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","John Aschenbeck","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Wanted to follow up on your three-year plan and I apologize if I missed this, but I was wondering how we should think about the progression of free cash flow, specifically as we get into 2020 and 2021. I'm just wondering is it fairly ratable or if there's perhaps some lumpiness from one year to another. And then also I'm not sure if you have it in front of you but was curious what the progression of CapEx looks like over that time period as well. Thanks.","Jeff Ritenour","This is Jeff. Yes, the first two years are pretty comparable as you roll forward. 2021, you do see a move higher with the production growth that we expect and you'll see additional free cash flow as the cost savings really start to compound over that multiyear period. On a capital standpoint, it's relatively flat as well. You'll see some increase on a year-over-year basis from 2019 to 2020 and then from 2020 to 2021; 10% overall.","John Aschenbeck","Got it, got it. Really helpful. Appreciate that. Last one is a more of a point of clarification on your 2019 oil growth. Looking at your exit rate that's targeting 20% growth versus full year 2018, how should we think of that exit rate? Is it fair to think of that as a proxy for a Q4 average? Or is it more so a smaller snapshot of time?","Jeff Ritenour","We will probably consider that a snapshot in time. That's just trying to give you indicator of just the production momentum we expect heading into 2020. So not trying to imply Q4 there but clearly you'll see a pretty strong growth rate year-over-year, but probably not greater than 20%.","John Aschenbeck","Okay. Perfect. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra","Yes, hi. First question on Canada, how are you thinking about Pike in the asset sale? I guess as a full exit, so is the intention sort of recover the billion-ish invested in Pike to-date?","Dave Hager","Well, its full axis of Canada. So Pike would be included in that in whatever sales price we get.","Subash Chandra","Okay. And the capital allocation in the U.S., just a follow-up on the Eagle Ford and STACK, the completion phase in 2019 for STACK in the 80 90 wells, should we think of that sort of as a run rate going forward? And in the Eagle Ford, the refracs, do they stand on their own or are they part of a mitigation strategy against frac heads?","Tony Vaughn","Subash on the Eagle Ford question, a portion of these are stand-alone refracs but the portion of those part of the completion of a pad. So it'd be a pressure mitigation process.","Scott Coody","And Subash, this is Scott. With regards to the STACK activity levels for 2019, we're going to bring online a few more wells than what we drill. I think we're going to drill about 90 wells, and from a spudding perspective, order of magnitude maybe 10 less somewhere in that neighborhood. So I think that's the best way to think about the cadence of activity in the STACK in 2019.","Subash Chandra","Okay. And so no comment on 2020 and beyond? Or should we think about that program as being a run rate program beyond 2019?","Dave Hager","Subash, I think it's a little bit early to be looking at that. But right now we have thoughts that that would just be a good cash flow-generating asset and that activity would be somewhat consistent with our plans in 2019.","We're quite excited right now. I think we reported in some really good rates on the wells that are associated with the less dense space projects and that's showing to be really prolific and has not been built into our fuller modeling thought process, but for the most part be fairly consistent activity to 2019.","Subash Chandra","Right. Thank you for all the answers.","Scott Coody","I show that we're now at the top of the hour. We appreciate everyone's interest in Devon today. And if we didn't get your question, please not hesitate to reach out the Investor Relations team today, which consists of myself and Chris Carr. Once again, thank you for your time.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7066":["Devon Energy Corp.

Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you, and good morning everyone. As Scott mentioned earlier, Tony will cover fourth quarter results later in the call. My comments today will focus on our outlook for 2018 and the strategic direction of Devon over the next several years, which we have branded as our 2020 Vision.","However, before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to address a topic that we have received a lot of questions on, and that is why we have not authorized a share repurchase program. Let me be clear. As we generate more cash through our operations and asset divestiture programs, we will reward our shareholders through higher dividends and opportunistic share buybacks. However, our near-term priority is to use a significant portion of our large cash balance to reduce the debt associated with our upstream business.","Why is this our top near-term priority? With our world-class Delaware and STACK positions shifting to full development mode, it is absolutely critical that we possess a top-tier balance sheet in order to maintain consistent activity levels through all cycles. Commodity prices go up and down, but our plan to execute on a steadier and more measured development program through all cycles will optimize returns and value associated with our development programs.","And while we certainly could have authorized a couple billion dollar share repurchase program today and had our stock price positively respond to this type of announcement, it is not the correct move for Devon right now. Our business is performing at a very high level, and with the continuation of current commodity prices, coupled with imminent asset sales during 2018, I am confident in stating that there will be increasing shareholder returns this year.","Moving to slide 3. With our world-class assets in the Delaware and STACK shifting to full-field development, I can confidently state that Devon has reached an inflection point as a company. With our low-risk development programs focused in our top-tier U.S. resource plays, we expect to deliver a dramatic step change in capital efficiency while delivering attractive corporate-level returns.","In 2018, we plan to invest approximately $2.3 billion in our upstream properties with the majority of this capital concentrated on high-return developments in the economic core of the Delaware and STACK. This focused development plan allows us to bring online greater than 25% more wells than in 2017 for a very similar amount of capital investment. Additionally, this program is self-funded at our base planning scenario of $50 WTI pricing.","On a retained asset basis, our capital plans in 2018 are expected to drive U.S. oil production growth of roughly 14% compared to 2017. Importantly, the trajectory of Devon's U.S. oil production profile is expected to steadily advance throughout the year and exit 2018 at rates greater than 25% higher than the 2017 average.","I do want to be clear on this. We have no shortage of highly attractive growth opportunities within our portfolio and could definitely grow at much higher rates in 2018 if we chose to optimize top line production with our capital allocation. However, we are absolutely committed to doing business differently in the E&P space and we are optimizing our capital allocation to maximize corporate-level returns while delivering capital-efficient cash flow growth.","We fundamentally believe that a steadier and more measured investment program through all cycles is the correct strategy to efficiently expand our business and maximize Devon's valuation in the marketplace as opposed to pursuing maximum production growth in any one given year.","Turning to slide 4, while Devon's business outlook in 2018 is very strong, I am much more excited about the expanding profitability and improving returns our business is capable of delivering on a multi-year basis.","However, before I get into the specific performance targets associated with our three-year plan, I do want to cover the strategic principles that underline or underpin our business model and will guide our behavior over the next several years.","First, to maximize and steadily expand the cash flow of our upstream business, we will continue to deploy leading technologies to optimize the productivity of our base production wedge. We also will aggressively work to improve our per-unit cash cost to get the most value we can out of every barrel produced.","And while maximizing cash flow is a top priority, we are in a depletion business that requires significant reinvestment. Given this dynamic, continuous improvement and capital efficiency will separate the winners and losers in this highly competitive space. And at Devon, our ability to stretch every investment dollar further is one of our top competitive advantages going forward.","With our industry-leading multi-zone development techniques at the Delaware Basin and STACK, we are positioned to deliver not only dramatic improvements in capital efficiency, but also substantially increase the net present value of our acreage through improved recoveries and more efficient operations.","With our Delaware Basin and STACK assets rapidly building momentum and operating scale, we are committed to simplifying our asset portfolio by selling less competitive assets. While we'll not go into the details of which assets we are currently evaluating to sell, we will be patient and sell assets only at the right price and as market conditions allow to ensure we bring forward the appropriate value for our shareholders.","Another critical objective is to further improve our investment-grade financial strength. Our goal is to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.0 to 1.5 times and maintain the ratio in a sustained $50 WTI price environment.","As I touched on to begin the call, another very important strategic intent of our 2020 Vision is our commitment to returning increasing amounts of cash to shareholders. Jeff will provide more details on both our debt targets and the return of cash to shareholders later in the call.","Moving to slide 5, we expect the strategic principles supporting our 2020 Vision to advance several key performance targets over the next three years. Keep in mind, with these targets we're simply showcasing how we expect our business to perform under a flat $50 WTI and $3 Henry Hub price deck. As we all know, industry conditions will evolve, and when they do, we will recalibrate our actions to optimize returns and capital efficiency.","First and foremost, with this disciplined game plan, we expect to deliver fully burdened corporate-level returns in excess of 15%. In conjunction with these attractive corporate returns, we expect capital requirements over the next three years to be funded within operating cash flow at a $50 WTI price point. Under this scenario, our capital programs will drive oil production growth of greater than 25% annually in the Delaware and STACK, advancing our total U.S. oil production by around 15% per year over this time period.","In addition to growth in high-value production, another key component of our strategy is to enhance profitability through the aggressive improvement of our cost structure. By 2020, we expect a combination of lower operating costs, declining interest expense and an improved overhead structure to translate into per-unit cash cost savings of approximately 15%.","These cost savings, combined with strong oil production growth for the Delaware and STACK, will expand Devon's upstream business cash flow by more than 15% annually through 2020. Put another way, given our advantaged portfolio, we will be able to attractively grow our business on a sustainable basis at a flat price deck of $50 WTI pricing. We will also have tremendous torque to the upside at higher prices as well. At $60 WTI pricing, we would be able to generate $2.5 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next three years.","As we build critical mass in the Delaware and STACK, we also are working to maximize shareholder value by simplifying our asset portfolio. Given our resource-rich asset base, we see the potential to monetize in excess of $5 billion of noncore assets in a very thoughtful and measured fashion over the next few years.","Combining these asset sale targets with our free cash flow generation capability at $60 WTI pricing, Devon's total cash inflows in excess of our planned capital requirements over the next three years could range up to 40% of our current market capitalization. As this excess cash flow manifests itself during 2018 and beyond, I emphasize again, we will reward our shareholders through higher dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.","Moving to slide 6. Another positive initiative underway at Devon is the steps we are taking to further align our management incentives with that of shareholders. In 2018, Devon will incorporate two return-oriented measures into our compensation packages. As you can see on the slide, one measure will calculate cumulative returns on capital employed, while the other will calculate returns in our current drilling programs.","Both return measures will be burdened by all corporate costs, which include G&A, corporate capital, land and all other technology initiatives. Additionally, we are going to advance other shareholder-friendly initiatives in 2018 that would improve the transparency of our business results such as improved environmental sustainability reporting. I will provide updates on these initiatives in future calls.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Tony Vaughn for additional commentary on our operations. Tony?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. On slide 7, I'd like to begin my prepared remarks today by providing some additional context around our fourth quarter production results.","Our oil production shortfall for the quarter was primarily driven by oil volumes within the U.S. due to the timing of well tie-ins associated with non-operated activity in the STACK. In aggregate, these near-term timing issues limited our U.S. production by nearly 10,000 barrels per day of oil in the quarter. Two thirds of this volume impact was attributable to the timing of non-operated pad developments from multiple partners within STACK.","Importantly, this issue in the STACK is now behind us, with the tie-in of more than 50 non-operated wells in early January. The spike in non-operated activity drove our current daily rates in STACK to approximately 130,000 BOEs per day, an increase of greater than 10% compared to the fourth quarter average.","To be abundantly clear, the production shortfall in the fourth quarter was not related to reservoir performance or the pace of our operated well activity. In fact, in the fourth quarter, our operated well results were some of the best in Devon's 46-year history. Our top 30 operated wells in the quarter averaged initial 30-day rates of greater than 2,500 BOEs per day.","Combined with the ramp-up of volumes in the Delaware Basin in early 2018, the production from our two franchise growth assets is currently approaching the 200,000 BOE per day barrier and is on track with our plan to grow oil production by greater than 35% from those two assets in 2018.","Moving to slide 8. As we have talked about length today, the 35% plus growth we expect from our world-class assets in the Delaware Basin and STACK during 2018 is driven by our transition to full-field development. Importantly, the majority of this activity in the upcoming year will leverage our multi-zone development schemes in the economic core of the Delaware and STACK.","As you can see on this slide, with this leading-edge development concept, we have more than 10 multi-zone projects scheduled in 2018, with several of these projects already underway. Early results from this leading-edge development concept further support our conviction that this is the innovative approach with the best way to efficiently convert stack pay and cash flow and production.","On slide 9, at the Anaconda project in the Delaware Basin, our initial multi-zone development, we achieved capital cost savings of approximately $1 million per well compared to traditional pad developments. These cost savings were driven by the benefits of centralized processing facilities, faster drill times, completion efficiencies that reached up to 14 stages per day at this project. In addition to the $1 million per well cost savings, well productivity at Anaconda was also very strong. Average per well 30-day production rates at the 10-well Anaconda program reached 1,600 BOEs per day.","Overall, a great result for our first attempt, but we definitely expect to improve with future projects. In fact, an early example of this continuous improvement is that our second multi-zone project in the Delaware, the 11-well Boomslang project, at Boomslang, rig productivity reached nearly 1,400 feet per day, breaking the previous record drill time achieved in Anaconda by nearly 15%. Completion operations are underway, and we expect to have more positive news to report on Boomslang and several other Delaware projects in the next quarter.","Now turning to slide 10, initial results from our multi-zone work in STACK are also very encouraging. At the Showboat project, drilling operations for the 24-well program concluded in January, ahead of schedule, with average rig productivity exceeding 1,000 feet drilled per day. This represents a 30% improvement in drilling efficiency compared to prior leasehold drilling in the area, translating into an average savings of about $500,000 per well.","To the west of Showboat, our Coyote development project is also progressing. Drilling operations at Coyote have also shown positive results, with drilling times improving by as much as 25%, over the course of this 7-well project compared to historical single well activity in the area.","Completion operations at Coyote are currently ongoing, but our initial well from the Coyote development is now flowing back, achieving 24-hour IP of 8,200 BOEs per day, 8,200 BOEs per day, of which more than 60% of that is oil. This is by far the highest well productivity we have seen to date in the play. So as you can see, our full-field development work in both the Delaware Basin and STACK is off to a great start.","On slide 11, a key component of this strong execution that should not be overlooked or underestimated is the operational planning and supply chain efforts underway at Devon that are critical to ensure the certainty of services and supplies to deliver on our capital plans. While the service market is unquestionably tight right now, especially in the Permian Basin, our supply chain team has proactively secured rigs and pressure pumping services at competitive prices to execute on our capital plans in 2018 and 2019.","The multi-year development plans we have designed for each asset, along with a disciplined hedging strategy, allowed Devon the opportunity to secure long-term relationships at below-market rates with top providers.","On the drilling side of the business, we had the rigs we need under contract to execute on our 2018 program. In fact, we entered the year at around 20 rigs, and due to efficiencies associated with our multi-zone developments, we plan to gradually reduce our rig count to exit the year at about 16 to 17 rigs. While industry will see some increases in day rates and drilling-related services, our contracting strategy and efficiencies in the Delaware Basin and STACK are expected to more than offset this inflation. In aggregate, we will generate cost savings on the drilling side of our business through our improving efficiencies.","Another key area of tightness in the marketplace is pressure pumping. Within the Delaware Basin and STACK, we have largely secured our horsepower requirements in 2018, with plans to utilize seven dedicated crews. In addition to the raw horsepower, we have also have contracts in place for the majority of our sand requirements, water, diesel, chemicals and last-mile logistics in 2018. Our strategy of debundling completion services and efficiencies from our multi-zone projects will result in significant cost savings in 2018.","So overall, across all phases of our business, we have agreements in place for more than 75% of our total capital requirements during 2018. While we do expect industry service cost inflation to be somewhere in the mid to high single digits in 2018, we believe our efficiency gains in the Delaware and STACK are projected to more than offset these higher costs.","Another area that we have done a lot of good work on is with our marketing and flow assurance. We have firm transportation covering a significant tranche of our production in both the Delaware and STACK. And in Canada, we have basis hedges covering around half of our production at $15 off WTI. These attractive hedges are currently worth approximately $300 million.","Bottom line, with this good upfront planning work from our operations, marketing and supply chain personnel, we are well positioned in a tight market.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Tony. For my prepared remarks today, I'd like to discuss our financial priorities within the context of our 2020 Vision and highlight the next steps in the execution of our financial strategy.","As you can see on slide 12, we have tremendous amount of flexibility when it comes to our financial position. We exited the year with $2.7 billion of cash on hand and expect this balance to meaningfully increase in the very near future once we finalize our Johnson County divestiture in the Barnett.","With regards to Devon's capital allocation, our first priority is to fund our operational plans in the Delaware and STACK as these early-stage assets transition to full-field development. Growth in these assets will drive additional operating and capital efficiencies along with higher overall margins for the company. Importantly, we expect to fund both our maintenance and growth capital requirements for the company through 2020 within operating cash flow at a $50 WTI price deck.","Another key financial priority is to achieve and maintain peer-leading investment-grade financial strength. To this end, we have set a target leverage ratio of 1 to 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. With the addition of our Johnson County divestiture proceeds to our cash balances, we expect to reach the targeted ratio range early in 2018. Given our strong liquidity, we will begin utilizing a portion of cash on hand to tender for outstanding debt.","This absolute debt repurchase will reduce our go-forward annual interest expense and help us achieve the targeted 15% cash cost savings Dave mentioned in his opening comments.","We will finalize size and timing of our initial debt tender in the coming weeks, but I expect this initiative to reduce our absolute debt by as much as $1.5 billion during 2018. Beyond this initial debt repurchase, we will balance additional debt repurchases against our other financial priorities, but will remain committed to sustain our targeted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in a $50 WTI price environment.","Another critical component of our financial strategy is the return of excess cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From a dividend policy perspective, our goal is to sustainably pay and steadily grow the dividend. We are targeting a manageable payout ratio of 5% to 10% of our operating upstream cash flow at our base planning scenario of $50 WTI pricing.","In addition to the quarterly dividend, with excess cash from asset sales or a windfall from higher commodity prices, we expect to reward shareholders through opportunistic share buybacks or potentially a special dividend. We will provide more updates on this topic in the future disclosures as excess cash flow manifest in 2018 and beyond.","Shifting briefly to tax reform. The recent changes in U.S. tax law were favorable to Devon and have enhanced our ability to return cash to shareholders in the future. While tax reform did not materially impact our fourth quarter or full year 2017 results, the tax reform will positively impact our ability to repatriate foreign earnings back to the U.S. In the future, the free cash flow generated from our Canadian operations can be transferred tax efficiently to the U.S. to help fund our growing, high-margin asset base.","Outside of tax reform, we completed a legal entity restructuring in Canada in 2017 that will significantly reduce our current tax expense going forward. The tax reform and legal entity restructuring resulted in material entries to our deferred taxes, driving some of the noise you see in our effective tax rate for the quarter and year end.","And finally, I do want to recognize our accounting team here at Devon and their efforts on the conversion from the full cost accounting methodology to successful efforts. A lot of long hours and hard work went into making this change in accounting policy. We believe successful efforts accounting provides several benefits, including greater transparency into the financial performance and better comparability of results to peers.","Going forward, we expect the change to help us highlight the superior capital efficiency of our core assets. We have included a supplemental disclosure packet on our website that highlights the changes on a reported quarterly and annual basis for 2017 as a result of the conversion to successful efforts methodology.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott.","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. We'll open the call to Q&A now. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have any further questions, you can reprompt as time permits. With that, operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dave, I understand you don't want to be specific on potential asset sales, but I wonder if I could just ask you to opine a little bit on two things, where the Powder River fits in your development outlook. Because either it looks to us like we see we're going to get a core asset or it's been primed for sale, and I'm leaning towards the former.","And my second issue I guess, related to the same thing is, what's in the development outlook that you have, particularly in the Delaware, what is the strategic role that EnLink plays going forward? And I'm just curious whether EnLink is part of the $5 billion target potential asset sales over the next several years. And I've got a quick follow-up, please.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure, Doug. Well first off, it's very clear that the two key core assets for Devon going forward are the Delaware and the STACK play. We have positions there that are as good as anybody's, and we are having outstanding results and they are going to drive the growth in the company for the next few years. And they're going to take the bulk of the capital for the next few years.","Outside of that, we do still have some great assets in other areas, including the Powder that you mentioned, Barnett, Eagle Ford in heavy oil as well as the EnLink. Specifically in regard to the Powder, we like the opportunities we're drilling there in the Turner. We see some potential there in the Niobrara as well, and we're going to be drilling some wells there. We think there's a good growth opportunity.","But again, it's not going to reach the scale of the STACK and the Delaware. So I'm not going to get more specific than just to describe that obviously, the two most important are the STACK and the Delaware. And we understand the pluses and minuses and the optionality we have around all of the other assets in our base, whether it be E&P or a midstream asset. But obviously we have a lot optionality.","And the reason \u2013 I'm not trying to be coy on this at all \u2013 but we're trying to maximize the value that we can get. And market conditions change through time too. And so to announce a strategic decision one way or the other when we have a lot of optionality and market conditions change is really not in the best interest of the shareholders, we don't think. So we have that optionality there. There's a lot of ways we could accomplish this. And reiterate once again that when we do this, you can look for us to be authorizing a way to return value to the shareholders.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the detailed answer. I guess my follow-up is also on EnLink and the buyback, Dave. I mean, I guess you kind of answered the question with a 40% number, at least in terms of the scale of the cumulative cash flow you could generate. But when you look at EnLink specifically, you know I've been rabbiting on about this for a while, that the consolidation discount, the debt metrics, all the things that go along with that and the strategic role in the company, can you just lay out, is there an option where EnLink can some way be deconsolidated while still retaining the necessary strategic control you'd acquire? And is that 40% number in the three-year timeline a reasonable basis that we should be thinking about by share buybacks? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Hey, Doug. This is Jeff Ritenour. In regards to deconsolidation, from an accounting standpoint in our financials, as long as we maintain control, we're going to end up consolidating the financial results. So don't expect to see any near-term deconsolidation short of a relinquishment of that control, which would really be driven by not only a sell-down of units, but ultimately we'd have to be at a position where we weren't in a control position, whereas today we actually sit on the board as you guys know. So don't see a consolidation in the near term.","From an overall investment thesis as it relates to EnLink, as you've heard us say many times, we like the investment. The distributions that we receive on an annual basis amount to about $265 million, $270 million a year. That is a material portion that goes towards funding our E&P capital budget each year. So again, and on top of that, you have the operational synergies in our core areas.","So both in the STACK play and obviously in North Texas, the relationship we have with EnLink is important to us from an operational standpoint. In the Delaware, not so much today. EnLink's business is just starting to grow in the Permian, and specifically, with an overlap on our Delaware assets, there isn't significant synergies there today.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jeff, just to be clear, the control comes from the 2% GP, right? Does that mean the equity interest down to that level could be for sale? And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","You're exactly right. The control does come from our ownership of the GP. And really, it's a little more complicated than that, in that we own 100% of the managing member of that general partner, which deems control over the entity.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to focus in on the management incentive plan here, really a two-part question. Are there additional changes alongside the addition of return calculation that we should expect? And second, how should we expect to view the transparency element moving forward within those calculations?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Hi, yeah, be glad to answer that, Paul. First off, yeah, these are going to be incorporated in our balanced scorecard that we use for the pool for our bonuses. You will see us take out a couple of measures that we have in there currently, replace those with these. We're going to be taking out the reserve adds measure and we're going to be taking out a pre-tax cash margin per BOE measure that we had in there historically.","We view these as a couple of the most important measures that we'll have in that balanced scorecard. And although we haven't fixed the exact percentages of what these will represent of our balanced scorecard, I can tell you that typically our more important measures each represent 15% to 20% typically. So I would expect this to be 30% to 40% of the total calculation.","But I think even as important as the actual math behind this, I can just tell you from a focus standpoint within the company and the conversations that are taking place internally at the company, that this is something that we have always been focused on it, but there's no question that it has intensified dramatically in the last six months.","And I think you can see as far as the transparency, we tried to provide some transparency in our operations report as to what we are targeting. We will give you as much of the detailed formula as possible here of how we are going about calculating those measures. We can describe that now. It gets a little complicated, but we'll certainly put that in the proxy so that understand how we're calculating it. We've laid out what the targets are.","And then the one measure, the cash return on capital employed is going to be something that you could easily measure straight off the financial statements. And so you can check it yourself. The other measure, which is the all-in asset return measurement, that really goes to the productivity of the wells. And so we're not going to actually provide the details of every decline curve of all of the wells that we drill there, but it'll be tied into our reserve report, which of course is audited every year.","And so it's going to be a very comprehensive and very accurate measure that we feel will give as much transparency as anybody in the industry around these numbers. And again that includes all overhead costs associated with \u2013 all costs associated with the corporation.","So I know a lot of them like to talk about well-level returns of 50% or 100%. We understand that's a fallacy frankly to even be talking about those kinds of things. This is where we are getting and what kind of returns are we generating for the shareholders. That's what we think's the most important and that's what we're going to provide as much transparency as we can.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","No. That's great. That's terrific. I guess changing one to 2018 guidance as a follow-up, could you guys go through some of the thoughts as you laid out 2018 guidance on either the risking of the non-op guidance moving forward as well as risking on the timing of some of your large pads? You mentioned that they may be actually coming forward, but curious how those were risked within the 2018 guidance as well as the non-op productivity.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, I might kick this off and then turn it over to Tony for a little bit more details. But obviously we were disappointed with our miss on Q4 production guidance. And we took the guidance that was provided by the operators on those approximate 50 wells and that's what we plugged into our guidance. If you look at the STACK overall, it's a little bit more significant proportion of the STACK production. In other places I think around 23% or so our production is outside operated.","I can tell you that we have taken a much more conservative approach to forecasting non-operated volumes in 2018 versus 2017. I guess you can say we learned our lesson there. We thought we were being appropriate, but in hindsight, some things happened that we didn't know was going to happen with those non-operated wells. Again, the key is though that all of our operated activity is just doing outstanding, but we have taken a more conservative look to the outside-operated wells. And certainly, we've taken a measured approach to our expectations of when our operated large pads are going to come on as well, to make sure that we have confidence in the guidance. So Tony, you want to take it, more detail on that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, you bet, Dave. Just to add a little bit to what you said, I think if you look at our work on these multi-zone projects, we probably have roughly about 25 to 30 projects in some level of maturity between STACK and Delaware. We're working those plans. We have a very disciplined stage gate process that we have a lot of transparency into what we're doing. You can see in our operating report, we have about 10 or 11 of these projects that are going to be really impacting 2018 highlighted here.","And the way we kind of think about this is we're trying to keep the projects of the right size and scale to reap out the benefits of the efficiencies of doing these batch operations and (36:59) and utilizing centralized production facilities on a greater number of wells and pads. But we don't want them so large that we just get extremely lumpy like we might have seen when we were in the offshore business.","So we've done a pretty good job of scaling these appropriately. The one large one that you see in 2018 is the project that we're on right now, which is the Showboat project. And in there, we have gotten through the drilling portion of this project and saw some great cost savings there on the drilling side. It's hard for us to explain and convey the synergies and the efficiencies we have when we get when we can park rigs, three or four rigs on a location and just execute, execute and execute. And we're seeing it in spades here on the drilling side of the business.","I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're also starting to see this on the completion side of the business, where we're zipper fracking not just two wells, but three wells together. And our efficiencies on that side of the business are peaking and really, the cost per well on the facility side is going to be competitive and even improving over time as we continue to utilize all these facilities.","So we think this is the answer to go. I think we've commented in the past that we think the present value uplift here is 40%. We still believe that. And I think we're very pleased with the early work we've done on these that we've commented on where we are in the maturity of our ability to execute on these. So we're excited about this part of our business.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Paul, I might just add, too, that when we first rolled up our 2018 oil guidance as a company, our total number was really very, very close to the Street average that we had. What happened really more recently that caused it go a little bit below the Street average is in Canada, where we're going to be experiencing higher royalties because of higher WTI prices. And so we're going to be going from a, as you probably understand, the royalties out there are not based on WCS prices. They're based on WTI prices. And so based on that, we have taken a more conservative assumption on what we think royalties are going to average throughout the year and increase those from I think around 5% to 7% or so. And that's really caused our overall oil production guidance to fall a little bit I think below where the Street expectation was.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","No, that's all very helpful color, appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo from TPH. Your line is open.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Dave and team.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just a question in your release, you highlight the potential over the next few years to reduce your costs, cash cost by about 15% on the operating level. Could you talk about some of the initiatives you're working on and where those trends might start to show up in terms of the cost savings over the next years?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure, Matt, and that's going to be about $2 per BOE we anticipate reducing from that. Several different things that are going to contribute to that, one of which is obviously we're going to be growing our volumes. And so we do not see our G&A or our LOE really increasing as we grow the volumes, so the per-unit costs are going to be coming down. I can tell you we're taking very hard looks also at both of those areas as to make sure that we are really maximizing the efficiency there. And we have initiatives going on where we see scope to improve in both of those areas on an absolute basis as well.","We also anticipate the interest cost coming down. Jeff has talked about the debt paydown, and so that's going to also. So you put all three of those together, we see about a $2 per BOE improvement. I might also mention that we're all anticipating, as our mix changes, and we have more oil as part of our production mix in the future, we also see about $1 per barrel improvement on the revenue side at flat prices. That's just as we move to more oily mix in it. So all told, about a $3 improvement on the per-unit basis.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you. And my follow-up question is just in regards to the asset side of the business. Could you remind us your current acreage exposure in Ward County, south of the state line and just thoughts around capital allocation on that asset over the next years given the focus in the northern Delaware Basin at this point?","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Just as a rundown of our overall Delaware position, we have about 300,000 surface acres, and about 90% of that's north of the state line area in New Mexico. So directionally, on the Texas side, we have 20,000 to 30,000 acres. Not all of those are in the counties that you referenced, but mostly concentrated in that area.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","And if I can expand on your question a little bit here, we talked a little bit about the $5 billion of asset divestitures. And so the way that we look at that is we, and once we complete the Johnson County divestiture in the Barnett, which we frankly wish that had been done by the time of this call, but we think that is right around the corner from us here. And we're very confident that that's going to get completed here by the end of Q1. But once we do that, from our first phase of divestments, we'll have accomplished $1 billion or more of divestments.","We see about $1 billion more of incremental portfolio cleanup that we can do with only minor impact on production. And that could include areas, like you mentioned, Matt, as part of that overall strategy. And we are in the process of putting that plan together and finalizing that plan, and you'll see us executing on that plan in 2018. So that would get us up to about the $2 billion number. And then beyond that, that's when we really get into the more strategic decisions. And again as I've said, it's our primary growth areas are the STACK and the Delaware. And beyond that we'll look at everything else that makes sense on an opportunistic basis.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","My question about the non-op strategy. It sort of hits you a bit in the STACK, and you have some activity in the Eagle Ford that's non-op. Are you happy with your level of non-op or is that something you'd clean up over time?","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Bob, I think and generally we're happy. If you just look at the component of non-op to the company, on a total capital basis, that's certainly less than 10% of the company spend, and on a production basis it's about 12% if I remember the numbers right. It happens to be concentrated, a large portion of that OBO volumes happen to be concentrated in the STACK play and that's really the cause of this one miss.","And you know our STACK team, we really operate the OBO component much like we do the operated component, so we're very in tune with what our operators are doing. We have technical meetings with those. We try to participate in a lot of activity in STACK just so we have a ample library to help us on the operated side. We probably have the deepest inventory of data of any of the operators in the STACK. So there's some true benefits to us having that component in STACK and that's helping us.","The relationship that we've had with BHP is similar to what it's been over the past few years in the Eagle Ford. And there, we're operating a couple of rigs this year. The way the Eagle Ford tends to work is when we have frac crews in the field and working new completions, we see a dramatic boost in rate, and when we don't, you see a pretty steep decline on that. And we're prepared to put a couple of rigs back on the completion side of the business in the Eagle Ford.","So we saw a little bit of a decline moving from Q4 to Q1 on the Eagle Ford, but it's going to really bounce back up. So I think we're happy. We got good operators and we learn a lot from those operators.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, Bob, I'm going to ask Wade Hutchings, who manages all of our STACK business, to comment a little bit on that. But I think the thing that you're going to hear is we participate in more wells than any other operator in the STACK play. And so when you see the fact that our operated activity, we've not had any hiccups. All of our wells have really performed at a very high level. That's one of the benefits of having some outside, some OBO activity, that we get a huge amount of data from a very large amount of wells that are drilled in the play, and it allows us on our high working interest wells that we operate to really produce outstanding results. So Wade can you expand on that a little bit more detail?","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Happy to, Dave. I think the key thing I would note for us is the biggest value for our OBO investments in STACK has really been accelerated learnings. We're generally happy with the results that we see on a financial basis. We actually get to control which wells we elect into and wells that look marginal we'll stand out of. But ultimately we come back to the most critical thing we are trying to determine today in the STACK is the appropriate development scenario.","And you see that in 2018, that makes up the bulk of our own operated investments, trying to answer how many reservoir compartments are there in the Meramec and how many wells per reservoir compartment make up an ideal development scenario. We're really accelerating that learning because we're participating in multiple development pilots today with several of the key operators in the STACK. And so again, I'd just reiterate, we get a very large amount of value on accelerating our learnings for how we're going to move into full-field development in the STACK today.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's clear. Thanks for the details.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Morning.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Dave, my first question is with regard to the master development plan approach that you're taking with the BLM. Looks like you increased your approvals from 2 to 4 MDPs in the quarter. And if I read it right, there's an aspirational goal of up to 1,600 permits, which sounds like a multiyear inventory. I was just wondering, in particular can you discuss what commitment the BLM is making to Devon when it approves these MDPs and how it's going to shape your development.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure, be glad. And we have also in the room here today Rick Gideon. Rick handles all of our Delaware activities as well as our Rockies activities. And so I'm going to let Rick \u2013 he's eminently familiar with all this and I think he'll give you a more thorough answer than I will. So Rick?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you, Dave. When we take a look at these MDPs, the overall plan is so that we can get permits not just on subsurface, but surface right-of-way, takeaway, battery, et cetera. So what we can do is cover the NEPA, the surface area all at one time. In doing this, it helps the BLM to be able to do more permits in a timely manner. So we work very closely with them, have a very good relationship. Once you have that approved, it then works on to the APD. Upon approval, the commitment from the BLM by statute is 30 days after we get those approved.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So then really shouldn't think of this in terms of being like a multiyear thing. It's more maybe like an annual thing that's going to roll from year to year, and then when you get the approvals from BLM, you'll decide which ones you want to move on and which ones not. Is that sort of the way it works?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, we're always prioritizing our asset, so the MDPs you will see are in the prioritized portions of our field, the best parts of the best rock. When we plan, we do plan for these multi horizons. And as we find out more information, you could see some minimal change to the drilling plan on whether a certain horizon is included, how many wells per section. But as we go into the planning for right-of-way, for takeaway, for battery, we plan for success. And so you'll see some changes within each of those MDPs. But we're prioritizing the best parts of our field.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, well yeah, that's helpful. My other question is using Anaconda as an example, but I mean you could refer to any of your major projects, Boomslang, Seawolf, whatever you like. You developed 10 wells in three landing zones. You said that centralization created all kinds of efficiencies, and it saved $1 million a well. What I'm trying to get a vision of is things like how many more wells and how many zones do you expect to drill in Anaconda in the future and in what size batches? I'm trying to get a sense of how you balance between the multi-zone development advantage that you've talked about while not overcapitalizing the project infrastructure.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Rick's going to handle that question again, so.","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","As we build these batteries, we're planning, and you may hear us utilize a term, drill-to-fill, and I'll utilize this both for the Delaware and the STACK. As we come back, we can reutilize that battery for the rest of the wells in that section. Depending on where it's at, when you take a look at an Anaconda, obviously we can finish the Leonard. We've already developed the Bone Springs in that area. But as we come back to these different independent zones that are not dependent or sharing the same pressure regime of some of these, we can reutilize that battery in the same section or even sections next to that section when we come back and drill. So you'll see even more use of that centralized battery as we move forward.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So the point is, the infrastructure is not necessarily just tied to the one project that we hear about, but it might be able to be parasitized in a useful way to (51:44)?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think that's the way to think about it. If you look at it on a map, these developments that we're doing, there are still a lot of areas immediately around these developments that are not yet developed. And so this infrastructure can be used as we develop those other areas as well.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave, to you and your team.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Morning, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask a question, and I apologize if someone else touched on this, but I may have missed it. But I believe Tony talked about this 8,200 barrel a day well at Coyote. And I wonder if you could go back over, talk about some of the specifics of that well. Presumably, it was a long lateral, but if you completed it any differently and how that result fit versus what you were expecting kind of pre-drill or pre-completion.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","No, nobody else talked about it. We could have four or five more questions about it if you want, but no, it's obviously a great well but we're going to have a lot of good wells out here. But, Wade, do you want to talk about it a little bit more?","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure, happy to. So, Charles, this well that we're referencing is the first well in our Coyote development project that has come online. It is actually very close to another well that we released results on in fourth quarter, the Faith Marie well. That well ended up with a 30-day IP of around 4,700 BOE a day. Again, the 8,200 BOE per day is just a 24-hour IP, but very encouraging results. It's in the kind of northwest part of the Meramec play. The target in that area is in the lower Meramec. And frankly, what we're seeing there is just excellent reservoir properties. And so we look forward to the rest of the Coyote wells coming online, and then you'll see other projects of similar size come online over the next one to two years in that area.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you for that detail. Am I getting the right message, that if you view the big driver being excellent reservoir properties in the area, that this is more likely to be representative than an anomaly, at least for this pad?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Well let me, I'm going to change \u2013 answer that and start off an answer and Wade or Tony can chime in a little bit here, too. That this Meramec is a little bit different than some of your unconventional plays, and it has some conventional porosity and permeability. And so you have to think about when it has that, that you may actually be able to increase your EUR and drill less wells to recover a similar amount of hydrocarbons than you originally anticipated.","So we're going to find areas out there such as this, where I think our well density is actually going to be a little bit less than we maybe originally anticipated. Extremely highly productive wells, but we're going to have higher EURs also. And so from a capital efficiency standpoint, that's a really good news story. But you have to think about that a little bit differently than you may in some of the shale reservoirs where you probably may not have the opportunity to increase your EUR as much when you see the interference between the wells.","So, Wade, you want to expand on that a little bit? Because that's I think a concept that's really important. Because sometimes when we hear people say, okay, we're going to develop this on four wells per section rather than six wells per section, people may look at that as a negative. Well, in some areas it may be. But here, it may actually be a positive because you're going to recover a very similar amount of hydrocarbons, just have to drill less wells.","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think I would expand on that by noting the team here at Devon has mapped each one of these reservoir targets across the Meramec all across the play. And they do change their reservoir quality in a geographic sense. And so as we have been appraising the field over the last couple of years, that's what we've been trying to determine, is where are the best reservoir quality in each of these potential landing zones. We still got a little bit more of that work to do. But in the core of the play, we feel like we've done a good enough job to identify which zones have the best reservoir quality.","And then the next question is how to most optimally develop each one of those zones. Some of those may take a lower well count per section than others because of the phenomenon that Dave described. We ultimately are seeking to get the most return out of every one of these sections, and ultimately determining the precise number of wells per layer that we want to invest in.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Charles, just to add a little bit of a high-level thought process to you. We've been involved in 5,000 Barnett wells. We've been involved in probably 600 or 700 Eagle Ford wells. We've talked to you about the continued optimization in the Woodford after 850 wells. So this is our business. And we try to core up and get a blocked acreage position and try to get as much data and science as we can so we can, as Wade said, optimize on value. And so this is a great storyline that you see an advantage for Devon, is just these large contiguous blocks of acreage we have that are in the heart of these plays.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Dave, Wade and Tony, that's helpful color from all of you. And I agree that a lot of people's instincts goes the wrong way. You'd rather drill one well and get the EUR from the whole section. But that seems to get lost some time.","Last thing, or the one quick follow-up. I don't mean to belabor this point, but the 50 wells outside operated that got delayed, just curious if there's maybe a little more color you can add. Is that just one operator? Because it really seems like a remarkable contrast to your operations in the STACK, and I guess what I guess I'm trying to confirm or disconfirm is the idea that this might be something that's emerging out of a traffic jam in the play or something like that.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","You know Charles, I would not read this as a systemic issue for the play. This happened to be on five or six large projects in the play from some of the more competent operators in the play and it was varied. It just wasn't one operator. And what you see the different operators doing is, Wade was really describing, is collecting a lot of data so some of these projects probably got slightly deferred because of data acquisition.","Some of these projects, the operators work really well here together and do our best not to bash offsetting wells. So when we have completion operations and one of our sections offset, operators will understand that and we'll alter their operations. So there's a little bit of this that we're all working together to try to maximize value. So I wouldn't read this as a systemic issue. I think actually is a pretty positive issue. Just happened in this particular 50-well program is just right at the quarter borderline. If it happened a little bit earlier in the quarter, we wouldn't even be talking about it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful color, Tony, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning guys, and thanks for taking my question. Just looking at and talking about the $3 a barrel cash margin expansion. Wanted to check something that your guidance doesn't include things like the Barnett asset sale, and that could be, asset sales could be an additional cash margin expansion beyond what you already detailed.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Absolutely.","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, we have not modeled in any divestitures into the forecast that we laid out.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Perfect. And you did say you could buy back up to 40% of your market cap?","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","No. I think in Dave's commentary, what we were suggesting was the cumulative cash flow that we could develop over that three-year period, married with proceeds from the divestitures would equate to essentially 40% of our market cap.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, cool. Thanks guys.","Operator","I'll now turn the conference back over to our presenters.","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","All right. We're now at the top of the hour.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you, Michelle, and good morning everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our operations report and management commentary at devonenergy.com, as today's call will largely consist of questions and answers. Also on the call today are Dave Hager, President and CEO; Tony Vaughn, Executive Vice President of E&P; Tom Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and a few other members of our senior management team.","Finally, I'd remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call will contain plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates which are forward-looking statements under US securities law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. For a review of risk factors relating to these estimates, see our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent 10-Q filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone.","The second quarter saw Devon deliver another high quality performance, continuing a trend that has generated top quartile results for our shareholders for the past several quarters. Before we jump into the Q&A, I would like to highlight a few key messages I would hope you would take away from our earnings materials.","First, as many of you know, I assumed the role of President and CEO August 1, and I want to be clear, the overall strategy that has led to Devon's recent outperformance remains unchanged. We will continue to operate in North America's best resource plays, deliver superior execution and maintain a high degree of financial strength.","As you can see from our second quarter results, Devon's premier asset portfolio continues to achieve significant operational improvements. Our three most active plays, the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford and the Anadarko Basin all delivered outstanding well performance that exceeded type curve expectations with substantially lower well costs and reduced operating expenses. We expect this outstanding operational performance to continue. Our technical teams are laser focused on getting the most out of our advantaged asset base with superior execution. This unwavering pursuit of excellence means we will continue to improve drilling times, maximize value per well with industry-leading completion designs and optimize base production with best in class field operations.","Importantly, we are keenly focused on maintaining our strong balance sheet and we have the flexibility in our capital programs through scalable operations, minimal exposure to long term service contracts, no long term project commitments, and negligible leasehold expiration issues to do just that.","Additionally, our advantaged capital structure is enhanced with the unique optionality EnLink provides with distributions approaching $300 million annually and the potential for dropdown proceeds. Given these benefits, we believe that in the current commodity price and service cost environment, we can deliver growing oil production in 2016 compared to 2015 exit rates, while spending within total cash inflows.","So in summary, we are pleased with the way Devon is positioned to successfully weather the current environment and prosper in the future. Undoubtedly in the E&P business, you need great assets, outstanding operations and a strong balance sheet to deliver sustainable long term growth and differentiating returns for investors. With Devon, you have all three of these winning qualities. With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Thanks, Dave. To ensure that we get as many people on the call as possible, we'd ask that you please limit yourself to one question with an associated follow-up and with enough time at the end, you can reprompt and we'll additional questions from the participants. So, Michelle, with that we're ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Another strong operations update today.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","First, you've reiterated your full-year crude production outlook, but there are a few moving pieces. And I guess first, what drove the decision to dial back the Eagle Ford, given what must be strong economics at the strip, and what would you and your partner need to see to either complete some of those DUCs you're building or kind of add rigs there? I have a follow-up, please.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Evan, this is Dave. I'll take a stab at that. Tony may want to add some things to it. Directionally, well first off, our well performance is just outstanding. We continue to see outstanding well performance on the capital program and outstanding economics on that program. If you'll remember back at the end of 2014, we had temporarily increased from five to nine completion crews and we jointly agreed with BHP that that was a temporary measure to draw down the inventory and then after that point, we would reduce the completion crews. And certainly in the current commodity price environment, and with some draw down in inventory, we felt that was appropriate.","So directionally, we have a great partnership with BHP. We discuss a lot of things technically. They might have reduced the completion crews and they have the ability to do that the way our agreements are written that they might have reduced the completion crews a little bit further than we have, taking it down to one crew. Directionally, we agreed with the reduction, but they were trying to manage their total cash flows as a company when making that along with making a little bit of a call, I believe, on commodity prices. And so that was really the decision that was made. It had nothing to do with the quality of the opportunity. The well results are absolutely outstanding. And I think we'll continue to see adjustments in rig activity and the completion crews in the future. So, Tony, do you want to add anything to that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","No, I think you summed it up very well, Dave. I think the one thing I would add is just the more our technical team has an opportunity to look at additional data through the work that we're doing in both Lavaca County and DeWitt County, both in the upper and the lower Eagle Ford, we continue to grow the resource base. So our expectations of the property are essentially growing. The wells, as you can see from our quarter-to-quarter reports, are just as prolific. In fact, if you look at all the public data, you're going to find that the BHP\/Devon combination is really delivering the best-in-class well results that we have in the industry right now.","So I think it's all about pace of activity, and Dave summarized pretty well that we just dropped that pace down. And we'll continue to hover at the five or six drilling rigs for this point and probably running from about one to three frac crews as we go forward. That's just the overall plan that we'll have for the second half of the year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And if I could, on a second question, you guys have reported another round of efficiencies achieved in the second quarter, 10% to 20% compared to the first quarter. Oilfield service prices appear to be coming down faster than you planned at the start of the year. So can you just talk about what's happening to the resulting savings? Does your reiteration of upstream CapEx and increased EUCs tell us there might be downside to that full-year CapEx, or how are you thinking about that relationship? Thanks.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'd say the bigger impact, Evan, we don't see a lot of variation in what the CapEx will be for the remainder of this year. I think the bigger impact will be as we have a full year of those cost savings and then 2016, what benefit that's going to provide to us. And so you look at that and the CapEx savings we're going to have from the cost reductions. Then there are some other factors also that if you look at our, we can take the spending down in Canada probably by around $500 million or so. We will not have any activity essentially probably next year in the Mississippian or the Southern Mississippian, Midland Basin, Wolfcamp, some other plays. We had great economics because we're essentially being carried on a large amount of the well cost. But once we're beyond the carry, we won't have any money we'll be spending there.","So you put all that together and where we have an E&P capital spend this year of $4 billion or a little bit over, I tried to make the comment there in my opening remarks that you could see that with the current strip that we \u2013 the cash flow that will be generated by that, plus the anticipated cash flow from any EnLink dropdowns, we are confident we'll be able to grow our oil production in 2016. And that's obviously the vast majority of the margin that we generate as a company.","So there are a lot of positive factors working that we're going to be able to significantly reduce the capital requirements. I know there's some concern out there that when our hedges roll off, what impact is that going to have on the company. And we're trying to address that with you and give you some directional things to think about there that we have confidence we can continue to grow our oil production, even when these hedges roll off, because of the factors I mentioned.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's real helpful, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess just following on from Evan's question, some growth at the strip, but if you truly went to, if commodity prices were awful, to maintenance levels, can you give us a sense next year of what that would be? Have you done that calculation?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","We have all the flexibility. It depends on the definition of awful, I guess you'd say. Because we obviously calculate our cash flows at all sorts of various commodity prices, including those below which we're currently seeing on the strip. I think the key thing is, we have all the flexibility in the world to adjust our capital however we want because essentially all of our acreage is held by production. We have no long-term projects we're committed to, no deepwater, no international, no heavy oil projects we're further committed at this point. We're just wrapping up Jackfish 3 and we don't have very many long-term rig commitments. So we can adjust our capital spending. And I think when you look at the combination that Devon provides of tremendous capital flexibility, some of the premier assets in North America, strong balance sheet, and the strong execution that we're consistently demonstrating every quarter, I think it's a unique combination in the industry.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Totally separate question then. Just on the Delaware obviously you're with the new completions and the higher proppant loads, you're increasing the IPs very strongly. You've also got a whole lot of downspacing that you have to do, testing different layers within each of the different zones. So I appreciate it's a little bit early, but the EUR feels like it should be rising. Is that an expectation that we should have given the performance that you have across the basin thus far, particularly in the basin?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Ed, I think the EURs are increasing as we continue to develop. And we're doing a lot of work in the southern portion of Lea and Eddy County, which is really I think some of the best inventory we have in our portfolio. You're starting to see those characterized on the IPs, and we continue to really outperform on those type wells that we deliver. So we really have got a great understanding now, I believe, of the relationship between frac design and size, not that we're done with improving the recipe, but we've got a great relationship between the frac design, the resulting IPs, EURs, and most importantly the returns. And that's really why we are moving our completion designs back to about the 1,500 to 2,000 pound per foot range because it affords us the most improved rate of returns.","Also, our work in the northern portion of Lea and Eddy County, we're derisking and really trying to set up some development work that will be ready for us in 2016. We're starting to improve that design for those fracs. And on a well-by-well basis, that's continuing to improve as well. So I think what the group is doing right now is we have a pretty good understanding about proppant loads and what that does to our completions. But we're not done. We're still trying to improve upon our frac fluids, the spacing links and the clusters and all the various things that go into a frac design. So we'll continue to see I think EURs improve and returns improve.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, good morning and congrats on another good quarter. So thinking about 2016, I'm going to go back to that. Obviously, this isn't a revelation that the Street bear cases, you guys aren't going to be able to grow as fast in 2016 as some of your peers. One, I guess how would you address that? And two, you talked about being able to grow within cash flow. What type of limits or maybe a better way, what type of goalposts or framework are you thinking about yourselves and at the board level as far as how you want to look at 2016, given where the strip is at right now?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","We have always thought that it was important to have a strong balance sheet. And we're going to continue to believe that that is important and certainly in these times of uncertain commodity prices. So directionally, we tend to think of our capital spending has to be within the total cash inflows that we anticipate for the company. So that would be both our operational cash flow plus any EnLink distributions and any dropdown proceeds from EnLink, such as the access pipeline or the new, the other new, the NGPL line that we highlighted in the operations report.","So that's directionally where we start off the discussion. We obviously will then look at the programs and see if there is any reason to deviate in a positive or a negative way from that. And we have the flexibility to do that given our strong balance sheet. But that's the starting point of the discussion. And I think it's important to remember that we did, our growth rate may not be quite as high next year, but remember we did, enjoyed great benefits of this in 2015 that others didn't, so we're starting from a much larger base. Don't forget that.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","The absolute base is higher because we have had such tremendous growth in 2015. So when you look at it at a two-year rate, you may get a little different answer.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, no, and I'm with you on that. And as far as balance sheet metrics, and I talked a little bit with Howard about this last night, but are you guys thinking, is there debt-to-cap, self-imposed debt-to-cap? I know in the past you've gotten, I think the word Howard used is antsy when you start to get into the high 30%, low 40s. Is that still the game plan? I know you said within cash flow, but I'm just trying to think of different scenarios under different pricing scenarios.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think Tom Mitchell, our CFO, would probably be the best person to talk to about this. Tom?","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","David, there is a perception that our debt level would stay the same but the metrics would blow out next year and that's just not really happening with what we're seeing in the cash flows and in our ability to manage it. There's no question that it moves up, but we're not alone in that and we don't disproportionately move up within the peer group as you go into next year on that metric. So to some degree, there is some misperception and I would just highlight what Dave mentioned. There is incredible flexibility with our EnLink investment that many don't enjoy right now. So I guess I would leave it at that.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, I appreciate the commentary. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rowe from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to get a sense for when you all think that you and BHP will decide on the right level of activity to pursue in 2016 in the Eagle Ford? And I guess I just want to understand your level of certainty there and if that lower activity levels do sustain into 2016, what could that mean for your views on the operated level of activity in the Delaware Basin?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","This is Tony. I'll just reiterate some of the points that Dave made early on with our relationship with BHP. BHP is in the same boat that all of us are in, so they're trying to manage their cash flow as a company. It's difficult for me to project what will happen in 2016, but I think we've got a lot of flexibility there. We've proven that we can operate as much as 15 rigs and nine frac crews in DeWitt County. And we also can show that the well performance has improved over time and the resource base is growing. So the development plans are poised for acceleration when the business environment is ready for that to occur. So we'll just have to get through the third and fourth quarter and see where we're at, but the asset base is still top tier in North America.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","I'd also point, I'd like to just remind you that we've quantified the upper Eagle Ford Marl. We've characterized that with our delineation work in Lavaca County, which is really not even the sweet spot of the upper Eagle Ford Marl. That thickens as we go into DeWitt County. So we think there are some growing resources with commercial returns available to us. We also think the staggering our wells in the lower Eagle Ford will both improve recoveries and provide additional resources. So we're continuing to work on that and that will be incorporated into our plans as soon as the business climate improves.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Michael, just to, I think we are also asking that question. Just to be clear, we do not have a shortage of opportunities. We have a wealth of opportunities given where that are still economic in the current price environment. So that if you look fundamentally, the two things that we look at when we decide how much to invest is, first, what are the returns on these opportunities. And make sure that we can generate returns well in excess of the cost of capital, and then second, how much do we want to spend given what our cash flow is.","And so we have tremendous flexibility. If there's a little bit less program, and I'm not saying it's going to be, but there's a little bit less program in the Eagle Ford, we can easily ramp up activities in other parts of our portfolio. So we have tremendous flexibility about how we spend and where we spend our capital.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Very helpful, thanks on that. I guess last question just relates to your revised 2015 capital guidance. This time you cut corporate and midstream capital. I guess my question is, are there more opportunities to cut costs like this heading into 2016 to limit some of those fixed cost obligations, or maybe non-productive capital that could be deferred to the future time periods? Thanks.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well we're always looking and we've highlighted how we're continuing to reduce well costs. And so we've given what we think is our most accurate guidance given the information that we have right now. But there's always opportunities to do better, so.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Subash Chandra from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning. BHP's decision aside, how would you compare the relative economics of DeWitt County and say in the Bone Springs Basin or maybe some emerging opportunities in the Delaware Sands? And then I have a follow-up, thanks.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","When I look across our portfolio, we update our well economics across our portfolio routinely. And when we compare those, probably the top areas that are performing are DeWitt County and the basin portion of the second Bone Springs. Those are probably the best returns that are equivalent to each other. Those are the best returns that we have in our inventory. We have additional high returns that we're seeing in the Powder River Basin and the Cosner-Parkman. And we're still having positive returns, very competitive returns in our Anadarko business unit in both the Woodford and the growing Meramec play. So I would probably characterize the basin portion of the Delaware Basin and DeWitt County very similar.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And my follow-up is, the Access Pipeline is a go-forward plan on Pike. Does that influence the valuation of Access in any way?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","It would influence the valuation of Access, as you might imagine, to some degree because it would be the anticipation of (25:58) at some point in the future from that. Now there are ways you may be able to address that and how we actually do the dropdown, but it could have some impact. Tom, do you want to add something to that?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I do want to add to that. It would impact it near term from a cash perspective, but that's the only way out of there. And the way this works, you're going to come up with some a rate, a fee rate, that your present valuing to come up with your sales value. So it would be considered. It just wouldn't necessarily come next year or it would be a contingency that would be out there. So the value is still there and it would be agreed to in any transaction that we did.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe a follow-up on the Bone Spring wells. The latest batch in the second quarter, very impressive results. Can you talk a little bit about maybe potential drivers of the results? Was there any change to completion or is it the type well, the specific location of the geography, landing zone improvement, and any reason why this type of performance wouldn't be sustainable going forward?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","If you're asking about the second Bone Springs, I think we just continued to optimize and we're really trying to core up and offset some of our best wells. So we're drilling the next best well. Not doing much appraisal work. We're trying to stay focused and drive margins and oil growth. So we have modified the completion designs as we've discussed and that has been really highly centered on proppant loads. But we're also, we probably have about 7 or 8 different designs across the Delaware Basin and those are all customized based on the portion of the basin that we had, the type of rocks that we have. And so I think we just continue to refine that in a very granular fashion.","I'd also like to comment about thinking in the last quarter, we commented on our well comm center here, which is our 24x7 operating center. That largely started out being dedicated to our drilling rigs and tremendous efficiencies on our drilling rigs. And some of that is really highlighted here in the operating report. But we've moved that into the completion space now. So we've got full coverage of our well center 24 hours a day on all of our frac crews that we're working right now. So there's a lot of attention to detail there. The non-productive time is grossly being diminished. A lot of the emphasis around the way we flow wells back, that's a science in itself and we've had a lot of learnings from some of our older plays like Cana-Woodford, that we've incorporated both into the Woodford and now into the Delaware Basin. So we feel like we're driving top tier execution just through a more focused granular approach to our business.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then maybe a follow up in the Anadarko Basin. I guess a couple of parts. Meramec versus Cana, looks like you're allocating more in near term to the Meramec. Is this reflective of rates of return or just reflection of controlling CapEx as Cana drilling is ahead of schedule? And then maybe broadly in the Anadarko, should we expect to continue the acceleration? Have the rates of return improved enough that we should expect additional acceleration into 2016? It looks like one of your partners is talking about doubling a rig count. So how should we think about capital trends there in that basin?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think the returns are very competitive in the basin in general. We've got a lot of repeatability in Cana. You've seen us decrease our well cost from $8.5 million, probably about a year ago, to the low $8 millions in the last call and now those are being driven down towards $7 million per well. The IP and EUR performance in the Cana-Woodford are continuing to grow. Probably the best pad that we brought on historically in Cana was this quarter in our Haley pad. So the Cana-Woodford project continues to outperform and continues to improve quarter by quarter. So we're extremely pleased with that, and if you recall, we've got a long list of opportunities there that we'll continue to prosecute on.","So really the way we describe the Meramec play in this particular report, we're finding that all the IPs and the well costs are very similar to what we have in the Woodford. It's got a slightly improved oil content so the margins are a little bit better than in Cana. As you know, it's a less mature asset than the Woodford is. So we're really not trying to divert or reallocate capital away from the Woodford. We're really trying to grow understanding of the Meramec so in 2016 we can come back with a very thoughtful development plan that will effectively prosecute both the Meramec and the Woodford combined. So the returns are good in the Meramec. They're not measurably higher, but they are a little bit better. But we're going to approach 2016 with a combined development plan for both horizons. And that's really what you're probably hearing our partner talk about as well as us.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sameer Uplenchwar from GMP Securities. Your line is open.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Good morning, guys, and congrats on a good quarter, a couple of questions. The first one is on the Permian, basically the Delaware. I'm just trying to understand how further along are you on announcing the grand plan for the Permian. When you got into the Eagle Ford, you said you were going to be at 140,000 BOEs per day. We can see a path to getting to 140,000 BOEs per day, in fact even higher than that with 5,000 locations, multiple stack pays. How much further do we have to go before we get an idea regarding how big this play could be as it relates to Devon, and how quickly can you get there? I'm just trying to get some color around that.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a good question, Sameer, and I'll tell you what we've been focused on, as we've talked about in previous calls, is really trying to generate high returns. And the highest return in our stacked opportunity of horizons we feel like is a second Bone Springs. It's very repeatable. We're growing a little there. You can see we had an outstanding Q1 and Q2 in the second Bone Springs that drove that oil growth. We are continuing to watch industry delineate the Wolfcamp. All that activity in Loving County is moving right into our acreage position and we're getting more comfortable with that. We've talked about that being a little bit more costly and a little bit more gassy, slightly less returns, but we're getting a good understand of the Wolfcamp.","Same thing for the Leonard, we're watching our industry competitors derisk around us. We're feeling pretty good about that, but again, we don't feel like that offers the same returns per well that we're seeing in the Bone Springs. And I think in this call we highlighted several wells that we just drilled and completed in the Delaware Sands, and some of that appraisal work that we've done in the last couple of quarters we found a new landing zone in the Delaware Sands that is much more prolific than it was before. So we've talked about this D-Sand. We were able to put on nine wells, all very repeatable, and averaged over 1,000 BOEs per day from that particular horizon.","So what that all means to us is that coupled with the different pilot tests that we've described in the Delaware Basin, all that information is being moved into a full development concept. And so we're coupling the optimum surface design for a multi-stacked area like this with the optimum subsurface design. In 2016, we're going to come out and have a full development plan for all horizons that we think will increase the returns of these projects even greater than what we have done just with our pad work, mostly centered in the second Bone Springs.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Got it, thank you. Thanks for the color. On the maintenance CapEx for 2016, I know this has been discussed a lot on the call. But I'm trying to figure out from a numbers perspective. We can see like $1 billion saving year over year just by getting like the Pike strat wells and the JV capital. If you remove all that, we can get about $1 billion less. So, if I'm thinking about flat year-over-year numbers, is $3.5 billion the right number? Is it $2.5 billion? I'm just trying to understand from a spending perspective. Where do you see from a Q4 2015 to a Q4 2016 exit-to-exit flat level?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, Sameer, let me try to clarify that. We are very confident that we can grow our oil production with a capital spend of between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. Now we are not as focused on the natural gas side, so there would be some decline on the natural gas side. But on the oil, which generates the vast majority of our revenue and the vast majority of our margin, we are confident we can grow our oil volumes at a spend between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.","The other thing that's continuing to go on too that I didn't even mention is just the efficiencies we're getting that Tony has been alluding to in his answers to the various calls here, which is driving higher productivity in each of our plays. And so that's the other thing that's an important factor in here and is driving that conclusion.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my questions, just some more follow-ups in the Permian. Certainly the performance was outstanding this quarter. It sounds like you're obviously evaluating development plans in the future for this. And I guess my two questions would be I guess first, a little bit more on how fast you can grow in the Permian. Can you discuss? What are the key bottlenecks that you're looking at, at this point in time on the infrastructure side? And then the second question is, when you look at all those various formations that you have opportunities on in the Permian, how does that development do you think happen? Is this amenable to big well pads with multiple horizons and wells on it?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think the second part of your question, we historically and the industry has historically talked about pads enough size for two to three wells, and I think what we would contemplate is probably eight to nine wells per pad. We would contemplate simultaneous operations much like you see in offshore international type environments, perhaps having frac centers off the pad. So it's a slightly different concept to what North American onshore players have historically developed or prosecuted their inventory with. But the basin is just loaded with opportunities. The resource size is tremendous. You've seen some of the unrisked locations that we had. I think the last time we commented it was about 11,000. So really, we've got to come out with a design for all of these horizons that will be complementary of each other and fully utilize the surface facilities in a different way than the industry has historically done.","So I think if I go back to the first portion of your question, there are challenges in the Delaware Basin. Permitting on federal acreage continues to be a real challenge. That has typically centered around seven to eight months to get some of those APDs approved through the system. We work really well with the field offices of the BLM, have a great relationship. We're working together. But they're limited on resource as well. There is infrastructure, there is localized infrastructure issues and takeaway that cause us to be a little bit more thoughtful about what we go drill. In fact, some of these other horizons we talked about being more gassy, some of those horizons has had CO2 issues associated with them, so we avoid that for now. And that's incorporated in our more thoughtful plans.","And then finally, I think understanding all of those challenges with having a more thoughtful approach to power, water management, understanding all of the results from the pilots that we have ongoing will certainly impact the development plan going forward for 2016 and beyond.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, I appreciate that context. So it sounds like certainly that the fact that the northern Delaware is I guess in general more fragmented than say what you have in the Eagle Ford. You still can build that scale and efficiencies in a similar fashion.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think we can. If you recall, we started our development in the northern portion of both of those counties two years ago. Had outstanding results and then we moved out and tested the southern portion of those two counties I believe in the fall about, or mid 2014 if I recall. And so really, if you think about the timeline that we've had to build our position and our oil growth here in the southern portion of the two counties, it's been quite rapid.","And so now we're going back, I think we talked about the 13 rigs we're using today. Three of those had been centered on the slope. So we're going back to build, get an updated to build our develop plane going into 2016 that will incorporate activity there. You got to chase slopes and it's a little bit more of a different depositional environment than it is in the southern portion of the two counties. So you've got to go at a pace and stay behind the data so you can do good quality work and maximize returns and that's what we're trying to do.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning everybody. I got a couple of questions, Dave, if I may. I guess just changing tack a little bit on EnLink. What is the latest thinking after the sell down you guys did? What is your latest thinking on the pace at which you want to bring forward that value? And I've got a follow-up, please.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug. We recognize the strategic value in EnLink and we believe in the long term of that business. We think it's a well run company with a very, very bright future. And so we like it longer term. We do recognize the optionality that EnLink brings to Devon. It's probably somewhat unique within the industry to have that optionality. And so we, like we do with all of our asset base, we believe active portfolio management is the right way to look at things. So we look at that with regard to every asset we own including EnLink on a continuous basis. And I think I'd just stop there.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I realize it could be somewhat sensitive in terms of timing. But my follow-up, Dave, and I know there's been a lot of questions on maintenance capital and definitions of growth, and I think you've been quite clear about that, but if I could just try one more go at it to just to really annoy you I guess. It seems at least for the first half production numbers that the 2015 production guidance probably has some upside risk to it. So I'd first of all appreciate your comment on that. And if so, when you talk about growth in oil production, are you talking about average 2016 over 2015 or are you talking more of a sustainable go forward basis? Or to be very clear about it, are you talking exit to exit? In other words, can you actually still add new volume at that spending level as opposed to maintaining the exit rate in 2015 at that spending level, if you see what I mean?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, to answer your second question there, Doug. First, you could never aggravate me, by the way. But we are talking about average of 2016 over the exit of 2015. And essentially we're flat for the entire year. So you can look at it as average of 2016 over average of 2015. It's really the same answer. So, we're talking about on average that we would be above 2015 levels, not just the exit of 2016. So I think that's a stronger statement, obviously. As far as our second half of 2015 guidance, I think our guidance is our guidance since we give it that way for a reason now. And I think Tony could comment on this. But there probably is some variability in there based I'd say particularly on the completion timing in the Eagle Ford to a larger degree, and to a lesser degree some timing of completion and completion of facilities in the Delaware Basin. And so we've given you the best guidance we have. But there is some variability based on exactly how that works out.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, maybe at the risk of aggravating Howard, maybe I could squeeze a third one in very quickly. And it really just goes back to the Bone Spring production numbers. I mean, they're quite stunning compared to the type curve that you just raised on the last call. So I guess my hopefully quick question would be, what do you need to see by way of well count or consistency in order to revisit that type curve, which was only just upgraded a quarter ago? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Doug, I think it's a good point. If you go back probably two or three quarters ago, our type curve was a general type curve for the entire Delaware basin and we're talking about IPs of about 750 BOEs per day and EURs of about 450,000 BOEs per day. We increased that this past quarter up to 900 and you're seeing IPs in Q2 of 1,400. So if we wanted to give you a more granular type curve based on the activity quarter to quarter, I think we could increase that. So the guys are confident that we're seeing a lot of consistency there in the southern portion of the basin.","So I would think with continued well performance here and watching the data for a few months to make sure the EURs hold up as expected, the type curve could improve on the basin portion of that. And going back to a couple of calls ago, the slope work is really about the same type curve that we had a year ago and we're seeing a little bit of variability there. The returns are not as good on the slope as they are on the basin. They're not as repeatable. So certainly wouldn't want to go out on a limb and talk about a changing type curve on the slope at this point. But the southern portion of the two counties is performing extremely well as you note.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answers, Dave. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, thank you. With the Meramec, Dave, it's early days I know, but do you think you're going to have a larger oil and liquids window than you're currently indicating in today's ops report?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Tony answer that. Tony, do you think the oil window is going to grow, continue to grow?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Well, there's 50 or 60 data points out there with the industry right now and all of it is looking pretty consistent. So, I think it's a bit early to tell but the encouraging, I think the encouraging thing right now is everything at this stage of that part of the play is nothing but positive. I think with continued development there, we'll start seeing some sweet spots in some less attractive areas. But for now, industry and Devon and our partner Cimarex is drilling a lot of really positive wells. I think we only have a couple of data points on the gassy side of that fluid column. So there will be further refinement behind that. So I'd say yes, it could grow.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Another thing, John, is obviously it's gradational. So even though we may talk about a specific oil window, as you get shallower, it tends to be more. And as you get deeper it tends to get a little more liquids-rich. But it's gradational, that boundary is.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, Dave. One for Tom regarding dropdowns. In all likelihood, NGPL to go before Access as a dropdown?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't know, we really, John, we haven't worked through the specific timing, but it's likely that NGPL would be later than that given the state of development and Darryl may want to give you some color around that. But likely the first dropdown would be Access to the degree we decide to do that.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Darryl, I might suggest, we haven't talked much about NGPL. And why don't we give Darryl just a minute here to describe the NGPL asset so everybody understands it a little bit better and the optionality that this asset provides us.","Darryl G. Smette - Executive Vice President, Marketing, Facilities, Pipeline and Supply Chain","Okay, the NGPL line that we've talked about in our disclosures is a 20 inch line that we have purchased, has not really finalized yet. We expect it will finalize end of the first quarter, early second quarter. It's subject to a couple of conditions that we feel very comfortable will be met. But it's a 20 inch line that runs from North Texas to the very south end of what industry now calls the SCOOP area. And so, it is very strategic in where it goes.","Now there is a couple of different things that could happen there. First of all, that pipeline could be extended so it moves all the way through SCOOP up to the Cana area and Stack area and that's very important when we look at it, because we think as all of these plays continue to develop, that we're going to see a need for additional NGL takeaway capacity out of Oklahoma as well as residue capacity out of Oklahoma. That's a positive. The other positive is that the right-of-way that comes with this acquisition is a perpetual right-of-way. It doesn't expire and it allows us to put as many lines in that right-of-way as we can get in there and it doesn't specify for which product.","So this gives us so much optionality in terms of whether it's a rich line that could move NGL and gas down to the Bridgeport plant for EnLink, whether it could be a residue gas that takes gas out of the State of Oklahoma. It could be used as an oil line. It could be used in a number of different ways. So we are very pleased that we have that asset. We think we can add on to that asset to create value either for Devon or for EnLink. So it's something we view as very positive for us, and quite frankly, positive for the industry.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thanks, Darryl.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy Advisory. Your line is open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Good morning. I guess question on the Meramec map that you have on slide 14 defining the geologic boundaries to the north and to the south in the zone. I'd understood that to the north it becomes more carbonate rich and then to the south it gets a little more clay rich. And it looks like your blob corresponds to how I would have drawn it. Is that a fair geologic characterization of why that blob is where it is?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think you're on to it, David. I think it's really, at least in our portion of it, it's more of a silty mudstone which provides a lot of the productivity of the interval. But I think you're describing the general trend just fine.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking about your Eagle Ford production profile and knowing BHP as the operator, you also had some facility constraints that you were working on debottlenecking. How does that production profile, surface capacity, and BHP relationship impact your 140,000 barrel a day targets that you originally had? How do you think about that growth profile heading into next year or lack thereof, I guess?","Darryl G. Smette - Executive Vice President, Marketing, Facilities, Pipeline and Supply Chain","This is Darryl. As it relates to takeaway capacity, over the past four, five, six months, our midstream providers continued to work on that, and we have increased our stabilization capacity from about 140,000 barrels a day up to somewhere between 160,000 to 170,000. On any given day it can be 170,000 barrels a day and some days 160,000. So that's a significant increase in capacity, and that's gross obviously.","The other area where we have increased capacity is we have put in a different truck station that will be finalized this month of October where we have the capacity to truck barrels out of that area. And that truck station is so much closer to our production area that it just keeps the barrels flowing a lot better. So from an infrastructure standpoint, we think that we are in pretty good shape when we look at the current spend profile for the rest of this year and as we start working with BHP on 2016.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","David, I know you're aware of this, but the productivity index on those wells are extremely rich. And when we do our modeling work, pace of activity is really pretty dramatic on what that forecast looks like going forward. So we continue to be optimistic on the play and the ability to grow volumes again.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","So in other words, we have the capability to go to 140,000 barrels a day from an operational perspective. It's just a question of how much capital we put into the program. And we'll be discussing that with BHP as we continue on throughout the year and seeing what the commodity price environment looks like and how much we both mutually want to spend.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Megan Repine from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Megan E. Repine - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to drill down on the Powder River results. How much of the 225,000 acres in the oil fairway would you say are derisked at this point? And in this commodity environment, how should we think about the pace of further derisking? And then just looking at the returns there, is there anything that would keep you at this point from accelerating activity more there?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Megan, without having my map in front of me, it's difficult for me to estimate that. But I would just estimate roughly about a quarter of our position has been derisked. The way our technical teams really try to think about this is we categorize our opportunities into different tier levels. So our top tier asset base, we've got several years of running room there. We do need to move up-dip and to the north to continue to derisk a larger area. We feel very confident.","As you know, we are starting to move towards long-lateral drilling, and that has achieved everything that we had expected in our modeling work, so that is moving forward. And really, the portion of our position that has not been derisked was dependent on the long-lateral results. So right now we are extremely encouraged, and again we're focused on drilling the next best well and seeing repeatable results. Very commercial, in fact, it's probably the top three returns we have in our portfolio right now.","Megan E. Repine - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's helpful, thanks. And then my next question is just on refracs. Can you just discuss the major challenges that you're still trying to get answered for horizontal refracs, and then any thoughts around refracs on some oil assets anytime soon?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Megan. We've got I think a working laboratory in the Barnett. And if you look what we have refrac'd over the years, it's over 1,000 vertical wells that we have refrac'd. We've refrac'd refracs now in the Barnett about 50 times. And now we're working on horizontal refracs that we talked about. And we probably had more of those done over time than you would expect. But we're using the more recent technology of finer grade sand and more diversion, more capable diversion techniques. That's really what we're exploring right now. And so we tried chemical diversion. We tried mechanical diversion. At least in the Barnett right now, mechanical diversion techniques are working better. We're expecting quality returns in that.","And so really when I look at the Barnett, it's an exciting resource base that we really haven't even talked about or tried to quantify right now, but very material to the company.","And we're also using that knowledge to actually go into some of our other plays. We've refrac'd I believe about 15 or 20 wells in the vertical Wolfberry in the Permian and have seen reasonable results. Not outstanding, but we're continuing to refine that. We've refrac'd a couple of wells in the Eagle Ford and also have refrac'd a well in the Haynesville. So we're using that knowledge to go into some of our wells that were frac'd before the recent drive-in technology changed about 18 months ago and looked for good quality candidates. But there is tremendous upside with the refracs on our inventory.","Megan E. Repine - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to just follow up as you think about your cadence of well completions on the oil side going into next year. To meet your goal of growing production and then doing that within cash inflows, do you expect that you would need a greater cadence of completed wells, or is well productivity really the major driver as you look into 2016?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well productivity is the major driver. We haven't assumed anything like, well we can do this if we really draw down the inventory of wells or anything tricky like that. That's not been in our thinking at all. It's really just the improved productivity along with the lower costs and the other factors I talked about.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And along those lines, then also just to make sure we're just defining inflows correctly. That does include, I think you said this before, the potential for dropdowns from EnLink. Would you be able to hit that objective without a dropdown from EnLink?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, what I tried to clarify and you can run your own cash flow models. But I tried to clarify that we can grow oil production at between $2 billion and $2.5 billion capital program next year. And so, you can then plug in whatever oil price you want to and assumptions on drop downs, etcetera, and see how that would work out relative to cash flow I think.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. And then in the Wolfcamp, you talked about increasing your prospectivity by 40% to the 140,000 net acres. Can you just talk about geographically where you saw that and then where you're heading and whether you see \u2013 what type of potential you could see for even further improvements in prospective acres?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","We expanded our Wolfcamp footprint across our position really because we saw a couple industry wells that were more oily than what we had previously expected. So if you look back at our map, you'll see that in southeast of Mexico, we expanded that to the west. And there's a few industry data points that you could go out and dig out that would show some really good quality work. We're still seeing a lot more activity just south of the New Mexico border that's very encouraging to us. We're going to drill about six Wolfcamp wells ourselves this year, about the same for the Leonard. So again, we think that's a great resource opportunity for us and will be incorporated into our 2016 development plans.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth from BMO. Your line is open.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. In the release, you highlighted margin improvement from reduced operating costs and the higher value oil growth, but also note the Eagle Ford is the highest margin asset in the portfolio. So with reduced activity here, how should we think about continued margin expansion to the corporation at a static commodity price? And it might also make sense to expand upon the strong sequential decline in Permian LOE as this becomes a bigger contributor to overall volumes.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","We're always driving, looking at ways we can drive down the LOE. And so that's part of the goal that we have to increase the margin. So there's the opportunity there. I think that you can see that this organization is highly focused on being the best operator in each of our core areas. So there is a potential there for expansion at static prices. We don't see a big shift in the mix taking place in the volumes, but that's part of what we do is always try to drive down the cost associated with our operations.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, and then on the Haley pad, the 15% oil mix, the well exceeded the type curve of 5% oil. How sustainable is the lower GOR over the life of the well and does the increased oil mix have more to do with the new completion design or the well is being drilled towards the eastern side of the Cana development?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would not expect the GOR to magically increase with time. I think if you look at our activity, we have drilled a lot of the Cana core inventory, so we're starting to move up dip to the north and to the east. So we're expecting a more liquid-rich fluid content as we go into the second half of the year and into 2016. So we'll still have, we've had I think about four or five wells in those areas that have been very encouraging and have been more oily. Great returns. So the performance will be moving that direction.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Michelle, we're past the top of the hour so we're going to take one more call and then call it a day.","Operator","Okay, so your final question will come from James Sullivan from Alembic Global Advisory. Your line is open.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in and obviously we covered a lot of ground here. I just want to go back to one quick thing on the refracs. Do you guys have any commentary on say alternative financing programs that are out there via service companies to do refracs? Have you guys looked at that or talked to people about that? I think Halliburton was talking about doing one just as a way of making the base maintenance cheaper for you guys or more capital efficient for you.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a good question. We're seeing some of the larger service providers that want to have a little bit more skin in the game for some of these new ideas. We're utilizing a concept and won't talk about the individual provider in Southeast New Mexico on some of the newer technology there for our new completions. We also know that that opportunity is available for the refracs. I tell you right now, I think with the 1,000 wells that we have refrac'd in North Texas and the growing list of horizontals that we have refrac'd, I think we probably had the greatest library available in the industry right now. So we've got a great opportunity there and we're continuing to prosecute that on our own.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Sounds great. All right, thanks. I'll let you guys jump off now.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you all for joining our conference call today. We appreciate the interest. If you have additional follow-ups, please don't hesitate to contact any of us in Investor Relations. We look forward to seeing you on the road soon.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Howard J. Thill - Senior Vice President, Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the call as well.","Today's call is going to consist largely of Q&A, so I hope everyone has had a chance to review our fourth quarter and full-year earnings release that also includes our forward-looking guidance as well as our detailed operations report. Also on the call today are: Dave Hager, President and CEO; Tony Vaughn, Executive Vice President of E&P; Tom Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and a few other members of our senior management team.","Finally, I'll remind you that comments and answers to questions on the call will contain plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates, which are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities laws. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results might differ materially.

Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone.","As we all know, 2015 provided an extremely challenging business environment for our industry. We responded during the year by proactively taking steps to align our business with these conditions by reducing field-level costs by $400 million, delivering efficiencies and cost savings and reduce capital requirements by $500 million, and we attained significant productivity gains and improved type curves and IP rates across all our core plays.","As we look to 2016, our top priority in this environment is to protect the balance sheet by balancing spending requirements with available cash flow. We also see no reason to accelerate production growth into these weak markets, which has led us to take aggressive measures to reduce our capital investment by 75% year over year.","We also have plans in place to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow on a go-forward basis through a number of initiatives, including incremental field-level cost savings, a reduction of our workforce by about 1,000 people, and by adjusting the dividend rate to preserve over $300 million of cash flow. In an effort to further strengthen our balance sheet, we also have non-core divestitures underway, with the intent to monetize $2 billion to $3 billion of assets during 2016.","As I've said many times, Devon is in the advantageous position of having no long-cycle projects, minimal long-term contracts, and nearly all of our acreage is held by production. These favorable attributes allow us to prudently adjust our 2016 capital program to balance cash flows and to protect our balance sheet.","But it also gives us the ability to ramp up development activity when commodity prices rebound and to see a quick production response to that ramp when it happens.","Our capital program in 2016 is designed to maximize cash flow and operational continuity, with activity directed toward the lowest risk and highest impact opportunities in each of Devon's core areas. This disciplined capital program is expected to maintain relatively flat oil production from Devon's core assets compared to 2015, and we are projecting only a 10% oil decline from Q4 2015 to Q4 2016. This production resiliency is a testament to the quality of our go-forward assets. Overall top line production in 2016 from core assets is expected to decline by 6%, driven by lower gas volumes.","The efficiency of our 2016 budget is also highlighted by our ability to fund our capital program at today's strip pricing within operational cash flow, EnLink distributions, and expected Access Pipeline proceeds. Once again, we have the flexibility to ramp up spending or to make additional cuts to our spending plans depending upon how commodity prices trend going forward.","As I mentioned earlier, in addition to balancing near-term spending with cash inflows, we are also working to improve our financial position through the monetization of $2 billion to $3 billion of assets. We are in the latter stages of discussions for the sale of our 50% interest in Access Pipeline, and expect that transaction to occur in the first half of the year, potentially the first quarter.","We are also in the process of opening a data room for the sale of up to 80,000 BOE per day of non-core upstream assets in the U.S. The properties up for sale include 15,000 net undeveloped acres in Martin County, Texas and producing assets in the Southern Midland Wolfcamp, Carthage, Granite Wash, and Mississippian Lime plays.","We have had direct contact from potential buyers ranging from majors to well-capitalized peers to private equity firms. We believe these assets are substantially higher quality than those being considered for divestment by others and are in the market quicker. This gives us a competitive edge. Conversations thus far have been encouraging, and we have confidence in our ability to attractively sell these assets throughout 2016 and use the upstream asset sale proceeds for debt retirements.","Looking at our financial flexibility longer term, if commodity prices remain low, Devon has significant balance sheet strength to withstand an extended downturn. Pro forma for the Felix acquisition, which closed in early January, we had $3.9 billion of liquidity at year end, consisting of $1.5 billion of cash and $2.4 billion of capacity on our senior credit facility. Importantly, this credit facility does not mature until the end of 2019 and contains only one material financial covenant, a debt-to-capitalization ratio below 65%. At year end this ratio was only 24%.","In addition to our strong liquidity, we've done a good job managing our upcoming debt maturities, with no significant debt coming due until December 2018. Bottom line, our advantaged capital structure provides us a significant amount of financial strength and flexibility.","So in summary, I hope you come away with three important messages today. First, we are committed to living within cash flows in 2016. To do so, we have taken aggressive measures to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow through operating cost and dividend reductions. Second, we have the financial strength to withstand an extended downturn, and we're looking to further bolster our investment-grade balance sheet with ongoing asset divestiture programs. And lastly, the quality, depth, and diversification of our go-forward asset base is unmatched. Devon has exposure to some of the best short-cycle projects in the world. We are well positioned to accelerate activity when the markets reward growth again.","With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A.","Howard J. Thill - Senior Vice President, Communications & Investor Relations","Thanks, Dave. We're going to have a lot of calls today and a lot of questions on today's call, I'm sure. So to make sure that we get to as many questions on the call as possible, as usual, I'll ask you to limit yourself to one question within an associated follow-up, and you can reprompt to ask additional questions if time permits.","So, Stephen, with that, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you and good morning, everybody. Dave, I appreciate the clarification on the asset sales process, but I wonder if you can just give us a little bit more color on your expected timing and perhaps the associated cash flow that goes along with that $2 billion to $3 billion of proceeds. I don't want to risk my follow-up here, but just for clarification, is Access still in that $2 billion to $3 billion, or is that additive to the $2 billion to $3 billion? I do have a quick follow-up, please.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Doug. Good morning. Yes, we do include Access in the $2 billion to $3 billion, although there's obviously flexibility around that. And we aren't trying to predict the market, but we did make that assumption that it's in there. But it could actually even be higher depending on how everything goes.","I think there's really a misperception in the market about the quality of these assets, to be quite honest with everybody. These are very high-quality assets. You may remember that we did a non-core divestiture program about a year and a half ago after we acquired GeoSouthern, and that was really what we would consider assets that were towards the bottom of our barrel I'd say as far as asset quality. These are high-quality assets. And the feedback that we have received from the market thus far is very positive regarding the quality of these assets and the ability to transact these assets at the prices that we have assumed here. We are opening data rooms starting next week. And then soon after that, we anticipate that we'd be receiving bids here during the first half of the year and closing on these throughout the year. I'm going to turn over to Tom Mitchell, who's going to comment a little bit about the cash flow side.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We haven't given out, Doug, a specific cash flow number. We've talked about 80,000 barrels a day. About 23% of that is oil. And I just want to emphasize what Dave said that we've had a number of discussions with parties. The interest in it is extremely robust, more than you would expect. It does lean closer to the private equity side from an interest level, but that's something that we had expected when we went out with the package. We're moving very quickly to try to get ahead of what we think may be further asset sales by other peers, and we're on that timeline right now going out here to open data rooms and move aggressively in early March.","So we're well positioned and it's a great package, and that's the feedback we're getting from the potential buyers. But on a scale basis, they're not seeing anything like this in the market, and on a quality basis they're not seeing anything like this in the market. And that's what gives us the confidence both that we'll get it done and within the ranges that we've talked about.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate that, fellows. My follow-up is really on the guidance for 2016, specifically in Canada and the oil sands. Based on the differentials that you appear to be assuming and the operating costs, it looks like there's a real chance that some of those oil sands projects could be negative cash flow. I'm just wondering if that's the right interpretation and how you plan to manage through that in terms of maintaining production if oil prices remain depressed. And I'll leave it there, thanks.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'm going expand your question just a little bit, Doug. We think we have a great benefit here at Devon, as I've been saying. We are just short-term project oriented. We do not have to continue investment into longer-term projects that no longer make economic sense such as in the deepwater, LNG projects, anything like that. So we have the ability to flex our capital down, and we have the ability to flex our capital back up very quickly. We have maintained \u2013 despite the employee reduction we're going through right now, it's very important to us to maintain the organizational capacity to flex our program back up should we see encouragement in prices.","We just don't think it makes a lot of sense to accelerate production into a $30 oil and $2 gas price environment currently. But if we see some encouragement, we have the organizational capacity. We'll have the service companies lined up where we can quickly accelerate this, and then there would be a commensurate adjustment in our production guidance. We have extremely high-quality projects. There's no question about that. We're just showing financial \u2013 the appropriate financial behavior here given where prices are currently. Now, I'll let Tony talk to you a little bit more about the oil sands and where that stands and where we stand on opportunities in the U.S. on the oil side too.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Okay. Thanks, Dave. And, Doug, just going back to your question about Canada, on the co-flow side of the business at our Bonnyville location, we've got a lot of flexibility there. So we evaluate all those wells, and we're capable of shutting in those wells when they become uneconomic on a well-by-well basis without any concern about the degradation and ultimate recoveries.","When you get into the SAGD [Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage] portion of the inventory there, we think we have the top-tier asset in the play. And we would probably be the last company to have the stress on us from a profitability or immediate cash flow projections. If you look at our capital demands for 2016, it's minor. It's minor in 2016, so we've got a lot of flexibility. There may be month-to-month that we have a neutral cash flow in the SAGD operation. But again, we probably have the best project there.","I guess when I go back and start looking at our ability to grow oil, we've got the most flexibility and more immediate impact will be on the U.S. side of the business. There we've got the best inventory or access to the best inventory in the Delaware Basin and STACK and the Eagle Ford. So we're ready to ramp up. We've got a deep inventory. We have all the permitting and required work done ready for that ramp-up. So as soon as we generate additional cash flow in the company, we'll be back to work and we'll be growing that oil base.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the clear answer, guys. Thank you very much.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Dave, I think you alluded to this, and I apologize if I missed it. But can you be a little bit more specific about what kind of oil and\/or natural gas prices would incentivize you to pick up activity in the back half of 2016, assuming all these asset sales get done, and maybe offer an opinion on which plays or which areas you'd be most likely to accelerate?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Charles, we are currently looking at an anticipated cash flow neutral budget at strip pricing from our operational cash flow, the EnLink distributions plus anticipated Access Pipeline proceeds, which by the way, we still have a high degree of confidence we are going to execute on. That has not changed. So at strip pricing, we'd be cash flow neutral.","If we see prices \u2013 if we see the strip moving up, and we have confidence it is going to continue to move up, that's when we would consider increasing activity. And again, all of our projects are short-term, so we can ramp back up very, very quickly. You saw that we ramped down quickly. We can ramp back up just as quickly. There is no issue there. We just feel that we are being prudent given the current commodity price environment.","And where would we ramp up? Tony I think answered it. There are three areas that really have strong economics for us. Those are the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin and in the STACK play, and we'd be looking at all three of those plays to see where we'd put the rigs. But they all would have fairly similar economics and strong economics.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it, that's helpful, Dave. And then that's a good segue also to the next question I was going to ask, which is about the big improvement in the STACK results you had that you released this quarter. I think I asked a similar question last quarter about what was driving the variance in well results across that position. And maybe now I would ask that question again, but also ask you what's driving that improvement over time as well?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Tony take that, but I'd just say we think this combined, we said it last quarter. We're in the best part of the STACK. We're in the heart just like we are in the Eagle Ford with our position we acquired there. We're in a volatile oil window, plus we have multiple pays, and we're moving through the appraisal process right now. And we knew it was going to get better, and frankly it's getting better. It's going to keep getting better. We've got the best inventory in the industry right now. But I'll let Tony go through the details on that.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Charles, you're right. If you look at our operating report, we commented on about 12 Devon wells that we brought on in the Meramec and another eight that were brought \u2013 or another four that were brought on in the Felix position. All of those really were above our type curve. In fact, on the majority of those wells that we continued the Felix operations, the wells were not only high rate but they were also about 60% oil. So it was above our overall modeling that we had done previously.","I think the work that we're continuing is really a follow-up to the good work that the Felix team was doing. They have really focused on the optimal landing zone in each of these Meramec intervals, a lot of detail and concern about maintaining the largest amount of footage drilled in the Polasti (19:46) interval there. We continue to advance the completion designs. We're pumping about 2,500 to 2,700 pounds per lateral foot, so we're loading these completions up with a lot of sand. We're using \u2013 the majority of our fluid is a slickwater-based fluid with some crosslinked gel in that. So we're experimenting with the fluid type there.","So I think all that combined is just leading to improved completions well to well. And I think we commented the last time we were on a call with you that really the outstanding thing that we really like about the STACK play is really the volatility of the results is very narrow for a very young play like we have at STACK. So we're very optimistic and we're ready for an increased run rate, increased activity level there when the opportunity arises.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks, Tony. I have the same recollection; and congratulations on your new position.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. Tom, I wanted to start with you. Obviously, Devon has taken some aggressive action on the cost front and CapEx front. I was wondering if you could comment on any discussions you've had with the rating agencies and your confidence about maintaining Devon's historical investment-grade credit rating.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Arun. Thanks for the question. Obviously at the end of the year you go before the agencies to give them your year-end results and talk about the reserve profile within the company. So we've been through that exercise with all of them. You've seen the results of that, so let me start with that. So S&P has taken us to BBB and a stable position. And we've got Fitch having concluded their rating, currently at BBB+ and also stable. So we've got two solid investment-grade positions there, which pretty much assures us as an investment-grade company.","Moody's is a different story. I think you're aware of that as well as others listening that they're debating what they're going to do. There are a lot of moving parts there. And quite frankly, it's hard for us, or I think anybody at this point in time, to tell exactly what they are going to do with this group. They've already made the decision on the non-investment-grade group, which resulted in multiple-notch downgrades. They've taken a very low price deck view of not really rating through the cycle but rating closer to the bottom of the cycle. And they're shifting how they're thinking about investment-grade. So on a historic model, I feel pretty comfortable that we would be okay. It's just very difficult at this point in time to tell exactly how they're going to recalibrate what they consider to be investment-grade. And that decision-making process is in is in play as we speak and probably concluding before the end of the month.","So I wish I could give you a more firm answer on that. I think the decisions that we've taken here, while they were really primarily targeted at the business, not the rating agencies, are also credit enhancing and should be confidence inspiring to the agencies. And that's the best we think we can do is to really focus on the business and let the rating agency portion fall where it falls, given of course the fact that we want to continue to maintain our strength in investment-grade and position ourselves as best as possible.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. My follow-up is just really regarding the Q4, if you guys could comment a little bit on the Q4 2016 exit rate. Just going through the math, it would suggest U.S. volumes down in the low 90,000 barrels per day on the oil side. I was wondering if you could comment if you agree with that in terms of the exit rate given lower CapEx. And just talk about \u2013 that would imply quite a bit of loss in operating momentum into 2017. How quickly do you think that \u2013 if you got a price signal, could you regain that operating momentum?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Arun, what I'm trying to emphasize to everybody here is that we are probably uniquely positioned with the ability \u2013 with the fact that all of our projects are short cycle time projects. They're all well oriented projects. We don't have any long-term projects within the company. And so that gives us tremendous flexibility to decrease our capital, such as we've done just now when we're in a very low commodity price environment, and the ability to ramp up capital spending and see commensurate results on the production side should we get some encouragement.","So we can make immediate decisions around ramping production back up. We have the projects ready. We have the permits ready. All we have to do \u2013 we have the wells designed. All we have to do is hire the rigs and drill the wells, and then you'll see production impact anywhere from \u2013 some will be completed immediately. Some are pad drilling and may take up to six months or so to see the production impact from those, but you start seeing response from higher capital spend very, very quickly for us. Tony might even be able to fill you in with a little bit more details on that than what I just said, Arun.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Arun, when we look at \u2013 when we do our forecasting work for the year, we're confident in the ability to forecast most of our properties. What I would comment on is the Eagle Ford has got \u2013 the wells have such a high productivity index. The wells have such a high productivity index there's a little bit more range of error included in that forecast. And as you know, the amount of \u2013 or the pace of our activities is being modified as we go through the year. So that one property alone is the one that can drive an outperformance compared to how we had forecast.","I'd also like to point out that we know with a limited capital program we're completely focused on the base management of our business. And we've talked about it over the course of the last 18 months that we've transformed our capabilities internally here. I think you're starting to see a lot of the results from that in public data. We have the highest 90-day Junes (27:00) in each of the four basins that we're driving capital towards. So we're pretty confident that we'll outperform. I think you saw that quarter to quarter over the last six or eight quarters from us. A lot of that's going be driven just by the management of our base. And so we've got \u2013 personally I've got a lot of confidence that we'll beat the curve that you're describing.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'd just suggest real quickly is that the guidance if I were to summarize the comments, maybe a glass half empty in terms of well productivity \u2013 maybe provide a little upside if you perform better than that in terms of \u2013 you highlighted the Eagle Ford.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","I think that's correct. I think, Arun, as we continue to see results in the STACK play, we've commented about the type curve there. We're already at that type curve. And so we'll continue to modify that as results continue to improve. So I think there are going be positives to the forecast.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, thank you.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Arun.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. My question is I guess the roadmap for asset sales and use of proceeds. You talked about paying debt down. If I think of hypothetically $2 billion to $3 billion, how do you think of how that would be deployed? Would it be 100% for debt reduction? I presume bank debt and near-term maturities, or is there some of it that you might reconsider for the drill bit?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Subash. This is Tom. What we've said to you guys is that the Access proceeds would be to fill the funding gap in the capital program this year. And that the proceeds from asset divestitures, the sale of our producing properties will be targeted for debt repayment.","So how we mechanically go about that debt repayment, we're still debating how exactly to go about that. Our bonds on the long end of the curve are trading well below par, so you actually get a big bang for the buck if that holds and you're able to redeploy the capital from the divestiture into those bonds. Whether we to that immediately or not is yet to be determined. This is a pretty volatile environment, but that's the target right now. So you'd have Access wherever it comes out filling the funding gap, and then the rest of it for debt repayment.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for that clarification. And then I guess secondly, is there a way \u2013 you mentioned that you want to preserve your optionality so you're organizationally capable of high levels of activity. Is there a way to put a rig number to it on what you think the peak rig count you can do after this resizing?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Subash, I think it's going be driven by our cash flow opportunities that we generate here in the company. We've got the capabilities internally to ramp quickly back up to a 20-rig program if we had the business environment to do that. So we really are not inhibited by the ability to execute. We think we have the permits in place in the core \u2013 or the core of each of our four areas. So it's really going be predicated on how we generate cash flow for the year.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Subash, that is a 20-rig operated program, not including the Eagle Ford where BHP operates that activity. And also we do a lot of activity 50:50 with Cimarex up in STACK play. And so those rigs would be in addition to the 20-rig program that obviously we can manage.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right. Right, so that could be 25 to 30 rigs. Okay, thank you very much.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Subash.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning and thanks for all the color in the ops report, but I'll probably have to stick with balance sheet questions. A downside and upside case, folks are worried about recession. You've highlighted the quality of the assets that you're selling this morning. But say for example the strip price even rolls into 2017 because of some economic weakness. What would be the game plan to manage the downside? Then I've got an upside question to follow.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ed. First off, we've already taken a lot of steps obviously to reduce our operating and G&A costs by around $800 million. The dividend payments, we've reduced those significantly by around $320 million, adjusted our capital program. We have the asset sales going on. So we think we're in a good position even if the strip or slightly lower does come in, in 2017. We would obviously be looking in 2017 at all available options that we have to us as a company, just as we did coming into 2016. Could they be \u2013 is there availability for further reductions on operating expense and G&A? We could review the dividend policy, equity offerings, asset sales. We have a lot of bullets in our gun, I guess you'd say, that we can fire here in order to really maintain our financial strength during these challenging economic times, and we just evaluate each of those and see which makes the most sense.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So I hear that you would be willing to sell perhaps even some of the I guess Tier 1 acreage if you had to if say oil stayed low for two years.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","We would certainly consider that. I'm not saying we are going to do that, but we would certainly \u2013 our focus of probably \u2013 we'd have to make a decision whether it makes more sense to look at the oil side, or we also have some very large gas assets sitting out there, so we'd have to look at that as well. So I'm not going to say we would do one or the other. There are no sacred cows around here, and we would certainly evaluate all the available options and see which we think generates the greatest value for the shareholders. We obviously have to be mindful of the cash flow that's generated by these, and we would do all the appropriate analysis when making our decision. We'd look at all available options to see how we can best handle that, should that situation occur.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then on the upside case, say oil does recover to some mid-cycle pricing. I appreciate everyone would have a different view of what that is. You seem like you're resource-rich, and the access to liquidity is probably constraining what you could do in terms of activity. So some other companies have been relatively successful in viewing themselves as startups and issuing equity for growth capital. Is that something on the upside case that you would consider?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Again, I hate to rule anything in or out. But if we get a price recovery to more like a mid-cycle case above the current strip, then we would have incremental cash flow available to reinvest back into the capital program. And I think that's the first place we'd look for our funding is just for the incremental available cash flow from higher prices.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","You have to use cash from opposite the first accelerated driver.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Kistler with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, guys.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Dave.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Following up a little bit on the 2016 and even some comments towards what 2017 might look like, maybe to frame that up, could you mind sharing, as you talked about managing base decline, where base decline was in 2015, and where you project it to be in 2016? Kind of helps give us an indication maybe to where 2017 would shake out.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Our overall base decline has really been running about \u2013 roughly about 20% for the company. On the gas side, especially in North Texas, the technical team and the operating group in North Texas have done an outstanding job to minimize the decline using plunger lifts and line pressure reductions. They managed to arrest that decline, and it's been running about 11% per year. Our oil decline, because it's fairly new investments, it's much greater and it tends to be over 30%. So on a combined basis it's still around 20% year over year, and I wouldn't expect that to change going into 2016. I think we still have a high degree of focus on our base business. We're continuing to improve our artificial lift operations. Our downtime is continuing to be minimized and improved as we go through our work; so high optimism that we'll continue to have wins on our large base business.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","I appreciate that. And then just one \u2013 thinking about activity in the Delaware right now, on the last call you talked a little bit about the BLM and permitting process there can be a little bit challenging. But obviously reduced activity I would assume puts you in a better position there. I'm just trying to get color on your thoughts there, and does that fit part and parcel with being able to accelerate there as you're able to maybe permit more ahead of a potential ramp up?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","I think, Dave, just as you mentioned, our activity is down in comparison to where it was a year or two years ago. So the permitting requirements are not near as onerous on us as they have been. That really hadn't stopped our desire to have a great working relationship with the BLM, especially in southeast New Mexico. That relationship is extremely high. We just entered into the ability to work with that office there under a master agreement type concept, which we believe we'll be able to communicate more of a full development plan with them and get all the right-of-way permitting done collectively. It won't include the individual APDs for the wells that we'll propose. We'll have to come back and follow up with that. But it will greatly accelerate our ability to ramp back up.","So we're continuing that relationship, and we're confident that we can have those wins that we've had in southeast New Mexico and take those to Wyoming and be able to ramp back up in the Powder River Basin in that asset as well.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay, I appreciate that incremental color. Thanks, guys.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dave.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Hi, guys.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","I've got a question for you on MLPs and EnLink, Dave. Some of the more leveraged E&Ps are roiling the MLP market as folks are worried about transportation, contract changes, things like that. How do you view EnLink? Has your perception or has your strategy changed at all with it because it seems like you're getting penalized for the carnage to the MLP market?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, John. Our strategy has not changed at all with regard to EnLink. We think that we have a great relationship with them. They provide outstanding service to us. We also like the fact that we are aligned with them in our new acreage in the STACK play that we acquired from Felix, with them acquiring the Tall Oak assets. That gives us great confidence as we put capital against that program that we're going to have outstanding service to get those wells hooked up in a timely manner. And so our strategy really has not changed in regard to that. We certainly believe that the agreements we have with them are important and the volume commitments and the rates that we agreed \u2013 the tariffs we've agreed to pay are bound by contract, and we plan to live up to those agreements. So there's really no change that's been in our relationship and our feeling about them from a long-term strategic value.","Now having said that, we obviously look at everything in our portfolio. And so if there is a reason why that should change, again, we like it long term. We will never rule any asset or anything as an absolute sacred cow where we don't look at the best business decision if we should go another direction. But right now, we don't see a reason to go another direction with the EnLink relationship.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Dave. One last one for me, you mentioned tighter spacing in your ops report in the Bone Spring and the Leonard. Is that going to be the future from a development perspective there, that you'll be doing tighter horizontal well spacing?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yes, John, this is Tony. I think you're right about that. We're actually having a lot of encouraging results right now on our downspacing pilots, especially in the areas that have original reservoir pressure. So if you look \u2013 we historically have landed the Second Bone Springs in the lower section of that package. And then we've staggered some what we call A-sand wells in above that and are seeing very encouraging results.","It's early on the areas that have partial depletion. We would expect a little bit less ability to downspace, but the data is still coming in, and we'll understand that better as we go through 2016. And of course, all this is really tied to oil price. And so there will be a direct relationship to spacing for all of us and the business environment as we go forward.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thanks.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Going back to the balance sheet, what are the metrics that you regard as most important for Devon? And will the asset sales and the dividend cut get you to where you want to be from a leverage perspective? Or per some of the earlier questions, are you considering more actions in your base case scenario as opposed to a downside scenario?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Brian. This is Tom. I think the asset sales go a long ways towards getting us where we want to be. And if you're on historical metrics, I think that pretty much works, and that's what you're seeing from S&P and Fitch.","Now like I said earlier in my previous comments, it's just really hard to tell where Moody's is going to shake out. So we're leaning really more on a historical view of what those metrics have been, which is not just cash flow metrics. It also involves a fairly healthy component of size and scale. But on Moody's, it's just extremely difficult at this point to answer your question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So the underlying then goal here is investment-grade credit ratings from all three ratings agencies. Whatever metrics they look at would be what you would want to gear the strategy towards.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We maintain investment-grade status with just two rating agencies. So we really \u2013 regardless of what Moody's does, we stay in the investment-grade indexes. So while we'd like that, it doesn't damage our investment-grade status if they were to drop us below.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. And then my follow-up is with regards to the \u2013 staying within cash flow. If and when oil prices do improve, should we just expect a straight CapEx equals cash flow type strategy? And how does the EnLink business apply here? If there's outspending, including the impact of distributions on a consolidated basis, at the EnLink level, does that weigh in your decision, or is it solely Devon and Devon only?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's essentially Devon and Devon only on that, Brian. And I think that would be the first thing I would say is to look at just a straight how much incremental cash flow we would have and putting that to work back into E&P capital. That's a good first proxy. Obviously, we would look at longer term what we think prices are going do. And if we have even greater confidence they're going to be moving up significantly in the future, we might be willing to ramp up even a little bit more than that. Conversely, if we think it's a temporary phenomenon, we may ramp up a little bit less. But I think that's a first good proxy of how to think about it.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, question on the Access Pipeline sale. Your partner in the pipeline has made some noise about potentially selling their stake as well. Does that help your process, does it hinder it, or is it a push?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's really independent of that, Bob. We each have our own processes going on for that. Frankly, we think we're probably a little more advanced in our stage of the process than our partner is in looking at their 50%. But it's really two independent processes at this point. And like I said, we remain very confident that we are going to be able to transact on that sometime in the first half of the year. It could potentially be as early as the first quarter, but no guarantees on that.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And to follow up, in terms of the price you might get for that asset, can we use the capital you've put into that asset as a decent proxy, or would we be far off if we did that?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","You wouldn't be too far off with that probably.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Hey, Tom. Actually you're in a pretty unique position where you can maintain investment-grade, so you can talk pretty openly about some of the concerns for investors around what happens to an E&P company when you lose investment-grade. What are the steps that goes on in thinking about your credit facility being secured, hedging facility, any firm transportation changes? I just would be curious about your perspective.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me just emphasize again so people are clear. Nothing would happen to us with a Moody's shift. And even if we had a bad result from another rating agency, our liquidity position is solid and doesn't change at all. So there's nothing in our revolving capacity, our debt, our bank debt capacity that changes in that circumstance. Those covenants remain the same. Nothing gets triggered. There's nothing in our public debt or our indentures that would occur if that is the case. I think the real impact to those that this occurs to would just be access to the capital markets and primarily at cost. You'd be dealing with higher costs as you tap the markets.","Our revolver has got a lot of term left on it. You're out into 2019 before that term is up. So a lot is going to happen between now and that point in time. Those who have to renegotiate now are going be dealing with a totally different environment. And I think the uncertainty that you're seeing out of the agencies on how they approach this is going to reach into those types of negotiations. You'll have people who have got near-term debt concerns just dealing with an uncertain bank market and an uncertain capital market.","The bondholders that I've spoken to are equally confused by this and don't know necessarily how exactly it's going to shake out. Some of them are \u2013 we don't think in our portfolio of debt holders that there's a lot that would be dependent on Moody's, but there potentially could be some selling of bonds for those investors who require a Moody's and an S&P rating both to hold debt, so that could also be another impact. But just to reemphasize for Devon, Devon really nothing would have \u2013 if we were taken fully non-investment-grade, which is not going to happen, there would be no change in our debt picture.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And nothing on the commercial paper side either?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Your commercial paper program, your access to it, and people's ability to trade in that is going be weakened if you've got somebody that goes to non-investment-grade. It's not taken away for us. That really just amounts to a cost of debt, not an access issue.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I think it's more critical for companies with international assets and bigger projects, so that's helpful. On the other side, just cash flow neutral, does that include EnLink distributions? I just want to make sure I'm getting that correct.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it does, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, that was it. Thank you, guys.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, David.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Your line is open.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks, just a quick housekeeping question on Jackfish. The ops report shows that unit LOE was below $10 in fourth quarter. Just wondering if you could tell us what the total operating cash cost was in the fourth quarter, including the blend cost, and maybe where cash costs are running today given the recent weakness in the Canadian currency. Thanks.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","It's about $7.00 for the blend costs, Phillips.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Has the total cash cost come down since then, I guess with the weakness in the Canadian currency?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Come down since \u2013 it's trading today at about where it was trading through the fourth quarter. It's around $0.72.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Where the exchange rate is, so it hasn't weakened further. It weakened throughout the year and gave us a significant uplift on the reduction in costs that you saw, but it hasn't continued to weaken in the first part of this year.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, a couple questions. If I just think \u2013 and I'm thinking about what I've seen you do in the Meramec as far as well costs, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, I guess a two-part question. One would be how much more room \u2013 let's just assume service costs and the forward strip stays where it's at right now. How much more room do you have as far as cost reductions available in the next two to three quarters? How much more downside do you see there?","And then the second piece would just be, you talked about your core assets and them all being economic today. Philosophically, how do you guys think ability the big picture, the U.S. and crude prices? I'm just trying to chase that marginal cost type number.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Dave, let me start on the operating side a bit. We would estimate that the 2016 costs in comparison to 2015 might be down another 4%, and it varies by category of course. We still think there are operating efficiency gains that we will have. As you roll back about 12 months ago, we saw \u2013 early in the year we saw a nice improvement in the service provider de-escalation component. But in the second half of the year, we saw great efficiency gains with just optimizing all of our well construction designs, optimizing the execution of our wells. We had very little trouble time. All that has accelerated our time to TD. We're getting better wells completed because of the focus on that detail, so we'll continue that. And historically, we've always seen somewhere between a zero and 10% efficiency gain, and I wouldn't expect anything different than that by the time we get to the end of 2016.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","David, just to expand a little bit on your question, we have certainly seen third-party studies that show that our acreage in the Eagle Ford in DeWitt County is probably the most economic acreage in the Eagle Ford, and I think it competes well with any play in onshore North America. I can also tell you that we see very similar economics to DeWitt County in the heart of our plays in the Delaware Basin and in the STACK play. So we think that we have certainly three of the plays in our portfolio that position us with the most economic opportunities that you might find in onshore North America.","And so it's not a question of the strength of the portfolio at this point. It's a question of how much capital are we going to put against that strong portfolio. I just want to emphasize one last time. We've taken capital down significantly, and we understand that. It's because we had the flexibility to do that in this current $30 oil and $2 gas price environment. But we have the ability to ramp that capital back up just as quickly and bring production back just as quickly should we see encouragement on the commodity price environment. So we said the first priority right now is balance sheet. That's what we're doing, but we have the ability to ramp it right back up and get back in the game.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","David, I'd draw your attention back to the operating report on page 12. You can just look at our Cana results and the Woodford, and you'll see that we've dropped our time to TD from 40 to 20 days, so we've actually decreased the drill time in half. And after 800 wells, as we've talked about our continuous improvement on the completion side, after 800 wells being drilled and completed, we're still seeing the highest IPs of the history of the Cana-Woodford work.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, thanks. I appreciate that.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Payne with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I think we've worn out the rating agency discussion, but I also wanted to just ask you just a simple question. Are they looking at your metrics excluding EnLink or inclusive of them? Thank you.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Ross, it's Tom again. It depends on which one you're dealing with. For the most part, they include it, but they include it in different ways. It's really included on a \u2013 even though this is non-recourse debt to Devon, Moody's for instance looks at it as a too-big-to-fail type situation where you would come in and support the credit in the event there were issues. So that's largely how they look at it. S&P takes them down one notch from where we are and looks at it a little bit differently.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Wolff with Jefferies. Jon Wolff, your line is open.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Looking at the $2.4 billion available of liquidity on the unsecured credit facility, it had been $3 billion prior. I was wondering if something was drawn, maybe commercial paper termination, or was it related to the facility being reduced? That's question number one.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There are a lot of moving parts going through the end of the year to make payments on Felix. So the only change from our $3 billion capacity is that we paid down about $300 million of commercial paper. So that's the only thing. So net-net, your net available liquidity is pretty much close to what you saw in the ops report.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just shy of $4 billion.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it. So would you say you're still active in the commercial paper market, overnight market?","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There has been no \u2013 it's a little bit more costly, but that's pretty much the case for anybody that's playing the CP market. Our access and our ability to deal with the CP market is unchanged at this point.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then I was a little confused on the mechanics on the rating agencies. Obviously, your investment-grade rating was affirmed by S&P. I guess everyone is waiting on Moody's, and I don't see a Fitch opinion since October. So is it two out of three, or is it either Moody's or S&P that creates the mechanics of...","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Fitch left \u2013 and these are conversations between Devon and Fitch. Fitch left our rating at that level. They're not reviewing it currently, so it stands as is and it's not up for review.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it.","Thomas L. Mitchell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What they've indicated for the whole group is that they would come out before the end of the month. Exactly when that occurs, it's hard for me to tell you. I think they had one or two more large investment-grade parties that were coming before them here in and around this timeframe right now, and then when they go out will be shortly after that, likely.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Super helpful, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone. It's notable that you've been confident about your asset sales program. Could you just reiterate that because it is so important for this year and we've been hearing quite negative things about the asset market? Thank you.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll reiterate it. We all feel extremely confident that these assets, from all we understand, are higher quality assets than anyone else has put on the market, including some of those that have recently transacted. And we also feel that there may be other companies that may be coming out with assets later in the year, but we're beating them to the market. So, from all the feedback we get, is that our expectations are very realistic for the timing and for the magnitude of proceeds that we can expect to receive from these assets.","We have had significant contact with potential purchasers, even before we get the data rooms out there. As Tom said, it ranges from majors to some well-capitalized independents to a lot of interest from private equity, and they're frankly people who have become comfortable with this price environment and want to make an entry at this point. And the high quality of these assets frankly can be a company-maker type opportunity for some smaller companies.","And that's what some of these people are looking at, frankly, is they can start a whole company around one or more of these assets and have a very bright future. So you never know for sure obviously until you transact, but all the feedback we have gives us tremendous confidence that we're well positioned from a timing standpoint on this and with the quality standpoint to make this happen.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","That is firmly stated. Thank you very much.","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Healy from AIG. Your line is open.","Jeff Healy - American International Group, Inc.","Hi, guys. I just want to follow up again on the more balance sheet focus. It looks like in the Devon transaction slide you guys had out that you were going to issue $1.35 billion of equity. I guess I wanted to check to see if that's still the intent. And if the asset sales don't emerge that you think will be able to happen in 2016 maybe look to do more equity to help shore up your balance sheet?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","We've already issued the equity associated with those transactions, the $1.35 billion. Tom can give you the exact numbers, but they were issued I think a little over $44 for the Felix side and a little over $40 \u2013 $41 I think on the Powder River Basin asset. So obviously we had a nice-looking price compared to today.","As far as additional equity beyond that, we are focused on our cost reductions. We're focused on the asset sales, on the dividend reduction. I'm not going take anything off the table as far as a possibility, but we think we've taken some very significant steps to really increase the financial strength of the company with the actions we talked about today.","Jeff Healy - American International Group, Inc.","Got it. Maybe just to follow up then, if we say that Moody's has moved the goal posts and doing their own thing, would you be willing to issue equity to preserve investment-grade if necessary at the other two agencies?","David A. Hager - President and Chief Executive Officer","As Tom said, we have had our ratings at S&P. We were downgraded one but pretty stable. At Fitch, we're not up for review right now, and we're still at the previous rating there. So we are already \u2013 two of the three we already have investment-grade. As Tom also alluded to, the fact that it really doesn't change our business model significantly if we were non-investment-grade.","So we are going to do the right decisions for the business, period. We can't just chase investment-grade rating certainly with Moody's when we're uncertain what the criteria are that they're going to use. And so we're going to focus less on that and make sure that we make the right decisions for the business overall, for our shareholders, and for our bondholders.","Jeff Healy - American International Group, Inc.","Okay, I appreciate it.

On today's call, I will cover a few preliminary items and then turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Hager. Dave will provide his thoughts on the recent performance and direction of New Devon. Following Dave, Tony Vaughn, our Chief Operating Officer will cover a few operating highlights from the quarter. And then we will wrap up our prepared remarks with Jeff Ritenour -- financial outlook. Jeff will cover our financial highlights -- outlook for the 2019.

These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially. Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Hager","Hello, I'm going to start over because of my microphone is not on. I apologize. Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. The second quarter is another outstanding one for the New Devon. Across the portfolio, our teams are delivering results that continue to exceed production and capital efficiency targets for successfully driving down per unit costs and maximizing margins. Before we get into details of the quarter, let's begin with a brief overview of what defines New Devon. For those of you that are new to the story, Devon is nearing the completion of its transformation to a U.S. oil growth company, allowing us to focus entirely on our world-class oil assets in the Delaware Basin, Powder River, Eagle Ford and STACK. The simplification of our portfolio unleashes the potential of our U.S. oil assets, which reside in a very best parts of the best oil plays in all in North America where we possess a multi-decade inventory of high return growth opportunities.","With these advantaged attributes, New Devon is positioned to deliver sustainable growth and thrive in today's commodity price environment. This is evidenced by several value enhancing accomplishments year-to-date. First, oil growth continues to exceed our plan, and we are now raising our full-year production outlook for the second time this year to a 19% growth rate. This represents a 400 basis point improvement compared to our original budget expectations heading into the year. Importantly, the strong well productivity driving oil growth higher is complemented with a step change in capital efficiency, resulting in a $50 million reduction in our 2019 capital outlook. Keep in mind, our 2019 capital budget already had $200 million in efficiencies built in it compared to 2018. So far this year, we have brought online 20% more wells for 10% less capital compared to 2018. Anyway you slice it, these are outstanding results. We have also taken action to materially improve our corporate cost structure. Our operating G&A cost savings initiatives are exceeding the plan by a wide margin and now we're on pace to achieve more than 70% of those $780 million annual savings target by year-end.","The impact of the savings plan is massive with a PV10 benefit over the next decade of more than $4 billion. This is equivalent to roughly 25% of our current enterprise valuation. This capital and cost discipline translated into free cash flow in the quarter. And coupled with our accretive sale of Canada, we have achieved nearly $3 billion of excess cash inflows this year. With these inflows, we are delivering on our promise to reduce leverage and return capital to shareholders. In fact, our leverage has now declined by 80% from peak levels and we returned more than $4 billion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","All in all, it has been a fantastic start to the year as we have executed a very high level on every single strategic objective underpinning the New Devon. And given the commodity price variability we must navigate through in this space, I firmly believe the investment of appeal of New Devon is further distinguish by our strategic approach to the business. We all know there has been some messy and surprising results in the industry of late, but I want to be clear about our unyielding commitment to excellence, discipline and consistency of results. New Devon's financial driven model is designed to deliver peer-leading returns on invested capital, to generate sustainable cash flow growth and growth rates in cash flow, and to return increasing amounts of cash to shareholders. And as you can see from our recent results, this model is working.","The key to this progressive and balanced operating model is a quality and multi-basin diversity of New Devon's asset portfolio, which has some of the lowest breakeven points in the E&P space. This asset quality and low-cost advantage allows us to build a margin of safety into our operating plans, which is demonstrated by our ability to fully fund our capital program at less than $50 WTI pricing, even after accounting for the recent weakness in gas and NGL strip pricing. With our multi-basin diversity, we have the capability to dynamically allocate capital between opportunities to optimize our rate of return. This flexibility is evident with our recent redeployment of capital from the STACK to higher return opportunities to Delaware and Powder River.","Lastly, to provide an additional level of certainty to our operational execution, we are proactively managing commodity risk through an active hedging program and taken steps to further fortify our balance sheet by aggressively reducing leverage ratios, less than one times net debt to EBITDA. Put it in another way, our operations are now backstopped by a fortress balance sheet.","I want to end my prepared remarks today with a few preliminary thoughts on our outlook for next year. As I mentioned earlier, Devon is trending ahead of plan on all the operational objectives supporting our three-year outlook, and we have significant operating momentum heading into next year. While it is still a bit too early to provide any detailed targets for 2020, I can tell you based off trajectory of our business, I expect efficiencies to continue to lower our breakeven capital funding levels and to further improve our corporate level returns.","Furthermore, given our low maintenance capital, we have the substantial flexibility to deliver a desirable combination of both free cash flow and highly competitive oil growth rates at today's strip pricing. More specifically at the asset level, we plan to allocate more capital to the Delaware to better leverage the well productivity and capital efficiencies this franchise asset is delivering, and we will continue to tailor STACK activity to the current commodity price environment. As our planning process firms up, we will provide more specific details on our 2020 outlook this fall. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tony Vaughn, our Chief Operating Officer.","Tony Vaughn","Thank you and good morning. As Dave touched on New Devon's operations are hitting on all cylinders and I'm quite pleased with the positive business momentum we continue to demonstrate in the second quarter. Each asset in our portfolio is executing at a very high level fulfilling its respective role in our portfolio. I am quite proud of the results the organization has generated and the strong performance as a result of the quality of our people and they're are delivering results. For today, I will focus my comments on our Delaware Basin operations, which are the driving force behind New Devon's growth year-to-date.","Our high margin production in the Delaware continue to rapidly advance in the second quarter, growing 58% on a year-over-year basis. The key driver of this robust growth is the high impact wells we have consistently brought online that rank among the very best in all of the industry. In the first half of the year, we commenced production on more than 50 new wells, diversified among the Leonard, Bone Spring, and Wolfcamp formations that achieved average 30 day rates of around 2500 BOEs per day. These high impact wells reflect the quality of our underlying asset base, our staffs' top tier planning and operating capabilities, and our willingness to deploy cutting-edge technologies to improve well productivity, and capital efficiency in the economic for this world-class play.","Looking ahead, as we transition more activity through the Wolfcamp which will account for as much as 65% of our program in coming years, I'm confident in making the prediction that our Wolfcamp well productivity and capital efficiency will improve from the impressive baseline we have established this past year.","Furthermore, with the substantial amount of acreage trades we have completed in the state line area, our future results will benefit from higher working interest in these high impact operated areas and from less exposure to certain lower returning non-operated activity scattered across the basin. With this world-class leasehold position in the Delaware, our team has successfully transitioned to full-field development across a significant portion of our core areas. Our outstanding results year-to-date are benefiting from the learning's obtained from the appraisal work we performed in prior years. Through this appraisal activity and our work in other plays across the company, we have a strong understanding of the subsurface that allows us to identify the best landing zones, understand parent-child dynamics, along with the appropriate well density per section and deploy optimize completion designs to capitalize on that knowledge.","Importantly, through this process, we have learned how to better size and scale these projects to optimize capital efficiency and returns. Our go-forward development projects are striking a healthy balance between present value and rate of return delivering an optimal outcome for shareholders. Overall, as our results indicate, we are well up on the learning curve and are very confident in our Delaware asset. Specifically in the Wolfcamp formation, which will be our most active target going forward, we have a very good understanding of lateral and vertical connectivity. We have settled on a development spacing of about 4 to 8 wells per landing zone depending on the oil column, pressure connectivity, and the subsurface variability in Southeast New Mexico. Our recent success with our Fighting Okra and Flagler projects are examples of this pragmatic spacing approach with strong returns. Importantly with our significant acreage position, we have the depth of inventory to deliver top tier results in the Delaware Basin for many years to come.","At today's drilling pace, the currently identified 2,000 higher return risk locations we have identified equate to 16 years of operated inventory. This inventory is a result of a detailed subsurface evaluation across our entire position rather than generalized acreage math. With a depth of STACK play resource across the Delaware, we expect our high return inventory to continue to expand as we capture additional efficiencies and further delineate the rich geologic column across our entire acreage footprint.","Now, I'd like to transition to a story line that's often overlooked, but critical to our recent success in the Delaware and that is the work we have performed in the field to improve the profile of our base production decline. So far year-to-date, our gross operated base production has outperformed our budgeted expectations by approximately 10%. This dramatic outperformance was accomplished through the use of leading-edge data analytics that has helped to minimize downtime in the field. We have also successfully boosted existing well productivity through proactive gas lift, rod pump optimization while reducing maintenance cost. This thoughtful and innovative work is delivering some of the best returns and value uplift in the portfolio with minimal cost. Lastly, I want to conclude my remarks in the Delaware by highlighting the good work that we have performed to maximize the value of our barrels produced. Beginning with our oil realizations, a major victory for us has been the avoidance of price deducts associated with the new West Texas Light index. We have leveraged our operating scale and acreage dedications in the area to attain multiyear contractual guarantees that ensure we receive Midland WTI pricing with gravity protection up to 60 degree API.","Coupled with a good work of our marketing teams have done in the hedging and firm transport front, our light oil realizations are near WTI pricing levels and importantly the regional gas price weakness experienced by the market has been mitigated by our attractive basis swap position. On the cost side of the equation in the Delaware, we have also been able to lower expenses and enhance our margins through the scalable field level infrastructure our teams have built out over the past several years.","This foresight has helped us reduce per unit LOE costs by more than 60% from peak levels. One of the most meaningful sources of LOE savings is the extensive water infrastructure we have proactively built out. We now have nearly all of our produced water connected to pipes. The infrastructure is fully integrated with 8 recycling facilities, 40 operated saltwater disposal wells, and several third party water systems. With this infrastructure, we avoid the extremely high expense of trucking in the remote desert of Southeast New Mexico that can easily exceed a couple of dollars per barrel and we're able to source over 80% of our operational water needs from produced water at very low cost.","The bottom line is, is that the hard work and thoughtful planning from our operations is paying off, and our positions allow us to capture additional value per barrel that many of our competitors cannot.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff Ritenour.","Jeff Ritenour","Thanks, Tony. I'd like to spend a few minutes today discussing the progress we've made advancing our financial strategy and briefly provide context on several key metrics that are improving within the updated 2019 outlook we issued last night. A good place to start today is with our improving financial performance for the quarter. Our operating cash flow increased 23% year-over-year to $623 million. This level of cash flow fully funded our capital requirements and generated nearly $60 million of free cash flow for the quarter. With the free cash flow, our business generated coupled with the proceeds from the sale of Canada, Devon's cash on hand increased to $3.8 billion at the end of June.","Subsequent to quarter end, we utilized a portion of this cash on hand to redeem $1.5 billion of low premium senior note that were due in 2021 and 2022. With this redemption activity, Devon has now completely cleared its debt maturity runway until late 2025. Given our strong liquidity, we expect to reduce additional debt in the second half of 2019. We will finalize the size and timing of our debt reduction activity in the near future, but we are well on our way to achieving our debt reduction goal in addition to debt reduction. Another key financial priority is our ongoing share repurchase program, which is the largest program by a wide margin in the E&P space. Since the program began in 2018, we have repurchased a 125 million shares at a total cost of $4.4 billion and we are on pace to reduce our outstanding share count by nearly 30% by year-end.","To advance our share repurchase activity in the second half of 2019, we expect to utilize cash on hand to reach our goal of $5 billion by year-end. Any upside from higher commodity prices or asset sales would be earmarked for additional return of capital to shareholders. I'll wrap up my comments today by covering a few key guidance items from our updated 2019 outlook. This updated outlook reflects the improvements of our retained business -- excuse me, reflects the improvements our retained business has achieved year-to-date and incorporates the impact of Canada's restatement to discontinued operations.","On the production front, as Dave touched on earlier, our light oil growth is running at least 400 basis points ahead of our original budgeted expectations. For the second half of the year, we expect the strongest oil growth to occur in the 4th quarter, driven by the timing of activity in the Delaware. This production profile positions us with strong volume momentum heading into 2020. Importantly, we are delivering this incremental oil growth with better than expected well productivity and capital efficiency. Because of this positive trend, we are lowering the midpoint of our capital spending outlook in 2019 by $50 million to a range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.","We also continue to make substantial progress on the cost reduction front. With a scalable growth we are achieving in the Delaware and the Powder River, coupled with the benefits of Canada exiting the portfolio, we project total company-per-unit LOE cost to improve 15% versus our original budget. Our G&A initiatives have also delivered a steady cadence of successful cost reductions year-to-date. We estimate that we have captured approximately $190 million of overhead savings to date on a run rate basis. And this momentum is projected to reduce G&A by more than 15% versus our original budget. With the progress we've made year-to-date, we are well on our way to attaining more than 70% of our $300 million, 3-year savings goal by the end of 2019.","Shifting the interest expense with the $1.5 billion debt redemption we completed at the end of July, we are lowering our net financing cost forecast by approximately $50 million to a range of $250 to $270 million. All in all, we are executing at a very high level on the key financial objectives underpinning our 3-year plan. We have significant operational momentum heading into 2020, and we are positioned to deliver free cash flow, and attractive growth.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott for Q&A .","Scott Coody","Thanks, Jeff. We will now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have further questions, you can re-prompt if time permits. With that operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning. You mentioned that you're now in call it pure development mode on the Delaware Basin. So I just wondering if you could talk about some of the implications for capital efficiency wise. I perceive that your capital efficiency has improved but maybe give us some more details on what's going on there and also maybe you could shed some light on the acreage, [indiscernible], supplies that you could get, some acreage in that neck of the woods and Todd, which has been really productive rock?","Dave Hager","Good morning, Arun. This is Dave. I'm going to start off with just a summary comment here and then we'll turn over to John Raines, who is our Delaware Basin, Vice President of that business unit to give some detailed comments about what you asked. What I think that is, you hit on the key, one of the key elements about New Devon that we have to continue to emphasize, is that in the Delaware Basin and -- most of our plays. We have moved out of an era where we're doing quite a bit of the appraisal work and moving into more, a much higher percentage that's pure development work. That leads to increased capital efficiency, lowering of the well cost, growing the best wells in the best zones, higher rates. It also obviously allows us to lower the well cost, as we have consistent capital, our consistent rigs in the same area.","And so you see higher quality results and you see very consistent results. We've demonstrated that clearly with the first two quarters of results in 2019, and we will continue to deliver on that in the future. So with that, I'll turn it over to John to answer more details about what that means.","John Raines","Yes, this is John. Thanks, Arun, for the question. It's a good one, it's one, it's a story I'm pretty excited to tell. I think to properly tell the story, I'll take you a little bit back to 2018. So if you go back to 2018, specifically with respect to our Wolfcamp, we really leaned in on developing two mile laterals and when we did that, we had a lot of learning's from these two mile laterals. And I'll talk about some of those specifically. Drilling as you noted in the ops report, we've improved our performance by 20% on drilled feet per day. These improvements are largely driven by moving away from a pure slim hole designed to a slightly larger hole and casing sizes. The result has seen better tool reliability that are ROP or rate of penetration and significantly reduced NPT. On completions as noted, we've seen about a 40% improvement in feet per day.","The real driver here is much more consistent work with our dedicated frac crews, and we've also engineered certain more prevalent problems out of the system. To date, we've seen fewer horsepower, wireline, [indiscernible] sleeve issues. That again we're much more prevalent in the past and this has significantly reduced our NPT. I'd also note on completions that we've reduced our flat time. So our flat time is essentially the time it takes to swap wells on a zipper job or to rig up and rig down. And to say that differently, we've basically substantially improved our onsite logistics. And then finally, for facilities, we've successfully deployed our first standardized train design on our Flagler project versus our 2018 baseline, this project delivered facilities at a per well cost of roughly 50% versus our baseline. This new designs really brought some much-needed standardization to our facilities and the simpler designed as a result in less equipment and associated cost, much lower construction costs, and other supply chain savings.","I'd say if you had to look at our total costs, in addition to just the cycle times we've mentioned in our operations report, by year-end, we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to reduce our non-Wolfcamp wells 10% to 15% total. And that does include some larger completion designs on some of those wells. And if we look at Wolfcamp, we're really striving towards a 15% to 20% type of reduction. So, I'm very proud of the work that the team has done there.","Arun Jayaram","Acreage trade?","John Raines","Yes, Arun. I think your second question was around acreage trades, and I bet you're more specifically referring to the 5500 acres at Todd. And so this is also a pretty fun story to tell. And I think it shows how much success you can create by having a really intentional effort. So the 5500 acres, again to go back in time has to be considered as a multi-year effort. If you really go back to the Todd area. This was an area that the team identified early on as being a good zip code. I think I've referred to the parent Boundary Raider well being drilled several years ago, even on a previous call. So it was really at that point that the team got pretty creative about consolidating our position here and upping our working interest. As for the 5550 acres itself, this is really a product of the team being creative in the land team in particular, being able to execute on our consolidation strategy. This acreage did not come to Devon via one or two large deals, rather this acreage came to Devon over the course of three years and over the course of more than a dozen trades. These trades ranged in size from a smallest 40 acres to as large as 2,000 acres. So you can see that the team has really been effective in the hand-to-hand combat out here.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just my follow up is that you guys have put out previously called the 12% to 17% I believe, the oil growth target from the New Devon properties. This morning or last night you highlighted more capital going to the Delaware from the STACK. So I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more thoughts on initially how you're thinking about how much capital would shift from the Delaware. Is it rig line or two or just maybe some broad thoughts on that?","Dave Hager","Well, we're still working through the details of that. And we're doing a lot of modeling work on our 2020 capital program to determine what provides the optimum efficiencies. But we did direction, in my comments I did directionally guide that Delaware capital will continue to increase in 2020 and obviously rightfully so when you see the outstanding results that we're delivering there. And we are delivering good results by the way in other parts of our portfolio. It's not that others are failing, but yes this is succeeding so well and that's why we're able to increase our production guidance and lower our capital guidance. So we don't -- I can't give you specifics at this point. We're continuing to look at various scenarios and obviously it's a great place to be. We'll get an even more capital efficiencies than you originally estimated to think about what the options you have when it comes to our 2020 capital program.","Arun Jayaram","Great, thanks a lot, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Dave, I'm not sure who wants to take this one, but just looking at the cash margin disclosure that you've given us, which is obviously very, very helpful. The highest margin in the portfolio right now is in the Powder River. So I'm wondering if you can just give us an update there as to how that translates to returns at the well level because obviously embryonic play one assumes the well costs are still being optimized and just discuss how you see the evolution of that play as it relates to the risk inventory and just how relative incremental capital allocation might evolve towards the Powder over time?","Dave Hager","Yes, you're right, Doug and good morning. It's the -- the Powder has the highest oil percentage of any of the plays that we're involved in; and so that play does have very high margins associated with it. And obviously, it's a very sensitive than to oil prices that earns, that you generate on that play. We're extremely pleased with the results we're getting so far in the Powder where we've now entered into the full development mode on the low risk Turner play. That will constitute the bulk of the growth that we're going to realize over the next three years. And then we're excited as well about the Niobrara. We have not said too much about our first Niobrara well. We're just following that well back at this point, but so far so good I would say. One thing to be cautious about by the way on the Niobrara is what you really can't compare our Niobrara to other industry players' Niobrara out there, we are at the, from a thermal maturity standpoint, we are in heart of the oil window throughout the geologic column, including the Niobrara on our acreage, and that is not the case for some of the industry, other industry players that have a much more gassy count Niobrara.","So we're excited although again that's the smaller part of our overall growth story over the next three years. But the returns are very competitive with those in the rest of portfolio and that's why we have four rigs working out there right now.","Doug Leggate","Just on the risk inventory Dave, what's, what would you say is the current gross inventory if you like versus the, I guess you are 100 locations that you've identified to date.","Dave Hager","I'm going to turn it over to give you to Wade Hutchings to give you the inventory number.","Wade Hutchings","Good morning, Doug. As you see in our main inventory disclosure slide, the high quality risk inventory for the Rockies are sitting about 650 gross operated well. And again, I'll just remind you on all of that inventory, we've stripped out any non-operated locations. We've also stripped out any risk locate, our unrisked locations and we're just focused in on those locations that we think we can drive high quality returns on. The inventory is a balance between all of those targets that Dave noted a moment ago, including some very high return Parkman and Teapot locations. And so when you look at it from an unrisked basis, the numbers obviously get a lot bigger. Those are very kind of preliminary risks high quality locations.","When we look at it from a total unrisked basis, we see several thousand Rockies operated locations as potential. And again, we're in the middle of trying to unlock that today with some of the appraisal work we're doing in Niobrara. We would note also there are several other prospective targets that other companies are testing. We're watching that very closely as well.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answers, guys. My follow-up hopefully is a quick one Dave that just the reallocation of capital from the stock. And I guess the Eagle Ford is back to seeing some activity it seems. Can you just clarify are these, should we think about these assets just as ex growth or absolute decline in particularly in the stock? On a similar context, just what are the triggers that might cause you to change activity levels if oil stays under pressure?","Dave Hager","Doug and for everyone, I think it's important to understand that we really have a dynamic capital allocation model, and what that means is that we really look at what are generating the highest returns throughout our portfolio. And we obviously take into account commodity price, commodity prices when we make that decision. We have the ability with the inventory levels that we have to grow any of the assets if we so choose. But we don't think about it so much about whether or not we are growing an individual asset or not. We allocate our capital out of what we consider to be the highest return opportunities and in a growth as an out, as an output of that given where we think we're getting the highest returns. If we were less dynamic frankly with our capital, we could just, we could allocate it more proportionate to all of our plays so that they all grow because we have the inventory to do that, but we don't think that's the way to optimize the value of the company. So with this, obviously we've had some weakness in natural gas and NGL prices here. And with that, we've made the decision to reduce the activity somewhat in the STACK and to reallocate that capital out to the Delaware and the Rockies given the higher returns in this point.","Doug Leggate","Again, I appreciate the answers Dave. Thanks a lot for your time.","Dave Hager","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning everyone.","Dave Hager","Good morning, Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai","Good morning. My first question is on capital allocation. Can you just discuss how you weighed whether to reallocate that $50 million in STACK CapEx versus just taking it out of the schedule and reducing the 2019 budget by $100 million instead of $50 million? And I know it's a pretty small amount. But I mean there's a lot of good things going on. You're on track to meet or exceed your oil production targets, you raised oil guide already twice this year. You've got the 3-year plan that already has a competitive growth rate. And I guess one can argue that the market is not paying for growth, but for discipline. So I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about this because I know spreadsheet math is different from how things work operationally.","Dave Hager","I'm glad you appreciate that. And yes, it's -- I think you could make the argument frankly not just about that $50 million. But you can make the argument about capital in general. But as the -- what the right levels of capital are in the program, we did it to optimize the capital efficiencies that we have in both the Delaware and the Powder River Basin to optimize returns. It's to optimize the interplay between drilling rigs and completion crews and to maximize the efficiency, between those. And so we felt that that was going to maximize returns in the right decision to do. I think it's a totally separate discussion that you can ask of us or everyone else, every other E&P companies what their right level of capital allocation is and what's the right mix of competitive free cash flow yield and growth. And certainly, we think we're in a position to deliver on both of those and that's certainly what we're looking at going forward into 2020.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. And then, that's very helpful. Thank you. My second question in terms of next year. I know you're not giving any detailed guidance or anything right now. But can you talk about generally what your appetite is for activity in the STACK if strip pricing holds and I'm pretty sure this isn't a target. But how much activity is required just to hold that asset flat these days, and then are there any overriding considerations in terms of having to maintain a specific minimal amount of activity in the play? It's pretty mature, so I'm guessing there is no real HPT requirements or anything, but you might have some other transport agreements or something?","Dave Hager","No, there is no firm transportation to drive that capital allocation, there is no held by production issues at all. It is simply optimizing returns and again it's optimizing returns across the entire portfolio. We are currently having the bulk of our activity in the, what we call the volatile oil portion of the play and those returns and we've -- on our revised type curve that we put out previously, we're meeting or exceeding those and are driving down the cost of those wells extremely efficiently, noticed returns compete for capital with everything else in the portfolio. Obviously, as we move outside of that in future years more into what would be considered the gas condensate window and even perhaps the dry gas window, the resources there, the resource is very strong and the opportunities are there. But with the recent weakness in natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices, that's why we reallocated the $50 million out, and we're looking very closely at any activity outside of that, and considering whether we want to bring in joint venture partners on a small or a larger scale to help us with any activity there to really dramatically increase our capital efficiency and make those opportunities to compete for capital.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Dave Hager","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Paul Grigel","Hi, good morning. Going back to the commentary on the base decline mitigation was interesting. I was wondering if you could talk about further upside that might be seen through that if that's been applied to other plays within the portfolio and then maybe the overall impact to the corporate decline rate that could have either initially or over time.","Dave Hager","Yes, Paul, let's say that's an area of focus that we've put in the company probably about 4 to 5 years ago. And I think over time we've described our commitment to being data driven. During that process, we've installed automation in virtually all of our producing assets across the portfolio. We have what we call decision support centers in each of our producing areas. They're manned 24-7 generally. There is a source of all this data driven work, we're actually now look, having the ability to look at information on all of our artificial lift equipment, and we can spot pending trouble on some of our artificial lift pumps and gas lift operations. We have the ability to predict failure as opposed to just running towards failure. We have the ability to bring the replacement pumps to location, have the crews available and ready to go before wells actually go offline.","So the guys have done a really good job of incorporating the stop process across the organization. You heard us talk a little bit or described what is going on and the good work that the Delaware Basin team is doing. A lot of that same work is happening across the area, other areas as well. So we think it's material to the business as John describe having 10% uplift in our base operations, with virtually very little cost associated with that is an increment, I'm not sure all companies appreciate and then focus on. So, I appreciate your interest in that as well. It's a good quality work by our operating people.","Paul Grigel","Definitely, definitely interesting topic. And then I guess maybe changing a little bit to 2020 and just kind of the capital efficiency that Dave, you mentioned earlier. As you guys look going forward on 1Q you were very clear that you would not outspend capital this year and that's clear in the reduction. As we move to 2020 with ongoing capital efficiencies, what are some of the sources that you guys see for additional upside that you can drive either on the capital side or on the operating cost side into 2020?","Dave Hager","Well, obviously, as we move into full development mode, we are going to continue to drive down the costs on the capital side.. I think John Raines already outlined of how he sees additional cost improvement in the Wolfcamp. And I would anticipate that we are going to see drilling and completion cost improvement throughout the portfolio, because when you're in full development mode, it's just by nature that you get better and better as you do more repetitive type activities. So, I would anticipate that you would see that even more. Tony, I don't know if you want to answer a little bit on the LOE side. But I think the good news, one of the good news things I can add here you'll find a little bit is a lot of our infrastructure is in place and so we are able to add barrels with very little incremental cost, because of all the vast majority of the infrastructure is already in place for our, once we increase our production.","Tony Vaughn","Yes, I guess right Dave. And I think it even goes back prior to that is we've been very committed to building contiguous acreage positions in all of our core areas and being in the heart of the play. While that is just kind of background work, John described a little bit of that in the Delaware Basin. But we've done a really good job of coring up our operations in all the areas that we work. That was purposeful. It allows us to build a more integrated infrastructure system there. We're continuing to optimize our drilling work and showing some great work there you see hence of that across our operating report that we've published where the drillers are reducing drill times, are doing that through new design work that they're doing and less trouble time that we've had in the past.","We're also in the process of seeing a lot of technology and innovation on the completion side of the business. We're tending to stretch out our stages, reduce volumes, increase the number of clusters, and we've even got technical guys that are working on very detailed work on the size and placement of perforations. And that is ability for our guys to both manage cost and deliver probably some of the best returns in the industry as shown on one of our exhibits. So, there is continuing to be a lot of very thoughtful technical work across the business. We're also doing this on the facility design work. We're standardizing and marginalizing all of our equipment there. So, almost every component of our operations, we're seeing some really thoughtful granular work as delivering the last couple of quarter's outperformance that I think you're seeing there. Coupled with that, we have a supply chain group that is doing some really good quality work. I'm not sure Jeff, you may want to describe a little bit about the...","Jeff Ritenour","Yes, Tony, I was going to add some commentary. On top of all the great operational things that Tony highlighted, the teams are working and the efficiencies that we're gaining, on top of that as you look forward to 2020 and 2021, the supply chain group along with our operations teams have done a great job of driving down price on the services that we're procuring. In fact, we're working in kind of a deflationary environment at the moment and expect that to continue for the, for the second half of this year. So that's going to be a nice tailwind for us potentially as we move into 2020 and 2021 relative to the expectations that we had for our 3-year plan Initially.","Paul Grigel","That's helpful. I just want to clarify and real one, real fit, real fast excuse me, on development mode. Is there any risk to lumpiness on production or is it sufficiently spread out?","Dave Hager","It looks like we're going to have a really strong Q4 and that's going to be based on the higher, slightly higher capital spend that we have in Q3. That is going to drive really high production there. The only concern I've heard from our, seen from a couple of reports as well, does that drive down on 2020. And I guess I'd be willing to prepare a little spreadsheet for anybody while bringing on production a month early is a good thing, if that's what ends up happening then I don't get too worried about whether it comes on in December or January, quite frankly I think it's a big value driver or better. Anyway they -- there, we do anticipate a very strong end of the year. That's going to give us a lot of operational momentum as we go into 2020.","Paul Grigel","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Bob Brackett","Yes, Dave, beginning of your prepared comments, you mentioned a low maintenance capital. Could you talk about what the maintenance CapEx is and what that base decline that it correlates to is?","Dave Hager","Yes. The maintenance capital is one, about $1.4 billion and that's maintenance capital essentially to keep EBITDA flat. And the base decline on the assets overall is in the low 30's, a little bit higher on the oil side of the business that factors into that.","Bob Brackett","Great, thanks for that.","Dave Hager","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Simmons Energy. Your line is open .","Ryan Todd","Good, thanks. Maybe on one on cash return. You've done, you talked a lot of wood over the last couple of years on debt reduction and buyback as you reach sort of the end of the near-term targets you've given on those two programs towards the end of this year. Looking forward, how does dividend growth compete going forward and how much, how important of a factor do you view the dividend -- the potential for dividend growth in terms of kind of long-term investability by the market?","Jeff Ritenour","Hey, Ryan, this is Jeff. Yes. I appreciate the question. Absolutely, the dividends are critical tool that we're utilizing to return cash to shareholders. We've done that for some time. We've had nice growth in the dividend. As you've heard us talk about our kind of dividend policy that we discussed with the Board, our thought processes really centers around the payout ratio, and so we've kind of designed the dividend to be kind of a 5% to 10% payout ratio, relative to our cash flow from operations. We think that that's competitive with our peer group. We want to make sure that we -- number 1, we can sustain the dividend on a go-forward basis. And then of course grow it from there. So, to the extent that we execute as we've talked about on our share repurchase program the remainder of this year and the debt reduction targets that we've outlined as well, we will certainly go back and discuss with the Board at the end of this year what the opportunity is to do additional share repurchases and think about additional dividend growth in that -- in those two concepts together.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. And then maybe just a quick one, any, I know the data room is open any comments you can make on the initial level of interest that you're seeing in the Barnett and whether it's likely to go as a single package or potentially multiples?","Jeff Ritenour","Brian, this is Jeff again, I'm just going to introduce David Harris, who leads our business development and E&P Group and he can give you some color on the process there.","Ryan Todd","Thanks.","Unidentified Company Representative","Good morning, Ryan. This is David. Thanks for your question. Yes, we have -- the data room process has been really active. I think the one thing I would highlight to you is it is a much deeper and broader mix of participants compared to what we saw recently on our Canadian process. And as we've indicated, we expect to get bids by the end of the 3rd quarter. These are, I'll remind you these are attractive low decline assets with access to premium Gulf Coast pricing, and we've really seen a lot of interest from the market participants given those attributes.","Ryan Todd","Okay, thank you.","Unidentified Company Representative","In terms of your second question on, is it likely to go as a single package, obviously we're open to whatever maximizes value for our shareholders. Given the operating synergies across the asset base and how blocky it is, I think it's more likely to be attractive to a buyer as a single package.","Ryan Todd","That's helpful, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Dingman from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Neil Dingman","Good morning. My question sort of takes on what they were just asking. You all certainly have done a lot for shareholder returns here now in the near term in the last several quarters. But my question would be this market continues to stay rational as it is. I'm just wondering how do you balance, do you re-up the shareholder buyback program or how do you balance that versus the growth program that you're outlining?","Dave Hager","Well, we are going to stick to our, I think the overall message first and foremost is that we are executing from an operational perspective at a very high level. We are going to continue to stick to that plan and we're very confident that that execution is going to continue. We think that we have the asset base, and there is a cost structure that we can deliver both, that we can deliver free cash flow yield. It's competitive, not only within the space but within other industrial companies, while still delivering significant growth. So, we are planning and our plans are based on delivering both of those. With that overall thought, that's part of the work that we're doing in regards to 2020 and beyond is what is the optimum level to ensure that we deliver on those metrics. So but the good news is with our low breakeven, the continued increasing capital efficiency, that continue reduction of the cost structure, and the growth in revenue is going to come as we grow our light oil production, we think we're as well positioned as just about any company out there in the space to deliver on that.","Neil Dingman","Great answer. And then just one follow-up, around the reallocation of your Mid-Con, the Delaware and the PRB, I'm just wondering other factors that you foresee in the Mid-Con that would cause you to bring some capital back to that play or is it just I mean you mentioned about just you're certainly return driven. Do you envision the Delaware and PRB just continuing to have higher returns?","Dave Hager","Well, I think currently, again to emphasize it as we -- the current activity we have going on in the volatile oil window is competitive right now. It is as we move out of the volatile oil window in future, are those returns going to compete and certainly in the weaker natural gas and NGL market on a ground floor basis right now that they're going to struggle to compete for capital as well as so with the other place. But as I also have mentioned and we're not being too specific here, we just can't, that we see opportunities because of our strong acreage position that there are opportunities on both the small and perhaps even larger scale to bring in capital to that play to make those economics competitive that we would have activity outside the volatile oil window that would take advantage of these partner joint venture type opportunity.","Neil Dingman","That's great detail. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our final question today comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.","David Heikkinen","Good morning guys, and congratulations on the process and progress. I've been thinking about kind of clear and simple communications for investors a lot, and I was thinking through like, why don't you all just say something simple like as we reduce our interest cost, we'll transfer those savings to our shareholders through an increased dividend. I just imagine like the immediate capitalization of $60 million of interest from the quarter into your stock to that increase in dividends and as you move forward with your plans on cost reduction. It'll just be like a very simple method for people to understand where you're going.","Jeff Ritenour","David, this is Jeff. I guess I would, I guess my commentary would be is that we believe it is, we are delivering a pretty simple message, which we've been pretty clear as we're generating cost savings, whether it's on the interest side or on the operating cost side, and the capital efficiencies that we're delivering on the operational side. That's ultimately generating the free cash flow that we projected in our 3-year plan. And then the mechanism that we're returning that to shareholders is through both the dividend and the share repurchase. So we think that's important to have a balance there. Obviously, our first priority has been to get the leverage down to the level that we felt comfortable with. And we're going to get that accomplished, obviously here over the next 6 to 9 months. Beyond that, then to the extent that we are generating the free cash flow that we expect, we'll deliver that in the form of share repurchases in the dividend.","And so again we've, I guess I would just say we feel like we have a pretty clear message on that front. We've done over $4.4 billion of share repurchase to-date and grown the dividend in the last year. So, clearly that cash flow is going back to shareholders.","David Heikkinen","Yes, I guess that optionality in the group is one thing that we hear a lot and optionality leads to some uncertainty. I appreciate the understanding and what you all are doing.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. I will turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks.","Scott Coody","Well, thank you I appreciate everyone's interest in Devon today and if there is any other questions for -- obviously, the IR team will be around all day long. So feel free -- thank you once again for your time today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Vincent W. White","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everybody, to today's second quarter 2012 earnings call and webcast. Today's call will follow our usual format. I'll provide a few preliminary items and then turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels for his review. Then Dave Hager, Head of Exploration and Production, will provide the operations update. And following that, our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Agosta, will finish up with a review of our financial results and outlook. After Jeff's call, we'll have a Q&A session. And our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols, as well as Darryl Smette, Head of Marketing and Midstream are with us today to help out with the Q&A session.","As usual, we'll conclude the call after an hour, so if we do not get to your questions during the Q&A, we'll be around for the remainder of the day to answer your questions. A replay of this call will also be available later today on our website.","During the call today, we're going to update some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results that we've seen in the first half of the year and our revised outlook for the second half of 2012. In addition to the updates that we're providing during the call, we will file an 8-K later today containing the details of our updated 2012 estimates. To access this guidance, just click on the guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of the Devon website.","Please note that all references today to our plans, forecast, expectations and estimates are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we always strive to give you the very best information possible, there are numerous factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. A discussion of risk factors relating to these estimates can be found in the 8-K that we are filing later today. Also, in today's call, we'll reference certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we use these measures, we're required to provide related disclosures and those are also available on the Devon website.","Looking briefly at our earnings for the quarter, the First Call mean estimate for Devon's second quarter earnings was $0.81 per share. That compares to actual non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.55 per share. So clearly, we had a big earnings miss for the second quarter. By far, the largest driver of the miss was wider product price differentials. These low price realizations also negatively impacted our midstream earnings. And to a much lesser degree, our results were negatively impacted by production interruptions that reduced our second quarter production by 16,000 barrels per day, average, for the full quarter. The most significant occurrence was a longer-than-expected partial shutdown for maintenance and repairs at our Bridgeport facility in north Texas. That work has now been completed. This reduced our NGLs production by approximately 10,000 barrels per day in the quarter, while disruptions at third-party facilities in the Permian Basin, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions contributed to the reduced volumes as well. As of today, all of the issues that interrupted production have been resolved.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to John Richels.","John Richels","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. While our second quarter earnings fell short of our expectations, when you look beyond the near-term challenges, we stayed right on track with the execution of our long-term strategic plan. We continued to deliver strong growth in oil production, driving company-wide oil production up 26% over the year-ago period and up 5% over the first quarter of the year. In spite of unusually weak Canadian oil price realizations, oil revenue accounted for almost 60% of our upstream revenues in the second quarter. Given the weakness in the NGLs market, it's worth noting that ethane accounted for only about 4% of our second quarter sales.","In April, we closed our $2.5 billion joint venture agreement with Sinopec. You might recall that the transaction price included a $900 million cash payment at closing, recovering significantly more than 100% of our land and exploration costs associated with these assets. The remaining $1.6 billion drilling carry will fund 80% of the capital requirements on the joint venture assets over the next few years. Also, in spite of weak second quarter price realizations for much of our production, operating cash flow for the quarter exceeded $1.4 billion and when you combine that with the proceeds from our Sinopec joint venture, total cash inflows approached $2.3 billion.","Additionally, we added some attractive hedges, which will stabilize cash flows in the second half of the year. We now have approximately 85% of our oil production locked in, with an average protected floor of $97 per barrel and 65% of our natural gas production protected at $3.76 per Mcf. And finally, we executed a robust oil-focused capital program, while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets and best liquidity positions in the peer group. We exited the quarter with $7 billion of cash and short-term investments and a net debt-to-cap ratio of about 14%.","As many of you are already aware, we also have some exciting news on the exploration front. Earlier this morning, we announced a $1.4 billion agreement with Sumitomo to explore and develop our 650,000 net acre position in the Cline and the Midland Wolfcamp shale plays. Sumitomo will invest $340 million in cash at closing and receive a 30% interest in these properties. Additionally, Sumitomo will fund a little over $1 billion, it's actually $1.025 billion of Devon's share of future drilling costs associated with these plays. This agreement will materially enhance our future returns and accelerate our evaluation and development of these assets, while leaving us with a land position approaching 0.5 million acres that represents a very significant growth opportunity for Devon. And finally, like our joint venture with Sinopec, this partnership affords us the flexibility to invest more of our operating cash flow in our development opportunities and to pursue additional oil prospects already identified by our technical staff.","For years, we've enjoyed a strong working relationship with Sumitomo. Sumitomo is really a terrific company and we look forward to working together for years to come through this mutually beneficial joint venture.","And speaking of additional oil prospects, during our Analyst Day in April, we mentioned that we were working to put together a significant leasehold position in an oil prospect that we were not yet ready to disclose. Today, with that acreage position largely assembled, it's now ripe for disclosure. It's in a play that's received a lot of attention lately with some very encouraging results. We've acquired an additional 400,000 net acres in the Mississippian trend outside of the area that's covered by our Sinopec joint venture. When you combine our position and the Sinopec JV with this new position, we now have over 545,000 net acres in this emerging oil play. So just to reiterate, this 400,000 net acre position that we're announcing today is not currently part of any joint venture. So between the Cline Shale position in the Midland Basin and our position in the Mississippian play, we have about a million acres net to Devon in 2 oil plays that appear to be working very, very well. We believe that this gives us years of oil growth beyond the light oil development projects that are currently driving our oil growth in the United States.","Shifting gears now, we've received a number of questions recently regarding the current state of the market for natural gas liquids and whether this will impact our capital allocation. Since last quarter's call, market conditions for natural gas liquids have deteriorated further. Inventory builds over the last 3 months far exceeded industry expectations. This was due to a variety of factors. There were delays in petrochemical plant turnarounds, we had extended downtime at 2 Mont Belvieu Fractionation facilities and we had a delay in the ramp-up of a petrochemical plant that's expanding its ability to run on ethane.","Given these higher inventory levels and new NGL supplies being brought onto the market, our outlook for NGL realizations has deteriorated somewhat since our last quarterly call and Jeff is going to provide some detailed guidance later in the call about those realizations.","Looking beyond 2012, with new takeaway pipelines and fractionation capacity coming online, ethane supply in the market will likely outpace incremental demand until new cracker additions are operational around mid-decade. Since ethane prices track natural gas prices, as long as the natural gas prices remain low, we'd expect ethane prices to also be weak during this period. However, as natural gas prices improve, so should ethane prices.","In addition, as new export capacity along the Gulf for propane becomes available later on this year, we expect to see our overall NGLs price realization stabilize. In any case, our firm transportation agreements and our dedicated fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu will maximize the value of our NGLs production.","Based upon our evolving outlook for price realizations for natural gas and NGLs, our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana programs continue to deliver attractive returns. Of course, in the current pricing environment, most light oil projects are delivering superior returns. And our light oil programs in the Permian and the Mississippian are developing now to the point where we're ready to begin increasing activity levels. We have migrated several rigs to these higher return light oil opportunities and plan to move additional rigs in the second half.","For the full year 2012, we expect to deliver oil production growth in excess of 20% shifting our overall production mix to 40% liquids by year end. We remain on target to meet our guidance of 253 million to 257 million barrels equivalent of production, although we're trending towards the low end of this range due to the gas processing curtailments experienced in the second quarter that Vince discussed earlier in the call.","Looking beyond the current year's activity, we are in the beginning stages of planning for our 2013 capital budget, and while it's a bit premature to provide much in the way of guidance, I can assure you that we will remain focused on maximizing growth and cash flow per share, adjusted for debt. We're fortunate that our existing resource base provides us the flexibility to shift additional capital towards light oil opportunities.","Our existing acreage base comprises some 5 billion barrels of risked oil resource, representing many years of high quality undrilled inventory. In addition, we're leveraging our portfolio through joint ventures to allow us to accelerate that growth.","So in summary, we remain excited about Devon's future and believe that we're well positioned to compete effectively in any business environment. Our measured approach to the business, strong balance sheet and high quality property base all position us to deliver on our long-term business plan.","And so with that, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?","David A. Hager","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. While the second quarter production was impacted by the gas processing disruptions that Vince and John mentioned, we continue to make good progress with the execution of our capital program. We delivered strong oil production growth in both the Permian and Jackfish. We also had encouraging initial well results in some of the new ventures' plays. Before we get to the highlights of the quarter, I'll begin with a quick recap of CapEx. E&P spending totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, bringing E&P capital for the first 6 months to $3.7 billion. Our 2012 capital program is front-end loaded, especially for leasehold expenditures. But in any case, we are tracking toward the higher end of our previous guidance range of $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion. As a reminder, when we close the Sumitomo transaction, we will have received a total of $1.2 billion in cash this year that is not netted against this capital for reporting purposes.","Moving now to specific operating areas, starting in the Permian Basin. Our Permian production averaged a record 58,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, up 21% over the second quarter of 2011. Looking specifically at our Permian oil production, it grew 24% over the same period, with light oil now accounting for nearly 60% of our total Permian volumes. A key driver of our Permian oil growth continues to be our Bone Springs horizontal program in New Mexico. We have 6 rigs running and in the second quarter, we brought 19 Bone Springs wells online, with average 30-day IP rates of 680 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With these wells generating returns north of 50%, they offer some of the highest returning opportunities in our portfolio. To date, we have identified roughly 300 risk locations in play, representing several years of additional growing inventory.","Also, in the Permian, we continue to have very good results from our 2-rig program targeting the Delaware formation. We brought 8 wells online during the second quarter. Of particular note was the Shaqtus 1H that had a 30-day IP rate of 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 1,263 barrels of oil. Like the Bone Springs, this play offers outstanding returns. We have approximately 200 risk locations remaining in the Delaware.","Last quarter, we told you about a successful Wolfcamp horizontal well we drilled in the heart of our Wolfberry acreage located some 80 miles northwest of the Wolfcamp play in the southern Midland Basin. The [indiscernible] 17H had a 30-day IP rate of 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the second quarter, we drilled an encouraging follow-up to this well. After 12 days of production, Natatia [ph] 49H is producing roughly 325 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 280 barrels of oil. These encouraging results were giving us the confidence to take the horizontal Wolfcamp play on our Wolfberry acreage into full development. And we also plan to test the middle Wolfcamp in the same area later this year.","I'll now move to the 2 Permian plays that comprise the joint venture with Sumitomo that we announced this morning. First, in the Cline Shale on the eastern flank of the Midland Basin, we have continued to add acreage and have now assembled some 556,000 net acres in the partnership. We began to assess the potential of this acreage during the second quarter with our first horizontal well in the play. The Stroman Ranch C58 located in Sterling County had a 30-day IP rate of 300 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On most of the frac stages, we utilize gel fracs. However, we did test a couple of stages with slick water, with very good results. Consequently, in our second horizontal well that is currently being completed, we are utilizing slick water for all of the completion stages and expect a higher IP rate. And while it's in the very early stages of the evaluation of our position, we are very encouraged that the Cline Shale with be a highly economic oil play. We will continue to refine our drilling and completion techniques on the remaining wells planned for the second half of this year and keep you updated as we move forward.","In the other play in the Sumitomo JV, the Wolfcamp Shale in the southern Midland Basin where we have 94,000 net acres, we brought 3 Wolfcamp horizontal wells online in the second quarter. These included the Coronado 2H with an average 30-day IP rate of 575 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we tied in our first 7,000-foot lateral completed with a slick water frac. After 22 days of production, the University 52-10H well has averaged 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 575 barrels of oil. We're, obviously, very encouraged by these results. We currently have 2 rigs running in the Wolfcamp Shale and 2 in the Cline. The joint venture with Sumitomo will allow us to accelerate the evaluation and de-risking of these plays. We expect to drill 28 wells in these 2 plays in the remainder of 2012, bringing the total number of wells drilled, or participated in, to 40.","Shifting now to our thermal oil projects in eastern Alberta, aggregate production from our 2 producing Jackfish projects averaged a record 51,100 barrels of oil per day, net of royalties, in the second quarter. Jackfish 1 continued its trend of best-in-class plant reliability and efficiency, achieving a plant utilization rate over the past 12 months of more than 98%. We will bring the Jackfish 1 plant down for scheduled maintenance beginning in early September. This is something we do roughly every 2 years.","We expect the maintenance turnaround to take about 3 weeks. When we restart the plant, it takes about 3 to 4 weeks to ramp production back up to capacity. Accordingly, our net Jackfish 1 production is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day in the second half of 2012. At Jackfish 2, production is on pace to reach more than 25,000 barrels per day, before royalties [ph], by year end and to reach facilities capacity in 2013. Jackfish 3 construction continues to progress well with roughly 40% of the project complete, putting us on track for a start-up around year-end 2014.","At Pike, we filed an application for regulatory approval in late June for the Pike 1 development. The Pike 1 application is for a project with a gross production capacity of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We continue to work with our partner on the details of the development plan and expect to finalize those later this year. We operate Pike with a 50% working interest.","As a reminder, we expect our existing SAGD assets to drive Devon's net thermal oil production to more than 150,000 barrels per day by the end of the decade. On the exploration front in Canada, we continue to evaluate the oil and liquids-rich gas potential across our more than 4 million net acres. Our most encouraging results over the last 18 months of exploratory drilling have been in the Ferrier corridor where Devon has roughly 240,000 net acres prospecting for the Cardium oil, the liquids-rich Glauconite and other lower Cretaceous zones. To date, we have drilled a total of 19 operated horizontal wells in these formations. Average 30-day IP rates have ranged between 300 and 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With drill and complete costs in the $4 million to $6 million range, these wells have strong economics. And we're currently evaluating a potential development plan for these areas.","Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in north Texas. Based upon the early success we are seeing in the Mississippian oil play in Oklahoma, we recently moved 2 of our Barnett rigs and 3 of our Cana rigs to the Mississippian. This leaves us with 10 operated Barnett rigs running in a liquids-rich core and the oil window in Wise County and 12 rigs running in core-rich Cana. As Vince mentioned earlier, our reported volumes were impacted by an extended maintenance turnaround of our Bridgeport natural gas processing plant in the Barnett. In spite of this curtailment, our second quarter net production from the Barnett averaged 1.32 Bcf equivalent per day, up 3% from our second quarter a year ago.","Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in western Oklahoma. In spite of some minor disruptions of third-party processing facilities and a temporary increase in uncompleted wells due to pad drilling, we still achieved an all-time production record at Cana. Second quarter 2012 production increased 48% over the year-ago quarter and 3% over the first quarter of 2012. Cana's second quarter production growth was led by oil and NGL growth of 59% over the year-ago quarter to 3,500 barrels of oil and 10,400 barrels of natural gas liquids per day.","Moving west to the Texas Panhandle. In the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results. We brought 6 operated Granite Wash wells online during the second quarter, with 30-day IP rates averaging 1,270 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We plan to move a fourth rig to the Granite Wash later this year. In addition to some of the very encouraging results in the Cline and Wolfcamp shale plays, we have some updates on some of our other new venture areas.","Looking first at the Ohio Utica, our first 2 wells, 2 horizontal wells, the Eichelberger 1H in Ashland County and the Richman Farms 1H in Medina County, were not encouraging. These wells are located on the northwestern-most acreage. We are currently completing our third well to the south, the Sensibaugh 1H located in southern Knox County. This well offsets our initial Harstine Trust core well. We will continue drilling in a liquids-rich window to the east where industry has about 20 horizontal rigs running.","In the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, we drilled our first 3 wells in the northern portion of our acreage position. The Richman Farms 74H located in East Feliciana parish was brought online in the second quarter with an average 30-day IP rate of just shy of 300 barrels of oil per day. In our next well, we've landed the lateral in a more optimal position and we saw significant improvement in rate. After 20 days of production, the Weyerhaeuser 14H, in St. Helena Parish, has averaged 670 barrels of oil per day from a 5,700-foot lateral. Our third well in the area, the Murphy 63H in West Feliciana Parish, a 4,700-foot lateral, is slated to begin the completion operations early next week. We plan to drill our future Tuscaloosa wells with 8,000-foot laterals. We expect this trend of improving performance to continue as we make additional improvements to our drilling and completions. Reducing costs and improving well performance over time are keys to making this play economic going forward.","In Michigan, results from our first 2, A-1 Carbonate horizontal wells have not been encouraging. Each of these wells appear to be tight. These wells were drilled in close proximity to each other in a central portion of the basin. So our plan, going forward, is to test the A1 in Utica potential on the outer flanks of the basin in the remainder of the year with a 2-rig program.","In the Rockies oil exploration, as we'd previously indicated, we're testing a number of objectives in the Powder River and DJ Basin. Since we last updated you at our Analyst Day, we've drilled 1 well in the Maori, 3 in Niobrara and one in the Codell. All these wells are in various stages of completion. We are currently drilling a follow-up to the successful Turner well we drilled earlier this year. As a reminder, this well had a 30-day IP of 433 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Finally, in the Mississippian oil play located in North-Central Oklahoma, we have now expanded Devon's position to 545,000 net acres, including about 150,000 net acres within the Sinopec JV. The recently added acreage is predominantly north of our initial position in Noble, Osage, Grant and Sumner counties. This is a play that's attracted a great deal of industry attention due to attractive returns, the high quality of oil it produces and the established, relatively industry-friendly regulatory environment in Oklahoma. We currently operate, or have an interest in, 52 Mississippian wells that are drilling, completing or producing. And we're expanding our operations quickly. We have 7 operated rigs running in the play and expect to add additional rigs later this year.","Our results continue to support a tight curve, with a 30-day IP of roughly 300 barrels of oil equivalent per day and an EUR of 300,000 to 400,000 Boe at a cost of $3 million to $3.5 million each, per well. Our 545,000 net acres represents a large position that will add many years of drilling inventory for us. And this is a position that can truly move the needle for a company of Devon's size with net rift [ph] potential of more than 800 million barrels of oil equivalent.","So in summary, our 2012 capital program continues to drive strong growth in oil and natural gas liquids production, while simultaneously evaluating a wide range of exploration prospects.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our second quarter results and, where called for, provide updated guidance for the second half of the year. Beginning with production, our second quarter reported production totaled 61.8 million oil equivalent barrels or 679,000 Boe per day, a 3% increase compared to the same period a year ago. This result is about 6,000 barrels per day or 1% shy of the lower end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. As Vince mentioned earlier, interruptions of midstream facilities reduced our second quarter volumes by approximately 16,000 Boe per day. Had these outages not occurred, production would have been at the top end of our guidance range. Fortunately, the disruptions impacted only gas and NGL volumes, so our oil production was on target. For the quarter, our oil production increased by 26% over the second quarter of 2011 to an average of 149,000 barrels per day. Strong year-over-year growth in the Permian and Jackfish drove the performance.","For the third quarter, we expect production to increase to a range of 680,000 to 690,000 barrels per day in spite of the plant turnaround at our Jackfish facility. The turnaround at Jackfish will reduce oil volumes by approximately 10,000 barrels per day in both the third and fourth quarters. Even with these curtailments, we still expect that our oil production will increase more than 20% in 2012.","Moving to price realizations and beginning with Canadian oil, supply and demand for Canadian crudes remains very tight. Consequently, any disruptions in refinery capacity, or pipeline takeaway, can have a dramatic effect on pricing. This has resulted in increased price volatility and has made it difficult to predict price realizations. In the second quarter, Canadian oil realizations came in at 59% of the WTI benchmark, or just below the lower end of our forecasted range. The wider second quarter differentials were attributable to extended maintenance downtime at Midwest refineries and various outages of third-party pipelines.","In the second half of the year, we expect turnarounds at 3 major Midwest refineries to continue to place pressure on our crude realizations. With this in mind, we now expect our Canadian oil realizations to range between 50% to 60% of WTI for both the third and fourth quarters. An incremental 80,000 barrels a day of refining capacity is expected by year end with an additional 240,000 barrels a day by the middle of next year. These additions should significantly improve the supply demand situation.","Given the challenges that John discussed for the NGL market, we now expect that our third quarter NGL realizations will range between 28% and 34% of WTI. On the natural gas side, our second quarter company-wide price realizations came in below the low end of our guidance range at approximately 80% of Henry Hub. Regional differentials widened in most of our producing regions in Canada and the United States during the quarter. Prices were especially weak in the Mid-Continent region.","For the second half of this year, we expect that our gas price realizations will average 75% to 80% of Henry Hub in the U.S. and 80% to 85% of Henry Hub in Canada.","Turning briefly to our marketing and midstream operations. In the second quarter, weak gas and NGL prices, coupled with a planned shutdown of our Gulf Coast Fractionators facility in Mont Belvieu to expand its capacity, reduced our midstream operating profit to $68 million. Now that the expansion of the facility is complete, we expect our midstream operating profit to rebound to a range of $90 million to $110 million in the third quarter.","Moving to expenses. In the second quarter, lease operating expenses came in at $8.30 per Boe. This represents a 2% increase compared to last quarter. Had we not experienced any production interruptions during the quarter, our per unit expenses would have been flat compared to the first quarter. This is noteworthy given our growth in oil production which, as you know, is generally more expensive to produce than natural gas. Looking ahead to the third quarter, due to the scheduled maintenance at Jackfish, we expect LOE to approximate $8.50 per Boe. For the full year, LOE should still fall within our previous guidance range.","Our second quarter G&A expenses were $176 million, a 5% increase over the previous quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is almost entirely attributable to the implementation of our new company-wide software platform. For the most part, these implementation costs are nonrecurring. Therefore, we are forecasting third quarter G&A expenses to decline to a range of $160 million to $170 million. Our full year forecast for G&A expenses also remains unchanged.","Shifting to interest expense. In early May, we took advantage of attractive market conditions to issue $2.5 billion of senior notes. We issued a combination of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes with respective coupon rates of 1 7\/8%, 3 1\/4% and 4 3\/4%. We utilized these proceeds to reduce our short-term borrowings. Interest expense totaled $99 million for the second quarter, a $14 million increase over the prior-year quarter. This increase is almost entirely attributable to the impact of the bond offering. For the remainder of the year, we expect our interest expense to range from $110 million to $150 million per quarter.","DD&A expense for the second quarter totaled $684 million or $11.07 per Boe. For the second half of this year, we expect our depletion rate to range between $11.20 and $11.60 per Boe. However, if natural gas prices remain depressed, we would also expect to incur a full-cost ceiling write-down in the third quarter related to our U.S. oil and gas properties. Just as a reminder, this is a simple accounting exercise that generates a noncash charge and lowers the company's go-forward DD&A rate.","In summary, our pretax cash costs totaled $14.39 per Boe in the second quarter. Had we not incurred the production disruptions, this figure would have been around $14 per barrel produced or about 1% over the previous quarter. In any case, we continue to be positioned as a low-cost producer among our peer group.","The final expense item I will touch on is income taxes. After backing out the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates, our adjusted second quarter 2012 income tax rate was 35% of pretax earnings. This is similar to the tax rates we would expect for the remaining 2 quarters of the year. In today's earnings release, we provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates.","Before we open the call to Q&A, I will conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial position.","During the second quarter, our cash flow from operations totaled $1.4 billion, combined with the $900 million of proceeds from our Sinopec joint venture, our total cash inflows reached $2.3 billion. This cash allows us to comfortably fund our robust capital program, while maintaining excellent financial strength. As mentioned earlier, we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted cap ratio of only 14% and cash and short-term investments of $7 billion. Clearly, from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we remain exceptionally strong.","At this point, I'll turn the call back to John.","John Richels","Thank you, Jeff. In summary, while second quarter earnings were impacted by low price realization and downtime at the midstream facilities, our operating results continue to reflect the successful execution of our plan. We delivered year-over-year oil production growth of 26%. Our exploration program delivered encouraging results in the Mississippian trend and the Cline Shale, and we also opportunistically added to our acreage position in both of these promising opportunities. We comfortably funded a robust capital program, while maintaining an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced a $1.4 billion joint venture agreement with Sumitomo to explore and develop the Cline play. And finally, we remain fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our growth and cash flow per share on a debt adjusted basis.","So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for Q&A. Vince?","Vincent W. White","Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question on the Cline Shale. What is the infrastructure need there right now? And is part of this development, or I'm sorry, the joint venture cover development ops in the infrastructure out there?","Darryl G. Smette","Yes, this is Darryl and I'll answer that. The whole Cline Shale is a big area obviously. There is a lot of the area out there that really has no infrastructure at all in terms of pipelines, gas processing plants, things of that nature. So infrastructure definitely, in a lot of these areas, will have to be built. There are a few little areas in Sterling County where there is some infrastructure and some of the wells that Dave talked about that have been drilled there are close to that infrastructure. But in general, when we go forward, and I think we're going to have success here, infrastructure will be an area that we have to focus on, either Devon, in terms of its midstream operations, or a third party or a combination thereof. The agreement with Sumitomo allows them to participate in midstream activities, if we choose to go forward with that, or if they choose to go forward with that, so that would be an option for them. But right now, that decision, whether they would participate in any midstream facilities has not been made by them.","David A. Hager","Scott, end of the day, I might just add, this is an area though where thousands of wells have been drilled historically by the industry. So there is, as far as, ongoing ability to drill and complete wells, there is an infrastructure that works for that. What Darryl was addressing earlier is, obviously, accurate from the midstream facility side.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Understood. So are the 40 wells that you're drilling, targeting sort of areas where some more of the development infrastructure is at this point, or are you going to spread them across the plays just to delineate better?","Darryl G. Smette","Well, right now, it looks like it's going to be some of both, so we can test the play from a wider context. But some areas are going to have a little bit of infrastructure and some of the wells that we will drill probably will not have the infrastructure right now.","John Richels","From a midstream perspective. Yes, that's what he's answering. But we are testing a good portion of our acreage to just get an idea of the prospectivity of various parts of our acreage.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up on the Mississippian play, you're moving some rigs in there. How are you allocating those rigs versus your new acreage versus the stuff you're doing with Sinopec? How does that work?","John Richels","Well, we have drilled a number of wells on the Sinopec acreage. We're now moving the rigs, for the current time, up to the new acreage and that's where our rigs are located presently and we'll probably continue to evaluate both of those areas throughout the rest of the year.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you've got 7 rigs in the play right now. How many are in the JV versus your own owned acreage? And what would you expect that to be at year end?","John Richels","Right now, we have all 7 rigs working in our own acreage and none in the JV acreage. We do anticipate we will be moving back into the JV acreage later this year, though. And I can't give you an exact count. We're continuing to still ramp up our activities and we -- but we're going to have significantly more rigs working by the end of the year than we have working now. But Scott, I think it would be a little speculative to go exactly how many rigs and exactly where they'd be located. But I think that you'll see, for the rest of the year, that we will have some rigs working in both those areas, with an increased rig count.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, when you say -- I mean just as sort of a ballpark, when you say significant there, are you saying maybe like doubling the rig count from where you're at right now? Is that sort of -- kind of a ballpark rate?","John Richels","That's certainly very possible, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Sheppard [ph] with Simmons & Company.","Unknown Analyst","I'm just wondering, to what extent has ethane rejection led to the Mid-Con basis maybe coming in weaker relative to other parts of the country and subsequently driving the weakness at corporate level you all had in gas realizations in 2Q?","David A. Hager","I'm not sure I understood the question. Could you repeat it, please?","Unknown Analyst","So with ethane rejection, I mean, is -- the fact that ethane's not going into the liquid stream, moving back into the dry gas stream, is that at all exacerbating the problem that you're seeing in the Mid-Con? Or is it strictly just higher gas production that's driving that? I'm just asking what \u2026","David A. Hager","Okay, thank you. That probably has a little bit of an impact, but not a lot of impact, I don't think. Our view is that there's probably somewhere around 200 million to maybe 300 million of additional volume, primarily in the Mid-Continent, as a result of ethane being rejected. And as you very well know, ethane prices in Conway have been down to $0.02, $0.03 a gallon. So there has been some rejection there. But the overall impact, while there is some, I think, that's very, very minor based on what we can tell.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, that's great. On the Mitz Line [ph], the new acreage, can you disclose the price that you paid per acre there?","John Richels","In areas where we're still looking at prospective acreage acquisitions, we generally decline to get real specific.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, that's fine. And I've just got a couple more. Exploration CapEx, up pretty substantially quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us a little bit more visibility on the progression of that through the end of the year?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","21","This is Jeff. That was -- we closed a lot of our acreage acquisitions in the second quarter. So that would be flowing through the exploration capital. And we indicated on our last quarterly call that we did expect Q2, the second quarter, to be very lumpy with regard to acreage acquisitions. And as David indicated, our capital program is more front-end loaded this year.","Darryl G. Smette","Particularly with regard to acreage, that's when we picked up the Cline Shale acreage, a lot of the Mississippian acreage and so that's what you saw the impact of.","John Richels","I know you know this, but I will just remind you, as Dave pointed out, that from a reporting point of view, we acquired this additional acreage. We brought in more than 100% of a lot of this acreage and that doesn't get netted out from a reporting perspective. So that skews the capital numbers a little bit because you don't see what the money that we're taking in on the other side.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And just one more, in the Midland-Wolfcamp and Cline areas where you executed the new JV, beyond 2012, what do you think the rig ramp might look like there? How many gross wells do you think you can drill in each of those regions going forward?","Darryl G. Smette","Well, we, obviously, need to see results first. And so it's somewhat speculative to -- at this point, to go too far out. But you can see, when you put together an acreage position of 650,000 acres like we have on this, we have anticipated a fairly aggressive ramp-up, if the results continue to perform as we expect and as we've seen. So I would see that -- I'm not going to give you an exact number here but -- because the economics are potentially very strong, you can anticipate a pretty strong ramp-up of rigs as we move into 2013. And of course, we'll be discussing that with our new partners, and they're -- Sumitomo, and they're anticipating this as well.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And what's a good well cost to use in those regions? What have you seen there in terms of gross well cost?","John Richels","Yes, gross well costs that we're using in the Wolfcamp Shale, we see on the order of around $6 million or so -- $6.5 million or so, in the Midland Basin so far. And very similar well cost that we've seen out in the Cline as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","On the JV acreage, could you guys clarify how much production are you conveying with the deal?","John Richels","It's minimal. Current production is less than 500 barrels a day that we'd be conveying.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just more strategically, if we're trying to look at 2013 from a high level given the commentary around NGL expectations from a pricing perspective and some of the results from some of the newer exploration areas, should we, one, assume that spending will be within cash flows net of deal proceeds? And with that, would we expect just more -- incrementally more capital allocation to the MF Line [ph] into the Permian and away from plays like the Barnett and Cana, and perhaps the Utica, Michigan area?","John Richels","Brian, let me take a shot at that. Obviously, we're early going into our 2013 planning so we haven't kind of crystallized all of that. We are in the position that we can take some of those proceeds that we got from our offshore and reinvest them into onshore project. All things being equal, though, as Dave has already said, we're reducing our rig count in places like the Barnett and Cana, and moving them more into these light oil places because of the economics. But I do want to make the point that, in the liquids-rich portions of the Cana and the Barnett, we still get some pretty darn good returns. When you're looking forward from this point, doesn't really matter what gas prices are for '12 anymore. We're really looking at 2013 prices for all of our capital activities. And if you take a $3.75 Henry Hub price next year, which I think is pretty close to what Wall Street is using and very close to the Strip as well so we're all in the same ballpark. Once you take into consideration our midstream uplift, and even at a 31% NGL realization, we're seeing a low-20s rate of return in the Barnett and an almost 30% rate of return in the Cana. So there are portions of those 2 plays that still make a lot of sense to the point that we can -- if we're going to focus in those best areas, we're going to move some of those rigs on to some of these new oil plays where we really have a whole lot of expectation and potential for the future. And the other question, living within cash flow, again, over the last couple of years, we have taken some of those proceeds from the offshore and have reinvested them in rebuilding or changing -- adding significantly to our light oil potential in the company. We've done a lot of that and my guess is we're -- while we have the capacity to do it, with some uncertainty on the commodities pricing side, we'll just have to be careful as we go into next year to make that final determination of how much we're going to spend. I think that it's kind of early, but my guess is, we'll be trending towards our cash flow.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I guess you're still saying that you might use some of the, I guess, the $7 billion that you still have to fund some opportunities, even if it were to exceed your cash flow levels, or no?","John Richels","Well, I think not to the extent we have, but we still have that capacity if we want to. I mean, we've added a lot and, as I was saying earlier, when you got a million net acres and a couple of highly perspective oil plays, we've got a lot of running room on those plays already, so we're pretty happy with what we've put together to this point in time.","Vincent W. White","This is Vince. I'd add that the 2 JVs that we've entered into will allow us to get a lot more activity out of any given capital spend. So we could achieve similar results of developing our core development plays, while evaluating acreage and exploration plays with a reduced amount of capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Going back to the Cline, can you estimate the impact of both cost and IPs that you think slick water would have relative to the Stroman Ranch well you highlighted? And then can you also talk about when you would plan to move drilling more meaningfully to the northeast within your acreage?","Darryl G. Smette","Well, about -- they're improvement costs but not a significant reduction in costs, relative in the overall well cost going to slick water. We can't say for certain how much improvement there will be going to slick water, but we have certainly seen in the Wolfcamp Shale that the -- going to slick water is a cleaner frac and we've seen much better results in the Wolfcamp Shale and operators have gone to slick water, primarily in the Wolfcamp Shale. We think the Cline is very similar and we know that some other operators also have recently moved to slick waters there also and it appears they're getting better results. So we need to actually complete the well to know for sure. But we're very optimistic that, based on all the other results we've seen in that area, we're going to see a pretty significant improvement. And again, we've just drilled one well on 650,000 acres, so far. So it's so early on. We're just very confident that we're going to be in a range based on the other wells that we've seen drilled in the area. And we are going to be moving some of the rigs off to the northeast to test some of that acreage as well later this year. So as I said, we're going to be moving the rigs around the acreage to get a good handle on what the overall prospectivity of various parts of the acreage position are.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, going over to the Utica, how committed are you to acreage retention in 2\/3 of your Utica acreage in the oil window? And do you see any differences in characteristics in the Knox County well versus the first 2 wells?","David A. Hager","Well, we're committed to economics. And we were committed to really drilling wells that are going to meet our economic thresholds. And the first 2 were disappointing, but it was on the far northwestern part of our acreage. We do see some -- because we are essentially very near the original well where we took a core in, that appeared to have good thermal maturity and good permeability, we are somewhat more optimistic in this well than we were the previous 2 wells. But even more so, as we move to the east with our additional drilling activity that we're going to be doing throughout the rest of the year, probably drill about 5 more wells for the rest of the year. We're going to be moving more where the rest of the industry activity is. And so that part of the acreage is probably even more prospective.","John Richels","And then, Brian, and the other thing is a couple of these plays, like that one and that portion of the play, we always said this was highly exploration in nature because there wasn't a lot of experience by the industry. And it's one of the reasons why we got in there and acquired our acreage for a few hundred dollars an acre rather than thousands an acre. So this is something that -- as Dave has correctly pointed out, we're going to be driven by economics on this thing, not by desire to hold acreage if it's not making sense in any portion of any play.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with S&B.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just have a follow-up on the question on Ashland and Medina. Have those 2 wells condemned the area? Or are you going to go back and try some different things further down the road?","John Richels","Well, those 2 wells were not encouraging in that immediate area. And it's exploration, you always have to drill more wells and as each one you drill, you may learn some more things that could or could not make the acreage there work. But the first 2 wells were not encouraging, so we just -- we need to get more well results in and perhaps with additional well results will give us a reason to go back there. But we're not focused in that area right now.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But do you think it was the frac or the geology that failed on you?","John Richels","We think it's geology.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, so it's the geology. Another question I had, can you update us on the offshore cash? I mean, you've talked about it before. And also, would you have any appetite to look at international shales, outside of North America, given you've got a war chest outside of the U.S.?","John Richels","Just an update, Bob, on the offshore cash. We have all but a few hundred million dollars of the $7 billion, is sitting offshore at this point in time. And so that hasn't really changed a whole lot since we talked to you before. As far as looking internationally, we're never close-minded about it but we have just repositioned the company to take advantage of our expertise and our portfolio in North America, and we've got an awful lot of really exciting opportunities ahead of us. And with the things that we've added recently, I think we really want to get more into that and really understand the potential and develop this big asset-base that we've got here before we start thinking of those other things. But you know us, we're never close-minded about anything. But right now, I have to tell you we're not looking internationally because we really have a whole lot on our plate here that we think is going to provide us a lot of drilling opportunities for a long time.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about Canadian asset sales? And I think you guys had mentioned at the Analyst Day, you could potentially shed some assets up there. Can you talk about where you're at in that process?","John Richels","David, as Dave said earlier, we're doing -- we've done a fair bit of exploration work here over the last little while. I think we're still evaluating our position in Canada. We've got some -- we've had some optimistic results, I think, on some of the acreage and we're just not ready to make a call like that at this point in time.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then let me take my follow-up to a different direction. Can you talk about -- there's rumors that you guys were drilling up near Abilene, and you got a trace, and not necessarily a Cline or Wolfcamp, but a Mississippian-type formation, can you give us any -- or Mississippian H formation, can you give us some color on that?","John Richels","No. We can't give you any color on that at this point.","Vincent W. White","All right. Well, I show the top of the hour. So thank you for participating in our call today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you, John, and I'd too like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2015 analyst and investor call. Also on the call today with me are John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Hager, Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; along with a few other members of our senior management team.","If you haven't had a chance to listen to the management commentary, you can find that, along with the associated slides and our new operations report at devonenergy.com. Additionally, we have included our forward-looking guidance in our earnings release. I hope you've had a chance to review all these documents, as today's call will largely consist of questions and answers.","Finally, I'll remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call will contain plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates, which are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law.

First quarter was an outstanding one for Devon and arguably one of the best from an operations perspective in the company's 40-year-plus history. Before we jump into Q&A, I'd like to highlight just a few key messages that I hope you'll take away from our earnings materials.","First, our premier asset portfolio is really hitting on all cylinders. We're seeing significant operational improvements across the portfolio, with improving type curves and increasing inventory, and we're achieving meaningful capital and operating cost efficiencies. The strong operational momentum translated into top-notch first quarter performance. We exceeded our production guidance for the third consecutive quarter. We did a great job of accelerating cost savings across our portfolio, with field level operating costs coming in well below our guidance.","We expect this level of excellence to continue in upcoming quarters. As a result, we have significantly raised our 2015 production outlook while at the same time reducing our full-year capital and LOE guidance by more than $400 million in aggregate.","And, finally, we have a terrific balance sheet that continues to get better. When you combine the additional cash flow from our improved production outlook, our lower cost guidance, and the recent EnLink-related sales proceeds, we've enhanced our cash flow outlook by over $1 billion in just a few months. So, in summary, our focused asset portfolio is generating differentiating results and returns for shareholders.","As many of you know, this will be my last quarterly call as CEO, with my planned retirement at the end of July. And I'm confident in saying that Devon has never been in better shape than it is today. We have a great set of assets, we have a very capable and experienced management team, and a rock-solid balance sheet. These winning qualities clearly offer investors a unique opportunity in the E&P space, and I firmly believe that Devon's best days are still ahead.","So thanks again for joining us today, and with that I'll turn the call back to Howard for Q&A.","Howard J. Thill - Senior VP-Communications & Investor Relations","Thanks, John. To make sure that we have enough time to take as many calls as possible, we'd ask that you limit yourself to one question with associated follow-ups to that question. You may reprompt to ask additional questions as time permits. So, John, with that, if you'll queue up the calls and questions, we'll go from there. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and great results today. A lot of new details, so I may jump into a more detailed question here. You introduced a Meramec type curve based upon the initial 12 wells you participated in. If I look at the map, it looks like your acreage includes oilier updip and the gassier downdip sections. Is the type curve representative of blend, or can you discuss how we should interpret that?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Hi, Evan, it's Dave Hager. Yeah, this is based more really on the results that we have to date, which is more in the oilier updip part of the play. We are going to be evaluating some as we move further down to the gassier part of the play. But the type curve you've seen is so far based on our results. We've seen the 12 wells you talked about as well as about 20 industry wells in the area.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And that's where your activity will be focused for the balance of 2015?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","The bulk of the activity is going to be focused in the oilier updip part of the play. I think we're going to draw a handful of wells down to evaluate a little further downdip, but the bulk of it is going to be in the oilier part. That's the best economics at this point.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. If I could slip just one more in. I know your DeWitt County Eagle Ford are performing \u2013 I think it's about 25% over the curve that you lifted just one quarter ago. Is that a function of coring up, enhanced completions? Can you kind of help just to kind of parse through that to understand the broader application on your locations?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, the two big things I would say are really around the enhanced completions that we're doing and then really the production optimization techniques that we're using. And so both of those we're very proud of. We think we are adding significant value to this asset with our contribution to the completion design, as well as the production enhancement techniques that we're using, coil tubing cleanouts, automation, choke management, et cetera, so the field is just performing outstanding, but those are the two big drivers.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Great results, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, gentlemen. I was wondering if you guys could comment a little bit more on the Bone Spring and talk about the economic returns that you're seeing in the basin area, or location, versus slope. I believe the drilling costs are cheaper on the slope. I just wondered if you'd maybe comment on the relative returns and where the program's going to be focused in 2015.","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, this is Dave again. The bulk of the program is going to be based in the basin part of the play. We have 10 of our 13 rigs working in the basin part right now. We get good economic returns in both parts of the play. So I want to emphasize that. They're just a little bit different. The slope is more a channelized deposition environment. It is more normally pressured. The well costs tend to be lower. Where, as you move down into the basin, it's a little bit deeper, it's more overpressured, and we're really \u2013 we're seeing some benefit from these enhanced higher sand concentrations up on the slope, but we really see the greatest improvement down in the basin part of the play. That's where about two-thirds of our opportunities lie. But I don't want discount the slope part of it, either. It's a good economic play. It's just a little bit different than-- it's a little lower cost and a little bit lower rate than the basin part of the plays.","But the bulk of it is going to be concentrated down in the basin part, and not only in the Bone Spring, the lower part of the Bone Spring, but I'm sure you noted also the A Sand wells that we had. We talked about a second well in there, and we're really encouraged by the results we're seeing in this A Sand or upper sand in the second Bone Spring. So, Tony, do you want to add anything to that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","You covered it really well, Dave. Arun, I'd just remind you that we really started a lot of our activity on the slope initially and then moved into the basin. But, when you go back and look at the results that we've had in the slope, probably about a third of those results have been at the type curve that we just announced for the basin. So we have a lot of upside on the slope type activity, and we think as we de-risk with those three wells, we'll set ourselves up for a continued development there. So we feel very positive about going back into the slope with more development type work.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","It sounded like from your ops report you could see a potential for the inventory to increase a lot in the Bone Spring. My follow-up is just regarding the Eagle Ford. You guys talked about maybe in Q2 being a little bit facilities constrained. Could you just talk about steps that you have under way to maybe relieve some of that midstream \u2013 call it bottleneck or whatnot? And when will you have more room to continue the strong growth you've had?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Okay. I'm going to have Darryl Smette talk about this.","Darryl G. Smette - Executive VP-Marketing, Midstream & Supply Chain","Yeah, I mean, there's a number of things that we're working on with our midstream provider and with our partner out there in order to increase the capacity. A lot of that has to do with operating efficiencies. That includes getting more uptime on the stabilizer that's out there. I know currently that stabilizer has a nameplate capacity of around 170,000 barrels a day. And, historically, that has been running about 140,000, 145,000. So we're working with our midstream provider to see if we can increase that operational time.","We're looking at additional compression in certain areas. We're also looking at, on the truck side of the equation, putting in delivery stations that are closer to the location so we can increase our truck activities so they don't have to drive so far. So there are just a number of things from an operational perspective that we're looking at. We also have had discussions with our midstream provider and with others about providing enhanced capacity out of the area, and those discussions continue on. But nothing has been finalized.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks. Congratulations on the quarter and good luck, John, on your retirement.","John Richels - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","You bet. My question is a quick follow-up on the Permian Basin. You take a look at that increase to potentially 11,000 gross unrisked locations, which is obviously meaningfully higher. When you look at that in the various formations you've identified, is that fairly \u2013 should I assume that it's fairly prorated to what you already have out there on a risked basis? Or is there more upside in specific formations like the Bone Spring?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, let's talk through the \u2013 there are several areas we see upside. We see significant upside in the Bone Spring as we do these downspacing pilots that we highlighted in the operations report. We also see upside in the Bone Spring from this upper sand, this A Sand that I've been talking about, where we talked about the first two wells. So when you combine those two, there is significant potential inventory expansion because of those two factors.","Additionally, in the 5,000 risked that we've been talking about historically, compared to the 11,000 unrisked number, we haven't been including anything from the Wolfcamp. We see probably four members of the Wolfcamp that are potentially prospective across Lea and Eddy counties. So that's a big driver also. Then, to a lesser degree, we do see some upside also on the Leonard and the Delaware Sands. But the two big drivers, I would say, would be the increase of potential in the Bone Spring, which again, we think is the most economic opportunity thus far in the play, and then in the Wolfcamp.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate that. And in the Eagle Ford, you did touch on \u2013 obviously the upper Eagle Ford is looking encouraging. And, Dave, what is your view on the play right now based on what you've recently seen? And if you do get more excited, is there more acreage acquisition opportunities targeting that trend?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, we probably don't talk too much about acreage acquisition opportunities. There may be some out there, but we're not going to get into detail on that too much. But I would say, from our mapping, we see the thickest part of this really being in DeWitt County over our existing acreage. We're very, very encouraged what we're seeing so far. We've had encouraging results to the northeast in Lavaca County, and as we're starting to move more into DeWitt County, we're seeing better well results. We're also learning better how to complete these wells. I think you've seen even as you can go way to the southwest beyond our DeWitt County acreage, you've seen another operator talk about encouraging results. I think they call it the Austin Chalk. And it's really the same marl formation as what we are talking about here.","So we're very encouraged with the results thus far, and we still don't think we've necessarily drilled the best part of it. And so we think it is going to be a very economic play. It's a little different. It's not necessarily a shale. It's more of a marl, which is more like a limestone, really. And so your spacing may be a little bit wider. We don't know for sure. We're thinking maybe 160, but it's too early to say for sure. But we're very encouraged with what we've seen so far.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So the way I'm hearing your comments, you are increasingly becoming more optimistic at this point?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Absolutely.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And let me join \u2013 echo my congratulations. And, Dave, we're looking forward to seeing your impact, more so than you've already done already. A couple questions if I may, fellows. But maybe going back to the Eagle Ford. I guess BHP as operator has raised some concern that they wanted to kind of slow things down a little bit. I'm guessing that the infrastructure is going to kind of do that for them. But what my question really is, how do you change your capital allocation in light of the 400-odd unrisked locations in the upper Eagle Ford? And you've obviously got a much bigger opportunity set than your partner. So that's kind of my first question. I've got a second in the Permian, please.","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, what we're trying to do right now, overall, Doug, is to match our activity with the availability of capacity with our infrastructure. And now we're trying to expand that capacity, and Darryl highlighted that. If you look at it, at the end of Q1, we had about 130 wells that were currently uncompleted. So we have an inventory to work through. We are staying active with drilling in the area. We have decreased the rig count a little bit, but we're getting also more wells, we're getting increased efficiencies. So we're getting more wells out of a slightly lower rig count. And so we have plenty of wells to be completed. And that's not the limiting factor. The limiting factor at this point is just solving some of these infrastructure issues, which we're confident we're going to be able to do. We are so far concentrating the bulk of our activity in the lower Eagle Ford, but we're talking to BHP about the upper Eagle Ford and plan to do some upper Eagle Ford tasks as we move into the heart of the play, which we think would be over the acreage we have with BHP in DeWitt County.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that. Thank you. But my follow-up in the Permian, obviously that's a more than potential double on your inventory. I'm just curious if \u2013 on the downspacing I guess in the Bone Spring \u2013 I'm curious, does that upside include the delineation or testing on the Wolfcamp? Or is that still ahead of us? And if so, again, how does (17:27) capital allocation go in your Delaware position? And I'll leave it there.","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","When we look at the table that we've referenced in some of our previous disclosures, Doug, we've included no locations for the Wolfcamp. And we've been focused on the second Bone Springs, again because of the returns are higher in that particular pay horizon than others. But we still have a lot of industry activity in and around our position in the Wolfcamp. So we're optimistic. We're building out the technical plans for a rig line right now in the Wolfcamp, and we'll probably drill \u2013 out of the 150 gross wells that we'll drill in the Delaware, about half a dozen of those will be in the Wolfcamp this year, and another half a dozen will be in the Leonard. But the focus again continues to be the second Bone Springs just because we're trying to maximize returns in this environment.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Just to be clear, that greater than 11,000 mentioned in the ops report, is there any Wolfcamp in there or not?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","There is on the gross expected locations of 11,000. There's not in the net risked count that we've disclosed.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning, gentleman, and congratulations also from me to you, John. If I could just bang a little bit more on the Bone Springs results, because this really so tantalizing. Dave, if I remember, about a year ago, I think, when you guys were expanding your \u2013 or one of the many times you expanded your inventory in the Bone Springs, at one point you described the logs out here as just like railroad tracks, like it's hard to see what makes one zone different from the other. And, as I'm looking at this now, can you give a bit of a narrative on why it is that you're looking at the upper now, and what's appealing to you? And I guess that would also go for the third Bone Springs, which is \u2013 you're going to do in one of your pilots. And what led you to that? And what could be in the future?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I remember giving that description. I think that the short answer is that you have to test these wells really to know how successful you are going to be. And that's what we've \u2013 we decided to do some tests in the upper Bone Spring, and we're continuing to appraise other areas, but it does take testing to really understand just how good they are. So, Tony, you want to expand on that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Sure will. Charles, I think the technical guys are doing a lot better job now of calibrating all the surface data we have, and of course we're getting a lot more control points as we continue to test. They're looking at micro-seismic results, and we're trying to understand what kind of a stimulator rock volume that we contact when we do our frac work there, and I think that what we're generally seeing is that while we're landing and spending most of our concentrated energy in the lower portions of the second Bone Springs, we know we're contacting a little bit upward into the middle, but we haven't seen evidence that we're contacting into the very upper portion of the second Bone. So it's really just, as we do in a lot of these type of plays where the rock is not that favorable or certainly not that obvious from first inspection, it takes a little bit more science to uncover that, and a lot of the subsurface data points just gives us a little bit more information to lead our developments down the road.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then, following up on the type curve adjustment you guys had. So you bumped the IPs by about 60%, but on your operations report, the graph right above there says your cum through 180 days is also up 60%. And so it looks like that's not just an IP effect but it's a sustained effect that you're seeing, sustained production uplift. So, if I put those two pieces together, it looks like the EUR is \u2013 maybe this is what you mean by the (21:41) but that EUR of 600 MBoe really looks to me like that's going to go higher. Is that -","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, that is an increase, Charles, from \u2013 if you go back a couple quarters, we said 450 MBoe plus. And I made the flippant comment it could've been plus, plus, plus, if I remember right.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Right.","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, so now we are saying 600 MBoe in the basin. And I think what \u2013 the comment that Tony also made earlier, I hope you caught that, is about a third of the wells we're drilling up in the slope are following the basin curve. And we haven't increased it on the slope yet, but we have some evidence so far that we may have some better results coming in the future on the slope as well. But that is an increase from \u2013 we've never come out with that 600 MBoe number specifically. Before we just said 450 MBoe plus.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, Dave.","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","And there may be some upside in the basin from that also, frankly. But we'll see how it goes.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Right, right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Morning, and I'd like to also begin by saying happy trails to John.","John Richels - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","You've certainly left Devon a much better company than it was when you took over. I wanted to actually talk about the Powder River Basin Parkman results, because I thought they were really quite impressive, particularly since some peers have retreated from the area during the downturn. I just wanted to ask a couple of things. If you want to count it as two questions, it's fine with me. What percentage of your focus area can support the 9,600-foot laterals that you highlighted? Will you drill shorter laterals where the geometry of the acreage requires it? And, finally, will you take your Parkman approach to the Turner or to the Frontier and see if they can show similar uplift?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks for noticing the results, Jeff. I think what we spent is \u2013 if you go back in 2013, early portion of 2014, we spent a lot of our capital on the efforts really delineating a very large, broad area there in the Powder, as you know. And we have centered in on a couple of what we call sweet spots in the Parkman and in the Turner. So the work that you're seeing now is us being able to confirm repeated high return-type work in those sweet spots. And most of that has been in the Parkman. We find that there's a great uplift with extended laterals, and we will continue to do that when possible. We also find that we're bringing on \u2013 starting to bring on some extended Turner wells right now, so we'll have a little bit better knowledge of what that will look like. But I would expect the Turner to follow the Parkman results.","And in terms of the total inventory, I think we've commented that we have about 1,000 locations in the Powder. We picked up a little bit more acreage in Q1 and supported our Tier 1 position in the Parkman and Turner. That adds to that location count. So on a normal lateral basis, that location count goes up a few hundred if not 300 more locations, but really goes up to 1,450 as I see in the operations report now. But we're trying to reduce that by drilling the extended-reach wells, and we think that if we can do that and core up our position, we can drop that to about 800 and see the results that you just saw this last quarter. So we're very excited about the Powder position right now.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, gentleman. Maybe if I could follow up with a couple questions on capital allocation. I guess one in the near term in 2015, if limitations persisted from the second quarter on, in terms of the debottlenecking in the Eagle Ford, what's your ability to deploy capital elsewhere in the portfolio? Can you make up the difference by accelerating activity in the Permian or the Anadarko Basin?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, we don't really see that the limitations that we're seeing in the Eagle Ford at this point are going to really change our capital requirements there on a very significant level at all. So it's kind of a hypothetical question, I guess you'd say, because we just don't see that to be a limiting factor.","Now, obviously, in the future \u2013 I'll expand your question. Longer term, we absolutely plan to increase our rig count in the Permian and in the Delaware Basin, because we are expanding the inventory so much. Now, we don't see that so much as a 2015 event at this point. We're balancing our cash flows with our returns and the available infrastructure and the other limitations, permits, et cetera, that we have in the Delaware Basin. But longer term, we absolutely plan to expand our activity in the Delaware Basin and most likely in other plays, such as the \u2013 up in the Powder River Basin as well. And we have scope eventually as prices improve to deploy more capital also in the Cana-Woodford area. So we have a lot of opportunities in the inventory, but we don't see a significant change to where we're spending the money in 2015.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great and maybe that segues into a discussion on 2016 on the allocation of capital. But can you talk a little bit about moving pieces in the portfolio, maybe in the case of a flat year-on-year CapEx environment? How much spend do you have rolling off year on year from 2015 to 2016 in areas like the oil sands or other places that would allow for incremental dollars to flow into places like the Eagle Ford, the Permian, and the Anadarko? And then with incremental \u2013 as you think about incremental capital growth from 2016 and beyond, can you rank maybe where the dollars go back into in terms of Eagle Ford versus Permian versus the Anadarko or other?","John Richels - President and Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, when you think about where we're allocating our capital this year and what \u2013 where you might, to your question, where you might drop some capital in the future, we're spending about $700 million this year in Canada. That was largely as a result of some ongoing projects that were well under way, and also the engineering and delineation appraisal work that we're doing on Pike. And so, on a going-forward basis, that could drop to somewhere around $200 million, $250 million just for the ongoing maintenance capital for the oil sands.","So that drives the $500 million, I guess, of less expenditure there. We also had some expenditures this year as we were finishing up the program in the Miss and the Southern Midland Basin that you could see curtailing next year.","So those additions \u2013 and then costs, of course. We're seeing costs go down significantly as we discussed, and we still think by year-end, we'll see costs 20% or 25% below where they were in the fourth quarter of 2014. So that rolls through as well. So there's some fairly significant chunks that you could see coming off. And it's a little hard to force rank. There's no question that our Eagle Ford is giving the best returns in our portfolio. But after that, as you look at the Delaware Basin, some of the work that we're doing in the Anadarko Basin, and as Dave said earlier, and Tony, the really positive results that we've seen in the Parkman, in the Rockies, they kind of fall into that next bucket. And you'd kind of be making decisions there not based on a full basin analysis but on incremental rigs and where you're drilling within those basins. So, as Dave said, we've got lots of opportunities, and if we were in that flat pricing environment, we also have some additional cash that frees up.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Just a quick one from the ops report. In the Eagle Ford, you mentioned that you're using a diverter and 100 mesh sand. Can you address that a little bit? Are you trying to put more sand at individual intervals, Dave? What's going on there?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","John, this is Tony. John, we're taking a engineered approach to our completion work in the Eagle Ford, so we're capturing a lot more science than we historically have done. We are trying to look at the rock that we drilled with our open-hole logs and design our fracs according to what we think will be successful to pump our jobs away. So we are using the 100 mesh trying to increase the total volume of sand into the wells, but we're also trying to be thoughtful in where we place that. And I think when you look at the results that we're seeing there, we've increased the results from our completions. We're also working with BHP, and their design is also changing greatly over the last year that we've been involved with them. Their completion results are also being upgraded as well. So I think between the two of us taking a slightly different approach, we are driving our completion results to be much more effective than we have in the past.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron from Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Yeah, John, I'm going to echo my sentiments for a happy retirement, and congrats on what you've done at Devon.","John Richels - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","If I just think \u2013 I want to go back to the Eagle Ford. And if I start thinking about big picture, I mean, you're adding 20,000 \u2013 or you added whatever you added, 23,000 barrels, I guess. 24,000 barrels during the quarter. When you start talking about 170,000 and I know you can go over nameplate, how should we think about this asset in 2016, I guess? Do you kind of ramp to that 180,000 level, and kind of sit at that level? Or how should we think about that?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, we aren't giving specific 2016 guidance at this point, David. But I can tell you we're real happy with how it's performed. And I think one of the key things is also going to be just how successful we are in debottlenecking the infrastructure here, and that's going to determine to some degree what our 2016 production is. But you can see we're just producing outstanding results, and until we work through the debottlenecking and we really work through our whole capital allocation, we're just trying to not get in too much detail at this point about 2016 production, I guess you'd say. But we're certainly very happy with the results we've had thus far.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Let me ask another question, just thinking about 2016. Kind of what's your framework or how should we think about your framework for \u2013 no matter what the price environment, whether it's $50, $70, $80, $60, whatever the number is, kind of what's your goal from a corporate perspective as far as cash flow, CapEx? How should we think about that?","John Richels - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, David, yeah, we said before that within some reasonable limits going forward, we want to live somewhere around cash flow, but cash flow can be different things. There's the operating cash flow. We also have other levers that we have been able to pull in the past. And so it's just a \u2013 we've got a lot of flexibility. It's a great thing about having a very strong balance sheet and a strong financial position in a tough market. But, philosophically, over time, we want to balance our capital expenditures somewhere close to what our cash flow is.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it at that. Congrats on a good quarter, and good operational detail. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","John Richels - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Congrats to John and Dave. On the Meramec, you've now derisked 60,000 acres, and wanted to see both what portion of the remaining 220,000 acres has scope for the oil window, what your delineation plans are there? And then, when you look at a well being drilled there, I think you talked about 51% overall liquids, how you see that changing if at all through the life of the well?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Brian, this is Tony. Brian, just \u2013 I think what we highlighted in our operations report is we had about 60,000 acres exposed to the \u2013 what we call the oil and liquids-rich window. Industry and Devon and our partner, we're currently delineating the fluid gradients through \u2013 across the field. But order of magnitude, I would estimate that our exposure just to the low-GOR oily window would be, order of magnitude, of about \u2013 less than 5,000 acres. Most of our exposure is going to be what I would call the condensate liquid-rich window, and that would be the 60,000 acres \u2013 largely the 60,000 acres, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then, does the well have a disproportionately higher liquids content initially? Or is it kind of 51% overall through the life, in your estimates?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Well, we really don't have a lot of historical performance to look at that, but we're expecting that the performance and really the liquid content will mimic a lot of the results we've already seen in the Cana-Woodford portion of our play there. Not a lot of difference at this time, but I got to tell you, Brian, it's real early. Not a lot of performance data to tell us that.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then, lastly, in the Permian, a lot of time spent talking about the Delaware Basin, obviously a lot of improvements and efficiencies going on there. I wonder if the extent of that opportunity set makes the meager Midland Basin assets less strategic in how you're thinking about the Midland?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, we always look at our portfolio, Brian. That's, I think, one thing you can say about Devon. If you look at what we've done over the last two years that we have really high-graded a portfolio, and we don't ever consider that job fully finished. We think part of our job is to bring in top-tier assets, and then when assets can be more effectively handled by somebody else or create more value through a transaction, we'll consider that.","So I'm not going to get too specific on the Midland Basin, I wouldn't say. We like Martin County, and we've had some historical success in the Southern Midland Basin and Wolfcamp, not quite as strong of economics over there, though, obviously. So we are constantly looking at what's the best return for our shareholders overall as far as whether should keep or do something with it. And certainly, the answer to this question is oil price dependent also. If oil prices move up, it significantly impacts the economics of our Midland Basin opportunities. So it's not just a \u2013 you have to evaluate it pretty carefully in different oil price scenarios.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next comes from the line of James Sullivan from Alembic Global.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, folks. Congrats to John and Dave both, also. Could you just remind me, to hop back over to the Bone Spring again, what is the average lateral length you guys are drilling out there right now? And what are you using for your type well? What is that based on in terms of a lateral length?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","These are just normal laterals, so they're about 5,000 feet at this point. We do like the opportunity to drill extended laterals or extended-reach wells when we can. And so, as we move into some of the other horizons, maybe the Wolfcamp and Leonard, you're going to see us move up into maybe the 7,500-foot lateral length. But, for now, most of our work and certainly the type curves are based on a 5,000-foot lateral.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Just to follow up on that point, and I guess what I'm trying to get at here is, I know folks have talked about it a little bit more with the Wolfcamp, but is it a priority for you, as the focus continues to be the second Bone Spring, is it a priority for you to block off your acreage to give yourselves more double sections to drill longer laterals for the second Bone Spring? I know you do have a couple of blockier areas where you can do that already. But maybe more opportunity to do that. Is it a priority for you guys? And if it is, would you consider a bigger, more comprehensive kind of acreage swap with one of the other operators in the basin there?","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, we would. We're always trying to block up acreage everywhere we work. The Delaware Basin is an area that, as you know, we're committed to. So we would love to have both a larger footprint and a more contiguous footprint, so our guys are always trying to work those opportunities. And we'll continue to expand the position and get our footprint to the point we can have the most optimum development plan possible. So, yeah, I think we would be interested in considering a trade to core up our position there.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel from Macquarie.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Most have been asked. Just wanted to get the latest thoughts on looking at 2016 in regards to hedging? And if there's a plan for instituting some hedges, a little bit more agnostic of prices or if it'll be a little bit more active? Or if you prefer to enter the year, depending on prices, without hedges?","Darryl G. Smette - Executive VP-Marketing, Midstream & Supply Chain","Yeah, this is Darryl. As we've said before, we would like, over any given point in time, to have about 50% of our oil and our natural gas financially hedged. Currently, we have no hedges for 2016, although we're very well hedged for 2015. Our current thought is that as we look at commodity prices, we think there's a lot more room for upside than there is downside. And so we have not executed on 2016.","We do have a process by which we consider hedging opportunities every couple weeks within our company. And so while we'll not give you any specific prices under which we would hedge, it is an ongoing discussion. But again, our overall thought is that we'd like to have about 50% of our oil and gas hedged at any given point in time. So it's something we look at all the time, continue to look at. But in the current price environment, when we look at the natural gas and the oil strip for 2016, it's not something that excites us.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Uplenchwar from GMP Securities.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Hi, good morning, guys. And congrats, John. And best of luck for you in the retirement.","John Richels - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sameer.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","What I'm trying to understand is, if I'm looking at 2016 \u2013 I know this question has been asked before; I'm just trying to get a direct answer. Is \u2013 what do you need to see to put rigs back to work, like, from a cost perspective? From an oil price perspective? Gas price perspective? Just trying to understand, because right now we're in a low price environment. But what happens in second half 2015 if prices move higher? How should we think about that?","John Richels - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Sameer, that's obviously a hard question to answer, and we're not trying to be evasive about 2016, but we're so early in thinking about 2016, and there are so many variabilities \u2013 costs and prices and all of the other variables that go into that. But I think what we would say is, whatever the price is, we're going to focus our efforts next year in the areas where we're going to drive the highest returns, or get the best rate of returns. And there are going to be some funds for that that will be available to us in even the next \u2013 in those really good areas where we've been driving the higher rates of return for next year. So, because we'll spend less dollars in a couple of the other places that we're committed to going into 2015.","So there's just a whole lot of variables right now, and we're so early in the process in determining what 2016 looks like, it's really hard for us to give you an answer there. But you ought to feel that \u2013 take away from this that our focus on the Eagle Ford, on the Delaware Basin, this emerging opportunity we have in the Rockies, which looks pretty good, are all areas that are going to drive high rates of return, and we'll focus on those areas whatever our capital budget ends up being.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Perfect. And then, on a broader basis, everybody's, including Devon's, well results continue to improve in the Eagle Ford and Bone Springs. I'm just trying to understand, what is Devon doing differently versus peers? And where is Devon leveraging on peers or partners, and just trying to get an idea about that longer laterals completion designs, or what have you? Thank you.","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Well, if I understood the question, what we're doing in the Bone Spring that's different, I think two things. One, we have some of the best geology for the Bone Spring, and so our acreage happens to be located where some of the best Bone Spring opportunities are. And, second, we think we are leading the industry in our completion technology. We have really made a conscious decision to step out and test various size sand concentrations and stepping up to 3,000 pounds of sand per foot and that too in some areas, so we can really understand what's the right size completion to put on each of our specific areas. And it's obviously a price-dependent issue as well.","So, I think what are we doing to lead the way in the Bone Springs? We're fortunate we have good geology. I think we have a good appraisal program going on, a good development program. And we're testing the various zones, and we are really, I think, leading the way with our completions at this point in the industry also. So, Tony, you want to add to that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yeah, Sameer, I think what I'd add to you, and we talked about this at the last call. But our technical teams are putting a lot more science and a lot more work into the subsurface characterizations of the projects we work on. So we're taking a lot more cores, pressures, temperatures. We have fiber optics in all the plays that we're currently working, so we're able to calibrate all that information.","On the execution side, the guys are doing a really good work. I think we've talked about standing up our well-con (46:25) center. So we're maintaining \u2013 we have 24-hour coverage of every drill bit that we're operating right now. So we're keeping the wells, the trajectory flat. We're keeping them in zone more than we have in the past. All that's really adding to a better completion. It's hard to measure the work that we do and where it ends up, but I think the outperformance that you've seen in the last couple quarters has been associated with just some good quality work from our technical people.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Investments.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Wow, this is like Christmas. Back here again. Thank you. Let me ask two real quick questions. The first one is with regard to the second Bone Spring stacking test, the stacking pilots. The first \u2013 the Pilot 3 and Pilot 4, are those located in the basin area? And Pilot 5, because it's got a third Bone Spring well in it, is it located someplace else?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","They're mostly in the basin. We have several pilots there, but I'd also let you know that we've got a couple up on the slope. So we're testing the downspacing concept mostly in the second Bone Spring. But we're trying to understand the relationship when these staggered laterals approach and just simply the downspacing in the same interval. We're testing these concepts in original pressured environments. We're also testing these concepts in partially depleted areas to know what we might be able to come back to and further develop our current position in.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, that's great. The other quick question I just wanted to ask. Slide 16, in the Anadarko, you showed a number of zones of interest. Was just wondering if you guys have tested or have any plan to test the Springer? Some of the peers in the mid-con are calling the Springer comparable or superior to the stack. Thank you.","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Well, we do have exposure to other intervals inside of the Mississippian there, and so our guys are looking at all of these intervals. We don't have a lot of data to talk about at this point, but we're not oblivious to some of these other opportunities, and we will be testing some of these with time.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","David A. Hager - Chief Operating Officer","Looking at the queue, it looks like we're getting fairly near the end of the calls, but I was thinking \u2013 there's one area we thought we might be asked about and we haven't been and I may, since we have a couple minutes here, I might ask Tony just to make a comment about it, our refrac program in the Barnett. And this is a program that we're really proud of how it's proceeding so far, and we see some real upside associated with that. So, Tony, you want to make a comment on that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Sure. Dave, like you mentioned, we were expecting a call on our refracs. We've heard a lot of that from our shareholders in the past. And I guess I want to \u2013 or kind of summarize the work that we're doing. We're excited about this opportunity across our entire position. We've seen such a dramatic improvement in our completion results with the newer technology that we're incorporating on our original completions that we've gone back and are starting to test some of these new completion techniques with our existing producers. We've already completed about 50 refracs on vertical wells in the Barnett, all with outstanding results, very commercial. We intend to complete a program of about 200 for 2015.","We've also \u2013 have completed about eight to 10 jobs on horizontal wells in the Barnett on what I would call partially depleted wells. We're encouraged by the work we're seeing there. We're \u2013 continue to test that consent. We have also \u2013 are testing refracs across the remaining portion of our portfolio. We've tested some in the shallow-water portions of the Permian Basin oil play and also in the Haynesville. We're designing refracs right now for the Eagle Ford and the Cana-Woodford projects. Overall, we understand that there's going to be technical challenges associated with a refrac program. Trying to control where you place the sand is going to be more difficult, but we're doing some real creative work in using science in our North Texas horizontal program to test both chemical diversion and mechanical diversion techniques, and we're encouraged by the work that we are seeing there.","So we're using all the technology available, employing all the science that we have from these existing properties that we've been so active in, in the past, and we're just extremely positive about it. We think this could be a significant game changer for a property like the Barnett Shale. We work pretty hard to keep our rate flat at 1.2 Bcf a day, and the guys have done a lot of good work with artificial lift and line pressure reductions. We think this refrac program could be a potential game-changer for the Barnett.","Howard J.

As you can see from our first quarter results, Devon's three-fold strategy of operating in North America's best resource plays, delivering superior execution, and maintaining a high degree of financial strength is working exceptionally well, and generating top tier results. Our production in the quarter exceeded guidance expectations by a wide margin. Our margins and profitability continue to expand as we transition to a higher margin product mix, and capital programs continue to achieve efficiency gains as we shift our focus toward full-field development in the STACK and Delaware Basin.","On the call today, I will focus my comments on three key messages. First, we remain very well positioned to accelerate investment across our world-class U.S. resource plays, and deliver on our 2017 and 2018 growth targets. By the end of this month, we will have 15 operated rigs running in the U.S., focused primarily within our top two franchise assets to STACK and Delaware Basin. As we progress through 2017, we are on pace to steadily ramp up drilling activity to as many as 20 rigs by year-end, resulting in a $2 billion to $2.3 billion upstream capital program for the year. Importantly, providing additional certainty to our accelerated investment plans, our attractive hedge position, excellent liquidity position, and innovative supply chain efforts.","With our disciplined hedging strategy we have stabilized our cash flow stream by locking in more than 50% of Devon's estimated oil and gas production for the year at or above market levels. We are also systematically accumulating additional hedges for 2018, and expect to protect the price on at least half of our production in 2018. Coupled with our investment-grade rating, and $2.1 billion of cash on hand, we have the financially capacity to execute on our business plan.","On the supply chain front, given the heightened competition for services and supplies in our core basins, we are taking aggressive steps to ensure that we have the resources and capabilities to achieve our growth plans. With this proactive work we have successfully secured equipment, crews, materials, and take-away capacity at competitive prices, and at the bottom of the cycle. Additionally, to achieve the best results for LOE and capital dollars we are mitigating inflation by decoupling historically bundled high-margin services, and are utilized in a much more diversified vendor universe base.","Also adding to our savings are the continued efficiency gains we're achieving across our early stage development plays, where the majority of our capital is invested. As we shift to full-field development in the STACK and Delaware Basin these efficiency gains will only ratchet higher. As a result of these strategies, strategic supply chain initiatives, and operational efficiencies, we have completely offset inflationary pressure through the first part of the year.","Overall, when you combine our financial strengths, and our innovative supply chain initiatives with the prospects of our top tier STACK and Delaware Basin assets, we are highly confident in our ability to deliver the value and returns associated with our growth plans over the next few years. The second key takeaway is that we are building momentum across our U.S. resource plays as we head to full-field development. As we have talked about at length over the past several months, we expect 2017 to be a breakout year for our Delaware Basin asset as we concentrate our activity in the economic core of the basin within southeast New Mexico. In fact, the initial well result from our development program in the first quarter, were truly fantastic.","Our first operated Wolfcamp well in the Rattlesnake area achieved the highest production rate of any well Devon has brought online in the Delaware Basin to-date. With 30 day rates reaching 3,000 BOE per day, we also tied in three high rate Bone Spring developable wells during the quarter with production rates that exceeded our type curve expectations by 30%.","In addition to our high rate well activity for the quarter, our shift to full field development in the Delaware Basin is now underway, we just completed drilling our first multi-zone development targeting three Leonard shale intervals and we have as many as four more multi-zone projects lined up to begin in the Delaware over the coming year. This development approach is expected as several advantages that will drive higher returns compared to traditional pad development work including improving rig and frac crew mobilization times, leveraging surface facilities across multiple drilling units, increasing per section recovery potential with improved planning, maximizing net present value as flexibility to add or defer development zones and more efficient permitting process on federal lands.","Additionally to maintain similar cycle times to traditional pad drilling, we plan to deploy concentrated development and completion activity across these larger developments. To position ourselves to accelerated activity across the Delaware Basin in 2018 and beyond, we have recently submitted four Master development plans to the Bureau of Land Management designed to accommodate up to 600 permits, in fact we just received notification of approval for a first master development plan at the Cotton Draw and expect the other three plants to be approved by year-end.","This innovative permitting strategy will allow us to accelerate our multi-zone development activity, maximizing returns and per section recoveries from our world class acreage. In the Oklahoma stack play, our capital activity also delivered outstanding well productivity, with the Woodford development program, we have now brought online the majority of the 39 well Hobson Row which results from this high impact road tracking at or above our EUR type curve of 1.6 million BOE per well. Hobson Row is one of the key drivers of our STACK growth plans in 2017 and gross production remains on pace to exceed 40,000 BOE per day by the end of the second quarter.","We're also excited about our next Woodford development, the Jacobs Row, we were deployed to learning attained from the Hobson Row and leverage larger completion designs across extended reach laterals, which we expect will boost returns associated with the Jacobs project to among the best in our portfolio. To the north and the over pressured oil window of the STACK our appraisal work during the quarter confirmed the potential for up to four landing zones in the core of the play. This appraisal activity will help further refine our initial multi-zone stack development, the Showboat project which is satisfied in the third quarter.","While still preliminary, our plans call for drilling 25 to 30 wells across two drilling units at Showboat, co-developing both the Meramec and Woodford formations. With additional appraisals of success in the core play, we could increase spacing to more than 20 wells per drilling unit with future development projects. To provide perspective on the scale of our stack opportunity, we have identified approximately 400 drilling units that are candidates for multi-zone development work providing us with a highly visible growth platform.","Looking beyond the Delaware and STACK, we also had impressive results within our Eagle Ford and Rockies assets. The initial flow back results from our nine Well Diamond spacing test in the Eagle Ford were very strong where 30 day rates averaging 2,100 BOE per day, with this pilot we have confirmed the Upper Eagle Ford as a commercially viable landing zone adding to our multi-year inventory in the field.","Our initial Rockies drilling work also delivered impressive results. Our first four Parkman wells crushed type curve expectations by averaging more than 1800 BOE per day of which 95% was light oil. Making the Rocky story sizzle even more for the quarter, are the results from recent state and federal lease options, winning bids that offset our southern acreage position recently $17,000 per acre. As a reminder, we opportunistically secured our leasehold position in this area for about $1,000 an acre in late 2015. And my last key message is that Devon absolutely possesses the low risk development inventory due to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone which are two of the very best positions, position poise on a North American cost curve, we have exposure to more than 30,000 potential drilling locations.","These world class assets provide Devon with a highly visible multi-decade growth platform. And as you saw in our press release last night, given the massive growth opportunity associated with our STACK and Delaware Basin assets, we simply have an abundance of opportunities within our portfolio. This high quality dilemma has resulted in our initial step to bring value forward with a $1 billion non-core asset divestiture program over the next 12 to 18 months. The non-core assets identified for monetization includes select portions of the Barnett Shale focus primarily around Johnson County and other properties located principally within the U.S.","Looking beyond today's announcement, I also want to be clear that our risk resource base in the U.S. has the potential to a further expand with ongoing appraisal work in STACK and Delaware Basin. With successful delineation results, we would evaluate strategic options for additional non-core asset sales in the future. The bottom line is the divestiture program combined with our excellent liquidity and strong hedge position supports our capital program and places us firmly on track to achieve our multi-year growth targets. Additionally, the certainty associated with our capital programs uniquely positions Devon attain strong operational momentum through the end of the decade.","So in summary, I believe Devon clearly offers investors a differentiated opportunity in the E&P space. We have a great collection of assets, we will continue to get the most out of these world-class assets with superior execution and we have one of the more advantageous capital structures in the E&P space. As we continue to execute on our disciplined business plan, we are well positioned to generate outsized returns for our shareholders for many years to come.","Now I will turn the call back over to Scott.","Scott Coody","Thanks Dave. We will now open the call to Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a follow up. If you have further questions you can re-prompt if time permits. With that, operator we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yes good morning, I was wondering Dave if you could maybe give us some more details on the multi-zone development, you mentioned that you had submitted kind of four master development plans, I was wondering maybe you could give us some details on what one of these development plans could look like at Cotton Draw in terms of the different zones between the Bone Spring Wolfcamp, Avalon et cetera?","David Hager","Arun, I'm going to take the first part of this, Arun, and good morning and I'm going to turn it over to Tony talk about the specific zones that we've been developing but talking a little bit about the Master development plan and that's really something that we are one of the first companies to do in the Delaware Basin and basically it takes a lot of the risk out of the permitting. As you know, we're developing this on federal acreage and historically has been difficult on a well by well basis to get an inventory far enough ahead of your drilling program to have the confidence that you can you can execute on a drilling program, with this master development program that essentially gives us a permit for a large area you see submitted four across and it's going to give us 600 and average about 150 per master development plan, we have the first one in already and so with that then all you have to do is get the individual ADPs which are a much, much shorter process and are really not on the critical path at all.","So this is a great concept that we've been working with the BLM on, we appreciate their cooperation on this and it's really a huge step forward for allowing us to go to a much higher rig count and you've seen in our operations report we said we're making plans not initially but up to 20 rigs out there and this is a big part of that. So Tony, you want to talk specifically about Cotton Draw a little bit?","Tony Vaughn","You know, Arun, appreciate your question, this is some planning works that we've been incorporating into the halls [ph] of Devon for about the last two years. And again as Dave mentioned, we appreciate the partnership that we have the BLM. It's really worked out to our advantage. And so if you look at the concept that we're describing in these multi-stacked horizons here, we're starting off with some fairly small sized, small-scaled, multi-stacked, multi-well pads. And so as we just commented on, we just finished a drilling of our Thistle Area 10 well pad. We will have a 20 well pad in the Delaware Basin by year-end.","We'll gradually transition from fairly small pads in 2017 and early '18. And by 2018 and beyond, we'll be a little bit larger in scale. But the benefit for something like Cotton Draw which has actually got prospectivity for 17 that will include the Bone Springs, Delaware, Leonard, and Wolfcamp. We will be prosecuting all those areas there. This one design allows us to have a larger sized pads not in surface areas much as in well count. And it will have a centralized production facility that each of the pads will be able to flow in to. This starts optimizing the surface facility; starts optimizing really the manufacturing process that we have. We will be able to have simultaneous operations as we go through the work. So provides a lot of the inherent efficiencies and our plan with a deep inventory that we have talked about in the Delaware Basin, we just knew there had to be a better solution than just a historic 2 to 3 wells per pad environment.","David Hager","And I might add I outlined in prepared remarks some of benefits of these type of well, but I know one of the push backs we've had is people are concerned, oh, my gosh, is this going to look a major offshore development in terms of timing with going this direction. Two comments on that, first is as Tony said, we're starting out small. So you are not going to see a large [indiscernible] 10, 15, 20 type of well sized pad initially. And the second point is in each of these pads, we are going to have multiple rigs working [ph]. And so, bottom line is you are not going to see a significant timing shift as we go from two to four wells per pad to a larger because of how we are going to concentrate our rigs on there to get it -- to keep the timing the same. So that concern is -- we have obviously been thinking about that, and we believe we have been working on that for a long time.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks. And my follow-up, I wanted to talk a little bit about the four extended reach wells that you're doing at the Hobson Row and what are your thoughts around the Jacob's Row? I think you talked about a 70 well development with Cimrax, I assume that's the standard lateral NSPs, four extended reach lateral wells do okay at Hobson, how could that influence your development plans for the Jacob's Row?","David Hager","Arun, we are really through all of the -- on the Jacob's Row -- on the Hobson Row excuse me, we are all the way through the completion of our normal lateral wells, and as you can see in the report, seeing very encouraging results. We've upsized the frac designs. And we decoupled our operations there. I will talk a little bit more about it as we go through call. I hope that great efficiency of operations. Execution phase is going really well. We're just now getting to long laterals that we described in the plan for the Hobson Row. We're fully expecting that long lateral is going to be the design of the future. And that will be what we incorporate into the Jacob's Row.","What I'll also comment on about we have 50:50 partnership with Cimrax there as you mentioned. We are continuing to work with their technical teams on what the -- what the forward plan is for capital allocation, both in Devon and in Cimrax. Right now, we're expecting to prosecute our three well section at the -- in Q4 of this year, we are expecting Cimrax to be close that same timeframe, but for right now, we're fully anticipating long lateral designs as we forward, and -- but we are fully focused on starting our three well program in middle of Q4\u2026","Arun Jayaram","And just to clarify is the Jacob's Row going to 70 long laterals or single laterals? I wasn't quite sure.","David Hager","It's going to be -- Arun, it's going to long lateral. Every time we can drill long lateral, we are going to drill long lateral. So I think if you've looked at lay out on the map that we highlighted here, they are all going to exposed to long lateral drilling.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Scott Coody","Arun, this is Scott. Hey, as you know, just a standard length lateral you are looking at 1.6 million equivalent on recovery basis. Right? So when you extend these laterals out with the Jacob's the returns ratchet significantly higher raveling what you are seeing in the over-pressured oil window in the Meramac. So, it'll be a great project for us and we are pretty excited about our spurting activity which will occur in Q4.","Arun Jayaram","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Excuse me. Good morning everybody. Excuse me. So, I wonder if I could start off with a question on inventory, Dave. And I guess it relates also to your billion dollar proposed asset sale. There are multiple pieces to this question, I guess, but just looking at all the data you've given today. You talked about going to 20 rigs. And at Delaware, you talked about 2000 unrisked locations. But yet your inventory in the Wolfcamp is only 500. So when do you basically get a little bit more disclosure, or, what do you need to see to step up the inventory in both the Delaware but also in the [indiscernible] landing zones now that seem to be working in the quarter the STACK. It seems your inventory is substantially understated. And my question is what that means for your -- timing of your non-core disposals as your inventory extends? If I may, I have got a quick follow-up to that, I will be glad. Thank you.","Dave Hager","Great. Well, I think you are hitting it exactly right, Doug. We see significant upside to our risked inventory. We obviously had a great well there with the Fighting Okra, and there has been some great offset wells to that. We are going to have a significant portion of our appraisal dollars in the Delaware Basin going to additional Wolfcamp wells here in the second half of the year. We are also going to be doing a lot more appraisal work up in the STACK. We take the approach so we want to see the actually results before we really put it into the risked inventory. But we have every confidence based on our well results and other competitor well results that this is going to continue to increase.","And we've looked as I said in our prepared remarks we look at this divestiture program as a first step. We think it's an appropriate first step because obviously commodity price has also has softened somewhat in the past few months. We are confident that we have a program already that we are planning on in 2018 that's well beyond the 20 rigs that we will in 2017. And we even talked in the last operations report, we didn't put in this one but a 60 and 3.25 $6 WTI, 3.25 Henry Hub, we will be generating about $3.5 billion of cash flow - upstream cash flow. So prices have fallen off a little bit from that. But with this, divestment program and that certainly gives us increased certainty that we can deliver on the growth results even if commodity price has soften because these wells are still generating incredible rates of return even at somewhat lower prices. So want to execute it.","Our operations teams are fully prepared to execute on that. And this gives us additional confidence that we will have the cash to generate that. Now as we further upraise these areas such as the Wolfcamp and additional landing zones in the STACK, we will consider additional divestments as appropriate if they are appropriate. And so, I would just look at this as certainly a single for how we are going in the future as we think this is the appropriate first step. But as we finish our appraisal program, there could be further steps. We continue with our appraisal program, there could be further steps.","Doug Leggate","So just to be clear, Dave, so, you are basically saying Devon lives within cash flows including asset sales?","Dave Hager","Essentially at this point, that's right, yes.","Doug Leggate","Okay. My follow-up is really on the relative economics across the different place. Obviously you've got a ton of things that are emerging that are competitive and what sits at the back of my mind is the rocky statement you made in the presentation. In order to provide a per acre value one would argue that you are trying to get the market to focus on the value of your acreage, but of course that only gets realized if you monetize it, and any reasonable timeline? I guess you can say the same thing about [indiscernible] recent sale of their oil sand. Again they got a big valuation for that, It's probably not getting recognized in your stock. So when you look to build the growth in inventory that you are clearly having in these areas, how did this relative areas within your business compete for capital? In other words, where would your incremental first look be to monetize, would it be Delaware slope, would it be the rest of the Barnett, would it be part of the Rockies, would it be oil sand, just how do you think about, how you prioritize non-core asset sales?","Dave Hager","Well, first off, I would say. We are not just trying to highlight it. We also get all the necessary I guess build in when you sell it. I think we can have that discussion over a beer someday I guess. But I don't think up sell all of our assets to get value recognized for it but what we are trying to say is that other people starting to recognize the value that we have and we think that should start showing up in our stock price.","The most important thing I can say is we are conscious strategy here and Devon has been to not only be in some of the best place in onshore north America, but to have the best positions and the best place in onshore north America. These are big place and they always in these place are as good spots to be and not so good spots to be and we are focused on being in the best and so I think when you look at our well level economics we will stand them up against anybody in the industry because we are in the heart of the best place onshore north America. Tony, do you want to add any comments from a relative viewpoint on the economics, but I am telling you they are all pretty outstanding.","Tony Vaughn","I think one thing Doug that we are proud about is we picked up our position. We expanded our position in the powder at a time when the industry really didn't understand the potential value there and now the industry has recognized that but if you look at the returns that we had before commodity prices cycled off, returns that we had in the powder where every bit is good, if not at the top end of our results in late Q4 or 14 and again if you look at the six wells or four wells that we talked about for this particular quarter. Again, there is a top end of our portfolio, so it's an equivalent capability to the Delaware, the best of the Delaware and the best of STACK, it just doesn't have the same skill to us as the other. So as commodity prices rise and additional cash flow is generated, it's going to be a great opportunity for us.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Tony Vaughn","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Jungwirth with BMO. Please go ahead.","Philip Jungwirth","Thanks, good morning. Question on the Barnett of the 400 to 500 million of cash flow expected in '17 just trying to understand the high level, does this include the -- in these de-payments and how should we think about any upside to Barnett cash flow de-contract, who are closer to the market rates.","Dave Hager","Well, I can certainly handle the first part of that with regards to the cash flow that we put up and that's net of all of our transportation and processing cost. So absolutely and I guess so could you repeat the second part of that question. I'm not sure I heard that clearly.","Philip Jungwirth","Just trying to understand how much upside there could be to that cash flow number if the AT&T contract within link we are in your vehicle sort of market rate?","Dave Hager","At that point you know, Philip that's undisclosed there is confidentiality regarding that. So that's not a number that we are going to be able to provide for you today. But I think the key takeaway is that these are very valuable assets that are generating free cash flow. So this isn't like other comps that occurred previously in prior years. This will be an asset that will be sort after and we expect to have good market as we look to market the asset.","Philip Jungwirth","Okay, great. And then, there has been a fair amount of or say the activity up towards northwest Dewey and Woodford County and we didn't had that's one filing, one empty position up there, I was just hoping that you help frame Devon's position in this area and is there anything to discuss in terms of well reserves, thoughts on the player or future activity plan?","Dave Hager","Philip, I think we've described that we have about 80,000 acres as what we call the northwest tag extension. We've acquired that position, just through a lot of organic leasing and picked up a few real small pieces. We have some well active in area we are really not ready to disclose that but we are encouraged and excited about the opportunities going forward and so I think at this point as well that's where we are leaving.","Philip Jungwirth","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake","Yes, good morning and it really feels like you are making progress de-risking this multi-zone perhaps in the Delaware. I mean each of the individual wells you give us later on. As you go to sort of a sectional development, are you ready at this stage to kind of like give us some kind of overall sectional tight curve and well cost or is it still too early?","Dave Hager","Probably the challenge to do that and good morning it is that. It really depends a lot on where you are and even in some cases you will find that some zones have already been developed and we will developing other zones as well. So there is, it's a fairly complex thing to try to give you a perception. In some cases there are. As Tony said we have Bone Springs, we have Leonard we have Wolfcamp, we have Delaware all of those in other areas such as our initial development and this we are just developing three zones in the Leonard and there is every other variety as well, but I guess the key is they are all working incredibly well, but it would be a very, it's not really possible just as to give a tight curve per section. I don't think because as a variety.","Edward Westlake","Okay, I think you know, when I think of the inventory and the value of the inventory. I'm trying to think of reasons why that the shares aren't reflecting in that and that sort of uncertainty maybe one of them although we can see obviously it's very good well results?","Dave Hager","Well, I see we said we have just a -- such a deep on risked inventory and we are going through an appraisal program and we will certainly layout even. Bottom-line is everything is working and it's working extremely economically right now and so as we continue this appraisal throughout '17 and even in the future years, you are going to see this inventory expand, we are confident to that. We just want to get the results before we give all the details.","Edward Westlake","The other comments in the up support around operational efficiency we are very interesting you talked about unbundling obviously the inflation starting to appear in certain lines but maybe if you can talk a little bit about how any examples you can share of how the unbundling of say problems or pressure pumping or other lines is leading to savings relative to say you know, a year ago or Q-over-Q however you want to describe it?","Dave Hager","Ed, we are seeing attention and cost escalation across the business. We've been very pleased. I think we commented in the past. So we are going to be able to mitigate about 75% of that cost escalation throughout Q4 '16 to Q4 '17 with just some good planning and good operational efficiency. We are seeing that in fact if you look at our capital spend through Q1 we are a little it light and we feel like we are being able to mitigate any tension we have on the system. Guys are doing extraordinarily a good job right now with the planning, not with execution but the planning of the work that we do and so when you guys are looking for we are already working out into 2018 and 2019 planning or work there allows us to go to providers, give them certainty about the long-term plans that are able to make more definitive long-term decisions. That's helping us in a big way, so we like to have control over our destiny as a lot of companies do we find that when we have good plans in place, good partners and control over the project schedule we can excel there.","So, we have actually contracted and secured our 2017 sand or all of our work in the mid-time and then also in the Delaware we have entered into a contract to secure the 100 mash [ph] sand for all of our STACK work for three years out. We find that the sand mines are pleased to be working with the end-user because we have definitive plans and also we are not at the mercy that some of the larger scale pressure pumping providers because we are getting plans from a lot of people that may not be as fine tuned and is well thought through as ours and so we would tend to get shuffled at times and so if I went back and looked at to look back on our work that we just completed on the Hobson Row, I think we've had a total of seven hours of delay not having sand on location rate of pump.","Historically, we would have three times that amount on single jobs at times, when we were depending on turnkey type work. So we've got some outstanding work across the organization that is allowing us to have good relationships. You're starting to see the OCTG market inflate as well. And we've had some long-term relationships with three providers there that we stuck with them during the downturn; they're sticking with us in the up cycle, so we're able to mitigate cost on the pipe side of the business. And on the drilling rig side of the business you're starting to see the, I guess I'll call it the high-spec end market for rigs is starting to diminish. And a little bit more pressure there, but our relationships with a couple of primary providers there have helped us get through that. We're also taking the opportunity to contract longer term in some of these spaces. And while we've always had a fair amount of our rigs under term -- In fact, right now I think we have 11 out of our 15 rigs under some amount of term. But we're also now moving that into the frac space.","And so, four out of six frac crews that we have working are on one-year term as well. So the guys are continuing to think forward. Our operating team and our supply chain group work extremely well together doing some good design work in-house. And so, we feel like we got places across the business that we essentially [technical difficulty] are gaining operational efficiencies that we didn't have two years ago. ","Edward Westlake","Thank you for the first answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Yes, thanks. Just kind of curious as you look at the STACK play and discuss the opportunities to get three to four potential formations for obviously these pad developments that sound pretty exciting. When you step back, how are you going to delineate the test of how many places have that say third or lower Meramec available or the Woodford available, is that something that you've got a good sense of right now or is there still a lot of work to get there?","Dave Hager","Scott, I think if you've watching the release on where our well activity has been, we've been really appraising around what we call appraisal areas one and two. In appraisal area one we'll have our first development that will start in Q3 of this year, we call that the Showboat development. In and around that particular area we feel confident that we understand the horizontal or the lateral spacing per zone very well. We're also getting fresh information on the vertical connectivity. And so we've got a lot of data on what we call the Meramec 200, and now we're seeing it on the 300 and the 400. That's being included, and that's what's described pictorially on one of the exhibits that we had in our operating report. So, in the specific area of the Showboat development we've got great pilot results in. It's giving us the confidence to incorporate parts of three different intervals in the Meramec. And as we continue with this development in Q3 we're also continuing appraisal work as we start moving to the western portion of the field.","So if you look at the latter half of '17 and the early part of '18, we'll be moving rigs more westerly than they had been to date. We're also going to be learning from our results as we go here. And so the first development, for instance, that Tony described here, is in the Showboat area. Well, our next development will be most likely a little bit to the west of this, so that we then learn from the Showboat and any actual well results. And sometimes there may even be some questions, I think, on the operations report. One of the things, that we don't have as many wells on that diagram in the lower part of the Meramec. But it's because we think there is a question as to whether these are in vertical communication. And less wells is good; if you can get the hydrocarbons out with less wells, that's actually good. But we'll learn from the actual production from that to help us guide our future development, and when we move back into that area. So we have a very well thought out, very well planned approach to this so that we will be bottom line, optimizing the NPV overall or the capital efficiency that we're going to get from this program.","Scott Hanold","Okay. And I hope that this is not putting words in your mouth, but in part where you're looking to delineate first and move to is part of it, it sounds like maybe a sickness of the Meramec?","Dave Hager","As you move to the west and to the south a bit, Scott, you are moving into a sicker portion of the Meramec in the, what we call, the 300 and 400 intervals. So you would see more oil in place in those middle-to-lower sections there. So you're right, it changes as you go from the eastern part of the field over to the west.","Scott Hanold","Okay, great. And as a follow-up question, the Barnett Shale potential sale, can you guys give us a sense of how much net production you'll have there? And maybe if you'd even extend that to that cash flow expectation or estimate that you all have put out there today or yesterday. What portion would be associated with that?","Dave Hager","The planned divestments are about 20% of the leasehold production reserves and the cash flows, a simple way to think about that.","Scott Hanold","Okay, I understand. That's great. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on a very interesting quarter. First, going to the multi-zone concept, as you continue to evolve this concept I was wondering is overall pad oil cut versus overall BOE potential a consideration factor regarding which zones might be developed?","Jeff Ritenour","Well it is, Jeff. And I think Dave was trying to articulate the full matrix of considerations our technical teams are going through right now. And so if you look at the different intervals, some are completely de-risked and already in the development phase and some have very little data. As an example, the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, we have higher oil cuts in some than others. And some are just more prolific from a traditional rate perspective. And so there's a complicated matrix that the guys go through. I'd have to tell you that we'll be focused on generating maximum present value and returns from each of the multi-stacked developments that we go into. There is also an optimized size that we look at. And we think that we can get up towards savings, roughly, of about 20% in the DNC side of this up to a certain limit of wells before you start seeing that cost benefit degrade. And also, returns will be maximized at a certain point. And then with too large of a program will turn over, and also diminish. So, guys are looking at this on a project-by-project basis. And it's harder to describe that. But they'll be looking to maximize value and returns.","Jeffrey Campbell","That was a helpful answer, I appreciate it. And then this is a little bit higher level one. Both the Barnett and the Delaware Basin are proximal to the Gulf Coast and growing that gas demand. Ultimately, can the legacy Barnett nat gas compete for capital with what might be viewed as associated nat gas in the Delaware Basin? ","Jeff Ritenour","Well, the nat gas that we have seen, the drier gas opportunities in our portfolio for the most part are not competing for capital as well as our more oily-oriented areas that have associated natural gas. Now everybody likes to talk about these more oily-oriented areas. There is in most cases a fair amount of natural gas that comes along with those; it varies play-to-play. But there is a fair amount. But I think we have not focused much drilling in our portfolio on dry gas opportunities. And so that's one of the things that we obviously are thinking about here as we look at our divestment program. There are still opportunities that can generate returns well above the cost to capital. It's just our portfolio is so high quality they may not generate capital within our portfolio. So we think there's a great market out there, and there's an opportunity potentially to move value forward. We're just trying to make those type of decisions at the appropriate time. And I think you saw the first step of it with our announced divestment last night, and described earlier the rationale for the timing and the magnitude of that.","Jeffrey Campbell","Right, understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Maybe let's start out with one in the Delaware Basin. I know you have limited results in the Wolfcamp right now. But in the past, you had talked about lack of capital deployment in the Wolfcamp, the view that wouldn't compete on a return basis with the Bone Spring, and the Leonard, I mean. First well there look quite strong and I mean would you still at this point based on incremental data we've seen over time characterize -- how would you characterize returns competitiveness of the Wolfcamp versus the Bone Spring and the Leonard and could this have any impact and how you think about deployment of capital within the Delaware going forward?","Dave Hager","Ryan, we're actually very positive view in the Wolfcamp going forward and we've seen some industry derisk the Wolfcamp around us and we've reported on the hiding of our well ourselves so we're highly encouraged with the opportunity in the Wolfcamp will compete for capital as well as our Bone Spring Delaware and Leonard going forward if you really step back about a year, year and a half ago we didn't have the infrastructure built in the southern portion of our play there so that was a learning experience we had to think you also saw about that time we had very high lease operating cost for BOE. All of that infrastructure we've caught up with our selves now, and so, we've got full water being pipe we've got power grid system across our position there in the Cotton Draw and in Rattlesnake area. So we'll have a much healthier commercial answer for Wolfcamp development going forward, and if you just look at the areas of focus for 2017 probably about 50% to 60% of our well activity will be focused in both Leonard and the Wolfcamp going forward. So we're encouraged by the quality of results that we're seeing in Wolfcamp.","Tony Vaughn","I would more directly to answer your question I still think the highest returns are in the Bone Spring and the Leonard has come up. The Wolfcamp is certainly improving significantly and it has the largest upside to the inventory.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thank you, that's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up on the multi-zone developments, you talked about some of the drilling and service level improvements and efficiency you might I wasn't sure if you just said there you could see 20% DLC improvement, but if you quantified what you think the efficiency improvements might be in multi-zone development relative to defend a single well that you've told in the past and then we talking about a 10% improvement in kind of capital efficiency 20% any ability to ballpark that.","Jeff Ritenour","Ryan, that was trying to describe a little bit earlier, but we have quantified that guys do a really good job of planning out these developments to maximize the efficiency of the developments. We think these multi stacked developments have the opportunity to reduce total CapEx cost by about 20% on a given section as compared to the historic two to three wells per pad and if you go through the long list of positive attributes that these new designs will yield, but we think it's a game changer for the large inventory that a company like Devon has.","Dave Hager","And I'll just reiterate one more time I said it earlier too, but you're not going to see a significant timing differences, this is not like an offshore development Tony and I've worked a lot of offshore developments we know what offshore developments look like it. You're not going to see significant timing difference are compared to what you've seen historically which I think has been some of the concern.","Ryan Todd","Great, I appreciate the clarity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Evan Calio","Good afternoon, guys. Last to cover maybe a bigger picture question, you what level of well performance you guys factor in your full-year production guidance and is it, that based on your actual type curves or something higher and I'm asking the question could you just reported excellent well results across all three of your major basins and most significantly above those type curves that the full-year production guidance for means unchanged this is kind of contrast between the guide and the information the ops report.","Dave Hager","Yes. Well, first off, the well results are outstanding as you said there's absolutely no hedging on that, but actually I understand that the current year well results proportionally to the total production is pretty down small and so there's a lot of other factors that go in to your production guidance beyond just the current year well results. So, and then, obviously I think everybody's figured out by now that, what is shifted between our outperformance here in Q1 and somewhat lower guidance in Q2 is just the fact that we moved, we're able to get some Eagle Ford completions accelerated into Q1 production and so the full-year guidance is unchanged it's just we got production on a little bit earlier and that's on those wells, but they do go on incredibly economic wells. But they are come on very high rates and have pretty steep declines, and we'll see some of that in Q2 in Eagle Ford. So there's just a lot of factors that go into the full-year production guidance were beyond the current -- beyond just the type curves that are -- that we publish, but obviously we are pleased that in several areas we are exceeding type curve expectations\u2026","Evan Calio","Make sense.","Dave Hager","Yes, I will add in, one more Tony.","Tony Vaughn","Yes, just I want to give a little kudos to the work our technical teams are doing on the completion side of the business is driving some of the sap performance and if you remember even I think it was probably several quarters ago that we showed that our 90-day IPs were number one out of 30 most active operators in the U.S. base and that was in 2015 and 2016 you looked the data, in 2015 by the way with the average of our per well performance was over 600 BOE per day. When we look at 2016 our average for new wells brought on is over 900 BOE per day. So we took -- what we thought was an outstanding performance and '15 continued to evolve doing some really sophisticated subsurface modeling, frac modeling and have increased our 90-day IPs another 50% in 2016. And you start looking at Q1 results in '17 it's a little higher than where we left off in '16, so the guys are continuing to put the pedal down and really outstanding results.","Evan Calio","Understood.","Jeff Ritenour","And just a point of clarity real quick that those are for a 90-day rate and then also the gas piece of that production which is being adjusted on a 21 basis as well, so that would account for some of the reconciliation versus some of the 30-day rate you're seeing in our operations reports.","Evan Calio","Great. So will look for that in the 2018 numbers, it sounds. And my second question is on the little bit fall from the asset sale programs to pick up on your opening comments and some of the Q&A discussion. The asset program appears to be its employees to grow as organic location count grows. How do you think about optimal inventory that defines how much is non-core so either in years of inventory region or return driven program and somewhat related to me is the vision to scale asset sales with the deliberate before the capital or more pace just with the down spacing results?","Dave Hager","Yes. That's a great question and it has a really hard question to answer it's kind of like the old reserve production ratio, you're going to have too much and you can have too little and what is the right number and I can give you some directional thoughts on that. I don't know that there is an absolute right answer, but I tend to think of somewhere around a 20 year inventory at anticipate that will be very economic locations that anticipated prices. Is kind of a quick summary of before I would say I don't think it does a lot of good to have a 100-year inventory and I don't know if I sleep for a while if I had a five year inventory, though so somewhere around there I know that there exact right number I really can't say, but I think that probably get you somewhere in the ballpark.","Evan Calio","Great. In the pacing concept, does it -- do you think the sales utilized can match ability to redeploy capital obviously neutralizing for many kind of commodity change or is it just going to run its course with results and location count?","Dave Hager","Well. We see this billion dollar divestment program is just giving us additional certainty with and we would do it anyway, because it's the right thing, because it's a right given the depth of our inventory. We also see that same time that commodity prices have weakened somewhat and so this gives us greater certainty around the fact that we are going to have the cash flow to execute on a very high return program in 2018. Now as we see in 2019 we're going to continue to ramp up activity and we again as we finish more of this appraisal work more of it gets de-risk the 2018 and the end of the game for us we see continuing to ramp up and capital and activity as we move forward beyond that this just going to continue to accelerate our growth and future years. And we will, if the all the appraisal work, works out as we anticipate it well I think that we would be looking at additional divestments depending on commodity prices to how strong those are but we're probably looking at additional investments to focus our capital even more. ","Evan Calio","Great, I appreciate it guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with TPH. Please go ahead.","Matt Portillo","Good morning, Dave, and team. Morning Just first question I wanted to follow up on comments around the upper Eagle Ford you made at the beginning with the successful commercial delineation just curious how that potentially impacts your view on inventory in the play and with the new diamond pattern that you're currently title piloting how much think about your core inventory over the next few years.","Dave Hager","Matt, we're very pleased with the well results we saw with the acceleration of our ductwork into Q1. That data is being incorporated open to Devon and BHPs technical thoughts right now but the lower Eagle Ford staggered wells worked extremely well the Upper Eagle Ford wells that were incorporated in that plan worked very well. We're drilling Austin Chalk wells at this time so, I don't know the technical teams of come out with their plan I would just made somewhere between 500, and 1000 locations and going forward, the main thing to think about at this point is we've got two rigs operating right now on the plate and anticipate probably three in the second half of this year. Those will be utilized when the guys are have incorporated all these results into their thoughts.","Tony Vaughn","And that really just another thought to that is that when you think about the Eagle Ford where well we do have some very high returning inventory in a multi-year basis that we can execute upon the transition of the Eagle Ford really is a free cash flow generator for our stack in Delaware Basin growth and I think that's how you need to perceive that asset with regard to the strategic fit in our portfolio of very high margin barrels, great results, but it's certainly we're going to harvest that cash flow and put it over the basin.","Matt Portillo","Great. And then as follow-up just in regards to the PRV highlighted some fantastic Parkman wells here in the rates of return on a, on a well level basis are competitive with the Delaware in the stack just curious from a milestone perspective what we should be watching for over the next year or two in term opportunities to scale the PRB further in regards to production and capital allocation?","Dave Hager","Our plans right now we're bringing in a second rig pretty quick so, we're encouraged by what we have we're starting to prosecute some of the new lands that we picked up this past year in the southern portion of our property and again it's going to be cash flow available to allocate between Delaware stack in the Rockies will these kind of the, the question that we evaluate quarter-to-quarter but we've got inventory and permits are coming we've got to get another good relationship there with the BLM office that is progressing. And we feel pretty good about uncertainty of execution in the powder as well as we did in the stack in the, in the Delaware.","Matt Portillo","Great thank you very much.","Operator","And our final question for today comes from the line of John [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thank you. As you get these bigger drilling units, Dave -- Tony has discussed some of the efficiencies you're gaining the fact that vendors like long term visibility do you see a point where as these filling units are larger that you have such concentrated activity that you're willing to do multi-year deals or that the vendors would do multi-year deals and also would behoove you if they're not willing to do that to be perhaps more integrated?","Dave Hager","Absolutely, John, and we have already done that on sand and we do see that is and I think Tony tried to allude to that that but that's one of the advantages that we see because this does provide certainty of activity and with us working directly with the sand mines for instance they like that because they really know then okay, we're dealing with counties is actually going to drill the well so, there is a much more certainty of demand in areas dealing with a service company who is relying on representations from a number of operators. And it's not a service company solve with a beta is not knowing it is detail whether those plans are going to be true or not where dealing directly with the Devon with a house standing reputation and following through on what we say we're going to do. We see that's an advantage and allows them to have confidence to enter into multiyear agreements with us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, good. With respect to the Eagle Ford I just heard you know about the harvest mode essentially put the Delaware in the stack what if BHP wanted to exit would you be interested in that position or you would just consider again the Eagle Ford to be more of a cash flow source.","Dave Hager","I don't know we have to I'd hate to say on any individual asset whether we would be interested or not instead. I think it is probably fair to say that we tend to like things where we see value gaps and a lot of times of value gaps of appear because of a perception of what the upside of an asset may be from one company to another.","So, I think given the maturity of the asset there's probably not as much inventory there as or maybe in other areas where there could be value gaps. Newest prefer more undeveloped acres so, I don't think that's a big focus for us right now, but I'd never have you know I mean have to see how it evolves, but that's initial thoughts.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you very much, Dave.","Scott Coody","I'm showing us at the top of the hour. So, I appreciate everyone's interest in Devon today. And if we didn't get your question, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any time, which consists of myself and Chris Carr. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you, everyone for attending. This will conclude today's conference call.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks we will conduct a question-and-answer session. The call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Vince White","","Thank you and welcome everyone to Devon\u2019s second quarter earnings call and webcast. Before we get started, I want to make sure that everyone is aware that we have prepared a handful of slides to supplement today\u2019s script. These are integrated with today\u2019s webcast and they\u2019re also available for download in PDF form on Devon\u2019s home page devonenergy.com.

When we use these measures we are required to provide specific related disclosures, those disclosures can be found on Devon\u2019s website.","As many of you know I am retiring from Devon at the end of this week. I can honestly say that being a part of this organization for the last 21 years has been both a pleasure and a privilege. I am truly grateful to all my friends at Devon and in the investment community and the industry for making my time here so rewarding. So thank you.","At this point I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Richels. John.","John Richels","","Thank you Vince and on behalf of the Company and many people you have positively impacted over your career. I just want to take this opportunity to thank you. You\u2019ve done a terrific job through the years and you have been a great friend and we wish both you and Marty a very happy and healthy retirement.","Now as many of you know with Vince\u2019s retirement, Howard Thill has joined our team as Senior Vice President of Communications Investor Relations. Howard has a long history in the business with over 30 years of experience the last 12 and much the same role at Marathon Oil and previously at Phillips Petroleum. We\u2019re very fortunate to have an individual of Howard\u2019s experience join our team and we welcome Howard to Devon. I am sure that many of you will have the opportunity to meet with Howard over the coming months.","So let\u2019s move to the results of the quarter. The second quarter was another outstanding one for Devon both operationally and financially as we continued to successfully execute on our strategic plan. As we point out on Slide 3, during the quarter we announced the sale of our non-core U.S. assets the final piece of our portfolio transformation. Since announcing this planned transformation just nine months ago we have taken three very significant steps to reconfigure our portfolio, the accretive Eagle Ford acquisition, the unique and innovative EnLink transaction and the sale of our non-core properties at very attractive prices.","Also during this time our drilling program has delivered impressive oil production growth through our focus on our reconfigured portfolio. This oil focused effort helped to deliver a 47% increase in cash flow this quarter compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. And during the period we also completed number of major projects that we\u2019ll discuss in more detail during the call.","So let\u2019s take a look at some of these highlights in a bit more detail.","Looking at Slide 4, in the second quarter we achieved year-over-year oil production growth of 34% from our go forward asset base, reaching an average daily rate of 205,000 barrels per day. This growth was driven entirely by light oil production from our retained U.S. assets which increased an impressive 79% compared to the second quarter of 2013. This dramatic increase in U.S. oil productions largely attributable to growth from our world class operations in the Permian basin and in the Eagle Ford.","With the aggressive transformation of our North American on shore portfolio, total liquids production is expected to approach 60% of Devon\u2019s go forward production by year-end, and that\u2019s up from just over 30% a few years ago.","As shown on Slide 5, our focus on high margin oil development increased our companywide oil revenue 42% in the second quarter compared to the previous year and accounted for more than 60% of our total upstream revenue. This strong revenue growth combined with our low cost structure has expanded our pre-tax cash margin per barrel by 40% year-over-year. As shown on Slide 6, as I mentioned earlier, we announced the $2.3 billion sale of our non-core oil and gas properties in the U.S. during the second quarter. This transaction valued these gas weighted assets at approximately seven times EBITDA, significantly above our current trading multiple thereby making it immediately accretive to Devon shareholders.","Combined with the sale of our Canadian conventional gas business earlier in the year, which has also had about seven times EBITDA, pre-tax proceeds from our non-core asset divestiture program totaled more than $5 billion. We are applying these proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing the debt taken on to fund our Eagle Ford acquisition. ","This portfolio repositioning provides Devon all the necessary attributes to deliver superior per share growth. Our go forwards assets are generating excellent full cycle returns, we have a strong investment grade balance sheet and we have a deep inventory of highly economic low risk development projects in some of the most attractive basins in North America.","As you can see on Slide 7, this formidable and balanced portfolio consists of three world-class oil development plays in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford and the Canadian oil sands and two of the best liquids-rich gas areas in the U.S., the Barnett Shale which is nearly 30% liquids production and the Anadarko Basin which is about 45% liquids. We also have two emerging oil plays which could further bolster the depth of our portfolio and we have a majority ownership in EnLink Midstream, one of the premier midstream companies in North America. ","Turning to Slide 8, with the first six months of 2014 results now in hand, our retained asset portfolio remains on track to deliver companywide oil production growth of more than 30% year-over-year. This exceptional oil growth rate is driven entirely by the 70% plus increase we expect in U.S. wide oil production. This should drive about 10% top-line production growth on a 6:1 energy equivalency basis. And on a value or price equivalency basis, applying a more realistic oil to natural gas price ratio of 20:1, expected top-line production growth in 2014 will be approximately 20%.","Moving to Slide 9, I'll remind you that about 80% of our 2014 E&P capital budget is focused on our core and emerging oil development opportunities which will continue to drive our oil production growth in the second half of 2014 as well as next year. As you can see on the table to the right of that slide, year-to-date, we have spent just under half of our 2014 capital budget. ","With large high quality acreage positions in each of our core assets, we're positioned with a deep inventory of repeatable investment opportunities. In fact as we discussed on our call last quarter, one of the most exciting operational developments over the past several months has been the significant expansion of our drilling inventory and our resource potential in the five margin core areas.","Led by the tremendous results that we are seeing in the Delaware Basin, our gross risk undrilled inventory has now increased by more than 5,000 locations year-to-date. These 5,000 plus locations have been rigorously risked based on historical well performance, in-depth technical evaluations and disciplined economic expectations based on the current price and cost environment just to mention a few. As we continue to de-risk and develop the opportunities within our portfolio, we fully expect our inventory to further increase overtime. In fact with the technical work that we have done over the last quarter, we have increasing confidence that we can materially grow this inventory in the near future and Dave will speak to this in more detail later. ","Not only do we have a very large resource base but we also have the financial capacity to efficiently convert this resource into production and cash flow. Our balance sheet's in terrific shape and our operating cash flow continues to accelerate, thanks to our rapid oil growth, driving margins higher.","And don\u2019t forget that another potential source of cash for Devon is the ability to dropdown additional midstream assets to EnLink. As seen on slides 10 and 11, two potential dropdown candidates are the access pipeline in the Canadian oil sands and the Victoria Express Pipeline in the Eagle Ford, both of which were recently completed. These strategically located assets have exposure to two of the fastest growing oil plays in North America. While no decision has been made, these high quality pipelines could be dropped into EnLink within the next year or two.","Given the visibility of our significant cash inflows, coupled with a high margin asset base ready for development, we expect to accelerate drilling activity in 2015 across several of our core and emerging plays. ","As you can see on Slide 12, Devon is positioned to deliver organic oil production growth in excess of 20% in 2015 while delivering a healthy topline production growth in the mid-single digits. The Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin will once again lead our oil production growth in the U.S. and we will also see significant oil growth from our Jackfish 3 project in Canada where we recently started steam injection.","In summary we\u2019re very pleased with the execution and outcome of the transformative steps that we took over a relatively short period of time to high grade our portfolio and meaningfully improve our growth trajectory and margins. When you combine the growth potential of our top tier oil development projects with our high quality natural gas optionality, we\u2019re very well positioned for competitive growth for years to come.","And as we execute on our growth plans Devon shareholders will continue to benefit from improving margins, higher cash flows and further value recognition through EnLink.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed operations review. Dave?","Dave Hager","","Thank you John. As John mentioned our solid execution in the quarter resulted in strong oil production growth driving an impressive increase in our operating cash flow. We are laser focused on the key drivers of outstanding operational performance, including driving down drilling times, optimized conclusion designs and very efficient production operations. Continuous improvement in each of these areas and others will provide incremental value in each of our operating areas.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at some of Devon\u2019s key operating highlights in more detail. In the Permian basin we increased production 25% compared to the same quarter last year to 95,000 BOE per day. The solid execution of our development programs in the Permian place is firmly on track to grow 2014 production by 20% compared to 2013. Importantly light oil production accounts for nearly 60% of our total Permian volumes.","Shown in the green outline on Slide 13, is the Bone Spring play in Delaware Basin, a key driver of our Permian oil growth. In the second quarter we brought 22 new Bone Spring wells online, with average 30 day IP rates of 660 BOE per day, once again exceeding our pre-drill expectations. At an average cost of just over 6 million per well our Bone Spring program is delivering some of the best returns in our portfolio. ","We also have an ongoing Delaware Sands program that is beating expectations. In the second quarter we commenced production on two high-rate oil wells targeting the Delaware Sands Lea County, New Mexico. Initial 30-day production from each of these two wells averaged about 1,000 BOE per day, 70% of which was light oil.","As we discussed last quarter the tremendous results from our Delaware Basin drilling programs coupled with an ongoing reservoir characterization work allowed us to substantially increase our rest undrilled inventory. The stack pay nature of our position in Delaware Basin provides us with exposure not only to the Bone Spring and Delaware Sands but also the Leonard Shale, Wolfcamp and several other oil zones. In aggregate our multi-zone potential and the Delaware Basin provides us with exposure to more than 5,000 (risk) [ph] undrilled locations.","Turning your attention to Slide 14, I want to be clear. This inventory of 5,000 plus locations is not simply acreage divided by an arbitrary well spacing. We screen these locations based on multi-variant analysis that takes into account geologic, geophysical, completion and production data that characterize and predict reservoir performance. This disciplined methodology is utilized across our entire portfolio including the Delaware Basin to identify and quantify undrilled inventory.","Slide 15, provides a summary of the risking applied to each of our perspective zones in the Delaware Basin. In the second column our technical teams have identified net perspective acres in each formation in the Delaware Basin. Next, the multi-variant analysis I just described was performed by our technical teams which risked these perspective acres by as much as 50%.","Now there is insufficient data to do a multi-variant analysis on down spacing. So you can see we conservatively assumed only four to five wells per drillable section in each formation. Given that we believe there is meaningful upside to our inventory. For example we\u2019re currently implanting a program in the Delaware Basin to utilize a much larger and more focused frac design, deliver a more complex fracturing network closer to the well bore. We believe these larger, more complex frac designs will more effectively drain the reservoir, increase recovery factors and further enhance rate return.","In conjunction with these larger more complex focused fracs we are evaluating the concept of a staggered lateral development scheme that can further tighten well spacing across our entire prospective formations in the Delaware Basin and thus could significantly increase our risk undrilled inventory. We will continue to update you on our progress in the coming quarters. ","Converting this massive and growing opportunity in the Delaware Basin into production and cash flow, is a top priority for us. While not finalized, our preliminary plan is to increase our operated rig count from the 12 currently running in the Delaware to as many as 20 by the end of 2015. We plan to ramp the activity in an orderly fashion, as we secured gathering and processing capacity, high quality rigs, completion services and manpower to support the higher rig count.","This increased investment in the Delaware Basin will allow us to continue aggressively developing our highly profitable Bone Spring inventory and accelerate the development and appraisal of our Delaware sands, Leonard Shale and Wolfcamp inventories. This sets up the prolific Delaware Basin position for significant high margin growth in 2015 and for years to come. ","Shifting to the Midland Basin, we delivered another quarter of strong results from our oil development program in a Southern Midland Wolfcamp shale. We increased average net production in this play to 12,000 Boe per day, representing significant year-over-year increase of 9,000 Boe per day.","In a Northern Midland Wolfcamp trend, we start our first horizontal well in Martin County, targeting the Wolfcamp B formation in the third quarter. We have approximately 14,000 net acres in a prolific Martin County area, prospective to multiple Wolfcamp zones. ","In aggregate, we have identified about 200 undrilled locations in the Northern Midland Wolfcamp trend and this is an area likely to see increased activity as we head into 2015. Shifting to the Eagle Ford on Slide 16, while we have wholly-owned these assets for a handful of months, we could not be more pleased with the performance we have seen from this world-class asset. And we have already identified several promising opportunities that can further enhance well economics and boost our drilling inventory.","I will speak to this in more detail shortly but let\u2019s begin with a review of the second quarter results. During the quarter, we have 17 rigs running across our Eagle Ford position with the majority focus on developing our DeWitt County acreage in the economic heart of this top tier oil play. We brought 60 new Eagle Ford wells online with average 30 day IP ratio, approaching 1,200 Boe per day. These high impact wells drove our average Q2 production in the Eagle Ford to 65,000 Boe per day, in line with the guidance range we had provided last quarter.","Notably, we achieved a strong growth in spite of production interruptions primarily related to third-party gathering constraints in DeWitt County. In aggregate, these gathering constraints reduced production by about 8,000 Boe per day in the quarter. Even with these infrastructure limitations, we were able to bring approximately 30 wells online around mid-quarter that helped accelerate our average net production in June to 73,000 Boe per day. This ramp up in June represents an impressive increase of nearly 50% compared to the first quarter exit rate.","It is also worth mentioning that our Eagle Ford production is also delivering the highest pre-tax cash operating margin of any asset in our portfolio at around $60 per Boe. ","Looking ahead to the second half of the year, our drilling and completion programs in Eagle Ford remain on schedule, keeping us on track to deliver outstanding production growth rates. As we have said before, this production can be somewhat lumpy due to the timing of pad drilling and third-party and midstream infrastructure. At June 30th, we had 108 drilled wells not yet producing. ","We expect this inventory to continue to trend downward over the coming months as the number pads are scheduled for tie-in and a necessary transportation system improvements are completed in DeWitt County. As a result, for the remaining six months of 2014, we are forecasting our net Eagle Ford production to average between 80,000 and 85,000 Boe per day. We expect both the third and fourth quarter to generate solid sequential quarter production growth with volume growth weighted more toward the fourth quarter due to the timing of pad tie-ins that I just mentioned.","Overall, the second half outlook, keeps us on pace to deliver on our previously announced guidance of 70,000 to 80,000 Boe per day for 10 months of ownership this year. as I touched on earlier, we are also excited about a number of potential upside opportunities we have identified across our position in Eagle Ford. In our development activity in DeWitt County, we are currently closely working with our partner BHP to enhance various aspects of our well completions as well as areas on the production operations side of the business. ","While it's premature to discuss any specific details the technical teams have identified opportunities to optimize completion designs that could increase well recoveries and at the same time reduce well costs. The teams have also identified potential opportunities to improve the rates of return to optimize choke management. As we continue to pursue these promising initiatives we will continue to update you on our progress.","Moving to Slide 17, another leg of upside is in Lavaca County. In the second quarter we tied in our first operated well in Lavaca County targeting the lower Eagle Ford formation. As seen on the blue on the map the initial 24 hour production from the Ronyn 1H was approximately 1,600 Boe per day, of which 70% was light oil. Combined with announced well by industry represented in gray lower Eagle Ford results to date in Lavaca County have exceeded our initial expectations.","Turning your attention to Slide 18, perhaps one of our more exciting potential upside opportunities is in the upper Eagle Ford. As shown by the size of Parkman, the majority of our DeWitt and Lavaca County acreage is highly perspective for this emerging play. This is further supported by the encouraging industry results in Lavaca County seen in gray on the map.","It is worth noting that these Lavaca County wells results are not in the thickest part of the upper Eagle Ford, which as you can see from the map bodes well for the prospects of our DeWitt County acreage where the upper Eagle Ford net pay is the thickest. We have just filed our first operated upper Eagle Ford well the Medina 2H on 100% working interest acreage in Northeast DeWitt County. This can be seen in blue on the map. ","This is the first of a handful of tasks planned this year. If the upper Eagle Ford formation is commercially successful this could expand Devon's resource and further deepen our drilling inventory.","On Slide 19, at our Jackfish thermal oil projects in Northeastern Alberta gross production from our Jackfish 1 and Jackfish 2 projects increased 3% year-over-year to a combined average of 60,000 barrels of oil per day or 52,000 barrels per day after royalties.","Further enhancing results this significant improvement in Western Canadian slug benchmark pricing increased price realizations at Jackfish by 22% compared to the year ago quarter to $65.88. At Jackfish 1 gross production averaged 36,000 barrels per day or 29,000 barrels per day net of royalties in the second quarter. ","The success of our ongoing efforts to improve our steam oil ratio once again resulted in gross production exceeding the facilities main pipe capacity of 35,000 barrels per day.","In the third quarter we will bring the Jackfish 1 plant down for a schedule two week maintenance turnaround beginning in September. Accordingly this maintenance downtime and subsequent ramp up will reduce Jackfish 1 production by 5,000 to 10,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Keep in mind this has been built into our third quarter and full year production guidance.","At Jackfish 3 we began steaming on July 13 and expect a steady ramp up of production over the next 18 months to a sustained rate of 35,000 barrels a day. Jackfish 3 will provide multi-year oil production growth beginning in 2015 with net oil production from our Jackfish complex expected to be between 62,000 and 67,000 barrels per day. This represents production growth of about 30% compared to 2014. ","Furthermore as seen on Slide 20, the completion of Jackfish 3 will begin an era of free cash flow from our Jackfish complex with the potential to generate around $1 billion annually for many years. Even after accounting for maintenance capital requirements.","Shifting now to the Anadarko Basin Western Oklahoma for our operations continued to deliver great results. In the second quarter we have once again set a production record reaching 93,000 Boe per day. With drilling focused on our most liquid rich acreage oil and NGL production increased 26% year-over-year and is now about 45% of production in the Anadarko Basin.","The Cana-Woodford play was the most significant contributor to our strong second quarter production growth in the Anadarko Basin. This growth was driven by the strong performance of several new well pads brought on line that employed our new redesign completions as well as rejuvenated performance from existing wells as a result of our ongoing asset treatment program.","Slide 21, shows the meaningful increase in sand per well along with more frac stages and tighter perp clusters. This new frac design was utilized on the 20 Cana-Woodford well we brought on line and the liquids rich core play during the second quarter. Initial 30 day raise from these wells averaged 1,250 Boe per day including 700 barrels of liquids per day exceeding our type curve by more than 35%. ","These are among the most productive wells ever drilled in Cana with average EURs trending in excess of a 1.5 million equivalent barrels per well. ","As you can see on Slide 22, for the 20 wells were brought online in Q2, the redesigned completions dramatically enhanced IPs, boosted EURs by more than 15% and with well cost essentially flat. This translates into strong rates of return that are competitive with many U.S. oil plays. Our asset team at Cana have also done some outstanding work to revitalize production from existing wells with asset treatments. We have now treated nearly 200 operated and non-operated Cana wells and results have been exceptional.","In most cases, the inexpensive procedure around $250,000 per job, took production per well from about a 1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, up to 2 million a day or more. As seen on Slide 23, these asset jobs have improved our gross operated wet gas production at Cana by roughly 40 million cubic feet a day. We expect Bcf per well of additional recovery with a payback period of less than three months. We have around 140 additional operated and non-operated wells that can be treated in the core area and we expect to have most of these treated by year-end.","Moving to Slide 24, given the success of these recent efforts at Cana, we opportunistically bolstered our leasehold position in May by acquiring an additional 50,000 net acres in the core of the play. This transaction closed in late June, increasing our total Cana-Woodford position to approximately 280,000 net surface acres with stacked pay potential including about 30,000 net acres of exposure to the stack, oil and condensate window. The new acreage further supplements the thousands of undrilled locations we have in this high quality liquids-rich play. Due to the highly competitive economics at Cana, we plan to accelerate activity in 2015.","If you were to include the non-operated activity of our partner in the play, our total rig count at Cana could be around 10 rigs by the first quarter of 2015. This increased activity puts Cana in a position to deliver strong growth for many years. ","Moving to Slide 25, we have approximately 150,000 net surface acres in the Powder River Basin prospective for multiple formations including the Parkman, Turner and Frontier. To-date, we have identified approximately 1,000 risk locations across our Powder River Basin position with roughly 75% of these locations associated with the Parkman formation.","Our recent drilling activity was highlighted by two wells targeting the Parkman formation in Campbell County, Wyoming. Initial 30 day production at each of these wells averaged 950 Boe per day of which 95% was light oil. ","At an average well cost of only $5 million per well, our Parkman program is generating attractive rates of return. We expect to add a fourth rig later this year and more aggressively develop the Parkman focus area in the second half of 2014 and 2015. ","With that I'll turn the call over to Tom for the financial review and outlook. Tom.","Tom Mitchell","Thank you, Dave and good morning to everyone. To reiterate John and Dave\u2019s comments, the second quarter was one of strong execution. We delivered operationally by successfully exploiting the high margin production opportunities within our portfolio. And we also delivered solid financial results as well. Our strong growth in oil production, combined with improved oil price realizations drove our E&P upstream revenue to 2.7 billion in the second quarter. These factors increased oil sales to more than 60% of our total E&P revenue in the quarter, pushing overall upstream revenue 20% higher than the year ago quarter. ","Not only are our upstream revenues growing rapidly but our midstream profitability is expanding as well. In the second quarter, our midstream business delivered excellent results, generating 224 million of operating profit. This result exceeded the top end of our guidance range and represented a 90% increase compared to the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was driven by the consolidation of EnLink Midstream and improved marketing margins. Based on our outstanding results in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full year forecast for midstream operating profit to a range of 775 million to 825 million, an increase of roughly 80 million from the midpoint of our previous guidance.","Moving to expenses, in the second quarter total pre-tax cash costs were well within our guidance range for the quarter coming in at 1.1 billion. Excluding the cost associated with the consolidation of EnLink, pre-tax cash costs for our upstream business were 7% higher than the second quarter of 2013. Now this amount, a third of the cost increase was attributable to higher operating cost associated with Devon\u2019s rapidly growing high margin oil. The remaining increase was driven by higher production taxes related to our strong revenue growth.","Looking to the second half of the year we expect modest upward pressure on our pre-tax cash cost and this is reflected in our 8-K guidance that will be filed later on today. ","Overall, the benefits of our high margin oil production, improved price realizations in low class structure significantly expanded our pre-tax cash margins. In fact our pre-tax cash margins improved by 40% year-over-year to our highest level in recent history.","Moving to the bottom line, our strong second quarter performance delivered adjusted earnings of $574 million or $1.40 per diluted share, the 16% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This improved profitability also translated into higher cash flows as well and we generated cash flow from operations of $2 billion, a 47% increase compared to the year ago quarter. ","Combined with 2.8 billion of pre-tax proceeds received from the sale of the company\u2019s Canadian conventional gas business in April. Devon\u2019s total cash inflows for the quarter reached 4.8 billion. In late June, we repay created the $2.8 billion sale proceeds from Canada, we utilize these bonds the free cash flow generated down the quarter and cash on hand to reduce debt by 3.2 billion during the quarter.","At June 30, our net debt declined to $10.8 billion of which $1.7 billion was attributable to the consolidation of EnLink Midstream and it\u2019s non-recourse to Devon. If you were to pro forma of the balance sheet for the closing of our U.S. divestitures which should occur in the next few weeks, our net debt excluding EnLink\u2019s debt decreased to around $7.5 billion.","So to put this in better perspective this is only around one time's 2014 expected EBITDA and this positions are go forward Devon with a strong investment grade credit ratings across the board and one of the better balance sheets in the E&P space. ","Moving to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect our go forward asset portfolio continue to demonstrate excellent year-over-year growth in oil production.","With average daily oil rates ranging 200,000 to 210,000 barrels per day, this guidance implies an expected 30 plus percent increase in oil production from our go forward properties compared to the year ago quarter. We expect to achieve this excellent growth in spite of the planned turnaround objectives which will limit production by 5,000 to 10,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.","Overall, we expect our go forward asset portfolio to deliver total production in the range of 603,000 to 627,000 Boe per day and this represents a top line growth from our retained assets of more than 10% compared to third quarter of 2013.","Based on our solid execution during the first six months of this year, we remain very comfortable with our previous full year guidance ranges for production. ","For the full year, we are on track to average more than 600,000 Boe per day from our go forward business driven by full year oil growth rate in excess of 30%. ","And finally, as a reminder we will be filing an 8-K later today containing detailed estimates for the upcoming third quarter and for the full year 2014. ","And will that, I will turn the call back to Vince, for Q&A. Vince?","Vince White ","","Thank you, operator we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","","Thank you, your first question comes from David Hickman with Hickman Energy Advisor. Your line is open.","David Hickman - Hickman Energy Advisor ","","I wanted to look at 5-15 days and just talk about each of the objectives you highlighted to get to the risk factor, can you just give us like what was the number one or the number two objective in the Delaware, Leonard, Bone Spring and other just to get to the 30% to 50% risk factors?","Dave Hager"," ","It was the primary things you have to look at, we looked at everything but you look at the prospectivity of the area based on all the well results you have and then you also apply what we call a drillability factor, can they physically be at locations, physically be accessed with our acreage inventory, those are two primary things we look at and then we also are looking at obviously historical production data to help it out and we all put it into what we call in multi-variant analysis but we remove bias and this is a statistical analysis where we are looking at basically trends in an un-bias manner that correlate with prospectivity. That doesn\u2019t totally substitute for good technical work but it\u2019s an additive to that but those are the main things you are looking at traditional things you are used to David is just good geosciences work, combined with reservoir work and production history.","David Hickman - Hickman Energy Advisor ","","And I guess where I\u2019m going is, as you get more production history in the Leonard and in the Bone Spring sands, do you expect those risk factors to move up with well performance there, how do things trend over time?","Dave Hager"," ","Well, the latest table constructor we hope the risk factors move down actually because the lower is the better, the way we constructed the table. Yes absolutely, as get more data we expect these risk factors to go down. And I think the biggest thing we expect to move up perhaps is this column this risked wells per section, because that\u2019s where we simply don\u2019t have enough data to do this kind of multi-variant analysis, because there hasn\u2019t been a lot of wells that have been drilled, six wells per section or eight wells per section in order to get a good history on.","So in this case we didn\u2019t really do that detailed statistical analysis, we just made -- what we think is a very conservative assumption and as we conduct these pilots which we\u2019re doing right now. We think there is great opportunity that we may increase from the four to five wells per section to more wells per section. But we just want to get some pilot information before we do that.","David Hickman - Hickman Energy Advisor ","And then just thinking about that and leading to the 5,000 the likely grows. What\u2019s the optimal kind of inventory life as you think about the basin relative to the number of wells you drill per year?","Dave Hager"," ","The way we think about it, is we generate as many as we can obviously, then we try to put as many rigs to work as we feel that we can and maintain the quality of our drilling results. So we identify huge new resource inventory, that\u2019s great news. But then we got to think about what can we actually execute and deliver the results with the risk that we perceive in the basins. So I don\u2019t know if there is an optimum. I mean I would love to have 100 years inventory, totally theoretical standpoint.","But what we\u2019re trying to do is increase the pace of our drill commence with our ability to de-risk the area. And we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to be able to get somewhat around 20 rigs next year and we\u2019re thinking higher than that internally but we got to walk before we run and so we\u2019ll see where it goes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","If I could take two questions please. First of all Dave on the Eagle Ford, just to be clear I am assuming you had no inventory in the upper Eagle Ford in your initial analysis when you acquired your southern. And if that is the case, can you give us some ideas based on (obviously) [ph] a number of third party wells that hoped and drilled near for Eagle Ford. From what you know today, what would you say about how -- at what proportion your acreage is perspective? And anything you could say about how that may change the inventory count? And I have a follow up please.","Dave Hager"," ","Well we had none of this and the inventory at the time we did the acquisition we gave zero value to the upper Eagle Ford. So this is all additive from a value standpoint. As you can see from the isopach map that we included in the presentation, we think the bulk of our acreage is perspective for the upper Eagle Ford. The key is that there is an ash zone that develops that we think that will contain the fracs that have been done in the lower Eagle Ford from penetrating up to the upper Eagle Ford.","And when we talk upper Eagle Ford, there are a couple of different upper Eagle Ford intervals, just you guys know there is an upper Eagle Ford shale and there is upper Eagle Ford Marl, we\u2019re really talking about the upper Eagle Ford marl which some might call the lower Austin Chalk, but it\u2019s a Marl zone and it is very mapable. We think the bulk of the acreage is developable for that. How much that adds at this point? Or we think is potentially is developable, we need to get more well results, so before we can quantify too much. And frankly where we\u2019re drilling right now in Lavaca County may or may not be the best part of it. The best maybe in DeWitt County.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow up is I guess is a Cana question but it is also kind of an activity question. 5,000 locations the 10 rigs, obviously I am missing something here. What proportion of those 5,000 locations falls into the category of the enhanced frac that you described obviously yourself. And how does this basically change capital allocation as you move forward in terms of [indiscernible] EBITDA level? I'll leave it there. Thanks. ","John Richels"," ","We may go higher than that, that\u2019s a fair enough point Doug. Now this is a recent development with these improved completion designs that are really enhancing the Cana economics. So we are allocating rigs back out there. we obviously want to see, we\u2019ve been drilling in what we think is some of the best part of the play not all of it is going to necessary quite as good as this but we think it\u2019s still going to be very good.","So we\u2019re going to see where these results are, where they take us. It\u2019s possible that we may continue to ramp the rigs up well beyond the 10 that I mentioned in my previous comments.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thinking more about the overall portfolio Dave in terms of given the spend for the balance sheet. I mean is there -- how do you see acceleration generally across the portfolio, given where your inventory is building on it pretty much every play now.","Dave Hager"," ","John may want to answer this too. But we obviously every year put together a long range plan where we try to balance our ability to execute on the portfolio and maintaining the strong balance sheet. And so this is part of the capital allocation process that we\u2019re going through right now as we speak about where we want to end up on that. I think the good news is we\u2019re in great financial shape after these transactions. John you want to add to that?","John Richels","","And then Doug one thing as Dave said, we are in great shape and we will have to see. We haven\u2019t port our budget for next year, we are still going to be working on that. I think the really important thing is with the transformation that we have undertaken over the last while, we have put ourselves in the position to be able to live within cash flow and still grow at very, very competitive rates whether we choose to do that or not that\u2019s another question. We may well, based on our outlook, based on industry conditions and basin conditions, choose to accelerate that in the future as well. And what\u2019s important is we got the financial capability, in some of the areas or in all of our areas, we want to make sure that we don\u2019t get ahead of the science, we don\u2019t get ahead of the geology, we don\u2019t get ahead of infrastructure, organizational capacity, availability of rigs and service and all of those kinds of things.","So, other items that factor into the pace that we can accelerate at but I will say we are all really excited. We are in a position that we haven\u2019t been in for a while of being able to significantly grow really high margin products and generate high levels of cash flow. So, we feel pretty good about where we are right now.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Wanted to follow-up on the CapEx points you were just discussing. Can you just talk to how you are thinking about CapEx for the remainder of the year and then since you did provide some preliminary oil growth expectations for 2015 within the context of your cash flow and your 2014 budget. How should we preliminarily think about 2015 levels of spending needed to achieve 20% plus oil growth?","","John Richels"," ","Well just for this -- this year, we haven\u2019t changed our guidance for the year, Brian, I think we are on the street at 5 to 5.4 for our E&P capital spending and that\u2019s assuming costs remain the same but we will see how that all sorts out. And we are halfway through the year and we so far spend about 47% of our total CapEx budget for the year, so we are on track for this year. ","When we talk about 20% growth in 2015, growth in our oil production 2015, we've done that based on our expectation for cash flow for next year. So, again as I said earlier whether we -- as we finish developing our budget and take all these other factors that I mentioned when I was replying to Doug, into account, where we actually ended up with a capital budget in 2015 remains to be seen but that 20% number is assuming living within cash flow.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","And then shifting back to the Delaware, the acreage position that you have there in New Mexico and Texas probably puts you in a very good position to comment on the quality of the oil and the impact of condensate. As you continue to drill in various zones and various parts of the play, are you seeing any increased condensate coming out of your wells? Is that impacting your realizations and what are you expecting there going forward?","Darryl Smette"," ","This is Darryl. In Permian Basin, what we have seen pretty consistently is a quality of group between 38 and 42 degrees. The vast majority of that is less than five-tenths of a percent sulfur so it\u2019s classified as sweet crude. There have been individual wells that we have drilled. We have seen the gravity go up as high as 45 to 46% which has not been consistent through all of our wells. There have been some industry players who have also seen gravity that high, depending on the volume from industry that comes out of that 45 to 46 degree gravity. It\u2019s pretty well blended in the other crude out there that\u2019s in the 36 to 40 degree, so we really don\u2019t see at least in the foreseeable future that, we are going to have any condensate problems coming out of the Permian Basin.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Thank you. Dave, I wanted to see if you can elaborate on your plans to increase your rig count in Delaware from 12 to 20 and maybe you can maybe just opinion on where your technical understanding is of the play versus a year or two ago and just your confidence in executing a program of that size?","Dave Hager ","Yes, well, I think our technical understanding has increased pretty significantly as we have appraised across our entire acreage position that has now put us into a position now that we have a pretty good understanding of what the prospectivity is across our entire acreage position. There is always risk when you drill well, so it\u2019s not an absolute but I would say our technical understanding because we have been appraising across the entire acreage position, certainly in the Bone Springs is there now. We still need to drill additional wells and we have a listed inventory in the Wolfcamp and there haven\u2019t been many drill on the New Mexico side and the Wolfcamp, so that\u2019s an area that still takes some additional maturing but there is no question that overall and in some of the other formations such as the Leonard obviously, we haven\u2019t drilled that many wells. We are drilling our first one right now but the industry has. So we\u2019ve got a pretty hand on what\u2019s going on there. ","So, from a technical standpoint most areas are maturing, that is really a little bit less on the technical side is more just getting making sure we have several factors working together to execute and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to get there, the aim should be to make sure that we have a high quality rigs and services are available, we have the gas takeaway capacity, and we have the infrastructure in the field from just a pure manpower standpoint to manage this kind of rig capacity.","And so we\u2019re working through all those issues and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to allows to do 20 rigs sometime next year.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","","Okay, and just my follow up. John, what your longer term thoughts regarding the pipe development and the regulatory approval process on that project?","John Richels ","","We filed the application for 105,000 barrels of project with BP about the end of last year. So, we\u2019ve been going through the process and it\u2019s moving along very well, we have some consultations that are with some groups that aren\u2019t left but it\u2019s moving along really well and it\u2019s our expectations that we\u2019ll get the regulatory approval for that project probably late this year or early in 2015. So, it\u2019s moving along really well and of course we still have as you know we haven\u2019t made the final things I mean decision on that yet but something it will have to do this well but it\u2019s moving along and Pike is, that was an area that always appealing to us because it\u2019s directly adjacent to Jackfish and Jackfish is in what looks to be the sweet spot of the oil sands for SAGD development. So this is a pretty good looking lease. ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","","Quick follow up, given the Delaware Basin opportunity, Cana-Woodford, Rockies oil, how would Pike now compete for capital relative to your U.S. onshore growth potential?","John Richels"," ","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s a project that has very, very different characteristics. So, if you just want to compare strictly on a rate of return basis, it doesn\u2019t compete as well because, you are reporting some capital upfront, you get this long stream of cash flow over a longer period of time. ","So, they're very different projects, the good part of it is, very, very low geological risk, very low engineering risk, you got this flat production profile for 20 or 25 years and an extremely high cash flow stream that comes with that. ","So, it really -- the characteristics of it are quite different and we\u2019ve always thought that having a portfolio that\u2019s has -- that's balanced in some way not only between natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil, we kind of like that balance between light oil and heavy oil too because they trade very differently over time and because they have these different characteristics. So, those are all things that we have to take into consideration in making that decision, it\u2019s kind of balancing the near term versus the longer term aspects of those two kinds of or two different plays.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Subash Chandra with Jefferies, your line is open.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies ","","Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of questions I guess first on Pike again, the access pipeline, is that sized for Pike? Or does it have to go through additional expansion for Pike?","Darryl Smette","","This is Darryl, and yes it is sized for Pike, actually sized for both Jackfish and Pike and it does have the ability with additional pump stations to increase capacity significantly, we currently have about 270,000 barrels a day of capacity on the blended stream and like I said with additional pump capacity we can increase that volume for that pipeline. So, all of those things have been taken into consideration. ","I might just add the access pipeline looping the 42 inch line was completed end of the second quarter early third quarter and we are now in the process of line filling that line so which should be operational towards the end of this year. ","John Richels"," ","So, those volumes that Darryl is saying that\u2019s really much more than we -- I mean that expansion capability with an extra pumping is actually much more than we need for Jackfish and Pike.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies ","","Okay, so it\u2019s in excess of those as well, okay. And then in Cana, the 10 rigs, is that -- are we still 6 to 8 operated and the balance non-op?","Darryl Smette","","The 6 to 8, if we do the 6 to 8 operated we really set around 10 by the first of the year if we do the full 6 to 8 which we as I was explained to Doug Leggate, we may do that and we may do more, that would actually be -- get us above the 10 rigs if we do that given what [indiscernible] is doing. And there is -- financially will do that. We\u2019re just staying by the first year-over-year around 10.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies ","Okay, but combined op, non-op?","Darryl Smette","","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies ","And any commentary just if you can refresh me on the status of the drilling carriers and where you sort of see the intercompany rig movements take place over the next six months?","Darryl Smette","","Well, I will start off with the rig movements. There is not a lot of rig movement going on. We are as we described increasing our activity a little bit already in Cana and so we are dropping down activity a little bit in the mix for that. We will be adding a little bit in the powder as I described but overall not a large movement in rigs in the last half of this year. We will be ramping up as we go into 2015. Now on the carriers, on the Sinopec side, as of June 30th, there was about just over $500 million remaining of the $1.6 billion carry. On Sumitomo side, there is 345 million remaining of a 1.25 billion total drilling carry. Around the end of the year, we think we would be down to the point on the Sinopec side, where we will be about a little over 150 million left and just under 150 million left on the Sumitomo side that we will utilize in 2015.","John Richels"," ","Well folks, I am showing the top of our here but before signing off let me leave you with a few key takeaways from today\u2019s call. First, we have dramatically improved our portfolio in a short period of time. Devon emerges with a formidable portfolio that\u2019s on track to deliver attractive high margin production growth for many years to come. As evidenced by our second quarter results, our pursuit of high margin production is significantly expanding our margins and profitability. ","And finally the commitment to our top strategic objective that you heard us talk about often, which is to optimize long-term growth and debt adjusted cash flow per share has never been stronger.","As we deliver on our growth expectations we are poised to create significant value for our shareholders in the upcoming years. So, we look forward to talking with you again on our next call and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our president and CEO, John Richels.","John Richels","Thank you, Vince, and good morning everyone. Before we get in to the business of the quarter, I\u2019d like to take just a moment here to welcome our latest edition to Devon\u2019s team of senior executives and that\u2019s our chief financial officer, Tom Mitchell. Many of you already know Tom and you know that Tom brings a wealth of industry experience and considerable financial sophistication and we\u2019re thrilled to have him on board. As Vince already mentioned, you\u2019re going to hear from Tom later on in the call and as you have the opportunity in the coming months to meet with him, please join us in welcoming Tom to Devon. So with that, let\u2019s take a look at our results.","The first quarter was another excellent one for Devon. As shown on slide three, our disciplined focus on high-margin oil development opportunities led to another quarter of outstanding growth in oil production that drove significant operating margin improvements. Additionally, we made meaningful progress in our efforts to high grade our go-forward asset portfolio. This progress was evidenced by the closing of our Eagle Ford acquisition, the completion of the EnLink Midstream combination, our exit from the conventional gas business in Canada, and our recently announced bolt-on [ph] acreage acquisition in Cana.","In addition, we once again raised our dividend during the quarter. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some of the highlights in more detail. In the first quarter, we achieved year-over-year oil product growth of 21% from go-forward asset base reaching an average daily rate of 176,000 barrels per day. As can be seen on slide four, this growth was driven entirely by light sweet crude production from our retained US assets which increased an impressive 56% compared to the first quarter of 2013. With our success in growing high-margin production, we expect oil and natural gas liquids to approach nearly 60% of Devon\u2019s go-forward production mix by year end.","In addition to our robust growth in high-margin oil production, we benefited from the sharp rise in natural gas pricing and improved Canadian heavy oil realizations. This increased first quarter upstream revenue by 42% compared to the first quarter of 2013.","As shown on side five, 67% of our upstream revenue came from liquids. Higher revenues coupled with our low cost structure drove operating margins by more than 50% year over year. Another notable first quarter financial highlight was a 9% increase in Devon\u2019s quarterly cash dividend to $0.24 per share. This is Devon\u2019s 9th dividend increase since 2004 representing an annual compound growth rate of 23%. Our dividend increase reflects Devon\u2019s long-term commitment to returning cash to our shareholders and ultimately underscores the confidence we have in our business.","Looking beyond our operating and financial results for the quarter, we did an outstanding job in the past few months in executing our portfolio transformation which is now nearly complete. The first major milestone occurred on February 28th with the closing of our Eagle Ford acquisition. This acquisition of 82,000 net acres in the economic heart of the play adds a new light oil core area to Devon\u2019s portfolio, offering some of the highest rate of return drilling opportunities in North America.","While we\u2019ve only owned this position for a short time, the reservoir performance that we\u2019ve seen to date has been outstanding, fully supporting our production growth targets and double digit accretion in cash flow per debt adjusted share.","One week later, on March 7th, we closed on our Midstream combination with Crosstex to form EnLink Midstream. EnLink units are now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbols ENLC for the general partner and ENLK for the MLP. And while the assets we contributed were valued in the transaction at about $4.8 billion, the ownership interest in the EnLink securities that we received had a market value at yesterday\u2019s close of more than $7.5 billion or approximately 27% of our current market capitalization.","This valuable ownership was attained by contributing most of Devon\u2019s US Midstream assets to EnLink. The contributed assets accounted for only 7% of Devon\u2019s cash flow last year. Furthermore, the loss of this direct Midstream cash flow was offset by our receded [ph] quarterly distribution payments from EnLink and EnLink\u2019s assumption of the associated capital obligations. Looking beyond these immediate benefits, we\u2019re also excited about the attractive long-term growth prospect associated with this business. The stable fixed fee structure, the deep backlog of liquids oriented projects and the future drop down potential from both Devon and from the general partner provide a foundation for EnLink to deliver attractive distribution growth for many years.","We took another significant step forward in our transformation in early April by closing the sale of our Canadian conventional business for CAD3.125 billion. This was the largest divestiture package in our non-core asset sale process and we attractively monetize these gas-weighted assets at nearly seven times EBITDA which is a substantial premium to Devon\u2019s current trading multiple.","After adjusting for currency exchange and taxes associated with both the sale and the repatriation of the funds to the US, we\u2019re receiving net proceeds of US$2.7 billion. For our remaining divestiture assets which are all located in the US, we\u2019re putting the final touches on the data rooms with the expectation to complete the sale of all non-core assets by year-end.","Most recently, we opportunistically added to our core Cana-Woodford position by acquiring an additional 50,000 net acres and 5,800 equivalent barrels per day of production. These assets directly overlap our existing core Cana position and expand our opportunity set with exposure to other Western Oklahoma oil and gas plays.","This move is consistent with our philosophy of building scale and scope in our core play areas. Later on the call, Dave will discuss some recent positive developments to Cana that led to our decision to acquire the additional interest.","The bold steps we\u2019ve recently taken to high grade our asset base have positioned Devon with a formidable and balanced portfolio focused on fewer core areas in some of the most attractive basins in North America. Our retained asset base consists of three world class oil development plays in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford, and Canadian Oil Sands. And two of the best liquids rich gas there is in the U.S., the Barnett Shale and the Anadarko Basin.","Each of these core areas has the inventory to materially grow production and sufficient scale to generate substantial amounts of cash flow. Our capital budget for these retained properties in 2014 is around $5 billion concentrated in our three high margin oil development plays.","Looking at slide six, company-wide oil production is expected to grow by more than 30% year over year led by a 70% plus increase in U.S. oil production. This should drive grow of about 10% in top line production on an energy equivalent basis or 20% higher on a 20-1 price equivalency basis. As evidenced by our solid first quarter performance, we are well on our way to achieving these attractive growth targets.","In addition to the growth we\u2019re delivering in 2014, Devon is also positioned for significant high margin oil growth in 2015 and beyond. That\u2019s illustrated on slide seven, where you can see that we expect Devon\u2019s retained asset base to generate organic oil production growth in excess of 20% in 2015. Let\u2019s take a look at the specific drivers of this oil growth. Our most significant growth next year will come from low risk, infill drilling in the Eagle Ford where we expect production to average well over a 100,000 BOEs per day.","In addition to this exceptional volume growth trajectory, this highly profitable production will also deliver a powerful free cash flow stream that should exceed $1 billion based on the current prices. So, just to be clear, that\u2019s free cash flow is cash flow in excess over capital investment.","Another driver growth in 2015 will be the acceleration of drilling activity in the Delaware Basin specifically in South-East New Mexico. Over the next year, we will accelerate development of our rapidly growing resource potential in that area. And Dave is going to provide more details on our significantly expanding inventory and significantly growing resource potential in this prolific basin later on in the call.","And lastly in Canada, the start up of our Jackfish 3 facility later this year will commence another leg of multi-year oil production growth from our thermal oil business. In 2015, we expect net oil production from our Jackfish complex to increase to a range of between 62,000 and 67,000 barrels per day, representing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 30%. Furthermore, the completion of Jackfish 3 will lower Devon\u2019s overall capital intensity and begin an era of free cash flow from our Jackfish complex with the potential to generate up to $1 billion annually for many years.","As you can see on slide eight, this wall of cash provides a significant source of capital for E&P investment, debt reduction, dividends, and share repurchases.","So, in summary, I\u2019ve never been more excited about Devon\u2019s future than today. As outlined on slide nine, Devon has established itself as one of the largest oil producers among our North American onshore peers. When you combine the growth potential of our top tier oil development projects with our high quality natural gas optionality, we are a well positioned for extremely competitive growth rates for years to come.","What makes our growth story even more compelling is Devon\u2019s attractive valuation. Backing out the value of the EnLink securities from our enterprise value and EBITDA reveals that our E&P business is trading at just over four times EBITDA. As we continue to execute on our growth plan, Devon shares\u2019 have the potential to benefit not only from improving margins and higher cash flow, but also through multiple expansion.","So, with that, I will turn the call over the Dave Hager for a more detailed operations review, Dave?","Dave Hager","Thanks, John. Good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin with a quick recap of our first quarter capital expenditures. Exploration development capital for the first quarter totaled $1.2 billion, just below the bottom end of our previous guidance range. Based on our planned activity levels to the remaining three quarters of 2014, we remain on track with full year drilling and completions capital guidance range of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion for our go-forwards assets.","As John indicated earlier, our focus on high margin oil projects led to another quarter of outstanding growth in oil production. Let\u2019s take a closer at some of the first quarter operating highlights, beginning with the Permian; first quarter production averaged a record 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This record was driven by robust growth in oil production, which increased 36% compared to the first quarter of 2013 and with 9% higher than the previous quarter. Light oil production continues to account for 60% of our total Permian production.","In the Delaware Basin our Bone Spring horizontal program is the most significant driver of our Permian oil growth. In the first quarter, we bought 35 Bone Springs wells online with an average 30 day IP raise approaching 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 80% was light oil.","Also in the Delaware Basin, we commenced production on two high rate oil wells targeting the Delaware Sands and Lee [ph] New Mexico. Initial 30 day production from these two wells averaged in excess of 1,000 BOE per day and consisted of nearly 90% light oil.","The tremendous results we continue to see from our Delaware Basin drilling programs coupled with our ongoing reservoir characterization work has allowed us to substantially increase our risk inventory in the Delaware Basin.","To help you more fully appreciate the scale and scope of our potential new Delaware Basin, I want to turn your attention to slide 10, which illustrates our acreage position by prospect [ph] deformation. As you can see the stack pay [ph] nature of our position and the Delaware Basin provides us with exposure not only as a Bone Spring and Delaware Sands, but also the Leonard Shale, Wolfcamp and several other oil zones. If you add up this lease hold buy [ph] formation you can see we have approximately 500,000 net acres to appraise and develop.","Turning to slide 11, you can see this translates into a significant inventory of undrilled locations for Devon. Our largest and most economic opportunity is in the Bone Spring, we recently completed our comprehensive reservoir evaluation on a large portion of our Bone Spring acreage position.","This work combined with strong well performance and successful appraisal drilling in several step-out areas has allowed us to add some 1,900 additional locations to our Bone Spring inventory. This booze [ph] an undrilled Bones Spring inventory to 3,500 locations, adding locations in the Delaware Sands, Leonard Shale and several other formation brings our total risk inventory at the Delaware Basin for more than 5,000 undrilled locations.","To put this on prospective at our current activity levels, this represents more than 25 years of drilling inventory in the Delaware Basin. Keep in mind these are rest [ph] locations and do not include any location to our Wolfcamp acreage which we are currently evaluating. We fully expect additional inventory increases over time as Devon and the industry continue to de-risk this world class oil basin.","With this significant inventory in the Delaware Basin as I can provide some thoughts on how we will approach converting this resource into production and cash flow. Today, we are running 12 rigs in the Delaware Basin, the appropriate level of activity given the availability in South-East New Mexico of gas gathering and processing capacity, high quality rigs, completion services and manpower. Our program in 2014 is focused almost entirely on our high rate of return and low risk Bone Spring development opportunities.","Over the next year, we expect additional capacity build out within this portion of the Permian to support additional activity to further exploit our rapidly growing resource inventory in the region. While we are not ready to provide specific plans, our preliminary view on 2015 is that we will have the opportunity to significantly increase our drilling activity next year.","This will allow us to continue aggressively developing our highly profitable Bone Spring and accelerate the development and appraisal of our Delaware Sands, Leonard Shale and Wolfcamp well inventories. Given our outlook for significant cash flow growth next year, we clearly have the means to fund a more robust level of activity.","As John highlighted in his opening remarks, the acceleration of drilling activity in the Delaware Basin is a visible source of future light oil production in 2015 and will remain a cornerstone asset for Devon for many years to come.","Shifting to the Southern Midland Basin, we will continue to see solid results from our oil development program, the Wolfcamp Shale, where we have a joint venture partnership with Sumitomo. During the first quarter, we tied in 26 Wolfcamp Shale wells, increasing our average net production in the play to an average of 10,000 BOE per day. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, this represents production growth of 8,000 BOE per day.","Moving to the Eagle Ford, as John mentioned, we completed our acquisition of 82,000 net acres in Eagle Ford on February 28 and resulted in one month of production in our first quarter reported results. Although we have only owned these assets for a couple of months now, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the quality and with our joint venture relationship with BHP in DeWitt County. The well and reservoir performance that we have seen today reinforces our previous forecast for average net daily production of 70,000 to 80,000 BOE per day for the 10 months we will own this asset this year.","We are also on track to deliver well an excess of 100,000 BOE per day in 2015. As many of you are aware through recent BHP disclosures, March production on our DeWitt County acres was temporarily constrained by third party gathering system downtime and the timing of well tie-ins.","In Eagle Ford, the production growth profile for most operators is somewhat lumpy due to nature or pad drilling and the Devon BHP partnership is no exception. With wells being bought on in groups as many as 20 at a time and the time in bringing on necessary infrastructure to tie into wells, the production growth would tend to come in step changes.","For March, our first month of ownership, our net Eagle Ford production averaged 49,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, as shown on Slide 12, an increase in well tie-ins at the end of March and in April had driven our net daily production up to 64,000 BOE per day currently. We expect to average between 65,000 and 70,000 BOE per day for the second quarter. And for the second half of the year, we expect our Eagle Ford production to increase to a range of 80,000 BOE to 85,000 BOE per day.","Our growth in the Eagle Ford in the second half of this year has been driven by a large number of well tie-ins during that period. Our Eagle Ford drilling program remains on plan and at quarter end, we had an inventory of about 120 wells drilled but not yet producing.","In the second half of the year, we expect this inventory to trim downward as we catch up on pad tie-ins and necessary transportation system permits [ph] are completed in DeWitt County. As I mentioned earlier, for the 10 months we will own the asset in 2014, we are on track to achieve our previously announced guidance of an average of 70,000 to 80,000 barrels per day. In addition to world-class oil development in DeWitt County, we are excited about the emerging opportunities we see ahead of us on our 32,000 net acres in Lavaca County.","As you can see on Slide 13, recently announced well results in \u2013 by industry in this area represented in blue have included initial oil production rates of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day. These results have far exceeded our expectations for the area. And with less than 10% of the acquisition value assigned to our 32,000 net acres, we are extremely encouraged with the upside potential on this acreage. We expect to bring our first Lavaca County wells online in the second quarter, and as previously disclosed, expect to participate in roughly 30 gross wells for the full year.","And lastly, I want to briefly mention another potential upside we have identified across our entire position in the Eagle Ford. We have mapped our acreage position in Lavaca and DeWitt County and believe that most of our acreage is respectfully [ph] for the upper Eagle Ford formation. Our belief is supported by recently industry results as noted in green on slide 13. We are evaluating these results and the timing of our first operated well to test the upper Eagle Ford.","Moving now to our thermal oil projects in Northeast Alberta on slide 14; first quarter gross production from our two Jackfish projects averaged roughly 62,000 barrels of oil per day or roughly 52,000 barrels per day after royalties. At Jackfish 1, gross production averaged 37 barrels per \u2013 37,000 barrels per day or 29,000 barrels per day net of royalties. The success of our ongoing efforts to improve steam efficiency and well productivity allowed us to exceed the facility\u2019s nameplate capacity of 35,000 barrels a day during the quarter.","Recently, we have seen excellent results from efficiency modifications to our steam generators, lowering steam chamber pressures, optimizing the temperature profile in the steam chamber and conducting well stimulations. Continued success from these and other efforts underway to lower our steam oil ratio could result in continued growth and production above nameplate capacity.","Construction of Jackfish 3 is essentially complete and plant commission activities are well underway. We expect to begin injecting steam in the third quarter of this year. Delivery of first oil is scheduled to occur late this year with production ramping up throughout 2015.","At Pike, our thermal oil sands joint venture with BP, the approval process for the first stage of the Pike development remains on track. And we expect to receive regulatory approval later this year. As a reminder, the Pike 1 development project will have ultimate gross production capacity of 105,000 barrels of oil per day. Devon operates Pike with a 50% working interest.","Shifting now to the Anadarko Basin in Western Oklahoma, our liquid rich Cana-Woodford Shale play average a record 60,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. As John mentioned, our recently announced transaction in the Cana-Woodford allows to increase our scale and scope in one of our core liquid rich gas plays and in a cost of less than $2 per BOE for the roughly 150 million barrels of rich [ph] resource. The additional 50,000 net acres increases our core Cana position to approximately 300,000 net acres.","We were particularly excited to acquire this acreage after seeing some positive results from our recent technical work in the area. With the asset teams focused on managing base production, we discovered through reservoir engineering including pressure transient analysis, that we had enhancement opportunities on many of our core area producing wells. We have now performed these enhancements on about 70 producing wells and the results have been outstanding. In most cases, this inexpensive treatment took production per well from around 1 million cubic feet equivalent per day up to 3 million a day or more.","We believe these efforts should increase EURs by about a Bcf per well with a payback period of less than three months. We have indentified more than 200 additional wells that can be treated in the core area including wells on our new acreage.","In addition to this technical work, we continue to make improvements to our completion design. With our most recent wells, we have doubled the number of frac stages and increased the amount of propane [ph] pumped to about 6 million pounds per well, a 70% increase over our previous jobs. The results from these completion improvements, as well as our downhole work on the existing producers, had been outstanding. Production performers from these wells are exceeding our type curve model and significantly enhancing our rate of return. These stronger returns have improved the competitiveness of our Cana drilling within our portfolio, which ultimately led us to take advantage of the opportunity to acquire additional acreage.","We\u2019re evaluating the impact of the acquisition and the recent technical advancements at Cana on our capital allocation plan and we\u2019ll discuss any modification during next quarter\u2019s call.","Looking at our Mississippian-Woodford trend in North Central Oklahoma, we brought 63 operated wells online during the quarter within the Sinopec joint venture area with overall results supporting our type curve expectations.","Solid performance from these wells help drive our average first quarter production in the trend to 19,000 BOE per day of which 50% was light oil. This represents a production growth rate of 35% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.","The focus of our activity this year is on the JV area where we have the benefit of a carry and are seeing the most consistent results.","And finally, our Rockies assets continue to deliver excellent results with net production averaging 20,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. Liquids production in the Rockies increased 21% compared to the first quarter of last year and account for nearly half of Devon\u2019s product mix in the region.","Our activity was highlighted by two high-rate oil wells brought online during the quarter, an Iberlin Ranch well targeting the Frontier formation that\u2019s tied in with initial 30-day production rates averaging 2,000 BOE per day including more than 1,700 barrels of oil per day.","We also commenced production on a well targeting the Parkman formation with 30-day production rate and averaging an excess of 1,100 BOE per day of which 96% was light oil.","Devon has 150,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin prospective for multiple formations including the Parkman, Turner and Frontier. The company has identified approximately 1,000 risked locations across the Powder River Basin and expects its drilling inventory to increase as the company de-risks this oil opportunity.","So in summary, we had another strong quarter of execution across our entire North American onshore portfolio. The core focus areas that I discussed today on the call are delivering highly economic and robust production growth for Devon. And with our drilling inventory of opportunities, we\u2019re poised to deliver impressive oil growth in 2014 and beyond.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom for the financial review and outlook. Tom.","Tom Mitchell","Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. Today, I\u2019ll take you through a brief review of our financial and operating results in the first quarter and where called for provide a state of guidance.","Before I get started, I wanted to remind everyone of the changes in our first quarter financial reporting resulting from the EnLink transaction.","Now that Devon is the majority owner in EnLink, accounting rules require that 100% of EnLink\u2019s revenues, expenses, debt and capital are consolidated within our financial statements.","The minority ownership interest from the portion that we do not own will be netted and deducted on a line item in the financials entitled non-controlling interests.","Due to these accounting changes, the comparability of first quarter results to prior quarters from a trend analysis perspective is challenging. However, in our earnings release and in our upcoming SEC filings, we\u2019re providing supplemental schedules that will break out the results of our upstream business on that of EnLink.","Since John covered the first quarter production highlights earlier in the call, I will begin with a quick review of our outlook of production. In the second quarter, we expect our go-forward asset portfolio to deliver total production of 609,000 to 631,000 BOE per day. This represents top line growth from our retained assets of approximately 15% compared to the second quarter of 2013.","Most importantly, this expected increase on production is underpinned by a strong, high-margin oil growth. For our go-forward properties, we are forecasting oil production in the second quarter to increase by roughly 30% year-over-year to a range of between 200,000 and 210,000 barrels per day.","This excellent growth in the high-margin oil production is driven by a full quarter of Eagle Ford production and continued success in our Permian development programs.","For the full year, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance range and on track to produce between 579,000 and 622,000 BOE per day from our go-forward business, driven by a full year growth rate in excess of 30%.","Moving to our upstream revenue, in the first quarter, improved priced realizations for all products combined with higher oil production drove our E&P upstream revenue to $2.6 billion. This represents an increase in oil, gas, and NGL sales of 42% compared to the year-ago quarter.","The most notable improvements in regional pricing were attributable to our Canadian heavy oil production, strong gas realizations from our retained U.S. portfolio and a meaningful price uptick in mid-continent NGLs.","In the first quarter, oil sales alone excluding NGLs accounted for more than 50% of our E&T revenue.","Turning now to our midstream business, once again, our midstream business delivered excellent results generating $183 million of operating profits in the first quarter, a 47% increase compared to the first quarter of last year and about 27% above the high end of our guidance range.","Improved price realization and effective cost management were the key drivers behind our first quarter outperformance.","Our first quarter results did include 25 days of contribution from EnLink which amounted to $50 million of operating profits. Based on our strong start to the year, we\u2019re confident of our full year forecast for midstream operating profit of $685 to $755 million.","Moving to expenses overall, our first quarter pre-tax expenses were generally in line with our expectations totaling $1.8 billion. Excluding the cost associated with the consolidation of EnLink, pre-tax expenses were 8% higher than the first quarter of 2013.","The increase in unit cost is attributable to higher production task and operating expenses associated with the company\u2019s rapidly growing high-margin oil production.","In addition, $22 million of non-recurring G&A transaction expenses associated with EnLink, Energy or Southern transactions and a change in our timing of our annual stock-based compensation grant resulted in an increase in the first quarter G&A.","This stock-based equity grants were previously made in the fourth quarter of each year. However, to better raise stock-based compensation to the year\u2019s performance, the 2013 grant was delayed to the first quarter of \u201814 resulting in no grant during the calendar year of 2013.","In the upcoming quarter, we expect improvements in our unit cash cost looking specifically at our largest cash cost, least operating expense, we expect second quarter LOE to decline by about 5% sequentially to a range of $9 to $9.25 per BOE.","This expected improvement in unit LOE cost is driven by our first full quarter of production from our low cost Eagle Ford assets and our high cost Canadian conventional business that took effect at the beginning of April.","For those of you modeling Devon, it\u2019s important to incorporate the change in our go-forward DD&A rates. In the second quarter, we expect DD&A expense to increase to a range of $13 to $14 per BOE.","This increase in DD&A which of course is a non-cash expense is primarily attributable to a full quarter of depletion expense associated with our newly acquired Eagle Ford properties and the consolidation of EnLink. For the full year, our DD&A forecast remains unchanged at $12.5 to $14.5 per BOE.","Cutting to the bottom line, our non-GAAP earnings increased to $547 million or $1.34 per share. This is more than double our earnings per share in the year-ago quarter and comfortably exceeded the Wall Street consensus expectations.","This improved profitability translated into higher cash flows with first quarter operating cash flow totaling $1.4 billion, a 41% year-over-year.","Before we open the call to Q&A, I\u2019ll conclude my remarks with a quick review of our balance sheet and liquidity. At the end of the first quarter, our financial position remains strong reflecting an investment grade credit ratings across the board.","With cash balances at $2 billion, we exited the quarter with a net debt balance of $13.5 billion. Of this amount, $1.5 billion of net debt is attributable to EnLink and is non-recourse to Devon.","If you include the proceeds from the closing of our Canadian conventional divestiture package in early April, our net debt decreased to about $11 billion or just over $9 billion if you exclude EnLink\u2019s net debt.","Looking ahead, any proceeds from our U.S. divestiture process will be utilized to reduce debt further strengthening our high quality balance sheet. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vince for Q&A. Vince.","Vince White","Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning, gentlemen. It seems like the strong of the quarter was the Delaware Basin inventory update. So I just wanted to know if you can maybe elaborate a little bit on what drove the increase in the inventory.","I believe your type curve was around 500 Mbo. Any thoughts on overall well performance? And I know you\u2019re not ready to talk about the program next year. But could we see a pretty significant increase in activity? And how many rigs you\u2019re running today in the Delaware?","Dave Hager","Hi Arun, this is Dave. I\u2019ll take a stab at that. We\u2019re currently running 12 rigs in the Delaware. And yes, as we said, we do anticipate a significant increase next year as we work our way through all the limitations that currently exists out there \u2013 the availability of cash processing capacity, availability of rigs, completion crews, manpower, et cetera. And we\u2019re working through all of those factors as we speak.","Yes, this was a big story for us. And there are really two key things that factored into this, one is we have continued to appraise our acreage position throughout the Delaware Basin particularly in Lea and Eddy County.","And so as we\u2019re getting those results, it\u2019s given us greater confidence to up our risk inventory. And obviously the results from those wells have been outstanding throughout our acreage position.","And second, frankly, we\u2019ve just taken the time to look at it in a more comprehensive manner than we\u2019ve been able to do previously. And then we looked at it more comprehensively coupled with the outstanding well results across our entire acreage position. We suspected it was there, but we were basically able to move into our risk inventory.","And so we feel very good. And I would point that the slide that we included there, Slide 11, did not include anything for the Wolfcamp. And the Wolfcamp we think has tremendous prospectivity in Southeastern Mexico. There\u2019s just not a lot of wells have been drilled there yet.","So we think as there\u2019s additional wells drilled in that area that that inventory is going to increase also.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. My question is on the Eagle Ford. It sounded like you\u2019re well on track in terms of \u201814 despite the lower March. But as we think about the \u201815 program, a lot of confidence here around production north of or in excess of 100,000 barrels a day. Can you just talk about the confidence in the ramp and what\u2019s given you that confidence? Is there early well results or what?","Dave Hager","Yes, I\u2019ll take a stab at that again, Arun. Absolutely, the well results have been 100% consistent with our acquisition expectations. These are outstanding wells. These are wells in the core of the core of the Eagle Ford. And so that gives us tremendous confidence, our infrastructure needs, our continuing to be build out. Frankly we think that already in the first couple of months that we\u2019ve owned the asset, that grains [ph] have improved efficiency to the overall process and all of that put together gives us tremendous that we\u2019re going to have the ramp that we talked about.","John Richels","And Arun, it\u2019s John. One thing I\u2019d just toss in here to what David has already said, you\u2019ll recall that when we did that acquisition, we indicated that GeoSouthern and BHP prior to the acquisition had drilled at least one well on every drilling unit across the DeWitt County acreage.","So this confidence that Dave is talking about at Wall Street by the fact that we\u2019ve got pretty darn good idea about what every drilling unit on that acreage looks like.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s great. Then just final question, as we think about heavy oil for the balance of the year, just thoughts on how you see that market playing out. And I know in \u201815, one of the potential headwinds exists on the Alberta Clipper, which hasn\u2019t been approved yet by the State\u2019s requirement. Any thoughts on \u201815 heavy oil differentials and is there enough rail maybe to soften the blow of the Alberta Clipper?","Darryl Smette","Yes, this is Darryl. You\u2019re exactly on point. We do expect that we\u2019re going to see increased takeaway capacity with the Flanagan South pipeline. That\u2019s due to come on mid-2014 probably later part of July is the date that we\u2019re getting out to Enbridge. That\u2019s a 585,000 barrel a day pipeline. We have a couple of permits that we have to get from the BOM, but anticipate that that will come on stream. That will bring additional capacity from Chicago down to the Cushing hub and then onto the gulf coast.","The Alberta Clipper is the line that runs from Hardisty in Alberta down to the neck points in the mid-continent. That would add about 800,000 barrels a day of capacity. That is generally requiring only additional pump stations or more horse power, not additional line looping.","We\u2019re awaiting on or they\u2019re awaiting \u2013 Enbridge is waiting on the government to issue those permits. The latest indication, we have from them is that they will expect those permits later on this year and so that capacity should be operational sometime in 2015.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot.","Vince White","Darryl, could you just bring that all together and summarize \u2013 I mean you have a lot of detailed knowledge there clearly, but summarize what this means for differentials.","Darryl Smette","Well, in terms of differentials, they\u2019ve been fairly volatile. And supply and demand have been fairly balanced over the last couple of years. And we have seen that volatility ranging anywhere from $20 up to as high as $40.5. With that additional capacity coming on stream including some additional capacity, some of the refineries, we think those differentials will have downward pressure.","So while they\u2019ll still remain volatile, we think that they\u2019ll be on that $20 to $25 barrel range and maybe $26 barrel range consistently rather than the volatility that we\u2019ve seen from $20 up to $40 or $45.","Vince White","Thank you.","Darryl Smette","And no, Vince, I might also add just as an addition there, is that we do have as an industry as lot of rail capacity now. Two years ago, as an industry, we had about 125,000 barrels or rail capacity out of Canada to United States. By the end of this year, that will be close to 650,000 barrels a day.","So not only are we hopeful with the pipelines coming on stream, but there is also the additional rail capacity that makes us feel very good about where differentials are going.","Vince White","Great. Operator, I want to remind everybody to limit their questions to one initial inquiring and one follow up. And we\u2019re ready for the next participant.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I appreciate you getting me engaged. I\u2019ll try to do a quick one hopefully. So I\u2019m trying to understand how we should interpret the balance sheet comment because you\u2019ve obviously got substantial inventory potential in the Delaware, but also the Eagle Ford inventory is going up and now you\u2019ve got the Rockies and \u2013 I guess the Cana is audited [ph] as well. Should we think of you spending your cash like old Devon or should we think about you starting to use your balance sheet to accelerate the overall pace.","I know you\u2019re not ready to give details specifically yet, but just high level how should we think about activity roles?","Vince White","This is Vince, Doug. My first observation is while we have this growing resource inventory, we also have a lot of growth in cash flow. So when you look at 2015 with the free cash flow thrown off by the Eagle Ford over and above the capital requirements and by our thermal projects, we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity to invest in this expanding inventory.","Dave Hager","And Doug, we\u2019re in a position now \u2013 the reason we\u2019re so excited about where we are as a company frankly, we\u2019re in a position now where we think we can grow our oil productions which is obviously our highest margin product by 20% of more for a considerable period of time while living within cash flow. And with a $9 billion debt level, we\u2019re probably at a fairly appropriate place for us to be.","And we haven\u2019t been in the position in the past few years of being able to grow that kind of production which \u2013 and the important part of it is of course is that we\u2019re also commensurately growing our cash flow per share without ramping up debt or summoning [ph] bunch of equity out the door. And that\u2019s pretty exciting position for us to be in. And that kind of growth rate for company our size I think stacks up pretty well.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, a big change from six months ago for sure [ph]. My follow up real quick is ownership in the GP, just a big picture of comments there in terms of \u2013 70%, it just seems there\u2019s no need to really have that big of a position. I\u2019m just curious as how you\u2019re thinking about that and all these matters [ph]. Thank you.","Dave Hager","Yes, that\u2019s turned out really well for us. As you know, as we said, we put those assets in at about $4.8 billion worth [indiscernible] today. So there\u2019s been a huge amount of accretion and it\u2019s a strategic asset for us. We\u2019ve always wanted to keep control of those assets or have some influence over those assets because they\u2019re so integral to our operations.","And we think there\u2019s going to be a lot of value accretion at the EnLink level over the next few years not only from a bunch of really exciting ideas that are \u2013 the management team at EnLink has but also through the continuation of the dropdowns from the general partner and also from Devon. And you\u2019ll recall we\u2019ve given a right of first offer to EnLink to purchase the expanded access pipeline in Canada when it\u2019s complete. So we\u2019re going to see a lot of growth.","Now having said that, you\u2019re absolutely right that they\u2019re \u2013 we got a larger position today than we ultimately need to control. But that\u2019s not lost [ph] on us. We always look at ways to realize that. But frankly, we got to do something that is creative and innovative, Doug, because just selling a bunch of units and paying a lot of tax isn\u2019t the way to do it.","So we\u2019re really actually excited about that position and the continued growth, but we\u2019ll always keep our eye on that.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answers. Thank you.","Vince White","Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Great. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning. You touched on Canadian oil realizations earlier but I wanted to ask on U.S. oil realizations which looks like they widened out a bit. I assume some of that is adding condensate in Eagle Ford but I wanted to see how you think your differentials will fall out as we go forward both on the condensate front of Eagle Ford and then if you expect any bottlenecks in the Permian both from a midstream ability to get oil out and then also if there are any changes in your gravity in related realizations of the Delaware Basin.","Darryl Smette","Yeah, this is Darryl again. Let\u2019s first take the Permian. We have seen differentials widen there since the end of last year into the first quarter where differentials both for West Texas sour and West Texas sweet were about $3.50. Fourth \u2013 or the second quarter this year looks like that\u2019s going to be closer to $8 as driven by a couple of facts. We\u2019ve just been increased production out of the Permian Basin, plus there were some refinery maintenance that extended longer than was anticipated, about three weeks. That\u2019s caused a bottleneck and a buildup of supply.","All of that should be relieved by the end of this quarter as we have another 350,000 barrels a day of pipeline capacity coming on stream \u2013 50,000 is an expansion of the longhorn system that was put in place last year; 300,000 of that is BridgeTex. So when you add all of that capacity, that gives you about 5.6 million barrels of export capacity. There\u2019s about 400 million, I guess, of refining and production out there that\u2019s around 1.5 million. So right now, we think the differentials while they\u2019re $8, that\u2019s going to narrow somewhat less than 250 as we go through the rest of the year. So we feel pretty good about that.","As we look at differentials in the Eagle Ford, our average gravity in Eagle Ford is about 52 degrees. First month that we had that asset, our net differential of WTI was about $7. We expect that to continue to be volatile as more of that type of crude is produced. But we think that\u2019s going to be volatile in a range of about $6 to $12 of WTI. That should work itself up. We think based on the projects that are ongoing in terms of splitters that will allow some of that lighter end product to be split out. In the next board, we think that differential will narrow down to the $6 to $8 range as we go forward.","All of these are things that we have anticipated when we made the acquisition. Our view still hasn\u2019t changed.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just thinking in the 2015, your comments on increasing activity again particularly on the Permian Basin, what are you doing to mitigate the cost inflation and what level of cost increases are you expecting or able to withstand when you think about that in CapEx and activity levels?","Darryl Smette","Well, the economics on these plays are pretty robust. So although the plays could handle higher CapEx, we do a lot of work to avoid that situation obviously. And we have just actually finished for this year and just recently our rebidding [ph] of all our stimulation work for the year were able \u2013 we have very good relationships with the key vendors, have had them over multiple years.","We were able to avoid any significant price increases. That\u2019s going to be basically flat in 2014 versus 2013. And we anticipate that these type of relationships are going to help us significantly in the future. I can\u2019t predict exactly what 2015 is going to look like but when you think of 2014, it\u2019s already had rapidly increasing activity in the Permian. But there is at the same time a lot of additional capacity coming into the Permian. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a significant issue there.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you.","Darryl Smette","Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Yeah, hi. I just want to confirm that Eagle Ford guidance did not include Lavaca County.","Darryl Smette","It does include Lavaca County. That includes our entire Eagle Ford position, the 17,000, 18,000 which is what we originally got into also.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Right, okay. Got it, okay. And the second one on the Permian and Bone Springs and it looks like it\u2019ll be a Bone Spring heavy program. What sort of initiatives are there or potential for more water recycling out in the Delaware and what are sort of the technical challenges of doing that, if any?","John Richels","Yeah, probably one of the biggest challenges that we have is \u2013 and you can get an idea from the map that we included in there, but our acreage is spread out throughout DeWitt and Eddy County. So to the degree that we have contiguous position that has sufficient scale, that allows us to get into where water recycling can work more efficiently. And we\u2019re working through that right now.","We\u2019re already doing that in the South Midland Basin as we speak and we\u2019re looking for opportunities to expand that into the Delaware Basin.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies & Company","And just along those lines, some of these other horizons, Leonard, et cetera, are they dryer than the Bone Springs \u2013","Darryl Smette","Well, we have included in our account essentially the oil areas of each of these because these are the ones that we think are economic. So I know these are \u2013 with Leonard, I think some of the industry competition has been talking about wells or drilling in the Leonard and we\u2019re right in and amongst those wells. But frankly, we have as good, if not, better acres positioned. Some of the other people are talking about it.","So we feel very good and actually, the Wolfcamp extends further to the west than we have outlined on the map but we\u2019ve just really highlighted what we think is the oily portion of the Wolfcamp on that map. So, no, these are essentially \u2013 these are really oil opportunities that have strong economics right now.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay. I guess I was referring in terms of dry, in terms of not having quite as much formation water as the conventional targets like Bone Springs.","Darryl Smette","No significant difference that I\u2019m aware of but I may have to research that a little more. But I\u2019m not aware of any significant changes.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Investments. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Thank you and good morning.","John Richels","Good morning, Jeff.","Dave Hager","Good morning.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","I wanted to ask \u2013 kind of jump to the Powder River. How contiguous is your position there? And along with that, do you have multiples on exposure on some of the acreage or do the frontier in the Parkman and Turner tend to occur individually on discrete locations?","John Richels","We have acreage throughout Campbell County but we also have some very nice positions that our contiguous in that area. To give you an idea, we have so far been what I would consider appraisal mode \u2013 appraising areas throughout Campbell County. Now we are in the position into Parkman and to a large degree also into Turner.","But we\u2019re going to go into full development mode on those formations. And so what you\u2019re going to see from us in the future is better economic \u2013 overall economic results as we can focus on development and get our costs down, get our EURs up even more consistently. So we\u2019re seeing outstanding results. And I can tell you that our program in the last quarter really delivered good results and you\u2019re going to see a continuous movement in that direction as we get out of the mode of appraising our entire acreage position and get into the mode of focusing on the most economic development areas.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","So just to follow up on what you just said, as you go into development mode, will you start to see a significant rise in rigs as we\u2019re going to see in Delaware or does there still need to be some more work done before you \u2013","John Richels","We think the opportunity is there. We\u2019re going to have three rigs working right now. We want to walk before we run, I guess you\u2019d say. But there\u2019s certainly opportunity to raise the rig count in the future. But we\u2019re going to see how these developments go. And if they work out the way we think they\u2019re going to work out, the opportunity is certainly there to raise the rig count in the future.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Great. And if I can ask just another quick question. Can you tell me what your current well spacing assumptions are for your 2015 production projections in Eagle Ford?","John Richels","There are various well spacing assumptions depending on exactly where the wells are located throughout our acreage position. They vary on the order of 40 acres to 80 acres for the average about 60-acre spacing.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","Okay, great. Thank you.","John Richels","Okay. Well, folks, we\u2019re sure on top of the hour and if there are any other questions, don\u2019t hesitate to call us. We\u2019ll be around all day. And just before signing off, let me leave you with just a few takeaways from today\u2019s call.","First, I think we\u2019ve done an excellent job of improving our portfolio on a very short period of time. Devon\u2019s emerged with a formidable portfolio that\u2019s on track to deliver multi-year growth production \u2013 oil production growth in excess of 20% while generating free cash flow. And as evidenced by our Q1 results, our pursuit of high margin production is significantly expanding our margins and profitability.","And finally, the resource potential associated with our world-class Permian position continues to get better with time and is clearly a cornerstone growth asset for Devon. As I mentioned earlier, as I look ahead, I\u2019ve never been more excited about the future prospects for Devon. Even with all of the exciting changes, our approach to the business remains unchanged. We will continue to aggressively pursue our top strategic objective of maximizing shareholder returns by optimizing long term growth and debt adjusted cash flow per share.","So we look forward to talking with you again at the next call and thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Howard Thill","Thank you, Courtney and good morning everyone. Welcome to Devon\u2019s fourth quarter conference and webcast call. I am Howard Thill, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations as Courtney told you for Devon Energy. Also on the call today are John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Hager, Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer along with a few other members of our senior management team.","If you haven\u2019t had a chance to listen to the management commentary, you can find that along with the associated slides and our new operations report at devonenergy.com. Additionally, we have included our forward-looking guidance in our earnings release. I hope you've all had a chance to review those documents as today\u2019s call will largely consist of Q&A.","Finally, I\u2019d remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call will contain plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates which are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. You have a lot of detail in the operations report that was posted last night I sure hope that you\u2019d like that new disclosure and you find the report very helpful as you work your way through the information.","Just before we jump into Q&A, I just like to make a couple of points. The past year was an important really transformational year for Devon and the Company delivered what we think were some outstanding results in 2014. As we discuss our 2014 results today and our outlook for 2015, I hope you come away with three important messages. First, the dramatic portfolio transformation that we accomplished in 2014 has resulted in Devon having a top tier asset portfolio with a deep inventory of high rate of return investment opportunities and years of running room. Secondly, we\u2019re approaching 2015 with caution and with a view to maintaining flexibility given the challenging business environment. With that in mind, we\u2019re laser focused on execution which is allowing us to decrease E&P capital spending by roughly 20% in 2015 without any reduction in our previous total production growth guidance or our previous guidance of 20% to 25% oil production growth. And lastly, we have a terrific balance sheet that continues to be one of the strongest in the E&P sector and we have a very strong hedge position, ample liquidity and a number of other financial leverage that give us superior financial strength and flexibility in the current business environment.","So in spite of the challenging macro environment, we think we are very well poised to deliver superior returns for our shareholders in the upcoming years. Again thank you for joining us and with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Howard to start the Q&A. Howard?","Howard Thill","Thanks John. And before we start, I\u2019d ask you to make certain that we can get as many people as possible on the call that you limit yourself to two questions. And you can re-prompt to ask additional questions as time may permit.","So Courtney with that we\u2019re ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","If I may take prospectus first of all on the increase in the type curve on the Eagle Ford I guess I was looking for some incremental disclosure on the rest of the Eagle Ford position Lavaca I guess the Upper Eagle Ford inventory potential because the reserve life there rather the drilling life is still relatively short and in the current price oil environment I am just curious as to how do you think about that inventory as we go forward? And I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up please.","David Hager","Hi Doug this is Dave. Well, we\u2019re very encouraged with what we\u2019re seeing obviously in the Eagle Ford we\u2019re up the type curve due to the results that we\u2019ve had with our optimized completions. We also -- the production optimization specifically the choke management have yielded outstanding results and you can see highlighted some increase in the type curve and then a few incredibly great wells, greater than 3,000 Boe per day on a 30 day IP. We have decreased the drilling activity somewhat in the -- or the rig activity somewhat in the Eagle Ford we\u2019ve dropped down we were thinking we\u2019re going to go from around 15 to 16 rigs, we\u2019re down around 10 rigs in DeWitt County and then we\u2019ll be drilling some wells in Lavaca County this year and we will also continue appraising the Upper Eagle Ford. We\u2019re very encouraged with earlier results that we see in the Upper Eagle Ford at this point.","Lavaca County is still a part of the overall program. I have talked about previously how it\u2019s a little bit thinner over there you don\u2019t get quite the rates in the EUR as you do in the other and given the current commodity price environment we think it\u2019s prudent to focus our activity in DeWitt County but we have a strategy for holding on to the Lavaca County acreage and that will be part of our go forward program when commodity prices recover somewhat. So we still have Lavaca it is there the DeWitt County and the Lower Eagle Ford just keeps getting better and we still don\u2019t have the results from the Devon completion that we did here and start coming online here at the first year, but these are from the revised BHP completions, we think took us about 80% away to where we want to go with the completions on and that\u2019s getting significantly better and the earlier results on the Upper Eagle Ford are encouraging. We just need to get more appraisal activity. So I think overall it\u2019s positive and with the lower growing activity and with the Upper Eagle Ford potential there, there is potential for lengthening the inventory that we have.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answer Dave, hopefully my second questions will quicker. Obviously there is a lot debate over how quickly and what scale of cost reduction the industry can expect in this lower oil price environment so I was just -- if you could give us Devon\u2019s perspective please in terms of what have you assumed in your capital budget by way of cost reduction and then ultimately where do you think it can get to sort of by year-end as opposed to the average for the year? And I will leave it there. Thank you.","David Hager","I think your question was quick on the first one my answer was long so it wasn\u2019t your fault, but I\u2019m going to turn it over to Darryl Smette he is going to talk a little bit about the cost reduction.","Darryl Smette","Yes Doug, just to kind of set the basis here what I\u2019m going to do is give you some numbers and they\u2019re going to be in relationship to the cost environment we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. So what we\u2019ve seen so far is a cost reduction on different phases of our CapEx from drilling rigs to drill bit to LTG those types of things of about 10% compared to the fourth quarter. We are still in meaningful discussions with all of our equipment and service providers. We have high hopes that we will continue to drive additional cost out of that system. Right now we\u2019re hoping that we could get an additional 10% to 15% by year-end. What we have currently in our budget is a 10% reduction from fourth quarter and that does not include any efficiency as it we might gain from our operational people that is just price related to our service providers.","Doug Leggate","So 25% would be the total dollar just to be clear?","Darryl Smette","That would be a comparison of fourth quarter 2014 versus fourth quarter 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra","First question is on the uncompleted inventory, how do you see that exiting \u201915 versus \u201914?","David Hager","Yes this is Dave again. Talking specifically in the Eagle Ford, we had about 150 wells they were not completed at the end of 2014. We have decreased our completion crews out there. We did have nine crews working at one point. We\u2019ve started five. We added four more, two of which were Devon operated. We\u2019ve gone from nine down to four at this point three of which are BHP operated, one of which is Devon operated. The Devon operated crew is also in DeWitt County. We\u2019re going to do a few more wells there and then we\u2019re going to move it to Lavaca County and then after that we\u2019ll be dropping that completion crew also. Having said all that we do anticipate the uncompleted inventory in Eagle Ford to basically have by the end of the year. So somewhere on the order of 70-75 uncompleted wells there.","The other key area I\u2019d say that we have an uncompleted inventory is in the Delaware Basin and the Permian Basin overall we have about 55 or so wells in the Permian Basin I think about 35 in the Delaware Basin that are uncompleted and that\u2019s going to be part of the basis of our growth as we move into 2015 as we drive that inventory down to probably more on the order of 20 to 25 uncompleted wells by the end of \u201915. So we\u2019re taking a measured approach at this in light of the current price environment but we will be driving the inventory down.","Subash Chandra","And a follow-up I guess I will wait for some details in the K but any sort of flavor you can add for the \u201914 reserves sort of where the hits and misses or the highs and lows were as far as reserve credit you might may or may not have gotten?","David Hager","Take a shot John and I will add to it.","John Richels","So Subash, what we look in our 2014 I mean some of the big pieces, and you\u2019re right you\u2019ll be able to get lot more detail but some of the highlights of that I guess was the light oil reserve additions were very-very strong we actually added about 200% of our light oil 2014 light oil production to the extent there were some downward revisions they were largely gas as a result of the five year rule if my memory serves me correct I think it\u2019s 74 million barrels were related to that. So they\u2019re just off because we\u2019re not developing that gas right now and it will come back at the right time. Dave, do you have anything to add to that?","David Hager","I think that\u2019s the key we had extensions discoveries around 200 million barrels or so and we purchase of about 265 million barrels we had revisions other than price of negative 65 million and that was essentially all of that and although more it was due to the five year rule so that\u2019s the key highlight. So we think when we put it all together from a all-in F&D standpoint or drill bit F&D we had very competitive metrics.","Subash Chandra","Yes, I guess I was sort of looking at in context of what you\u2019d spent in \u201914 versus \u201913, look to be a bit more and with revisions or say even without revisions look to be about the same as the prior year if there was any read through in that?","David Hager","Well, the one thing you have to keep in mind in general when you\u2019re thinking about F&D is that as we shift to oil the F&D maybe a little bit higher but it\u2019s still has the value equation makes it more than worthwhile as you still are on from a returns standpoint you still get much higher returns. But as you make the shift like we have to oil, oil F&D tends to be a little bit higher.","Subash Chandra","Okay, that is all. Thank you.","John Richels","And as we said Subash the bulk of that or a big piece of that reserve addition was on the light oil side which is our highest margin product as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David Tameron","If I think about the ability to ramp in the second half of the year and kind of how you guys are with price sensitivity and I assume like every other E&P company you\u2019ve run 10-15 different scenarios since October-November. But how should we think about if oil comes back to 65, what\u2019s that look like can you just give some general framework and thoughts around that?","David Hager","Yes this is Dave again. Well there\u2019re a lot of variables that go into that equation and we\u2019re going to give you a fairly non-specific answer here because of that. But we have to look at also what is the cost environment if oil does go back we have to look at what returns we\u2019re getting in each of those plays, what the takeaway capacity is, what the drilling results are, et cetera. So there is -- it's ought to be too specific on that I would say that the key thing is we have a lot of flexibility both to take capital down or to take capital back up. The vast majority of our rigs are on a well-to-well basis. We have very few on a long-term contract. Almost all of our acreage is held by production. So there is no concern with drilling wells just to retain acreage. So we have all the flexibility. So we\u2019ll assess that situation if that were to occur and make the right call understanding we are looking at first the returns at a well level and then second what\u2019s our balance sheet look like.","David Tameron","And one follow-up on that, if I think about 2016 let\u2019s say I know it\u2019s long ways out. But if I think about oil and where it\u2019s at and let\u2019s say you get those 25% reductions on the service side that you\u2019re targeting by 4Q. Does that set up a scenario where 2016 and I guess would that set up a scenario where margins come in sets the 2016 looks similar to what you would have done in 2013-2014 just at a lower price band. Does that make sense?","David Hager","Yes, I understand what you are trying to scribe there David. Well, it\u2019s possible that\u2019s true from I think in that scenario and again there is a lot of variables go in there so it\u2019s hard to say for sure. But I think you could paint a scenario where you could be getting similar type returns to what you\u2019re talking about in 2013-2014, you would have to also then consider though the cash flow for the company and the desire that we want to say with a strong balance sheet. So, obviously 65 to 70 you would have lower cash flow than you would have had at $90 a barrel.","Having said that, we\u2019re also looking at in addition to what we have talked about we have a lot of productivity gains that we\u2019ve been able to get here through the improved completion design. And so I think at the well level you could just paint a scenario where you could have very-very good returns in that kind of price environment. I think you\u2019d have to look at the overall cash flow for the company and just say how much capital do you want to spend and then maintain a strong balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Bob Brackett","I have a question about the JVs and how you allocate capital in the Eagle Ford that BHP JV, how do you develop that plan, do they put forward a plan for the number of rigs and you either consent or not consent or you do it interactively?","David Hager","Tony Vaughn our Head of E&P is in the room and we\u2019re going to turn the call over to Tony, he was probably the closest of any of us with BHP and we\u2019ll have him answer that.","Tony Vaughn","Hi Bob this is Tony. I appreciate your question. We do work very closely with BHP. We actually have some of our engineers accounted into the BHP office so it\u2019s very close working relationship. As you know we were running about 15 rigs in DeWitt County three and our Lavaca County work. We jointly decided to reduce activity on the DeWitt side of the business back to 10 it affords us the opportunity to actually high grade the completions and you can see that the type curve was increased from about 1,200 up to 1600 Boe, 1,650 Boes per day but the average for the last quarter was all the way up to 2,100 Boes per day. So it\u2019s really a joint effort. We have a concept of working in a project team environment between the two companies and a lot of synergies there bring all of our technical skills to the table and we just jointly work that process.","Bob Brackett","Okay. And then a similar JV question on this line it looks like you still have some money left on the carry, why not go ahead and use up that carry since you got at 70%?","Tony Vaughn","Well, that carry is fungible. So we can move it, if you remember the original was the set up in five different plays and we can use that carry up in the Rockies as well and that\u2019s our intention to use rest of it. The JV money the signer pack is in the Turner and below but they\u2019re not in the Parkman but we will be drilling some Turner wells and that will use up that remaining JV carry and we think that\u2019s the most efficient place to do it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles Meade","I\u2019m wondering on the NGL front the guidance you guys gave for pricing surprised me a little bit and I\u2019m wondering from your advantage business point at both a producer but also operating EnLink if you could talk about how you see that market evolving over the course of the year?","Darryl Smette","Yes, this is Darryl. Obviously NGL prices have really taken a hit. Starting a couple of years ago but just in the last three or four months that has deteriorated even further. There is a couple of things at work there. First of all we\u2019ve had, because of the success the industry has had, we\u2019ve had a tremendous amount of new NGL that has come on to market and that is including virtually all the products but primarily ethane and propane. Over the last few months what you\u2019ve seen is the deterioration in the propane price and that has been caused by a couple of different things, number one the increase in supply but in the middle part of 2014 and early in 2014 we were able to export large portion of that propane internationally because of the downturn in the economies and the low crude oil prices now the crude oil Napa price is able to compete internationally with propane. So the propane price internationally plus the cost does not make that a good exportable product right now. So that has really backed up propane and caused a large growth in storage.","As we go forward we don\u2019t see, and let me just add to that, what we had is a very mild winter in some parts of the country especially early on in November and December and so there was on the propane side a number of demand scenarios that didn\u2019t play out because of that warm weather. As we move through the year it\u2019s going to take a while to work off that propane supply. So while we might see some improvement, we have seen some improvement in the last 30 days or so. We still think that propane is going to be under pressure. We do think ethane will continue to be under pressure simply because of all the ethane that is out there. We do not think ethane will start trading above the Btu equivalent of gas until we get into the late 2016 maybe early 2017 as additional pet Cam plants come on-stream. Even though there are some export facilities that will be available at least on the water coming in the next year or two in the current environment we don\u2019t see that helping a lot. So we think ethane is going to continue be under pressure for the next year and a half or so and we think propane as we go through the summer months may improve a bit at least in the near-term that doesn\u2019t give us much hope either.","Charles Meade","That is a lot of great detail and I\u2019m sure some of the people on the call up in the Northeast are wondering about that mild winter you\u2019re talking about but on the different front your thermal oil in Canada, can you talk a bit about how that asset I know the operational performance looks great, but I\u2019m wondering if you can talking more broad sense how that asset looks in your portfolio now and if you -- how it compares to your light tight opportunities and particularly with the performance but also I know there is a different tax regime up there and all that sort of thing?","Darryl Smette","Charles, when you look at the -- we got the production continuing to ramp-up in Canada as you know from Jackfish 3 and we actually have another pad coming on at Jackfish 2 to help ramp that production up through the end of \u201915 and through all of 2016. We\u2019re not making a lot of capital expenditures and undertaking a lot of capital expenditures in Canada in that heavy oil business today. And this is a business that we always thought you have to take a long-term view on it and you have to be in one of the best projects. And we\u2019re in an area with Jackfish and Pike frankly our neighbors there are Cenovus\u2019 Christina Lake and MEG and we\u2019re in really what appears to be the sweet spot for oil sands development in Canada. So we\u2019re not expanding a lot in terms of additional CapEx right now. The returns from that over the last year have always been cash flow positive even we\u2019re cash flow positive even at a $40 or $45 WTI because we are in one of the very best projects and the returns over the last year have ranged from some of the lower values with the $45 WTI to very high returns when oil was trading at $100 and the differential was 14. So it\u2019s something that you have to take a bit of a long-term view on but it\u2019s still provides at a WTI prices where they are today a pretty good rate of return on cash going forward basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer","On the cost front your guidance for both lease operating expense and SG&A costs per Boe appears to be rising a bit in 2015 relative to \u201914. Can you talk to what\u2019s driving this and if you see or have baked in cost deflation opportunities?","David Hager","I may start off on the LOE side here briefly and then hand it over to Tom Mitchell to talk about on the G&A side. On the LOE side, the increase is primarily driven just as we continue to shift our portfolio to an oil oriented portfolio versus a gas oriented portfolio. And so if you remember and part of 2014 we still have the conventional gas assets in the Canada as well as the non-core gas assets in the U.S. And so they contributed the overall number for 2014. So it\u2019s just a shift of the portfolio. But in a normalized price environment you are still increasing margins significantly as you move to this oil oriented portfolio. But that\u2019s the only thing on the LOE side. I think Tom can give you little more specifics probably on that and also on the G&A side.","Tom Mitchell","Yes Brian, on G&A, first of all, you got to remember that reported volumes are down year-on-year when you take out the non-core assets that have been divested so that\u2019s part of it. We do have some increases you\u2019ve got a full year of EnLink in there and EnLink s is up a little bit. And then addition to that and this is really positive and you\u2019re seeing it in our execution some investment has been made primarily on the technical side that\u2019s going into G&A here back in Oklahoma City and a huge investment really in just execution overall within the company and you\u2019re seeing it in our results here in the last few quarters in particular. So those are the primary drivers behind it.","David Hager","Brian one thing I didn\u2019t answer is we have not assumed any cost savings on the LOE side. Now we are going after those obviously but unlike the capital side where Darryl talked about the cost savings we have not assumed that in our budget case again we are aggressively pursuing those but we have not made that assumption.","Brian Singer","And then my follow-up actually goes a bit back to the prior question with regards to oil sands. When you think about Pike this is a year I think you said you\u2019re going to be doing the final review as you think about potentially looking at it again for sanction next year. But do you see cost deflation opportunities and have you locked any in, in terms of Pike or future in situ oil sands and what pace is that moving at relative to what you\u2019re seeing in onshore U.S.?","Tom Mitchell","Brian you are absolutely right we are seeing some cost in. So what we\u2019re doing at Pike now as we\u2019ve previously discussed and Dave can maybe give you if you like some more detail around the engineering. But we\u2019re doing some additional engineering work throughout this year to scope out the project properly and also at the same time scoping out costs because that we\u2019re seeing exactly what you have alluded to we don\u2019t quite know where those costs are all going to work out throughout the year but we think we\u2019re going to have significant cost savings going into a decision as to whether we move ahead and when we move ahead with Pike. And that makes a significant difference if we can keep those costs down. We\u2019re going to revisit the decision on Pike after we\u2019ve done this additional appraisal work and the additional engineering work and scoped up the cost more towards year-end.","And in addition to the cost side that will also give us more clarity and some visibility hopefully on FX which is an important factor as well to give us more clarity and visibility on commodity prices and also on differentials because we\u2019ll maybe have a little bit more definition around projects like Keystone XL or TransCanada\u2019s Energy East and Alberta Clipper and Kinder Morgan and the rail process all of those things that go into determining differential. So we\u2019re going to get lot more of that information but we are definitely seeing the cost structure come down, having said that because we\u2019re still working on the final engineering documentation. We haven\u2019t been locking in costs at this point in time but we\u2019ll get a lot more clarity on that as we work our way through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe, TPH. Your line is open.","Michael Rowe","I actually wanted to go back to comment made earlier just about 2016 and kind your willingness to out spin cash flow. I\u2019m just wondering if hedges kind of roll out in 2016 and current strip price proves to be accurate, could you maybe talk about the ability of your high rate of return Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin assets to sustainably grow within cash flow and if they can\u2019t I mean do you have some level of comfort to out spin cash flow and given your ability to monetize midstream assets to EnLink?","David Hager","Michael, certainly I mean yes the assets you\u2019re talking about our returns in the Eagle Ford and Permian are very high and certainly maintain that, but as I said in the comments at the beginning, we are in a terrific position obviously to depending on our outlook for the future at the time. We\u2019re in perfect position to take advantage of that because of our strong financial position and because of all of the financial levers that you\u2019ve talked about. So our plan is as we kind of look in the future our plan is to live pretty close to cash flow, but we\u2019ve got a whole lot of other financial levers that we can take advantage of if we felt the time was right and the circumstance at the time were right.","Michael Rowe","And I guess just the last question I guess would be sort of around your hedging strategy, just given the highlights of return that you can get in the Eagle Ford as an example even today do you have any desire to hedge 2016 at this point and I guess what are your parameters that you\u2019re thinking about internally before you\u2019d make a decision to actually roll on hedges in 2016? Thank you.","David Hager","Well so far we have -- our philosophy generally has been that we try to lock in about 50% or hedge about 50% of our production and we do that just as a matter of prudence even having a strong balance sheet and having the financial levers it is just to ensure some level of cash flow every year. So that\u2019s our general philosophy. Now we haven\u2019t been layering in a lot of hedges for 2016 at these prices because we believe that the price is going to be higher in 2016. And what we have typically tried to do although we have swapped some volumes, we typically try to do it on collars where we can lock in or protect the floor price and keep some of the upside as well. But given that we haven\u2019t been layering in the hedges at this price we\u2019re going to have to see a little stronger price or we have a change of view in the future. And the other thing that you always have to remember is, we always try to keep in mind is that when we do lock in the price side that doesn\u2019t lock in the cost side. And so you\u2019re only locking in half the equation and so we\u2019re watching where costs are going now and we\u2019re watching where commodity prices are going as we continue to prepare for 2016 and the position we might take in our hedging decisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global. Your line is open.","James Sullivan","Just wanted to go back to a topic actually from a little minute ago about the NGL pricing you guys gave some nice color there, thanks for that. But I wanted to talk about how that affected your thinking on capital allocation to the Anadarko Basin and CANA specially, obviously the NGL wide rate parallels are kind of a bigger part of the economic proposition for those wells how do you think about that and how is that affecting well economics your generally kind of poor view of the NGL market. I know that you have a bigger asset there now so I\u2019m not sure if we should think of the 400 million is an increase in spending, but just any color on that?","David Hager","We have a very deep inventory of development opportunities that we\u2019re pursing in the CANA field particularly not to mention now the Meramec that has, we\u2019ve had a couple of good wells in the oil section of the Meramec that we\u2019ve operated and then you can see we are in a number of non-operated Meramec wells that were oil oriented in the past year so that\u2019s kind of a separate story but that\u2019s a very positive story as well. Regarding CANA and the funding of the activity that we\u2019re doing there is the completion designs that have really carried the day to improve the economics and the rates of return that we have out there where we upped the sand count tamp around 3.5 million pounds of sand around 6 million pounds of sand or around from 700 to 1,200 pounds per lateral foot. And we\u2019re frankly testing that over 2,000 pounds per lateral foot now. We may see even further improvements by the size, the type curve, improvement we\u2019ve already described to you. And so that carries the day we have baked these lower NGL prices that Darryl described into our rates of return and bottom-line with the improved completion techniques that we\u2019re seeing these wells compete well with the other opportunities that we\u2019re funding this year because of those improved completion designs.","James Sullivan","The other thing I had is you guys have talked and this actually goes to some of the work you guys have done in that same filed but about optimizing performance on base production I think you have had some asset jobs that you were doing out there and showing some really nice upticks there. Could you give a rough and I know would have to be rough companywide base decline estimate and that can be either net or not net or whatever maintenance efforts you guys are undertaking eventually in the Barnett too?","Tony Vaughn","James this is Tony Vaughn again. Our base decline just overall for the company without CapEx is roughly about 20% maybe not quite that high some of the good work that the teams have done across the company have really focused on up time they focused on line pressure reductions in areas like the Barnett and at CANA. As you mentioned we\u2019ve worked on some chemical jobs in CANA that really had a strong boost in our rate and have major rate impact in \u201914. The guys are looking at artificial lift with a strong focus on that more than we had in the past so all that collectively in my mind in \u201914 was probably one of the primary reasons for outperformance over expectations. And so I think there is a renewed vigor we\u2019ve really segregated our workforce into a couple of different areas. So we have the team in every business unit that\u2019s focused on nothing but the base. We also have a team focused on the execution part of the business as well as the asset management side. So I think we\u2019re just bringing a lot of clarity and a lot of focus to the wellbores that we operate.","David Hager","And let me just add a little bit to that too I often get asked when I am out meeting with investors why are we doing is this is the new Devon why are we doing so much better operationally and Tony is actually probably even if anything he is underselling the transformation that\u2019s taken place internally to Devon and around the execution around the assets. Bottom-line we are very focused on being one of if not the best operator in each of our core areas and it\u2019s not just words that we\u2019re saying here but about 18 months ago we took some of our top-technical professionals away for a few months along with a couple of consultants and said what new we need to do to transform our operational performance. And what you are seeing today is the results of that effort and there are a number of very specific initiatives that came out of that where we added technical staff that Tom mentioned earlier where we\u2019ve added separated the execution for the long-term asset management. We\u2019ve added project management skills. We have a 24x7 well control center where we manage all the operations of all our wells. We have state of operations we have computerized operations in all of peered office where we remotely monitor production of all the wells. I could go on with several other things but I think that\u2019s what gives us confidence that the tight performance that you\u2019re seeing out of Devon is going to continue on into the future. We\u2019ve got the top assets, we\u2019ve got strong balance sheet you\u2019re seeing the execution now. We\u2019re humble about it but we intend to continue doing what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re going to keep getting even better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open.","David Heikkinen","Just thinking about improving service equipment reliability and just the efficiency and pace of wells per rig per year, can you give us some thoughts about fourth quarter \u201915 versus fourth quarter \u201914 of, is that a 10% improvement or are there any particular areas where mud motors or frac equipment was less reliable and now that the industry has slowed down you\u2019d see a bigger improvement in just that efficiency side as we head into \u201916?","Tony Vaughn","David, this is Tony Vaughn again. I think what you\u2019re describing is well within our expectations for as we go through \u201915 as Dave mentioned we\u2019re putting a lot of thoughts into and a lot more granularity into all of our wellbore designs we\u2019re really trying to drive out efficiency using project managements skill to manage cost to stay on schedule. We are starting to see the benefits of that right now. We have incorporated some stretch in inside of each of our business units for the execution part of our work so I think the 2% improvements that you described is relevant I\u2019d also mention that we through our capital allocation process we have really cored up into the sweet spots of these areas that we work in, we\u2019re really doing more development type work and less appraisal work. We have spent a fair amount of money on science and some of these appraisal areas such as the Lavaca County and also in the Delaware all that will come to will pay-off dividend here probably in the second half of this year. So I think the 10% that you described is probably well within reach then.","David Heikkinen","And so as we think going in the \u201916 just kind of modeling in the increase in wells at this rig count before you even think about ramping rig count is reasonable that is cool. The other question I just want to make sure I was understanding what you said on the LOE front that you haven\u2019t factored any cost savings and not putting words in your mouth but again kind of the same 10% CapEx reduction that you built in I don\u2019t see a reason why some of your maintenance and kind of base LOE couldn\u2019t come down at fair amount as we go into \u201916 is that a reasonable framework?","Tony Vaughn","You know what David we have put some challenge to our business units cost contentment is going to be a real driving force inside each of our business unit teams. I think the ability to reduce LOE is there I think a larger percent of that cost component is associated with labor which is a little bit stickier than some of the other things that we\u2019ve talked about today. I do think we still have the ability to shave off some LOE and it will be a little bit better than what we have forecast but you have to remember we\u2019re seeing projects like the Barnett which is accreted to the company LOE is starting to decline replacing that with some higher cost barrels in places like the Delaware. So we\u2019re working that, got a lot of focus on that as we just described.","David Heikkinen","And just one last one, and I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t want to give an expectation for an exit rate for production at this point, for \u201915?","Tony Vaughn","David I don\u2019t think we\u2019re not focused really on the, or giving an exit rate. But suffice to say our production stays pretty strong through the year. We have a pretty good bump in the first quarter and then it holds pretty steady after that throughout the year. And we put ourselves into really a great position with the ton of flexibility as we move into \u201916 which I think is really the important part as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram","I wanted to first ask few questions on the Eagle Ford and perhaps maybe try to understand to what level kind of the new completion design is driving the improve results. I was wondering if you had any data on perhaps wells that are located in the same area, and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the new completion design versus the old one?","David Hager","Well Tony, can give a little more specific here but in general the wells that you saw are in the fourth quarter were the results of a revised design that we worked with BHP on I generally characterize as probably somewhere around 80% of where we\u2019d have liked to go with the completion design. Now we added for a period of time during the fourth quarter two completion crews that Devon operated by themselves and pumped a number of jobs those wells are just now starting to come online. So we\u2019re not sure if you are going to see the other incremental improvement or not but we\u2019ll see and we\u2019ll probably have the results for that in the first quarter. But the type curve improvement that you\u2019re seeing I think is in that wells that are in like type areas and that\u2019s the result of that, I don\u2019t know if Tony wants to add any more detail around that.","Tony Vaughn","Yes, I think that\u2019s right Dave, BHP has got a good design I think they\u2019ve actually been changing that over the course of the last 9-10 months which is approaching a summer design to Devon and we pump a little bit more sand we pump more fluid they have a little bit different philosophy there but I think their completions are moving up. It will be interesting to see if the design that we pumped on the 28 wells that we worked on in DeWitt County have any incremental benefit in that. But I think overall we\u2019re starting to see good collaboration between the two companies trying to take the best from both. I also mentioned to you that some of the science that we\u2019re doing especially in Lavaca County is very unique. We have run fiber optics we drilled vertical well there taking 240 feet of core, doing a lot of micro seismic work, trying to have a really good understanding of what delivers value on the completions in the Eagle Ford. So I think that will continue to improve. We\u2019re also seeing a lot of benefits from our production optimization work that I think we\u2019ve talked about in the past and there are guys they have taken a really I think a really aliquant approach to managing their bottom out pressures and rate. We\u2019re seeing the type curves move up and exceeding performance on that. We\u2019re waiting to see if there will be a corresponding improvement in the expected ultimate recovery per well. I think that could come but we need little bit more data to understand that better.","Arun Jayaram","And my follow up question is just regarding future potential dropdowns to EnLink I guess you guys highlighted in the ops report about expecting to do the Victoria Express Pipeline some time in 2015. I was wondering if you can maybe give some more details around that. And secondly regarding Access how big of a factor would be in terms of that ultimate valuation would the FID be on Pike in terms of future volumes?","Tony Vaughn","Yes Arun, what we talked about with the Victoria Express is potentially dropping that down some time in the first half of the year guys on both our folks here and on the EnLink team are working on that and what that would look like and what the valuation would be and we can\u2019t give you a whole lot more color around that right now. As we move into Access we\u2019re working a lot on that. There are some complexities with it because it\u2019s in Canada and it\u2019s a large asset it will certainly our pace of development of Pike later on in the year will certainly have some bearing on that valuation. So as we get to the time of the year when we\u2019re revisiting that making that decision that will come into play. But we always talked about the dropdown on Access probably being late in 2015 or maybe even moving over to the beginning of \u201916.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, so it sounds like in the next year or so?","Tony Vaughn","Yes sir and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at right now but there is a lot of moving parts right now so we will have to see whether it works out that way that\u2019s the current or that\u2019s currently what we\u2019re moving towards now whether we get all of that work done and whether it all pans out exactly the way we think will remain to be seen. But what we\u2019ve always talked about is potentially doing it in the latter half of this year or early in \u201916.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John Herrlin","Two quick ones in the U.S. you had a negative 38 million barrel revision for oil that wasn\u2019t related to price, John earlier you talked about the revisions being related to the five year rule is that the case for the oil in the U.S.?","John Richels","Tony can answer that on -- sorry John that was largely, the five year rule was largely related to gas.","John Herrlin","Okay, I figured that.","Tony Vaughn","On the oil side we saw a little bit underperformance in our expectations in the Mississippian so we wrote down some per well performance there and also in the Southern Midland Basin we had to write down a little bit of reserves associated with that. And mostly as John had mentioned these were mostly gas write offs and associated with the five year rule.","John Herrlin","EnLink bought the Coronado system in the Midland Basin Darryl how are you configured for the Delaware side in terms of GTP do you have adequate infrastructure at this stage?","Darryl Smette","John look just to kind of paint the background here and I think we\u2019ve mentioned this before but a lot of acreage Devon has in the Permian Basin is acreage that we have acquired overtime. The vast majority of that acreage is currently dedicated to other parties. And so we have very little acreage that\u2019s available to go into any of the EnLink facilities out there although the acreage that is available in the facilities are closed that is certainly a party that we talk to all the time.","In terms of the facilities that are third-party facilities we have issues every now and then closer to well head we have to put in the different types of facilities that kinds of ebbs and flows and it depends on the performance of the wells generally. So when we are seeing some really-really good results from some of the wells and they come on stream which has happened more recently. There is a period of time when we have to have the facilities that catch up our third-party providers have done a very good job of doing that for us. We have a team of Devon what we call facility and pipeline people who are busy installing the facilities that we need to get to the third-party people. So right now we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at. We have a few bottlenecks we have some wells that are offline waiting for some pipeline and some other facilities to be installed. Most of that will be up and operational by the end of the second quarter, but we have made pretty good progress and for the most part are staying ahead of the curve. But there are some isolated incidents where we have a two or three month wait to make sure all of our production moves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kapil Singh with DoubleLine Capital. Your line is open.","Kapil Singh","Just a quick question on leverage, where do you see that going what are your sort of targets over the next kind of 12 months? And then related to that your ratings as well. And what is sort of the plan to achieve whatever those targets are?","Tom Mitchell","Yes this is Tom. We\u2019re pretty solid in our ratings we just have visited with the rating agencies in the last few week. So they\u2019re comfortable with where we are, they\u2019re comfortable with the capital plan. As far as movement in leverage it should be pretty much where you\u2019re seeing it. We are relatively neutral on a cash flow spend in the plan and what we have presented before them. So it\u2019s really one of the sweet spots for the company right now. We are very strong in this area and with the agencies.","Kapil Singh","But is leverage going to stay consistent as earnings for our EBITDA drops but that I think is same right you\u2019re not planning to pay down debt or is that wrong?","Tom Mitchell","There is no particular debt pay down, and as you get into \u201916 and \u201917 I\u2019m not really projecting out into that timeframe right now but for the near-term year and a half it is stable.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global. Your line is open.","James Sullivan","Just a quick clarification, you guys have 13 Second Bone Spring wells that you talked about both in the ops reports of Q3 and Q4 that had a very good third year rates about 900 Boes, all 26 of those were done with a heavier sand loadings, is that right?","David Hager","That\u2019s correct.","James Sullivan","Just want to check that out, so that\u2019s a pretty significant corpus of data there.","David Hager","And we are testing bigger sand rates beyond that James just to give you an idea we will have results for that in the future.","James Sullivan","The other thing I had was you guys had a little bit of commentary in the ops report about the possibility of the EUR estimates going up if you guys could provide the type curves but generally done with increasing the IP rates, 30 day rates and I guess that could be interpreted as hedging your bets on whether you\u2019re accelerating resource or adding it per well. Is it fair to say that you guys are seeing something with the longer data series that you\u2019re seeing data that would suggest you that you are capturing new resource with the new completions?","David Hager","We\u2019re very confident in the Bone Spring that we\u2019re going to increase the EURs. We\u2019re just trying to figure out what the number is and get a little more production history before we do that. And Eagle Ford Tony talked about it\u2019s always less certain it\u2019s earlier on we think there is a possibility when we may bring up the EUR there as well but there is less certainty there than the Bone Spring.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Thill for closing remarks.","Howard Thill","Thank you, Courtney and we appreciate all of the questions.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Scott Coody","Thank you, and good morning. I hope everyone has had the chance to review our second quarter financial and operational disclosures that were released last night. This data package includes our earnings release, forward-looking guidance, and detailed operations report.","Also on the call today are Dave Hager, President and CEO; Tony Vaughn, Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Ritenour, Chief Financial Officer and a few other members of our senior management team.","I would like to remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call today will contain plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially. For a review of risk factors related to these statements, please see our Form 10-K.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Hager","Thank you, Scott, and welcome everyone. Devon achieved another high quality operating performance in the second quarter, building operational momentum in our U.S. resource place and accelerating efficiency gains across our portfolio. These successful efforts result are in a record study and well reserves that growth of our U.S. oil production above guidance expectations with a capital investment that was 17% below our budget year-to-date.","As a result of this strong capital efficiency we are lowering our full-year capital outlook by $100 million and importantly we have not made any changes to our planned activity levels in 2017. For more details on our very strong performance for the quarter, I encourage every investor to read about our Q2 operations report. With this momentum, we are highly confident in our ability to deliver value and returns on our investments plans over the next few years as we navigate industry conditions.","For 2017 our capital plan remains on-track to reach 20 rigs running by year end and we expect to maintain this operational momentum in 2018. Importantly nearly all of these plan drilling activities concentrated within our STACK and Delaware Basin assets which are two of the very best position place on a North American cost curve delivering attractive returns even at today\u2019s strip prices.","To be clear, we are not chasing product growth with our capital programs and remain keenly focused on maximizing our full cycle returns. With this disciplined approach to the business, I can confidently say that this drill bit activity is a very appropriate level of investment for Devon in this environment.","Providing additional certainty to the execution of the business plan is our strong financial position. With a disciplined hedging strategy, we have stabilized our cash flow stream by locking in roughly 55% of Devon\u2019s estimated oil and gas production for the remainder of the year at rates well above market levels.","Additionally, we are steadily accumulating our hedge position in 2018, with this strong hedge book, we remain on-track to invest within cash flow during 2017, coupled with our investment grade ratings, no significant debt maturities until 2021 $2.4 billion of cash on hand and the expectation of a $1 billion of non-core divestiture proceeds over the coming year, we absolutely had a financial capacity and flexibility to execute our business plan.","Given our ability to organically fund capital requirements, Devon is uniquely positioned to maintain and build momentum into future as we advance our development programs in the STACK and Delaware Basin. The quality and size of this world class opportunities ahead us unmatched in the industry. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone we have exposure to over 30,000 potential drilling locations concentrated in very best portions of these place.","This premier asset based provides Devon with a sustainable long-term growth opportunity with the lowest breakeven economics of any repeatable resource play in North America.","Additionally, as these asset shift to full-field development, we fully expect to enhance returns as we reap significant efficiency gains from our multi zone manufacturing work and further optimize our best in class operational performance with cutting edge, predictive analytics and artificial and - efforts.","Looking to the end of the decade, Devon\u2019s differentiated investment story only gets better, our resource rich STACK and Delaware Basin development programs will be in full blown manufacturing mode and the massive upside potential within these franchise assets will be further defined.","As these strategic objectives are successfully met, we expect to take additional steps to further high grade our resource rich portfolio. In fact as our business evolves over the next several years, we see the potential of the monetize several billion dollars of less competitive assets within our portfolio in a very thoughtful and measured pricing.","Potential proceeds from these portfolio rationalization efforts would be balance between accelerating the development of our highest rate of return inventory and debt reduction activities. With this exciting multiyear transformation, we expect to emerge with the highly focused asset portfolio and our profitability would be dramatically enhanced as we transition to a much higher margin barrel.","We also intend to have a fortress balance sheet with net debt-to-EBITDA target of 1.0 to 1.5 times by the end of the decade. These winning characteristics will allowed Devon to deliver consistent, competitive and measured growth rates along with top tier return on capital employed.","So, in summary before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few key messages from today\u2019s call. First, Devon is consistently delivering best-in-class Delaware results to reflect our premium assets and operational excellence.","With the quality returns, we are achieving in the STACK in Delaware Basin coupled with our outstanding financial position, we are on-track to reach 20 rigs by year-end and expect to maintain our strong operational momentum in 2018.","And lastly, as our massive resource set in the STACK and Delaware Basin shift to full-field development mode, we will continually high grade our portfolio by divesting assets.","And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Scott.","Scott Coody","Thanks, Dave. We will now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have any further questions, you can re-prompt as time permits. With that Operator, we will take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Thank you. Good morning, Dave. Good morning everybody. A couple of questions Dave. I guess the one is kind of the housekeeping issue on Canada. Can you just walk us through just the issues in the most recent quarter and the trajectory as we move through the backend of the year. just trying to get a handles as to what do you think the sustaining production capacity in the auto sign at this point. And I have got a follow-up please.","Dave Hager","Great. Doug and I\u2019m going to let Tony answer the details. Obviously, we did encounter what we consider to be a one-time maintenance event is it impacting our production. In July we\u2019ve actually move beyond that that\u2019s fixed that issue is, but Tony can give you the details of that. And I can tell the asset in general is performing outstanding, we just had a one-time maintenance event that\u2019s in a rear view mirror as we sit here today and things look outstanding from this point forward. So, Tony you want to follow-up a little detail on that.","Tony Vaughn","Yes. Good morning, Doug, Doug at J2 we have these very large skim tank vessels there that are really of large diameter vessels this got dapples in it, it is designed to move water and oil through a last stages of separation and extend the retention time. And what we found was we have a pretty sophisticated leak detection system in our Jackfish projects we recognized that we had a small leak in the J2 skim tank areas.","So, we got in there and recognized that what we suspect is through vibration of the flow into those dapples that were down the bolt and brackets system causing some of those brackets to drop, one dropped and punctured the bottom of that vessel.","So we got in cleaned the tank out and took a look at it, we knew exactly what the problem is, so we only did that on J2. We also just did a turnaround in J3, we suspected this issue in J2, so we have been in the in two of those skim tanks in the last 30, 40 days and we will be in the third at J1 within 12 months from now.","So really it was an isolated event that\u2019s now behind us and I think we had this solution remedy and if you just look at the forward just like Dave mentioned, we have production at all three of these Jackfish plants really operating at name plate and above.","In fact J2 and J3 the two that we just took down that are already rent backup and access of the name plate capacity and expect both of those to be back in the mid 40,000 barrels of oil per day. So when we get into the Q4 with the claim quarter we will be back into that 140,000 barrels of oil per day range and again a long life project in front of us. So this is just one of event that\u2019s in the rear view mirror now Doug.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the color. Thanks for that. I guess that the follow-up is, I\u2019m not quite sure how to ask this question efficiently. So when you look at the third quarter guidance I think at least versus the dump sale side that was a little bit late, but still you hasn\u2019t change which I think chemist speaks to the potential lumpiness of moving to these very large developments are going to characterize the production profile I guess forward. So I just wondered if you could help us navigate that a little bit in terms of what that trajectory you had laid out with all these very large full-field developments going on, what that could look like as we go into next year and how you how ratable you expect that goes to be in I guess there is multiple pieces but I will leave it there and let someone else jump on. Thanks.","Dave Hager","If you look at the issue that happened with probably maybe a little bit like guidance compared to what some people are expected in Q3 on the U.S. oil side is we had a large number of completions in the Eagle Ford in Q1 and that caused really strong performance compared to guidance in Q1 and also carried over to some degree into Q2. But those wells obviously fall off fairly quickly.","When we originally put the budget together we had anticipated a little bit more balanced on the completions in the Eagle Ford and have submit in more in Q2 it would cause a little bit higher production in Q3 and where we ended up. So in essence we completed those wells early, caused strong performance Q1, Q2, we had no Eagle Ford completions in Q2 because we got them done early and so that caused Q3 Eagle Ford to fall off a little bit more than was originally anticipated.","But again extremely economic wells, some of the best in the portfolio we just moved the production forward as water boiling down to. As we get more into the full development, what is going to happen is that we are going to have multiple numbers of these multi zone developments going at anyone given time and certainly in any individual one you can say there will be lumpiness, but we think there will be enough of those.","It\u2019s not going to call us extreme lumpiness in the overall production profile for the company and keep in mind also that even as we are moving into these ,the bulk of these are going to smaller to start with and as we get further on in the development they will growing size most likely, but by then we have even more going.","so that\u2019s sure there are going to be some lumpiness to it, we anticipate with a number of lumpiness or should be the number of developments we have going on. The lumpiness will not be too magnified.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answer, Dave. Thanks a lot. I know it\u2019s a tough thing to describe.","Dave Hager","Yes. And let me just emphasize to we\u2019re still on target to grow our U,S, oil production by 2018. And so there is no change in that guidance at all.","Doug Leggate","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","Hi, good morning guys. Yes. When are your STACK developments schedule for next year, Coyote, it\u2019s in the far north western areas of your acreage. Just any color, do you think that to be party or acreage as de-risked or mature for development or is that dependent upon Coyote. And maybe more generally, if you can just discuss raw quality well performance or expected well performance difference between your focus areas in Showboat [indiscernible] and what do you expect around the Northwest Coyote?","Tony Vaughn","This is Tony here. I just kind of describe to you that we have broken down our footprint in the STACK prospect here into several different what we call the appraisal areas and of course Showboat is really in appraisal area one where we\u2019ve had some lot of success we\u2019ve reported on that but we\u2019ve also been in the process both us and industry de-risking our next couple of appraisal areas.","And so, the Coyote project will be in one of these top couple of appraisal areas that we have been de-risking. So, the way we look at this is we\u2019ve got a great understanding and the Meramec 200 and the Meramec 300, you are starting to see some results come in across the board and Meramec 400 some from Devon but some from industry.","We have seeing some in the west from other operators that have not performed up to the same quality of results that we\u2019ve seen in the 200 and 300, none of that was unexpected I think from us, and I guess I got to remind everybody on the call Evan that this commitment that we have to being highly data driven is we think is really laying us out to be a the premier operator in the field.","Number one, we have got what we think is the best footprint in the play, but really we have this commitment to being data driven and have acquired substantial amount of subsurface data, we\u2019ve built that into the three dimensional earth models and that\u2019s really the basis for all the design work going forward.","So, when you look at some of the results we have over there, industry is doing a good job right now of piloting different ideas from spacing and lateral intervals to vertical connectivity type testing to just simply appraising different horizons. And we\u2019re moving into what we think are going to be the sweet spot of each of these intervals that we\u2019re in. So we are expecting a good performance out of the Coyote project.","Evan Calio","Great. Thanks. And maybe second if I could. Yes, Jacobs Row was downsized I guess not surprise given commentary for your partner. How do you deploy free of capital from lower non-op activity in 2018. And could you provide us some color on how do you would compare Woodford full development returns versus your STACK Meramec or your Delaware program and I will leave it there?","Dave Hager","Yes. Well obviously we look at our portfolio across the entire company and we allocate our capital to those on a risk adjusted basis provide us the highest return. And so we when we look at redeploying capital such as that, we will look across the entire company and see where the best place is. I can tell you in general that we will be redeploying any capital there back into the Meramec development or into the Delaware Basin development.","Those are very good returns, so we think we\u2019re going to get there, but we think we have - they are probably a little bit less on average, we would say that we can get from our Delaware and Meramec program but not significantly less, but there is obviously less condensate production on those than the other players were pursuing. So that\u2019s where the capital would be redeployed.","Evan Calio","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Todd, with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Maybe one question on CapEx if we look at the CapEx that you announce that the full-year, what were the primary drivers and how do you see those trends as sustaining or evolving over the course of the year.","Dave Hager","Well the primary driver for the CapEx reduction is just the increased efficiency that we have been able to achieve in across the entire asset base, I would say one big factor in that as our supply initiative where we have decoupled much of the completion activities where we are supplying our own sand our own diesel and we see significant savings from that.","We\u2019re also just through the use of our advanced predictive analytics, artificial intelligence work we are finding that not only are we is it helping deliver best of any operator a 90 day IP, there is also driving our costs roller as well. So we feel really good about where it is, we\u2019re very confident obviously the $100 million reduction there maybe some upside to that we will have to see how the second half goes.","We do anticipate there maybe some increase inflationary pressure in the second half of the year and so that may drive our costs a little bit higher than they were in the first half of the year. We will just have to see how that goes, but we decided as appropriate at this point just take what we are sure of which is a $100 million reduction and then see how things evolve in the second half of the year.","Ryan Todd","So far the early takeaway is which I think Jacobs Row with some of the first kind of larger scale unbundled efforts that you had made on supply chain mainly, the takeaway has been a little bit better than expected. Is that fair?","Dave Hager","And the efficiencies across our entire portfolio of just drilling wells more effectively, et cetera. Yes.","Ryan Todd","That\u2019s great, thanks and then maybe one follow-up question on the Meramec. You had some comments in there about results that you have seen in-production results today, have you seen any spacing pilots in the Meramec. I think there has some noise and confusion around some of the pilot results that we have seen across the play from some of your peers in the basin that\u2019s caused them concern. So any thoughts that you can share on what you have seen so far across the spacing pilots and views on what that it means for kind of full-field development in the Meramec?","Dave Hager","I will kick it off, I\u2019m going to probably just going to repeat what Tony did, maybe are just slightly different words here, but if you look at it our operated spacing tests have been very, very successful. We have seen on some of the outside operated spacing test or has been some very successful and ones but some have had mixed results. When we look at those test that others have done, we can\u2019t say for sure why they tested it exactly what they tested, but the results are not a surprise to us.","Now, without going to the specifics of each one sometimes we\u2019ve seen that they have been testing zones that we know have would be thinner and wouldn\u2019t have the kind of productivity as other zones that are in the same geographic area. Why they tested that, they are probably just trying to get an idea of the productivity of our secondary or tertiary zone we suspect.","In other cases, we know that they have been grilled on the fringe of what we consider the key part of the play to be. In some cases we think that they have used completion designs that are not as a sophisticated as what design we are using. And we\u2019ve talked a little bit in the press release about the proprietary completion design.","So, to our view point there is nothing this surprised us with our test which have been very successful or some of these others that had mixed results and in just affirms, we have the best position in the play and that we understand what is going on, on here. So, that\u2019s kind of an overall view. And would also say it that it is very early on in the play and I suspect and we don\u2019t know for sure, but I suspect in some of these cases these companies maybe testing the limits of certain things.","And they learn from these and as they go into full-field development it will be better results. And so I would be very careful about extrapolating the results from any early experimentation that maybe taking on in the play, say this is the way it\u2019s going to work on the full-field. But I suspect they knew what they are doing, we don\u2019t know exactly all the reasons. We suspect they knew what they are doing and they are just testing a limits of certain things to see if it would work or not. But, again it\u2019s no surprise to us at all in any of the results we have seen.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David Tameron","Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m just going to reference the slide, I think it\u2019s 15 in your deck, just the route area. Can you just give me an update of kind of Seawolf, it looks like this development pattern changed from maybe what you had been thinking. Can you just give us the latest and greatest thinking as far as that relates to or I guess the focus on this area and realizing every areas is different. But, can you just update us on that as far as the development patterns and how many wells per section, et cetera.","Scott Coody","Dave, this is Scott. And absolutely that a systematic change slightly. I think we added one or two more wells from last year and we got a little bit more specific with regards to the landing zone. I think this time around we include the X, Y because that\u2019s a common nomenclature in that area. And obviously we\u2019re doing an appraisal well and lower Wolfcamp bay as well, but maybe Tony could speak to just what we\u2019re trying to accomplish at that particular pilot, which we call the Seawolf pilot.","Tony Vaughn","David, as Scott mentioned the well that we\u2019ve reported on here in the lower portion of the upper Wolfcamp A, was just below the highlighted Rattlesnake area there. It gives us a little bit of upside thought process on the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, but if you go back to the last quarterly call, where we\u2019ve reported the results of the Fighting Okra well. It\u2019s just immediately south of the spot on the map that says the word Seawolf.","And so there you saw the outstanding results that had there in upper portion of the upper Wolfcamp and this Seawolf is really going to be our first what we call our first multi zone development in Rattlesnake and we have got a substantial amount of locations that we have highlighted in our resource play.","Starting right here with this will spread the 12 world program and the Wolfcamp and as we work that of we will just move those three rigs from that location start moving to the East and probably delineate that Rattlesnake area. So what we don\u2019t show on this is a lot of industry activity that\u2019s been around this and there is been some boomer wells there.","We feel like this particular portion of not only of our play that this particular portion of the Delaware Basin is perhaps the best column in all of North America, so we are expecting a very robust long-term development just in this Rattlesnake area.","David Tameron","Okay and just noticed the B maybe versus the prior to the Wolfcamp B is no longer part of that plank, you talk a little bit about I know others have done the same, can you just talk about your thinking there?","Tony Vaughn","There is not been a lot of data points that have come through in the lower portion of the Wolfcamp A or the B, there has been some other nomenclatures, Wolfcamp 300 and 400, there has been some data points out there few and far between, some of those have been in fact a bit disappointing.","So we know there is a very rich hydrocarbon column here, lot of oil in place, we think it will come with time, but we also think we can maximize our present value by focusing on the upper portion of the Wolfcamp.","And we know that we can come back and drill back through that zone and get to the lower portion of the Wolfcamp which we frankly right now we are not prioritizing in our development because we just have not de-risked it, we don\u2019t see the activity from industry really shown us the results either.","David Tameron","Okay, thanks for that color. And then Dave can I just ask one about [indiscernible] sell the Barnett or a portion of the Barnet and I can imagine what your answer is going to be, but because we have talked it about in the past, but I\u2019m just thinking about in terms of returns and generating cash flow you know historically it has generated lot of free cash flow, it doesn\u2019t\u2019 look like you are going need that over the next couple of quarters or a couple of spending gap or can you just talk about your decision there?","Dave Hager","Well you are right, we don\u2019t needed for the shorter term. What I tried to do paint in my prepared remarks at the beginning of the conference call here is where we see directionally we are going and by 2020 and that is as we are moving into full-field development in the STACK and the Delaware that we will become a more streamlined company eventually and we see in the billions of dollars of asset sales that we may accomplish over that timeframe and in a very measured way as we balance our cash inflows and our cash outflows.","Certainly there are several different areas that we can consider and I\u2019m not going to go into detail on any decision over regarding any specific area or assets that we have that we may consider from monetization. But in general, I mentioned that we would certainly most likely be divesting several billion dollars of assets, we see using some of that to further development activity in the STACK in the Delaware Basin and also repaying debt with a portion of those proceeds to build an extremely strong balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA on the order of 1 to 1.5.","So, we think that financial strength is going to certainly position us with a great deal of strength in any commodity price environment. We think that\u2019s really the key for a top performing E&P company to have, we have franchise assets, we\u2019re executing very well on those assets and we will further streamline the portfolio and we will have one of the best balance sheets and not the best balance sheet in the industry when we are finished with his total transformation.","And so certainly the Barnett or some other assets configure into that equation, again we\u2019re making no decision on that today and certainly no announcement on that today. But we certainly have a lot of flexibility about how we go about accomplishing this strategic objective, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re going.","David Tameron","Okay. Thanks, I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Dave and to rest of the team there. I would like to ask two questions on the Delaware Basin. First on the Seawolf development. Can you talk about what if any lessons you are able to bring from your multi zone high intensity development plans over in the STACK to the Delaware Basin in to that development or is it more of just a blank slate and there is not a lot of portability of lesson from one to the other?","Dave Hager","Hi, Charles. Thanks for the question, we do find the ability to transfer learning between our Delaware and STACK teams, in fact we\u2019ve been on this multi zone design for about two years now and that\u2019s a really thoughtful work that has going on with our technical teams in both areas. I meet with each other, so transfer learnings quite easily here, we\u2019re all centralized in this building so makes it real advantageous from that perspective.","One of the things I think unique about the Delaware is really the federal permitting aspects is a little bit more complicated than it is in STACK and I think in the last conference call we talked about receiving our first master development plan which was played as a 162 well permit that we received in [indiscernible] and we feel like we\u2019re very close to having three more of those master development plans approved by the BLM which will set us for about 600 to 750 potential locations left.","And the benefits we see from this multi zone development concept is just much more efficient not only permitting exercise that we are going through as I just described but really we layout the integrated surface facility concept for each of these areas. And in that we\u2019re able to use the centralize production facility not just by one pad or two pads, but in our planning there, when we start looking at the chart and laying out all of these different projects we continue to use these surface facilities for a given area.","So for instance in Seawolf while that will be the first 12 well project we will drive. We will continue to run additional projects producing through that centralize production facility for some time to come. So, we will maximize the rate capacity in that facility for a while. We also feel like there is tremendous ability to increase the efficiency of our operations and just to give you order of magnitude on that, when we put in a park of that three rigs in a half section or quarter section type area and don\u2019t have to really move those rigs from location-to-location, we will not got about three days of rig time out of the what is normally about a spud to TD time of about 10 bay.","So the more we keep our operations centralize there, we can continue to think of things in terms of batch operations, so we will use had the flexibility use spudder rigs to get to surface pull drill and then come back behind with our conventional rigs for the production stream, we will also be able to do simultaneous operations and it will actually have some frack operations ongoing in some of these projects while we drill and produce. So tremendous amount of present value uplift by thinking a little bit differently than industry has taught up in the past, and we\u2019re incorporating the same concept throughout the Delaware and the STAC development shows.","Tony Vaughn","Charles, the only think I would add. I think you had a really strong list a bunch of stock there that one thing is we probably have as much experience as anybody out there in the industry what we would call the parent child relationship in any given area. In other words the relationship between the first well section and what the ultimate down spacing might be and what kind of completion designs optimize recovery given that.","And so that\u2019s something that we have obviously studied from Eagle Ford to the STACK and the Delaware and we feel we have a really good understand, you have to actually drill the wells in many cases to know absolute results, but we have a pretty good understanding of I would say what is going to optimize the overall recovery for the highest returns around that and that comes from experience and drilling in a number of different areas and transferring those earnings from one place to another.","Charles Meade","Right, that\u2019s great color guys, and you guys are pushing the envelope within the industry on that kind of concentrate development. And that actually leads to my second question, you guys have highlighted the Seawolf development, but I couldn\u2019t have noticed that just in north you have got this [indiscernible] development that just maybe a little bit behind those schedule with actually more wells and so maybe can you give us little more color on what the plan is there?","Dave Hager","Charles we have laid out, I think what we show here to be really these projects that will be initiated through the later part of 2017 and into the early part of 2018, so we have got a gain chart that actually goes beyond that with additional projects there, but as you the focus for what we call the distilled areas really largely going to be the Leonard and little bit of bonds claim type work and some Wolfcamp work there.","So it\u2019s just another - the project that we have talked about in the last operating report and the one that we mentioned in this the Anaconda is really a three interval test on the Leonard that we are completing those wells and starting to bring those online. We will have operating results of those in Q3 but at this point we\u2019re looking at those as very favorable results, so I did say it\u2019s just really just a continuation of the development of that column.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yes. Dave, I wanted to see if you can elaborate a more on your thoughts on this longer-term vision perhaps this leaner and meaner Devon with the focus on the STACK and Delaware Basin. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how we should think about how other assets fit into the Devon portfolio as you are thinking about maybe deleveraging through assets sales and particular at Canada?","Dave Hager","Well, thanks Arun. We obviously have a number of strong assets throughout our portfolio. It appears that those will have the greatest development opportunity are going to be the STACK and Delaware Basin. And then to probably a lesser degree and the anticipated price environment and again we\u2019re basing - we\u2019re a thrive in a $45 to $50 well and we\u2019re not counting on higher prices.","So, we are building a company here is kind of succeed and be one of the top companies in the current price environment. And in that world it looks like STACK and Delaware are probably going to lead the way as far as development opportunities on the number of other areas we will have some developments such as Rockies and others are going to be providing more cash flow to the company.","So, we\u2019re on the cusp of really moving into full-field development in the STACK and the Delaware plays and when we do these plays are going to be out absorbed and generate very strong returns. And again, I want to emphasize again, we are a returns oriented organization, we\u2019re not just growing for growth sake, but we think we can generate very strong returns in those plays in this price environment.","If there is any question about the quality of the wells that we\u2019re drilling again I would refer people back to page six of the operations report where we show we have the highest 90 day IP in the industry. So, we can talk 24 hours, you can talk 30 days all that, but when it comes to 90 day, we\u2019re the leader. And we can generate very strong returns from that.","So, as we do, we do see that some of these other areas could potential provide divestiture opportunities that would allow us to further our development in the STACK and Delaware Basin. And I\u2019m not going to go as far as saying what specific it was, because that\u2019s going to or continue to looking at that and we will continue to look. It will be a measure a very thoughtful process, we will be balancing our cash inflows and cash outflows as said and we\u2019re going to use sum for debt repayment to build this fortress balance sheet.","So, beyond now there at this point no further discussion, but obviously we\u2019re going to look at all the key criteria when making that call, but it\u2019s a great position to be in where we have a very strong asset base, we\u2019re executing now IPO very well on that asset base. And we are going to continue to increase the focus of the company.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. That\u2019s great. And just my follow up Dave, in a $45 to $50 world we had been thinking about Devon based on your previous kind of commentary of kind of balancing your internally generated cash flow plus the in-link distributions with your CapEx. Given how you maybe embarking on this asset sale program beyond the 20% sale in the Barnett. Is there a comfort perhaps to spend above that amount with asset sales kind of plugging the delta there.","Dave Hager","In essence yes, is the quick answer to that. Now again we are driven by returns first and we are we only do it if we feel we can generate good returns with the capital that we are deploying. We are confident in that price environment that we can generate good returns in the STACK and Delaware Basin plays. And so depending on these circumstances we would certainly be open to using a portion of divestment proceeds to further development of those plays and then a portion of that to pay down debt to build this strong balance sheet as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator instructions]. Your next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisor.","David Heikkinen","Good morning guys, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question Jackfish one, do you expect similar skim tank issues and inspections ongoing and potential downtime?","Tony Vaughn","David could, we solve a little bit of evidence of the bracket issue in J3 skim tank, we had no detection this time at J1, you also have to remember we have already been in this skim tank at J1 in the previous turnaround. So, we\u2019re really not expecting it to be initially, but we will certainly made the same type of proactive repair work that we did in J2 and J3 while we are in the tank.","David Heikkinen","Okay and then just on the Hobson Row you highlighted that in your 2Q ops report can you talk to all about what the current production is and how it actually contributed to the volume I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of those 39 wells are actually producing?","Jeff Ritenour","Obviously the Hobson Row the key driver behind our growth in STACK this year, we have revamped STACK production by that 20% and that\u2019s largely driven by just the success of the Hobson Row and what we are seeing there and maybe I handed it over to Tony where he can talk about just what we are seeing from the type curves and more importantly how we are going to deploy that success to the Jacobs Row. Tony.","Tony Vaughn","Dave I don\u2019t have a whole lot to add to that. We reported a little bit of the results on the last operating report, the work that we have done so far in this particular quarter has been type curve type results, so we didn\u2019t really highlighted individually, but I will tell you we pumped near 500 million pounds of sand in that work and from an execution perspective the team did outstanding results.","And there is a great partnership between the operating guys and the supply chain guys that we have there, I think Dave mentioned earlier, this is the first area that we decoupled great success there and we think we dropped about 15% of the cost of those that work out of this system just through that operating efficiencies there.","We are very excited about extending the work from the is a normal lateral work that we have historically done and to the long laterals, we got the all the wells completed now, they are all starting to flow back, we will be able to report on those results in the next quarter, but again when we start looking towards the future in this and understanding what the value of the long lateral will bring we think the returns through this development are as competitive as much of what we have in the portfolio.","David Heikkinen","And just on that cost savings. How do you think that will flow through to your future development cost reported in your reserve reports. Should we expect a down or trend and Devon future development cost as you kind of lock in this decoupling of services and just trend deposit?","Dave Hager","Well I think that certainly is a positive driver towards, yeah towards lower F&D now. Obviously as you pursue more oil oriented plays as you well know David those tend to be a little bit F&D type plays in general. But that element would help mitigate to absolutely.","Jeff Ritenour","Yes. One other thing to add on that Dave, real quick is just ultimately as you start heading towards those multi zone developments for the majority of our capital is going to be concentrated going forward and that\u2019s going to be another tailwind as well. So very concentrated capital programs combined at the supply chain, we would expect to show very well in this metric in the upcoming year.","David Heikkinen","Thanks guys.","Scott Coody","Well, I guess it looks like there is no one else in the queue. So, we will wrap up the call today. We appreciate everyone\u2019s interest in Devon. And do you have any other questions feel free to call the IR team anytime and that consisting myself Chris Carr.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Scott Coody","Thank you, and good morning. I hope everyone has had the chance to review our third quarter financial and operational disclosures that were released last night. This data package includes our earnings release, forward-looking guidance and detailed operations report.","With today's call, we are going to slightly modify the format of our prepared remarks. As always, I will cover a few preliminary items. Then our President and CEO, Dave Hager, will provide his thoughts on the strategic direction of Devon. Following Dave, Tony Vaughn, our Chief Operating Officer, is going to cover the key operational highlights for the quarter. And then we will wrap up our prepared remarks with a brief review by Jeff Ritenour, our Chief Financial Officer. Overall, this commentary should last around 15 minutes and then we will open the call to Q&A.","Before moving on, I would like to remind you that comments and answers to questions on the call today will contain plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially. For a review of risk factors related to these statements, please see our Form 10-K.","And with that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Hager.","David Hager","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Scott mentioned, we are making some minor modifications to the format of the call today to provide Tony and Jeff the opportunity to convey key messages and technical insights about their respective areas of business. My comments today will focus on the strategic direction of Devon over the next several years, which we have recently branded as our 2020 vision. The intuitive strategic plan is to accelerate value creation from our advantaged asset base by continuing to deliver industry-leading drill bit results while improving our financial strength. With the 2020 vision, our top objective is to deliver attractive peer-leading returns on invested capital for our shareholders.","While the disciplined pursuit of returns is not new at Devon, our 2020 vision will further refine our focus on maximizing full cycle returns at the corporate level. In fact, at our November board meeting, we will discuss incorporating return-oriented measures into our compensation metrics for the upcoming 2018 budgeting cycle. Our refinement and capital allocation will result in more measured and consistent investment through all cycles, positioning us to more efficiently expand our business over time while optimizing returns. This balanced operating model is in contrast to the industry's historical behavior of aggressively chasing topline growth at the ultimate expense of shareholders. This is not a populist philosophy that we are paying lift service too. We are absolutely committed to doing business differently in the E&P space, and we are taking the appropriate steps to become an industry leader with our disciplined approach to capital allocation. In short, we can lead and we will lead.","While having the right capital allocations critical to achieving our 2020 vision, it is equally important to possess the right asset portfolio and get the most of these assets with superior execution. And at Devon, we are truly advantaged with our world-class acreage positions and the STACK and the Delaware basin. The quality and of these two franchised assets are unmatched in the industry with exposure to more than 30,000 potential drilling locations, concentrated in the economic core of these plays. Not only of the STACK and Delaware basin assets two are the very best positioned plays on the North American cost curve, but Devon\u2019s large, contiguous stacked pay acreage position in these basins provide us a multi-decade growth opportunity. And with this long runway of highly economic opportunities, we are executing at a very high level. Over the past few years, Devon has the top well productivity of any U.S. operator, which is quite an accomplishment in this competitive space. And importantly, with these terrific wells, we are significantly enhancing returns by embracing leading technologies to improve drilling times, optimize completion designs and to increase our base production.","As we continue to advance our development programs and build additional operating scale in the STACK and Delaware basin, the next phase of our 2020 vision is to further high grade our resource-rich portfolio. Given the massive opportunity we have in the STACK and Delaware plays, we see the potential to monetize several billion dollars of less competitive assets within our portfolio in a very thoughtful and measured fashion over the next few years. Potential proceeds from these portfolio rationalization efforts would be balanced between further debt reduction, reinvesting in the core business and returning cash to our shareholders. We expect to emerge with a highly focused asset portfolio and enhance profitability as we transition to a much higher-margin barrel. With our 2020 vision, we also plan to have a fortress balance sheet with a net debt to EBITDA target of 1.0 to 1.5 times by the end of the decade. Overall, these winning characteristic will allow Devon to deliver consistent, competitive and major growth rates along with top tier returns on capital employed.","And lastly, I'll finish my remarks with a few preliminary thoughts on our outlook for 2018. First and foremost, our capital program in the upcoming year is being designed to optimize returns, not production growth. And while we do expect robust growth form our STACK and Delaware assets, this higher return in production growth was simply be an output of our outstanding asset base and strong execution. While we are still working through the details of our budget, we are directionally planning on an upstream budget somewhere in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in 2018. To be absolutely clear, we expect to deliver this capital spend within operating cash flow at $50 TWI and $3 Henry Hub. ","With current strip pricing above this base planning scenario, we have no plans to modify our capital range and we would expect to generate free cash flow. And I cannot emphasize this enough. This disciplined plan will represent a major inflection point for Devon due to a step change and improved capital efficiency as we shift our full field development in the STACK and Delaware basin and we leverage technology to lower our cost structure. With this highly efficient capital program, we expect to bring online more than 25% more development wells in 2018 as compared to the 2017 program. This means both more wells online and a focus on our highest return place.","This high returning capital program is expected to increase oil production in the STACK and Delaware Basin by more than 30% in 2018. We will provide more detailed production guidance on other components of our production mix in the coming months, once we have better insight inside in the planned activity levels for our non-operated Eagle Ford asset. ","And with that, I will turn the call over to Tony Vaughn for additional commentary on our operations.","Tony Vaughn","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. My remarks for today will be focused on a few key operating things that are integral to the success of Devon's 2020 vision. First, the prolific wells we are bringing online lead the industry in well productivity and reflect quality of our underlying asset base our STACK\u2019s operating capabilities and our willingness to deploy cutting-edge technologies across our asset base. ","In the third quarter, the well productivity from our U.S. resources plays was nothing short of outstanding. We commenced production on 50 new wells that achieved 30-day rates of greater than 2,100 BOEs per day. Importantly, we delivered these high-return wells with the capital investment that was below the low end of our guidance range for the third consecutive quarter.","The second key message I want to leave you with today is our capital efficiency will dramatically improve as we transition to fulfill development as we further leverage the technology to maximize performance. With the size and the scale of our STACK and Delaware positions, our top priority is to efficiently comfort the resource associated with these world-class assets into production and cash flow. To maximize the value of these stacked-pay reservoirs, our capital activity is shifting towards low-risk, multi-zone developments to increase capital efficiencies and recoveries on a per-section basis.","Early results from this thoughtful leading-edge development concept were quite positive. At the end of Corner project in the Delaware Basin, which is Devon's first multi-zone development, drilling time has improved 55% compared to historic results in this area. We also attained significant efficiencies due to less smoke times, more repetitive operations, improved productivity from zipper fracs and we achieved supply chain savings by debundling our completion work. Overall, these improvements resulted in capital savings of approximately $1 million per well compared to traditional pad developments.","Also of note, we were able to compress the spud to first production cycle time at Anaconda to only 5.8 months. We will continue to leverage this advantage development scheme with a majority of our capital activity going forward. In fact, we will have several multi-zone projects under development across STACK and Delaware by year end and I fully expect to report more positive results in n this topic next quarter.","And finally, I'm excited about our supply chain efforts underway that will help ensure the certainty of execution with our future multi-zone projects. And as we have discussed at length today, Devon has uniquely positioned to maintain and build operating momentum for the foreseeable future with our STACK and Delaware basin assets. To profitably execute on this massive opportunity, we have integrated teams across Devon proactively securing equipment, crews, materials and takeaway capacity at competitive prices and flexible terms to ensure the resources and capabilities to execute on our capital plans. A recent example of this integrated planning effort was our ability to lock in essentially all sand requirements for our capital programs through 2018 at rates significantly below market. This accomplishment was achieved in a tight market and the advantage rates were secured by sourcing all fine sand requirements from regional sand mines in the southern U.S. Due to substantially lower transportation cost, we expect total delivered cost from our regional stored sand to be around 30% less and the equivalent grades in northern white sand without any degradation in performance. To provide additional flexibility with our operations, we have also secured appropriate amounts of local trans load capacity in both stack and Delaware to further improved final amount of logistics. These are just a few of the many initiatives underway across Devon that will help enhance returns on the capital investment and the uncertainty of our ability to execute on these development projects.","So to summarize, we are building a very progressive culture that emphasizes data-driven decision making and innovation across multi-disciplined teams. This effort is consistently delivering best-in-class drill bet results, improvements in capital efficiency as we shift to multi-zone developments and we have planning efforts underway to ensure certainty of execution with our future activity.","And now, I will turn the call over to Jeff for our financial overview.","Jeff Ritenour","Thanks, Tony. I would like to spend a few minutes today discussing Devon's financial strategy within the context of our 2020 vision and build upon the points made by Dave in his opening comments. A great place to start is with a review of our current financial position. Our upstream currently at $6.9 billion of outstanding debt with no significant maturities prior to 2021. Devon also has excellent liquidity with $2.8 billion of cash on hand and an undrawn credit facility of $3 billion. In the coming months, we expect our financial strengths to be further enhance with the completion of our ongoing divestiture program.","This solid financial position provides a significant optionality as we move forward in pursuit of Devon's 2020 Vision. Our top near-term objective is to fund our operational plants in the STACK and Delaware basin as these early-stage assets transition to fulfill development. Growth in these assets will drive additional operating and capital cost efficiencies along with higher overall margins for the company. This disciplined capital program will be funded directionally with an operating cash flow. In conjunction with funding our capital programs, we are also intent on reducing outstanding debt. As Dave mentioned earlier, a critical component at Devon's 2020 Vision is the commitment to further improve our investment-grade financial strength. By the end of the decade, we expect to improve Devon's leverage metrics from 1.0 to 1.5 times net debt to EBITDA as compared to our current level of just below two times. To be clear, we expect to achieve this goal with a reduction of absolute debt. We are not planning on higher commodity prices to deleverage our business. Given our strong liquidity, the first step in our debt reduction plan will be to utilize a portion of cash on hand to tender for outstanding debt. We will finalize size and timing of our tender after we complete our 2018 capital budgeting process, but we expect to further reduce debt by at least $1 billion over the next year.","Looking beyond 2018, the second phase of our debt reduction plan is tied to the progression of our STACK and Delaware development programs. As these world-class assets build scale and become self-sufficient, we expect to take additional steps to high grade our resource-rich portfolio with the monetization of less competitive assets. Use of proceeds will include additional debt reduction, reinvestment in the core business and the return of cash to our shareholders.","So, in summary, achievement of Devon's 2020 Vision positions the company with a top tier balance sheet in the E&P space, facilitating consistent investment in our assets and optimal returns through all cycles.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott.","Scott Coody","Thanks, Jeff. We will now open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan, your line is open.","Evan Calio","My first question, Dave. I know in your opening comments you talked about prioritizing improving the balance sheet near term to ensure execution under a range of commodity prices and have an active asset program. How do you think about the potential return for cash to shareholders longer term on the back end of your Vision 2020 strategy? I am presuming capital efficiency will be higher in '18 with all bases in development mode and you'll have proceeds of several years\u2019 worth of non-core asset sales on the book. So can you give us kind of color on that the distribution strategy and that maybe longer or medium term period?","David Hager","Evan, yes, that's absolutely something we are considering in a medium and longer term. Our short-term priority is to continue to build scale in the STACK and the Delaware basin and we have really optimized our capital program in 2018 to deliver what we consider the sweet spot of capital spend to deliver with the highest return as we focus our activities one on development activities with increased efficiencies with having higher -- significantly higher number of starts and completions, as I said in opening remarks, 25% or more than we had in 2017 as well as focusing those and the highest return areas in our portfolio. As we build that scale, as we execute on the 2020 Vision with further several billion dollars of divestments, we do see that we will be paying down some debt to build a fortress balance sheet to allow us to certainly withstand any sort of weaker commodity price environment in any reasonable price range. Beyond that, we do see in the medium and long term that we will be in a free cash flow generation plus potentially have proceed from the asset divestitures as those take place and we will be looking returning value to the shareholders in one way or the other. ","Evan Calio","Great. I appreciate that. And second, I know you've introduced the preliminary CapEx guidance range to $2 billion to $2.5 billion is lower than expectations but soon to be looked appeared assume a 4Q run rate or annualized run rate. On the other half of the picture, I believe you mentioned that a 25% more wells on a similar drilling dollar assumption, I mean can you give us kind of a base line of what that's assuming in 2017? I know there were some backlogs\u2026","David Hager","That could somewhere around 240 or so, approximately, wells drilled and completed in 2017. And put simply, Evan, it would be inaccurate to take our Q4 capital run rate and extrapolate that forward to all of 2018. We have a handful of rigs that are working in Q4 in the Rocky -- one in the Rocky, one in the Barnett and a few others tests - few of one-off exploration ideas that will not be active in 2018. And so we will have a higher capital spend rate in Q4 2017 than we will average for each quarter in 2018. And then our efficiency is really just what Tony went through in many ways that we're getting into development drilling, we are realizing efficiencies from that and we are concentrating more of our total E&P capital spend on development drilling. So were getting more efficient, we\u2019re putting more dollars into the development drilling and we're drilling the best return wells. So if you put all three of those factors together, that's why we feel really good about the program not just in 2018 but well beyond 2018. We\u2019re getting in development mode, quite simply and that can continue for a long time.","Evan Calio","That\u2019s great. I think a follow-up to that, to your comments. What percentage of the '18 wells would be drilled on multi-well pads versus 2017? I think I missed that.","Tony Vaughn","Evan, it is something about two-thirds of our program in '18 will be on these multi-zone projects. And I think a good readout on what Dave was talking about is really to go back and dissect the results that we had on really a serial number one, which was our Anaconda project in the Delaware Basin, and there we were able to reduce cost some 20% on a per-well basis just through the efficiency gains from these multi-zone concept.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bob Morris from Citi. Bob, your line is open.","Bob Morris","I mean, you mentioned focusing on the STACK and the Delaware but perhaps the best returns on a limited programs that they have been in the pad of River Basin and the Rockies. How does that fit into your program next year? And do you have the scale there or the runway to be able to accelerate that or it would be more there or how do you think about that within your portfolio?","David Heikkinen","Well, you are right, Bob. We've drilled some really nice wells that\u2019s still early on in the Powder River Basin, but that certainly provides additional strength and optionality to the overall portfolio. I'll let Tony detail out the potential 2018 plans, but we're proud of what we've done so far and we have a lot of acreage that we have yet to evaluate there. It looks like we focused primarily in a shorter term on the turner as we described in the operations reports. But Tony want to detail it out a little further.","Tony Vaughn","Well, just to add on what Dave said, Bob, we are doing some really outstanding work. You are seeing the returns on that. We have historically been focused on some of the shallow conventional horizons from the Teapot and Parkman and those offer some of the best returns we have seen, essentially 95% overall stream. Now we are bringing on some of our turner wells. We think this is a more unconventional type play in the basin, perhaps a little bit more ubiquitous across our position. We have got a substantial permit there. In fact, we picked up about 100-plus permits from the Casper BLM office, which is quite unusual in terms of the pace of permits being approved. So we have got the capacity to stand up additional rigs and repeat high-quality results. It's going to be a matter of going through the budgeting process this year and allocating capital to the best opportunities we have.","Bob Morris","And how do you think about your footprint there? Is it somewhere that you think you could expand your footprint of all these tests working the different formations? Or is there enough running room there to really make this a core party out of portfolio?","David Heikkinen","Bob, we have got 400-plus thousand acres in Powder, so we think we have got the position that we wanted. You just really map out what would classified as Tier 1, it's something less than the 400,000 acres, but we have got a substantial portion of that locked up in between our position, our legacy position that we had on the north end of our play in Campbell County to the south end of our newly acquired position in Converse County. There is some good work going on by EOG and into the south. There is some other good work going on by just speaking of few others. So we are really in the heart of the play and has the position that we like there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Ryan your line is open.","Ryan Todd","Maybe if I could ask one on each of your key core plays. In the Permian, it was a -- I guess starting out, what's the early impression. You mentioned you drilled a three-mile lateral, any comments on what you saw there as a three-mile lateral potential for that to become a larger part of the program going forward within the multi zone development plans?","David Heikkinen","You bet, Ryan. We are flowing that well backward, we don\u2019t have the 30 days behind us to report on that. You will hear from us next quarter, but we are quite pleased with the results of what you have today. So really on an \u201copportunity going forward basis,\u201d we got a three mile lateral in Delaware. We also are in the process of preparing the flow back in three mile in the stacked play as well. I don\u2019t know that this will displace all the 2 mile laterals that we are working on and established. There is going to be some unique footprint opportunities that allow us to go to 3 miles and I think these first two wells are proving and giving us confidence that from an operational perspective. We can drill complement and flow back and a high quality well in 3 miles.","Ryan Todd","Any ideas on extending the 3 mile lateral and the stack as well or are you keeping the Permian for now?","David Heikkinen","No, we got -- we are flowing back -- preparing to flow back our first 3 mile lateral in the STACK play right now. It\u2019s early, so I can't report on that. But mechanically, the drilling operation went extremely well, very cost efficient to do this. We traded all of the way to the toe of the well and we are preparing to flow that well back. So there is going to be some opportunities to fill in on our footprint to 3 mile concept, but a lot of our position is going to be more relegated to the 2 mile laterals.","Ryan Todd","And then maybe another follow-up on the STACK, a couple of things. In the [cleaner] pie that was clearly the strong results, can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you learned on staking there and in the upper Meramac? And then you also said that was assigned winder in all new wells you're moving a little further, kind of pushing the boundary, is that further to the north and even to the east? Can you talk about maybe what you've seen in terms of the extent of the core of the play as you tested the boundaries a little bit?","Tony Vaughn","Ryan, we're pleased with the work that we're doing. I think you saw the report out on Fleenor work there and we're quite pleased with that. I think what we are trying to highlight there is while we got an exceptional flow back results on the flinger wells, we did this with a different cost structure than what we had historically done. And ones that simply the cost going from the [indiscernible] anything about that, but it really is really associated with the modified completion design. So we're pleased with the work that we're doing on the east side of the play. I think, if you look at our '18 work, we're going to start moving that to the north and west portion of the play. We're going to -- in fact we've already spread our second multi-zone project that we call the Coyote on the Northwest side of the play, and we've piloted some wells around there that we're quite pleased will be reporting on we'll be reporting on that in some time soon as well.","David Heikkinen","And Ryan, just to add a few more details there to Tony's comments, that was the Fleenor pilot was a stagger test within the Meramac 200. So in that area, that's the thickest zone, and so ultimately we were trying trying to maximize recoveries in that very prosperous area, so once again very successful and we'll deploy those learnings to just the next multi-zone projects that we have, so just once again you're constantly retooling what you're doing and that's just going to be an input as we head towards -- show in other projects, so.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Go ahead, your line is open.","Doug Leggate ","So, Dave, obviously this is little bit of a change from the cash inflow versus operating cash flow, I guess, that's the subtlety of your vision 2020. So I guess my question is as you focus on the two core areas given I guess the increase in inventory what does it say about the asset sales definition in terms of what becomes noncore? And I'm specifically thinking about Tony's comments around the potter, because obviously while the returns are great the scale is not relative to the other areas. So does that become a for-sale asset and just maybe some color on your thinking around scale and timing of executing our program?","David Heikkinen","Well, first off, you're right. We have made a subtle change what we say live within our cash flow from operations, and the reason for that is simply the strength that we're seeing both in terms of the capital efficiency that we're able to achieve as well as the returns we're able to achieve when we're focusing even more dollars into development side and in our highest return areas. So it's really a very good new story that we are been able to spend lower capital dollars live within operating cash flow and deliver the kind of returns that we're which again we're focused on returns on production growth but we'll see strong production growth as a result. Now as more specifically to the Powder River Basin, it's still early days in the Powder River Basin. We like the optionality that the Powder River Basin provides. We see that the on a go-forward basis, as Tony said, we will be focusing more of our activity on the turner and we really need to see a more results from the turner to really understand was some certainly how does it compete for capital versus the STACK and the Delaware plays. So we have a lot of optionality around and we have said we will divesting several million dollars of additional assets. It is because of the incredible strength of our portfolio that we have a lot of optionality that may come from. We are certain that we are going to have areas throughout our portfolio that someone could come in and drill development wells that will achieve returns well above the cost of capital but not as good as we're going to get in our poor plays. So that gives us a lot of optionality around where we decide to do those divestments from, and we haven't made a final decision on that and maybe one area or maybe a combination of acreage from a number of areas, but we are absolutely committed, though, to the vision that we have is just with the how we execute that vision we're still talking about.","Doug Leggate ","My follow-up, Dave, it might be for you or might be for Jeff but it really goes to the net debt to EBITDA target and the relationship with EnLink I guess is the broader question. In years gone by, you did sell down a little bit of EnLink that\u2019s stopped obviously, but when you look at net debt, obviously you are consolidating EnLink debt, but you\u2019re going to be going strictly intellectual about it, deconsolidating handling with also like the marketable securities and your definition of corporate net debt the recourse to Devon level? Sorry, for the lengthy question, I guess, but what\u2019s trying to understand is what is our future relationship with EnLink? Like how does it factor into that net-debt target and do you look at it on a just Devon basis as oppose to the consolidated EnLink basis now we do there? Thanks.","Jeff Ritenour","Doug, this is Jeff. Yes, we think about it on and the targets that we've outlined are based on a Devon\u2019s standalone basis. So we are not including the EnLink debt or the EnLink EBITDA in that calculation. ","Doug Leggate ","What about the handling to equity as marketable securities?","Jeff Ritenour","That is not included in the calculation either. Yes, if you are asking if we\u2019ve reduced the debt for the value of the EnLink securities, we are not.","Doug Leggate ","Okay, that's very clear. As far as your relationship with EnLink goes going forward?","David Heikkinen","Well, I can just add from a strategic level. First off, we like the relationship very much and we think they are doing an outstanding job and particularly supporting us in one of our key development areas in the STACK but also every area where we have common operations. So we like the relationship strategically. Now whether we would ever consider a sell-downs or not, that\u2019s certainly not on the table at this point. I would never rule it out. As there is always an option that we have out there where we certainly have no current plans around that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Grego [ph] from Macquarie. Paul, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Dave, focusing on your comments around changes to management incentives, what should we expect on those changes? You mentioned that drilling rate of return as a potential metric, has there been a consideration for corporate returns level metrics like and RACE and then for any growth metrics will they be measured on a debt adjusted per share basis?","David Heikkinen","Let me start this answer off then ask Jeff to fill in on the details he can give. Again, we have not made a decision on this. We need to discuss this with our board and make a final decision, but this give you our preliminary thoughts that we will be taking to our board. The first comment I just want to make is we fully acknowledge that our industry in general has not delivered acceptable returns and we are absolute -- and I would include Devon in that, and we are absolutely committed on a go-forward basis to deliver acceptable returns at the corporate level to our shareholders, and that\u2019s what this effort is all about is to make sure that we are delivering on that. We are focusing our capital program in order to be able to accomplish it. We have the asset base and we have the execution do it, but we are fully committed to provide one the right incentives internally to make sure that we deliver on that, and second, the transparency as best we can to the shareholders so that they can measure our effectiveness of doing this. And as I said in the opening comments, we have the ability to lead in this area and we intend to lead it. So Jeff, can you maybe talk a little more detail about a couple of the metrics that we are considering at this point. And again, there is no final decision we will give you our thought process.","Jeff Ritenour","Yes, that\u2019s right. As Dave said, it\u2019s certainly something that we are still in discussion with our board about - well, we are going to lay out the spectrum of all the usual suspects that you would expect as it relates to these metrics. If I had to put them into two buckets, I would say one bucket is probably closer to a gap metric. So things like ROCE, or a cash return on capital employed, the benefit there obviously is the transparency and the ease of calculation to those metrics directly off the financial statements, and then maybe a second bucket which is frankly what we think is probably closer to the reality of our returns on our capital program each year, which is more of an all end-- again a corporate return, all in capital -- not just drilling capital but all capital split by the company in any given year and then the future cash flows obviously that\u2019s going to be generated from that capital spend. That one, again as I said is we think, it's probably the better metric; however, it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to provide the level of transparency I think that you and the investor of the universe would like to see. So we are waving and balancing each of those different options. We will discuss that with the board as Dave said later this month and hopefully lane on a conclusion. I will add as you mentioned Paul, our analysis and our historical look at all these different metrics continues to suggest that a debt adjusted per share metric is the most highly correlated with equity returns in this space. So I certainly think that whatever we land on we will have a flavor of that.","David Heikkinen","And again, just to be clear, on that second major that Jeff talked about which is our rate of return metric, we are thinking in terms of birding that as much as we can with all other cost we incur within the corporation, so you are getting that even though it's based on wells, it is really burden with all the costs that corporation, so look at more of a total corporate return from our capital program.","Unidentified Analyst","And then I guess as follow-up to that. How do you guys consider the role of hedging as well as exploration within the 2020 vision and bouncing against both annual corporate return is well a longer run, ROIC or corporate return metric?","Tony Vaughn","First in regard to exploration. We are certainly in a great position where we have such a strong development inventory as we have right now. So there is not the need in the short term for exploration in order to accomplish certainly the 2020 vision. Now if you look at longer term for the company, I think that you always have to be mindful that some level of exploration should be thought about in order to have a long-term sustainable company. But certainly in the next few years the amount of capital that will be dedicated to exploration is going to be less than you might normally think for a company of our size. Now with regards to hedging, we think that hedging is an important part of the overall company business in order to make sure that we're delivering consistent results. We also think it's important to give us confidence around the cash flow that we're going to have in a given year in order to execute it our capital program. We have designed our hedging program for hedging out approximately a third of our volumes in the given year on just what we would call a systematic basis where we just take the existing prices in the market and hedge forward for a number of quarters on that basis. And then we intend to roughly get around 50% overall hedge with the other 16%, 17% or whatever, and could very little bit from that but somewhere around that, on more an opportunistic basis. And we certainly with the strength that we've seen in the market recently that we're opportunistically hedging as we speak.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott, your line is open.","Scott Hanold","One follow-up question on the EnLink, the response you've provided. Can you tell us incrementally what other strategic benefits are there to be joined up within EnLink. Do you have most of developments -- midstream developments done that you need in the STACK or is there still a lot of wood out there?","David Heikkinen","There is still midstream development that\u2019s ongoing. As we speak, we're certainly getting into the development program, but there certainly is build out quite a bit of midstream infrastructures still in front of us. And obviously, the hooking up up very large number of wells on a timely basis, it's important to delivering our returns.","Scott Hanold","So certainly through '18 and maybe into '19 strategic business revision would be joined, is that fair?","David Heikkinen","No, I think that's certainly true, yes, there's a benefit there.","Scott Hanold","And my follow-up question would be related to again this thought on looking at being a little bit more balanced then potentially free cash flow positive in the future, and I think you guys made a point this year of really ramping up activity especially in the STACK and Delaware, for efficiency purpose. And so those -- obviously those areas are at cash flow deficit. I would imagine at the field level, can you just generally discuss when you look at -- the future monetization strategy would you look to really do that once those assets can support themselves because I think right now some of your -- the mature assets that don't get capital are actually free cash flow generative for those areas?","Jeff Ritenour","Scott, this is Jeff. That's exactly right. I mean, I think the way we're thinking about it internally is we'd like to see the STACK and Delaware assets to get to a more mature level. They\u2019re relatively immature today in our portfolio, just by the nature of the assets, but as Tony described with the multi-zone development that we're going to head into much bigger way here in 2018, the capital efficiency and the cost efficiency that we're going to see in those assets, we expect them to reset kind of self-sufficiency point in the not too distant future and that will give us the confidence to embark upon a broader divestiture program that Dave described in his opening comments.","Scott Hanold","Okay, so that's self sufficiency point is probably in line with what you talk around the 2020 vision of modernizations is that right?","Jeff Ritenour","Yes, that's right. I mean we certainly would expect to reach that point, again, assuming a commodity price environment of going to 50 in three environment but within our 2020 time frame. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram","Just perhaps the follow-up on that question, are there assets today outside of the Delaware and STACK that you have considered as core or perhaps you can describe the attributes of the assets that you think will remain in the portfolio and along basis?","David Heikkinen","Well, the key attribute that we would look at is do they compete for capital in our portfolio and is there additional value that we can create by if there are development opportunities that may not compete in our portfolio, but that we could be paid for some of that upside from that development opportunity by someone else. And so we will be looking at areas that and certainly all of our areas we feel what you are talking about the Eagle Ford, you are talking about Barnett the pattern they have some element and there may even be areas within the STACK and Delaware on a much smaller scale basis that we may not get to. They are not absolutely core to us, but that we could look at divestment? Or these are not going to be large scale numbers but they are probably somewhere within those basins as well that not going to necessarily meet our return requirements just cause are the very high return capability of so many of our development opportunities. So that's the key thing that we'd be looking at is we think the bulk of the value creation that we do in the company is when we can deploy capital a returns it's very far above the cost of capital and that's what we do in our key development areas. If we aren\u2019t doing that and we aren\u2019t going to fund and perhaps someone else will see an opportunity there and pay us for the part of that opportunity.","Arun Jayaram","And my follow-up, I just wanted to check or had a housekeeping question on Jackfish. Just given the improvement in oil prices, do you expect any of those projects to reach a threshold where the royalties would increase in 2018, and also wanted to see if there is any turnaround scheduled at any of the three Jackfish projects in 2018?","Tony Vaughn","Arun, this is Tony. We do have -- we are working a turnaround one per year. So you saw us go through J3 and then previous to that J2, did a little bit of maintenance on J2 this year, so we will be back to a turnaround on J1 in summer of '18. We don\u2019t expect a royalty change in 2018.","Arun Jayaram","Then that change at all to given any of the three projects in '18?","Tony Vaughn","No.","Jeff Ritenour","And Arun, just a real quick just to provide some color there is obviously Jackfish one is post payout. That's been post payout for quite some time. Jackfish 2 and Jackfish 3 are pre payout, and based off current strip pricing, we wouldn\u2019t expect those to be have any meaningful adjustments in royalty factors on that front until next decade.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy. David, your line is open.","David Heikkinen ","The highlights kind of in the release around a projected NPV uplift upgraded that 40% as you look forward to the STACK and Delaware kind of caught our eye, but can you help us understand kind of to find the starting point for where the NPV is in the STACK now and then how the 40% or more is there, and then same thing for the Delaware\u2019s starting point so kind of know where you are going on that uplift for the multi-zone development?","Tony Vaughn","Dave, this is Tony. The comment about the 40% uplift in BB10 is really in comparison to a typical historic four or six-well pad. That\u2019s just the delta that we see in front of us by utilizing this multi-zone concept. As we have mentioned before, we already saw 20% of the cost come out of the first project in the Delaware basin. We really haven\u2019t even optimized in my mind the opportunity in front of us. And you are starting to see the concept of more batch operations utilizing sputter rigs to get the surface whole drilled followed by the conventional drilling rig to drill the production string. And the utilization, the centralized production facilities that will be equipped to handle production from multi pads have a drill to field type concept is a substantial boost. So if you just look at the typical work process and the game chart, this is the way that we are lining out all components of that and give you order to magnitude. When you take a rig on typical Delaware basin well, you take the rig and move it to another pad to couple of miles away. It's an additional 3.5 days of nonproductive time until you are back moving a bit. And simply skating over for a multi-wheel pad, you have got about a half a day of down time. So this is the type of work that we think is something we have been planning and talking about for two years. We are just now coming into this space, and again we think it\u2019s a game-changer for the type of contiguous multi-zone switch spot type projects that we have.","David Heikkinen ","I guess I'm going to try a little harder. So if I think about a four or six well pad, I mean if we just think about NPV per well of kind of $15 million to $20 million bucks and you get 40% more than that on each set of four to six wells, in fact how it ends up flowing, I'm trying to get the hard numbers on the where the four to six well pads would have been, and this an NPV, incremental NPV beyond invested capital?","Scott Coody","David, this is Scott. A lot of numbers float around there and I think ii Ill honestly that I have a spreadsheet that it\u2019d be very happy to walk through at my desk after the call. So just to maybe keep a little bit harsh strategic questions so that I can handle later on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Jeff, your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell","We have got a lot of capital allocation questions, so I thought to stick to a couple that are more we do with field. So I'm looking at the operation support. I just want to referring to Slide 16, it shows number of interesting multi-zone projects with beginning with that condo at the top going down in the due, so I was just wondering because -- particularly because there is a number of different zones and multiple interval of all these different projects. So any of these -- anything that you would still consider to be a delineation or project or a testing zone interference or anything in any way I wouldn't want to call exploratory, but something of that nature, are these all just purely development projects at this point for efficiency?","David Heikkinen","These are all development projects, and we've done a lot of pilot work over the last couple of years, we feel like we have a really good understanding of the lateral space and requirements for the different zones that we work in. We're continuing to gain more insight into the vertical connectivity. When you go into the Delaware Basin for instance, you've got about a dozen different known commercially productive horizons there. There's a pilot work we've established what we believe to be zones that are pressure dependent on each other and some that are independent of each other. So we're utilizing that knowledge to really focus here on what we consider to be the high-return, low-risk development projects in front of us. That doesn't mean to say that we're not going to do a little bit of a spacing work or test zone in a column that we know to be pressure in communication with the rest of the column. We're going to complete a little bit of that will happen. But for the most part in the Delaware Basin for 2018, you'll see about 90-plus percent -- maybe 95% of our capital spend will be on development.","Jeffrey Campbell","And then returning to TRP, just earlier in the discussion it was mentioned that you guys have a very large acreage position there, but I'm just curious -- I think I understood Dave to said that going forward this is really going to be a concentration on the turn and of course you have the Super Mario project area laid out. So I am wondering is as you really hone in on the return going forward, will it still contain enough resource to support a core play as well results pan out and what I'm thinking is illustration on Page 17 kind of shows that the Parkman, the Teapot, the Turner. They all seem to do sort of discreet in different portions of the acreage.","Tony Vaughn","You're a little bit right. Now there are some vertical opportunities in the Turner. There's a couple of different zones in the Turner that we look at, and there's a portion of the footprint here that'll have the traditional mulita-zone potential but not like you see in the Delaware Basin, but I would tell you that in addition to the key department Turner that we talked about there's a lot of activities that's happening in the deeper horizons, the Niobrara is the source rock here. But there are some results happening just south of our footprint in the Niobrara. We got about eight producing Niobrara wells on our footprint that we acquired a couple of years ago, and on the per foot basis even though the wells the laterals were very short laterals and probably not frac with the knowledge that we have today, they're encouraging. And so if you look at the Niobrara being ubiquitous across the play source rock there, moving that into a commercial development over the next few years would be a step change for the Powder. So there's some other zones that both Devon and other some of our peers are pursuing outside of the Turner and the Parkman.","David Heikkinen","Another way to describe it too is if you look at Page 18, you can see clearly the potential does exists there and the Turner was about 400 or so high quality locations, potential -- and this is very early on in the spacing test and weather is going to play out. That way but that area could be significant, the other thing you have to think about too, and I'm not saying would or wouldn't consider this for monetization outside of some core area we defined in the pattern but you also want to know what's your potentially monetizing and what you have potentially given up and what their right value for that is to. And so even though - and one of you -- and Tony described some potential, for instance , in the it is still exist up there and you want to have some idea for what that potential truly is in order to make sure you are getting the proper value for the shareholders before you would consider that.","Jeffrey Campbell","I mean I think that's a great point, and if I could just follow-up it's just first time I'm aware that you guys are talking about the Niobrara, one word just to have something to visualize. We are thinking about some areas that might the potential to have a DJ Basin type of setup where there is and A and B and the C or is it kind of essentially be one extra zone that could be added to the Turner or suff0x or whatever else you might mess around with?","Tony Vaughn","I think it's too early to define that. I know the B and the C have been tested in the Basin , ut I'd say for our particular area we are doing to be some work in 2018 and start to understanding that and we've got a good technical team just map this southern port the southern work that has been ongoing and there is some new work that\u2019s just north of thus that it is also helping us connect the docs in activity. So a little bit early to define what this might look like.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jamal [Indiscernible] from KPH & Company.","Unidentified Analyst ","I know it's been touched on a little bit but just wanted to talk about the spending at operating cash flow again and if it's to be implied that this handling distribution are going to be used to cover the dividend and also just wanted to think about the delta between handling distribution, which are quite a bit higher than a dividend and how you all the think about that as that as they continues to pick up?","Jeff Ritenour","Jamal, this is Jeff again. Yes, you\u2019re exactly right. As Dave mentioned earlier, several difference and how we've described our going forward game plan which is to spin within operating cash flow, so that would meet the handling distributions would be on top of that. But as you pointed, out we do have a dividend and the EnLink distributions more than offset that. So we are still between the two with that some incremental cash available. ","Unidentified Analyst ","And then just quickly one to talk on at the Jacob's pad, that was whether mix in this release just kind of one to think off your updated thoughts in terms of development in 2018 for that pad specially given some of the ongoing spacing incurred by your partner?","David Heikkinen","Yes, I think we're anxious to see some of the spacing test just south of our Jacob's and Lou. I think that's going to be very informative for us to continue to design work on our particular project. We've actually engineered the Jacob's project we've continued we are thinking about deferring that outside of the 2018 capital program. Most of that thought process is really because the Merrimack and the STACK work were doing right now is so commercial and prolific. And so it's the Jacob's and the Woodford are now getting displaced by the Merrimack type opportunities from a return perspective, and as we've mentioned before, we're setting up these multi-zone developments in the in both in the STACK and Delaware. In fact, we have about 29 known projects identified that will get us through the next couple of years on these two basins alone. So we got it engineered and slavered as it competes but right now it's we are finding that we have got other opportunities that have higher returns that we will displace that.","Jeff Ritenour","And that\u2019s some pretty important data that our partner and this development is going to be obtaining from their spacing test. It\u2019s a pretty dramatic down-spacing with their testing there and if that works so we certainly want to know that before we commence on this Jacobs annually development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Biju Perincheril from Susquehanna.","Biju Perincheril","Jeff, just a quick follow-up question on the Fleenor pilot. Is that the two wells in the 200-zone testing should have the optimum landing point? Or in that area, do you have sort of enough thickness to have two separate wells within the 200 zone?","Jeff Ritenour","This is really testing the landing zone is the primary purpose of the test, and again, this is a staggered approach. We have seen some advantages by staggering even within the same specific interval. That just to settle difference tends to provide a better performance from the offset well. So it was really a landing zone with a staggered concept, and then again we slightly modified our completion design there which really moved about $200,000 out the completion and still got the results that we posted here.","Biju Perincheril","And those completion improvements, is that is replicated STACK or not. Is there any of that built into the 2018 sort of preliminary plans you\u2019ve provided?","Jeff Ritenour","It will be. It\u2019s a data point that we have here, so we will continue to work that. It happens to be with some of the product that we use during our completion process. So we got a data point now that was positive and will continue to better understand that. But those are the subtle opportunities that we are seeing across the board. We have got a culture of innovation in the company that frankly we haven\u2019t seen to-date that are exploring every component of our business, and it\u2019s a some nation of a lot of settle changes like this that\u2019s really heading up until that present value up-list, perhaps 40% on these type of projects.","Scott Coody","We\u2019re now at the top of the hour and there are several still in our queue. So if we did not hit your question today, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out Investor Relations team at any time today, which is obviously consisting with myself and Chris Carr. But we appreciate your interest in Devon and we will talk to you next time. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to Devon Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2012 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Vincent White","Thank you and welcome everybody to today's fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings call and webcast. Today's call will follow our usual format. I will cover a few preliminary items and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels. John will provide an overview of our 2012 results and his thoughts on the year ahead, and then Dave Hager, Head of Exploration and Production, will provide an update on Devon's reserves activity and operations. Following that, our CFO, Jeff Agosta, will finish up with a review of our financial results as well as specific guidance for 2013. After Jeff's discussion we'll of course have a Q&A session. And I want to remind everybody that our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols, as well as Darryl Smette, the Head of Marketing, Midstream and Supply Chain, they are both with us today. As usual we'll respect your schedule and conclude the call after one hour.Later today we will file a Form 8-K that will provide specific detailed forecast for all of our operating items as well as our capital budget for 2013. The guidance section of our website will contain a copy of that 8-K and other forward-looking estimates that we mention in the call today To access that guidance, just click on the guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of the Devon website.Please note that all references today to our plans, forecast, expectations and estimates are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities laws and are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. You could see a discussion of the risk factors relating to these estimates in our Form 10-K. Also in today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we use these measures, we're required to provide related disclosures. Those can be found on Devon's website.Before I turn over the call to John, I want to comment on the $896 million property impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter. This resulted principally from the full-cost accounting ceiling test. It is a non-cash impairment charge and it resulted from the decline in natural gas and NGL\u2019s prices over the past 12 months. Just to be clear, this write-down is simply an accounting exercise and is not reflective of the fair value of our assets. The impairment charge has no impact on cash flow, cash balances or credit agreements and is not indicative of the future cash flows we expect to generate from our assets. It\u2019s worth noting that this charge is not unique to Devon. Several companies in our industry have taken these impairment charges throughout 2012.When you exclude the impairment charge and the other items that analysts typically don\u2019t put in their estimates, our non-GAAP earnings and cash flow for the fourth quarter was $0.78 and $3.11 respectively per diluted share. Both these results exceeded street expectations by a comfortable margin.At this point I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Richels.John Richels","Thank you, Vince. Good morning everyone. \u00a02012 was a year of achievement and challenges for Devon. While weak price realizations definitely hurt our financial results for the year, we continued to make significant progress towards the conversion of our portfolio to higher margin oil production.We drove 2012 oil production up 20%, more than offsetting declines in natural gas. In fact, production from our North American asset base climbed to an all-time record of 250 million oil equivalent barrels. This production growth was led by year over year Permian Basin oil production growth of 31%.With the aggressive transition of our product mix, liquids production has now reached nearly 40% of our total volumes at yearend. We have also significantly increased our development inventory in the Permian through our successful Bone Spring and Delaware programs. Over the past year, our risk resource from these two plays has more than doubled.In 2012 we also successfully entered into two exploration based joint ventures that are delivering nearly $4 billion in value to the company. This included $1.3 billion in upfront cash payments, along with $2.6 billion of future drilling carries that will fund 70% of Devon\u2019s drilling costs in our new venture plays over the next couple of years.While the upfront cash payments alone more than compensated us for our acreage and early exploration costs, these transactions also significantly improved the capital efficiency of our go-forward programs.Our exploration work on the joint venture assets is delivering very promising results in the Mississippian play in Oklahoma, the WolfCamp and Cline Shale in the Permian Basin and in various oil plays in the Rockies. In aggregate, Devon has exposure to over 1 million net acres in these plays.On the liquidity front, our balance sheet remains in terrific shape and continues to be one of the strongest in the peer group. At December 31, we had $7 billion of cash and short term investments and a net debt to cap ratio of only 18%. This position of strength helps us comfortably fund our transition through an oilier production mix.And finally, with the 2012 capital program weighted towards oil projects, we had strong growth in oil reserves. Our oil reserve additions reached almost 260% of 2012 oil production. Dave will provide more details on the results of our 2012 capital program later on in the call.Looking now to this year\u2019s activity, given the pricing environment we\u2019re facing in 2013, our capital program is designed to enhance capital efficiency by concentrating spending in core development regions and derisking our joint venture acreage while significantly reducing investments related to acreage capture. We expect our E&P capital expenditures in 2013 to decline by more than 25% to a range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. This includes $200 million for routine leasehold acquisitions, which is roughly $1 billion less than the spend rate in 2012. ","Even with our reduced E&P budget for 2013, we expect to maintain drilling activity levels similar to that of last year. This is a result of significantly higher drill-bit activity on our joint venture projects where our partners will fund most of the total well cost. In 2012, the benefit from our drilling carries amounted to approximately $400 million, and for 2013 that benefit will climb to around $1 billion. We will also have a very active year expanding our midstream business. In 2013, we plan to invest around $1 billion to finish our plant expansions in the Barnett and Cana, roughly double the capacity of our access pipeline in Canada, construct a new gas processing \u00a0facility in the Ferrier area of Western Alberta, and build out infrastructure in the Mississippian play and in the Permian Basin.Total capital spending for 2013 after you include the midstream capital, E&P capital, capitalized G&A and interest and corporate capital, is expected to come in somewhere between $6.4 billion and $7 billion. The majority of our 2013 E&P dollars will be devoted to oil driven development projects. This focus will translate into oil production growth in the mid-teens over 2012. Our oil production growth in 2013 should come almost entirely from light, sweet crude in the U.S., which is expected to grow roughly 40% over 2012 levels.The aggressive development of the Permian basin will be supplemented by the early stage development of the Mississippian. On the liquids-rich side of the portfolio, we will limit drilling to only the most economic liquids-rich portions of our Barnett and Cana fields. This activity will generate NGLs production growth in the range of around 10% to 15%. And lastly, similar to years in the recent past, we will not pursue dry gas drilling during 2013. The lack of investment in dry gas will lead to year-over-year natural gas declines of about 8% to 10%.Summing up our forecasted production. On an energy equivalent BOE basis, we expect production to be essentially flat versus 2012. However, given the sustained divergence in the value of oil and natural gas, it's become pretty obvious to just about everyone that the energy equivalent BOE conversion rate of 6:1 has been rendered meaningless from an economic perspective. Based on the current price realizations of our oil and gas mix, a value or price equivalent is a much more meaningful way to evaluate growth in the value of a hydrocarbon stream.From this perspective, applying a relatively conservative oil to natural gas price ratio of 20:1 to the midpoint of our 2013 production guidance, yields 7% overall growth for the year. Now let's switch gears a little bit. Over the past year, Devon's stock price performance has clearly been a source of frustration for us as well as for our shareholders. The headwinds that we faced in 2012 were principally the result of our product mix and weak price realizations for natural gas, natural gas liquids and Canadian oil. Those three products, together comprised over 90% of our production. However, independent of these depressed price realizations, it's been noted by us, by many of our shareholders and by other industry observers, that Devon's current stock price does not adequately reflect the underlying value of our assets.For those of you who have followed Devon over the years, you know that we have never hesitated to make bold moves to unlock value or to return capital to our shareholders. For example, at times in the past when conditions were right, we have been very active sellers. In fact in the last decade, we sold more than $18 billion of assets at very favorable prices including the assets that we disposed in the strategic repositioning of our company to focus on the North American onshore business. We also executed highly favorable and innovative joint ventures to improve our capital efficiencies and mitigate exploration risk. And over the same period, we bought back almost 25% of our common stock which is more than any other independent in this sector. And finally, we have increased our dividend almost every year since 2004.In 2013, our board will once again look at the prospect of increasing our dividend. As we move forward, I can assure you that in addition to continuing to work to increase the oil weighting in our production mix, we are examining and considering any and every initiative to unlock value that makes sense from a long term value creation perspective.While we\u2019re not investing because assets do not currently compete effectively for capital within our portfolio, we\u2019re considering how we might monetize or bring forward the value associated with those assets. Similarly, if we have assets that we do not believe are being appropriately reflected in our stock price, we\u2019re working to determine how that value might be realized or more appropriately reflected in our stock. However, anything we do must be thoughtful and smart and must enhance long term value. We will not pursue a short lived bump in the stock price at the expense of sustained value creation. But I can absolutely assure you that we will leave no stone unturned in looking for true value creation opportunities.One potential opportunity that appears to have promise is the creation of a Midstream Master Limited Partnership. Now those of you who have followed us for some time may recall that we came very close to creating an MLP for our midstream business in 2007. Prior to completing that transaction, we determined that capital markets were not right at that time to generate meaningful accretion for our shareholders. However, many things have changed. Today, capital markets are deeper, yields in the MLP market are lower and structural enhancements have occurred that have caused us to reexamine whether moving midstream assets into an MLP may make sense. We\u2019ve now retained investment bankers and specialized legal counsel to assist in that evaluation. That\u2019s just one example of the opportunities that we\u2019re actively considering and evaluating to unlock value in our company.So in summary, we remain committed to our top strategic objective and that is optimizing long term growth and cash flow per share adjusted for debt. To meet this objective in 2013, we will aggressively invest in oil driven projects while letting gas volumes decline. We simply refuse to compromise value by funding projects with low rates of return to deliver topline growth based on near meaningless energy equivalency metrics.Our capital programs continue to drive strong production growth rates on the oil side of our business while simultaneously expanding our oil resource base to provide future growth. This is evidenced by both the significant expansion of our development inventory in the Permian and the ongoing exploration and derisking of our emerging oil plays.So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Hager. Dave?David Hager","Thanks John. Good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start with a quick review of the impact of our 2012 capital program on reserves. Overall, proved reserves of oil, gas and NGLs totaled 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent on December 31. Drill-bit reserve additions and by drill-bit I\u2019m referring to discoveries, extensions and performance revisions, totaled $381 million BOE or over 150% of our 2012 production.Not surprisingly, the largest contributors to these reserve additions were from our core development areas, the Permian, Jackfish, Cana and the Barnett. It\u2019s also worth noting that we did not achieve these results by significantly increasing our pad count. We ended the year with just 28% of our total proved reserves classified as proved undeveloped. This is obviously very low compared to industry norms.These reserve additions were achieved with drill-bit capital $7.5 billion. This includes $7.1 billion of E&P capital plus capitalized G&A and interest. This gives us an F&D cost just under $20 per energy equivalent BOE. As John mentioned, we received $1.3 billion of cash proceeds upon our closing our Sinopec and Sumitomo joint venture agreements. If you net the $1.3 billion of cash proceeds against our drill-bit capital, our drill-bit F&D costs come down to about $16 per BOE in 2012, a very competitive result.Revisions related to price reduced our companywide proved reserves by 171 million BOE. This is entirely due to the impact of lower natural gas and NGL prices in North America over the past 12 months. Lower prices reduce the theoretical economic life of some gas and liquid-rich gas projects, thereby decreasing proved reserves. Importantly, with our 2012 capital program largely focused on oil projects, we have replaced nearly 260% of our oil production during the year. These oil additions help drive our oil reserves to 27% of total reserves. Including NGLs, liquids now comprise 47% of our total proved reserves.Shifting now to our fourth quarter operating highlights and 2013 plans, starting in the Permian Basin. Our Permian production averaged a record 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, up 24% over the fourth quarter of 2011. Looking specifically to our Permian oil production, it grew 31% over the same period, with light oil now accounting for 60% of our total Permian volumes.In the fourth quarter, we took advantage of favorable conditions in the rig market to secure several additional rigs for our expanded 2013 Permian program. We currently have 29 operated rigs focused on Permian oil production. This year we plan to spend about $1.5 billion there drilling some 300 wells. Our activity spans numerous light oil plays from development to exploration. Our Permian development plays generate some of the best returns in our portfolio. In 2013, our Permian oil production growth is expected to approach 40%.At year-end, we had a large number of wells waiting on completion. We are currently catching up on these completions so our Permian production growth should accelerate into the second quarter. A key driver of our Permian oil growth continues to be our Bone Spring's horizontal program in New Mexico. We recently added a couple of rigs and now have eight operated rigs working in the play. In the fourth quarter, we brought ten Bone Springs wells on line with 30-day IP rates of 790 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 75% of which was light oil.As we mentioned last quarter, we have had considerable success in regenerating our inventory in the Bone Springs. Our drilling success combined with our ongoing geologic evaluation has once again allowed us to increase our inventory. We have now identified 700 remaining Bone Springs locations, more than doubling our previous count. This multiyear inventory represents roughly 140 million barrels of net risk resource potential to Devon. Accordingly, we ramped up our program for 2013. We plan to invest approximately $400 million of capital into Bone Springs and drill roughly 85 wells.Also in the Permian, we continued to have very good results with our two rig program targeting the Delaware formation. We brought five wells online during the fourth quarter with 30-day average IP rates of 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 85% of which was light oil. Like the Bone Springs, continuing drilling success and geologic work has allowed us to triple our drilling inventory to approximately 600 risk locations in the Delaware. In our JV with Sumitomo, the partnership has 556,000 net acres on the eastern flank of the Midland basin and along the Eastern Shelf. We are testing a number of formations including the Cline Shale where we experimenting with various landing zones, lateral lengths and completion techniques in an attempt to understand the optimum approach.Accordingly, the six wells we had brought online to date have \u00a0had highly variable results. As we continue to make progress in understanding the reservoir and refine our completion techniques, we are confident that this may mature into an economic play. In 2013, we are writing a four-rig program. Expect to drill approximately 30 across this exploration acreage, testing multiple formations. Keep in mind, our joint venture agreement is allowing Devon to look at these exploration opportunities with very little impact from a capital perspective. Our share of capital for this exploration program will total approximately $140 million this year.Also within the JV, we have been derisking our acreage that is prospective for the Wolfcamp shale in the Southern Midland basin. During the fourth quarter, we brought six horizontal Wolfcamp shale wells online with 30-day IP rates of up to 795 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 560 barrels of oil. This program is now delivering consistent, economic results. As a result, Devon and its joint venture partner are pursuing a more aggressive development program in 2013. We are running a five rig program and drilling approximately 110 wells. After the benefit of our drilling carry, we expect to spend about $150 million in the play this year.Devon has established a very large position in the Mississippian oil play located in north central Oklahoma. We now have approximately 600,000 net acres in the play, with roughly one fourth of this acreage in our JV with Sinopec. This position holds a potential to be a very large oil play for us. We\u2019ve been ramping up activity and are currently running 15 operated rigs drilling both the Mississippian and Woodford shale targets.In the fourth quarter, we tied in seven wells within the JV area. These wells were brought in line with 30 day IP rates of 335 BOE per day including 210 barrels of oil, above the high end of our tight curve expectations. Since yearend we\u2019ve brought on an additional 16 wells and have another 57 wells in various stages of completion. Because of pad drilling and the necessary infrastructure build out, we\u2019ve been running a large backlog of wells drilled but not yet producing.Our testing of various frac sizes as well as different landing points within the Miss is ongoing. But we continue to believe the key to optimizing development of the Mississippian play will be the integration of 3D seismic data, production data, logs, core samples and work to develop a comprehensive reservoir model and improve overall well performance. To this end, we have already obtained some 3D seismic and expect to have 3D over essentially all of our acreage by the end of next year.Our drilling results should begin to reflect the benefits of this approach as we progress through the year. Even without the benefit of the improvements that we anticipate, our results to date support our economic view for this emerging play.In 2013, Devon and our partner will spend some $1.2 billion of capital in the Mississippian and participate in approximately 400 wells, including about 300 operated wells and about 100 OBO wells. Roughly two thirds of our drilling will focus on our acreage inside the JV with the balance focused on derisking our acreage to the north and northwest. We expect to add at least five additional operated rigs as we go through the year.Shifting now to our thermal oil projects in northeastern Alberta. Aggregate production from our two Jackfish projects averaged roughly 49,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter. Production in our Jackfish 1 project ramped up significantly quicker than expected following scheduled maintenance in the third quarter.This further exemplifies the project\u2019s best in class performance from both a plant reliability and production efficiency perspective. Looking ahead, the widening of heavy oil differentials has pushed expected payout at Jackfish 1 to midyear. As a reminder, we\u2019d expect our post payout royalty at Jackfish 1 to be between 20% and 25% versus our current 5% to 6% pre payout rate. With this delay in payout, we now expect Jackfish 1 production to average roughly 30,000 barrels per day in 2013 net of royalties.At Jackfish 2, fourth quarter production increased to 20,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Drilling operations have been concluded and completion operations have begun on an additional well pad at Jackfish 2. First steam on this pad is expected late in the fourth quarter. Construction of Jackfish 3 continues on schedule with approximately 50% of the project now complete putting us on track for a startup around yearend 2014.At Pike, this winter\u2019s drilling -- winter appraisal program is well underway. We plan to drill 35 stratigraphic wells and shoot approximately 55 square miles of seismic. The program should substantially complete the evaluation of the first phase of the Pike development and engineering work is ongoing. As a reminder, the Pike 1 development project will have gross production capacity of 105,000 barrels of oil per day. Devon operates Pike with a 50% working interest. In total, we expect to spend approximately $870 million on our thermal oil projects in 2013.As highlighted on previous calls, we have been investing in a multiyear exploration program to evaluate the oil and liquid-rich resource potential of our substantial Western Canadian acreage position. Based on the results, we are moving forward with the development projects in the Ferrier corridor area in Western Alberta. Devon has roughly 240,000 net acres prospective for the Cardium oil and liquids-rich lower cretaceous zones including the glauconite.The first phase of development is focused on about one-third of our acreage position and represents more than \u00a0100 million barrels of reserve potential. In conjunction with this development, we are constructing a gas processing facility with an inlet capacity of 100 million a day and liquids processing capacity of approximately 13,000 barrels per day. Construction is slated to begin in the second quarter of this year with completion scheduled for mid-2014. We will begin ramping up our drilling activity late this year with 13-wells planned for the fourth quarter. We also plan to test the potential beyond the currently sanctioned development and expect additional phases in the future.Moving to the Texas Panhandle and the Granite Wash area. We continue to see solid results. We brought seven operated wells online during the fourth quarter, highlighted by the results of our third Hogshooter well. The Willis Luther 9-8H located in Wheeler County had a 30-day average IP rate of 2,800 BOE per day, including 2,100 barrels of light oil and 440 barrels of NGLs. In 2013, we plan to invest approximately $200 million of capital drilling roughly 50 wells. Our four-rig program will be focused on exploiting the Hogshooter and Granite Wash potential across our acreage.Moving to our Rockies oil exploration program. We've been testing several different formations with our most encouraging results to date coming from the Turner and Frontier. In the fourth quarter, we tied in our second Frontier well. The Iberlin Ranch Fed 2826-2FH had a 30-day IP rate of 975 barrels of oil equivalent per day including 888 barrels of oil. In 2013, we plan to invest approximately $30 million of capital and drill roughly 25 wells in the area. Our four-rig program will focus on exploiting our success in the Turner and Frontier. And just as a reminder, we expose very little capital compared to the activity level as this is part of the JV with Sinopec.Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. We continue to achieve excellent results from an efficiency standpoint with pad drilling. In 2012, we reduced our average drilling days by more than 20% compared to the previous year. In the fourth quarter, we brought 29 operated wells online with average 30-day IP rates of 6.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 550 barrels of liquids per day. These results continue to be among the best wells ever drilled at Cana with average EURs approaching 10 billion cubic feet equivalent.Fourth quarter production increased 31% over the year-ago quarter and 15% over the third quarter of 2012. Cana's fourth quarter production growth was led by oil and NGL growth of 68% over the year-ago quarter to 4,500 barrels of oil and 13,200 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. In 2013, we plan to invest approximately $550 million of capital at Cana and drill 150 wells, focused entirely in the oil and liquid-rich core. We are currently running 13 operated rigs. However, should our drilling efficiencies continue to improve at Cana, it's likely we'll trim our rig count as we move through the year.Shifting to the Barnett shale in North Texas, in the fourth quarter we had 10 operated rigs running in the oil window and the liquid rich core. Our net fourth quarter production averaged 1.4 BCF equivalent per day, up 3% from the year ago quarter. In 2013, we plan to invest approximately $500 million of capital in the Barnett and drill approximately 150 wells. We currently have 10 operated rigs running but planning to drop four of these rigs over the next couple of months. Our liquid rich focused drilling program in the core of the play continues to generate competitive returns.In summary, our 2012 capital program delivered strong oil production growth and we are on track to repeat this in 2013.With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?Jeffrey Agosta","Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Today I will take you through a brief review of our financials and operating results for 2012 and provide commentary on our outlook for 2013. Starting first with production, in the fourth quarter we produced 62.4 million oil equivalent barrels or 679,000 BOE per day. This result was at the high end of the guidance we provided last quarter. This strong performance was driven by excellent execution in our core development regions.In the fourth quarter, companywide oil production averaged 151,000 barrels per day, a 6% increase compared to the previous quarter and an all-time high for our North American onshore asset base. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect our strong oil growth to continue. Led by increased activity levels in the Permian basin and Mississippian, we are forecasting first quarter oil production to average between 153,000 and 163,000 barrels per day.Overall, we expect total companywide production of oil, gas, and NGLs to total about 670,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2013, down slightly from Q4. This is a result of a sequential quarter growth in oil and liquids production, being more than offset by a 5% decrease in gas production. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gas production reflects the timing of well completions and is not indicative of the decline rate in gas we expect for the full year.Now for a brief review of our revenues. In the fourth quarter, E&P revenues increased 8% over the previous quarter to $1.9 billion. Significantly higher natural gas price realizations during the quarter drove this result, more than offsetting the weak oil pricing received on our Canadian production.Fourth quarter Canadian oil realizations came in at 59% of the WTI benchmark or about 5 percentage points below the low end of our forecasted range. The most significant factor that impacted fourth quarter Canadian oil prices was high crude storage levels resulting from unexpected third-party pipeline curtailments in November and December.Looking ahead to the first half of this year, these high inventory levels, coupled with downtime at multiple refineries and restricted flow rates on export pipelines, will continue to impact Canadian crude prices. However, we believe that the supply and demand dynamics related to Canadian crude will significantly improve in the back half of the year.A key demand catalyst currently expected to occur in the second half of year is the startup of the Whiting Refinery. This will bring on 260,000 barrels per day of incremental heavy crude processing capacity. Additionally, as 2013 progresses, we expect increases in pipeline and rail capacity will help alleviate transportation bottlenecks. We believe these favorable developments will improve our Canadian oil realizations for the second half of the year.We are also experiencing wide oil price differentials in the Permian. A delay in the startup of the Longhorn Pipeline that will move oil from West Texas to the Gulf Coast is negatively impacting realizations in the first quarter. However, the good news is that we expect the Longhorn Pipeline in the West Texas Gulf expansion to be operational early in the second quarter, adding almost 300,000 barrels per day of takeaway capacity to the Gulf Coast. This should cause our differentials in the final three quarters of the year for the Permian to shrink to more historical levels of roughly $1 to $3 discount to WTI.Looking briefly at the impact of hedges, in the fourth quarter, our hedge position delivered cash settlements of $202 million. In total, these settlements enhanced our companywide average realized prices by $3.24 per BOE, an uplift of 11%. For 2013, through a combination of swaps and collars, we have roughly 70% of our forecasted oil production locked in with a weighted average floor price of $96 per barrel. We also have about 60% of our expected gas production for the year hedged at a weighted average protected price of $3.87. In the 8-K we are filing later today, we will provide a more detailed breakdown of both our hedging positions and our expected price realizations.Turning briefly to our midstream business. Driven by improved gas prices and strong cost management efforts, our fourth quarter operating profit climbed to $121 million, bringing our full year midstream profit up to $410 million. Looking ahead, we expect improved gas prices and increased processing capacity in the Barnett and Cana to increase profitability this year. For 2013, we are forecasting our operating profit to range from $425 million to $475 million, with the first quarter expected to range between $100 million and $120 million.Moving to expenses. Our fourth quarter cash expenses were generally in line with our expectations with total pre-tax cash costs coming in at $15.20 per BOE. The only outlier versus guidance was G&A expense coming in at $198 million or $3.17 per BOE. This was about $25 million above the top end of our forecast. A $21 million charge related to the early settlement of pension liabilities was the biggest driver. Even with this un-forecasted expense in the quarter, Devon maintains a best quartile cost structure in the E&P industry. This is especially noteworthy given our shift to oilier projects which have higher margins but are generally more expensive to produce. Cutting to the bottom line, as Vince mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings were $0.78 per share, $0.03 higher than the Street's mean estimate. This level of earnings translated into cash flow per share of $3.11, exceeding the consensus expectations by 12%.Now for a quick review of our financial position. For 2012, Devon's cash flow from operations totaled $5 billion. Combined with the joint venture proceeds and other minor asset sales, our total cash inflows reached $6.5 billion for the year. This cash allowed us to comfortably fund a robust capital program while maintaining excellent financial strength. At December 31, our cash and short-term investments totaled $7 billion and our net debt to adjusted cap ratio was only 18%. While we clearly possess a great deal of financial strength and flexibility, we are fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength, and optimizing our growth and cash flow per share adjusted for the debt.So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?Vincent WhiteOperator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.David Kistler - Simmons & CompanyReal quickly, thinking about the pursuit of maybe MLP-ing the midstream, obviously bringing another significant amount of capital on top of the $7 billion you already have, realize that $7 billion you're waiting on repatriation thoughts around that. But with that kind of a war chest, should we be thinking towards potential acquisitions going forward or is that still probably off the table?Jeffrey AgostaWell, first of all -- Dave, this is Jeff. If we do a MLP IPO, the initial proceeds from that would generally be in the $300 million to $500 million range. So it would not substantially increase our cash position. And we're continuing to study the impact of repatriating the cash that's offshore. We have about, just for reference, we have about $6.5 billion of our $7 billion in cash is outside of the United States. The remaining $0.5 billion is in the United States. So, I'll turn the rest of the answer over to John.John RichelsSo, Dave, as Jeff says, this comes in tranches, when you do something like this, right. So you get the value out over time. So it does increase it. Look, anything that we do \u2013 first of all, we\u2019ve got a lot of projects that Dave has been talking about that are oil projects that if they\u2019re successful as we think they\u2019re going to be, they\u2019re going to require quite a bit of cash investment over the next few years as we develop them into really major projects. But anything that we do, whether we're investing that money in our projects, whether we use it do an acquisition, whether we buy back stock, we\u2019re going to do whatever is going to result in the most accretion and cash flow per share adjusted for debt. We've talked a lot about that metric. We think that that ultimately is what we ought to be focused on. So nothing is off the table.David Kistler - Simmons & CompanyI appreciate that. And then maybe jumping into one of the specific oil projects. You mentioned variability of results in the Cline. Can you guys give us some additional color on what you think \u2013 I know it's early stages \u2013 could be driving that variability of results and then I'll let somebody else hop on.David Hager","Sure, Dave. This is Dave Hager. Yeah, I think there are two big factors that \u2013 well, I'd say three. I guess one, geographic where we are testing various areas throughout our acreage position. Second is landing zones. We are still testing out various landing zones within the Cline and other formations to see what may be the best. And third, completion techniques and we're still optimizing the completion techniques. So it's just really early on in the play to give any sort of conclusive results. But I can tell you we're optimistic with what we're seeing so far and we're very confident we're going to make this into an economic play.Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchI have a couple of questions, one on the MLP and one on the Miss, if I may. John, one of the things that you talked about in the past about reasons for not doing an MLP was the variability of the NGL component of your earnings and a very low tax basis. Can you help us understand what's changed on those two issues? And my follow-up is on Miss, please.John RichelsWell, a couple of things have changed, Doug. You're right. I mean, when we looked at it before, that was a bit of a stumbling block, because an MLP with high variability or high exposure to commodity prices did not exact the same kind of multiples as say a tolling business did. We've talked a lot about that in the past. There are a couple of things that have changed. First of all, we think there may be more of an opportunity for us to change the nature of some of the contracts that we have today than a few years ago for a variety of contractual reasons. And secondly, there are some innovations, if I can call it that, that have arisen in the last few years as where the operating company can ensure a more constant cash flow through hedging or other techniques with the \u2013 between the MLP and the operating company, and where the operating company becomes the counterparty.So there are some new ideas around that that have arisen that we think are ones that we need to look at pretty carefully. Of course there's a transfer risk when you do that as well and that has to be factored into the equation. But those are the kinds of things that we can do or we can \u2013 you're always going to have a little bit of variability. This is not going to be a tolling business. So we can take the wide variability out that we have our portfolio exposed to percentage of production type contract.Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And on the tax, John?Jeff AgostaDoug, this is Jeff. The tax basis hasn't really changed. That situation still exists and so we would just need to be thoughtful and deliberate about how we move the assets into the MLP to minimize the tax leakage.John RichelsBut we have and we are adding new assets all the time and to the extent we have newer assets, then gosh, we talked today about this even, it's not out of the question. You could do some of this with the Canadian assets. We're building the Ferrier plant. We're building out facilities in the Miss. We're building out facilities in the Permian. All of those things would have a much higher tax basis as well if we were to start doing drop-downs over time.Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchGot it. Thank you. My follow-up, I guess this is probably for Dave. But Dave, the Vitruvian acreage that you picked up in the northern part of the Miss, assumingly Dave it all seemed \u2013 it was in a better area I guess than the joint venture acreage. Do you have any obligations or any agreements forthcoming between yourselves and Sinopec in terms of how you might involve them in that and maybe talk a little bit about the relative EUR prospectivity of that area relative to the Southern piece? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.David Hager","Yeah. There are no obligations with Sinopec regarding how we develop the acreage outside the existing joint venture area with Sinopec in the Mississippian. So we can develop that as we deem appropriate out there. It's still early on, I would say overall, Doug, to get an idea of the EURs outside to the North there, and what you're calling the Vitruvian acreage versus inside the joint venture area with Sinopec. We really need to get more well completions on line. We're encouraged with what we've seen so far, and of course there are a lot of wells immediately to the west of that that a couple of our competitor companies have drilled.We think we're going to be able to even improve on those results because we're going to use 3D seismic to optimize the results. We're going to have an integrated petrophysical model that we're going to use. And so it's a more geo-science intensity approach that we're going to use. And so, we think over time, once we get all that data and put all that together, we're going to see even better results. But we don't have that much results to-date with our own wells to be able to say conclusively at this point whether that's true. But we certainly believe that's going to be the case.Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research","You mentioned de-booking some liquid rich reserves. I'm wondering where those reserves were located.John Richels","Essentially, any gas projects with lower gas prices the economic tail is shortened, and so that would be really across our liquids-rich positions. And we had minor of negative revisions associated with Cana where we've talked about in the previous call, where we went to a reduced frac size with our 2011 program and we had a minor amount of negative reserve revision associated with that which were liquid rich. But it's very minor in the overall scheme.OperatorNext we have the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Brian Singer - Goldman SachsWhen you think about the U.S. E&P business on a standalone basis, do you believe you have the assets at this point where that business can stand on its own without either JV proceeds or carries? Or do they need either acquisitions or the growth and cash flow synergies provided by your Canada business?John RichelsBrian, a few things. First of all, our Permian position is about as good a position as you get in this industry. We've got over 1 million acres in the Permian. We're growing that at 30s and 40s percent. I mean, that's growing very well. And we've added these new areas. Now, we're in the early stages of a couple of areas, the Cline, of course, and the Mississippian. But we are encouraged by it and we've got the acreage position that makes sense for a company our size, where you can get the scale and the efficiency. So, it's not a slam-dunk for us obviously because it's early days in some of these plays, but we've added some very good positions.We are also encouraged by what we're seeing in the Rockies. We started talking about that as the Niobrara, and now we're seeing a lot of other formations, but it's a multi-zoned area that we are continuing to pursue as well. But I think there's still some work to do obviously for us to fully understand it, but we think that we have put together some pretty prospective areas that really supplement this tremendous growth that we're going to see for many years in the Permian. And if gas prices start to change, if NGL prices start to come back, we think we've got some really good projects where we have the scale and the efficiencies and the infrastructure to grow them very effectively.David HagerI might just add. Really the assets that we have in place right now are totally sufficient for growth for the next couple of years. There's no question about that. I think the question is beyond that, how large scale are the Mississippian or Cline positions. And what we've seen so far is very optimistic. But there's no issue for the next couple of years whether we have plenty and we are taking the exploration risk associated with it out by doing these joint ventures. And then once they get to full or large scale development, then they can really impact us materially. And so we are very optimistic at this point. We still need some more results but the early results are very encouraging.John Richels","And Brian, one last comment. As you know, we've got a dedicated new ventures team that's looking at new opportunities all the time. So those things \u2013 again as Dave said, that's development for the future, but those things are continuing as well.Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s great. And then as a follow-up, just looking at your production guidance that you talked about earlier, I think the crux of that is the oil growth in the U.S. and it seems to be about 17,000 or so barrel a day increase from your fourth quarter levels. Can you just provide a little more granularity about \u2013 is that almost entirely driven by the Permian or a little bit more granularity on whether the Mississippi Lime or some of the areas in the Rockies are providing contributions to that?David Hager","It is primarily driven by the Permian with some minor contributions early on here with the Mississippian and in the Rockies. But the biggest part of it is the Permian.OperatorNext we have David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.David Tameron \u2013 Wells FargoQuestion on use of proceeds for cash. I know we've talked about in the past a little bit, but how you guys look at your current dividend policy and could we anticipate any changes there?John Richels","Yeah. David, as you probably know, we've increased our dividend every year since its inception, except during the height of the financial crisis and while we were doing our redevelopment \u2013 or repositioning of the company. So we've had an intention and a history of increasing every year. We tend to look at that in around March of the year. We'll take it to our Board of Directors again this year and we have every reason to believe we'd be continuing the increase. But we think what's really important is to have a sustainable dividend and one that we can regularly increase over time.David Tameron \u2013 Wells FargoOkay. But as far as many meaningful changes, you don't anticipate that at this time. Is that what I'm hearing, John?John RichelsWell, I guess it depends on what you think meaningful is. I guess we think we're going to continue to increase it.David Tameron \u2013 Wells FargoOkay and then as a follow-up just on a completely separate topic. Your production guidance, can you talk about what assumption you've made as far as ethane recovery or rejection and how that could swing your full-year production number?David HagerWell, at this point we're probably being impacted on the order of about 3,000 barrels a day or so by ethane rejection currently. At this point we\u2019re not rejecting ethane on our current Devon operated plants. The full impact if it would \u2013 if we would make that decision, which of course we'll evaluate continuously throughout the year, we're probably on the order of 10,000 to 50,000 barrels a day if we made that decision.David Tameron \u2013 Wells FargoOkay. And just to clarify, is that in your guidance or is that not in your guidance?David HagerIt is not in our guidance right now that we will reject ethane beyond the 3,000 barrels a day that is currently happening on our outside operated projects.Vincent WhiteThis is Vince. I might add that we have some of the lowest transportation costs and our participation in the extraction business gives us really some of the best ethane extraction economics of the industry. So our point at which we reject isn't necessarily equal to that of our figures.OperatorNext we have the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Your line is open.John Herrlin \u2013 Societe GeneraleNot to beat a dead horse with the MLP, but you almost went through the process once before. Gas prices have been weak a while. Is this just a preempted move? Because you're really not short of cash, so why bother doing it?John RichelsWell, John, yeah, gas prices have been lower, but those things change over time and these MLPs take a while to fully develop as well. So the price at any point in time, I'm not sure is the right way for us to look at it. And whether our \u2013 wherever prices are, I mean we ought to always be looking at and we try to always look at ways to unlock value in the company. We think this is just one of the ways that we can do that and market conditions are such that it makes it much more attractive than when we did that before. And as I was saying, today capital markets are much deeper. The yields have all changed. Some of the innovations with regard to structuring make it more attractive. The fact that we're out there building new facilities all the time to create a continuous stream of dropdowns for an MLP, make it all attractive for us. So we think it's the right thing to do irrespective of either where the commodity prices are right now or where stock prices are right now.John Herrlin \u2013 Societe GeneraleOkay. Thank you, John. One for Dave. Could you see, Dave, in the Permian a whole lot more capital being allocated to the plays and could you rank them in order of priority?John Richels","Sure John. First off, we have ramped up our activity significantly in 2013 over 2012, and of course '12 was up significantly over '11. So we have been increasing a lot. We're going to spend about $1.5 billion there amongst four different plays really, the Bone Springs and Delaware, lumping them into one. Wolfcamp, Cline Shale, second, Wolfberry, and then up on the Central Basin platform. There's different ways to rank them, John, I guess you'd say, if you look at current economics I'd say the Bone Springs and Delaware probably rank at the top of the list. If you look at total resource potential then certainly the Cline Shale and the Wolfcamp Shale would rank at the top of the list. And as we really drive the economic value as we move forward in the Cline Shale, it could be very, very significant.Now, can we do more in the future than we're doing right now, I think we are continually looking at ways to increase our activity even further, because these are very strong economics. There are infrastructure limitations as far as gas takeaway capacity and you can't \u2013 you can\u2019t take the gas away. So if we can't take the gas oil, you have limits on your oil production there, you have that issue. We have internal constraints for manpower, there is getting the permits from the state and the feds. So that's a process. We're addressing all of those issues currently and we're looking at ways to increase even further. There's also just the pace of geologic maturity of the prospects also and we can't get too risky out there on that side. But we're working on all that, John, because we recognize that these are strong economics and we have a premier position in the industry out here.","Vincent White","All right. Operator, I'm showing the top of the hour so we'll end today's call. As usual, we'll be around the rest of the day to take any questions that didn't make it into the call today. Thank you for your participation.","Operator","","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Vincent W. White","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to today's Year-End 2011 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'll begin today's call with a few preliminary housekeeping items and then turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels. John will provide an overview of our 2011 results and his thoughts on the year ahead;  then Dave Hager, Head of Exploration and Production, will cover the operating highlights and the details of our 2012 capital program. And following that, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will finish up with a review of our financial results. We'll conclude with a Q&A period, and as usual, we will tend to hold the call to 1 hour. Also with us today is Larry Nichols, our Executive Chairman, and other members of the Devon senior management team to help with the Q&A session.","A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our homepage. In today's call, we'll be providing high-level guidance for 2012 capital, production and certain operating items. And as is our practice, after the call today, we will file an 8-K with all the detailed estimates for production by product category and geographic region, operating expense items and so forth as well as expected realized prices relative to benchmark oil, gas and NGL prices. The 8-K will also provide additional details of our 2012 capital plan.","Please note that all references in today's call to our plans, forecast, expectations and estimates are considered forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we always strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are a lot of factors that could cause our actual results to differ from these estimates we're providing. A discussion of risk factors related to those estimates can be found in our SEC filing, that is, our 8-K that we'll file later today. Also in today's call, we will reference certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we use these measures, we're required to provide certain related disclosures and those are available on the Devon website.","Before I hand off the call, I want to officially announce that Devon will be hosting an analyst event in Houston. This is going to be half-day format on the morning of April 4. We'll provide an overview of Devon's corporate strategy, an update of the company's resource potential and inventory and provide an in-depth operational review of our key exploration and development projects. Invitations will be sent out in the next week or 2, I just wanted to let you know to save the date. Again, that will start the morning of Wednesday, April 4, at about 8 a.m. in Houston.","With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Richels","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. 2011 was another outstanding year for Devon. We delivered strong financial results driven by the solid execution of our operational plans and the very successful completion of our strategic repositioning. Net earnings climbed to an all-time record $4.7 billion for the year. Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings totaled $1.55 per diluted share, exceeding the First Call estimate by $0.07. Cash flow totaled $6.5 billion for the year, and coupled with the final proceeds from our strategic repositioning, cash inflows reached nearly $10 billion.","In November, we concluded our $3.5 billion share buyback program, completing the repurchase of 11% of our outstanding shares. And I'll remind you, in total, over the past 8 years we've reduced our share count by over 20%. Production from our onshore North American asset base grew to an all-time record of 240 million equivalent barrels in 2011. Fourth quarter production increased 10% over the year-ago quarter, driven by an impressive 21% increase in oil and liquids production. Record production from each of our 4 core development areas, that's the Permian Basin, Jackfish, the Barnett and Cana, contributed to this strong liquids growth. In 2011, we continued to assemble high-impact positions across 5 oil and liquids-rich new venture plays. Subsequently, we entered into a joint venture with Sinopec, whereby they will invest $2.5 billion in exchange for 1\/3 of our 1.4 million net acres in these plays. ","And finally, excellent operating performance translated into another strong year of company-wide reserve growth, boosting year-end proved reserves to an all-time record 3 billion barrels equivalent. Looking more closely at our 2011 reserve activities, our drill-bit reserve additions, that's extensions, discoveries and performance revisions, totaled 386 million barrels and replaced 160% of our production for the year. With our 2011 program focused on oil and liquids-rich gas, our liquids reserve replacement rate reached 230%. This boosted oil and natural gas liquids to 42% of the company's total reserves, more than half of which is black oil. These results were achieved in spite of 2011 being a modest year for SAGD bookings. Significant oil reserve additions are expected from Jackfish 3 this year, and that will set up 2012 as another good year for company-wide reserve additions.","Our total costs incurred for the year were $6.9 billion, including capitalized G&A and interest. Even though we invested $1.5 billion on unproved leasehold capture and exploration activity that did not add reserves in 2011 and more than $700 million on our SAGD projects, our F&D costs came in at less than $18 per BOE, a very competitive result. This is without reflecting the benefit of the $900 million in cash that we are receiving from Sinopec. It's worth noting that we achieved these results while decreasing our percentage of proved undeveloped reserves. In fact, Devon's PUDs account for just 26% of our total proved reserves at year end, down from 29% at the beginning of the year, which gives us one of the lowest PUD ratios in the industry.","It's no surprise that gas, dry gas projects are increasingly challenged in our current environment. In 2011, we allocated over 90% of our E&P capital to oil and liquids-rich projects, and in 2012, virtually all of our capital will be directed to our oil and liquids-rich project areas. We've always believed that a balanced portfolio provides better risk-adjusted returns than one focused on either oil or gas. This philosophy has served us well as dry gas economics have eroded. Our diversified portfolio provided the opportunity to easily deploy capital to our deep inventory of oil and liquids-rich projects without having to abruptly shift our focus or overpay to establish new oil and liquids-rich projects. ","When considering our capital allocation for 2012, we remain focused on optimizing our long-term growth per share adjusted for debt. We implement this philosophy by determining a right combination of E&P investments, debt reduction, share repurchases and dividend payments. In aggregate, we expect our full year 2012 E&P capital to decline to between $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion. Approximately 90% of this capital will be devoted to development projects translating into top line production growth of 6% driven by oil production growth in excess of 20% and double-digit production growth in NGLs. By the end of 2012, our liquids production will be 40% of our total production and some 60% of the total liquids will be oil.","In addition to the development projects that drive this growth, we're allocating 10% of our capital to exploration activity in our various oil and liquids-rich plays. Although our 2012 capital budget includes about $225 million for routine leasehold acquisitions, it does not include any large-scale acreage acquisitions that we may identify throughout the year. And on that front, we're currently working on significant oil-focused opportunities to expand our footprint in current plays and also to establish new positions in plays that we're not yet prepared to talk about.","The impact of our exploration program will be enhanced by our $2.5 billion agreement with Sinopec. This joint venture materially enhances our returns and improves our capital efficiency. Not only do we recover more than 100% of our costs to date per acreage in exploration drilling, the transaction also reduces our future capital outlays. In addition, it will allow us to accelerate activity in our new venture plays without diverting capital from our core development projects. And finally, the reduction in capital outlays gives us an additional financial flexibility to aggressively pursue new plays.","Cash flow from operations and the cash that we will receive from the Sinopec joint venture will fund a robust capital program for 2012 without the need to issue equity or significantly increase debt. As a result, given our reduced share count in 2012, our top line growth of 6% should translate into approximately 10% growth in production per share.","In addition to investing in our core business, we've got a -- we've had a long history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we are increasing Devon's quarterly dividend by 18% to $0.20 per quarter. Since 2004, we have increased our dividend 7 times or a total of 800%. Going forward, we fully expect to continue to regularly increase our dividend.","Also, since 2004, we reduced our share count by 20%. And while Devon's common stock continues to be a compelling value based on where we're trading today, for the time being we've decided against additional share repurchases. The oil plays that we're building and de-risking in 2012 should provide the opportunity to deploy significant quantities of capital in the future. These developing investment opportunities, combined with an extremely weak natural gas price environment, uncertainty in the world economic outlook and more than $6 billion of our cash held offshore, all suggest that maintaining a high degree of liquidity and financial flexibility makes sense. As we have in the past, we will continue to evaluate the merits of additional share repurchases as we go forward.","In summary, Devon is well positioned to deliver highly competitive per-share growth. We remain intently focused on optimizing margins and maintaining our position as a low-cost producer. Our balance sheet remains in terrific shape, allowing us to invest in our business based on our long-term outlook. We maintain a disciplined approach of balancing resource development with resource capture to optimize the value of our portfolio. Our deep and diverse inventory of low-risk oil and liquids-rich development opportunities provides us ample opportunity to invest at very attractive rates of return in the current environment. Simultaneously, we're establishing and testing a wide array of exciting new resource plays. All of these factors position Devon to deliver many years of profitable growth.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed review of our operating highlights. Dave?","David A. Hager","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of 2011 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities.","E&P spending was $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by approximately $400 million. This resulted from 2 opportunistic acreage acquisitions identified by our new ventures group that we closed in the fourth quarter. First, we purchased an additional 125,000 net acres in the Ohio Utica. A portion of those expenditures will be reimbursed through our Sinopec joint venture agreement. Second, we acquired undeveloped acreage in a promising new oil opportunity that we're not yet ready to disclose. As John mentioned, in 2012, we will continue to pursue acreage acquisitions in an opportunistic manner to build significant positions at reasonable costs.","Shifting now to our fourth quarter operating highlights and 2012 plans, starting with our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta. Our fourth quarter daily production at Jackfish 1 averaged 31,400 barrels per day, net of royalties and continuing its excellent trend, the continuous trend of excellent plant reliability and efficiency. At Jackfish 2, we exited the year producing approximately 14,000 barrels per day, net of royalties. Production at Jackfish 2 will continue its ramp-up throughout the remainder of this year.","In early December, we received regulatory approval for our third Jackfish project and began site clearing in January. Although field construction will not begin in earnest until spring once the land dries out, we are roughly 20% complete with the project as a result of our decision some 18 months ago to place orders for various long-lead-time components for the project. Plant start-up for Jackfish 3 is targeted for late 2014.","At Pike, our SAGD oil sands joint venture, this winter's appraisal program is underway and should confirm the resource potential for a 105,000-barrel-per-day project for the first phase of the Pike development. This winter's drilling program consists of drilling over 100 stratigraphic test wells and acquiring 50 square miles of 3D seismic. We expect to begin the regulatory process for Pike as early as this summer. You may recall that we expect Pike to ultimately support additional phases of development before -- beyond this first phase. Devon operates Pike with a 50% working interest.","In aggregate, we plan to spend approximately $800 million on our thermal oil sands projects in 2012. With the initial phase of Jackfish running near capacity and Jackfish 2 continuing to ramp up, we expect to grow our thermal oil production by 50% over 2011 to an average of over 50,000 barrels per day in 2012. We are on track to achieve our goal of growing our net SAGD oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020, representing a 17% to 19% compound annual growth rate through the end of the decade.","On the exploration front in Canada, we continue to evaluate the oil and liquids-rich potential of numerous play types across our more than 4 million net acres. Our most encouraging results from our 2011 program came in at the Ferrier Area where we are targeting cardium oil. We drilled 8 wells in the area and saw 30-day IP rates as high as 940 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We were also encouraged by our early results in the Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan. We are still in the early stages of the evaluation of these and several other emerging liquids plays in Canada. We will continue this effort in 2012, spending approximately $350 million drilling some 90 exploratory wells.","Moving now to the Permian Basin. Our total net production averaged over 53,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the fourth quarter, up 19% over the fourth quarter of 2010. Permian oil and gas liquids production grew at 22% over the same period and, today, account for 75% of our total Permian volumes. At year end, we had 16 operated rigs running and have since added a 17th rig. And we plan to pick up 2 additional rigs over the course of the next month, bringing us to 19 operated rigs in the basin focused on drilling high-return oil opportunities.","Devon was the first to apply horizontal drilling in shale in the early days of the Barnett. Today, we continue to leverage this expertise and are currently operating 15 horizontal rigs in the Permian, making Devon the most active horizontal driller in the basin. This reflects the large horizontal drilling opportunity set we have across our Permian position. These are light oil opportunities generating some of the best returns in our portfolio. Accordingly, in 2012, we expect to spend $1 billion and drill over 300 wells in the Permian. This includes 100 wells in the Wolfberry play, 80 in the Bone Springs, 75 in various conventional formations, 35 in the Wolfcamp Shale, 35 in the Delaware and 5 in the Avalon. In 2012, our Permian properties are expected to deliver 25% liquids production growth over 2011.","We only recently began drilling on the 92,000-net-acre Wolfcamp shale position that we have established in the Southern Midland Basin. We brought 4 Wolfcamp Shale horizontal wells online in the fourth quarter, with the best well delivering a 24-hour IP of 935 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The results of our wells, combined with industry results around our position, give us confidence and consistent economic results in this play. We are continuing to fine-tune our drilling and completion techniques and have just finished drilling our first 7,100-foot lateral, which included a 30-stage completion. This well is just starting to flow back. We'll keep you posted and updated on our progress.","Moving now to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. Our Cana gas plant was back fully operational in December, following repairs of the damage incurred last May from a tornado. This helped us achieve our target exit rate for the Cana of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Fourth quarter net production increased 83% over the year-ago quarter to a record 250 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, including 3,100 barrels of oil and 7,400 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. This significant liquids contribution, combined with our low acreage and royalty costs, enable us to generate strong full-cycle returns in the current commodity price environment.","In 2012, we plan to invest some $870 million of capital and drill nearly 200 wells in Cana. Our Cana activity will be focused in the oil and natural gas liquids-rich portion of the core area. Liquids should represent almost 40% of the production stream generated by the 2012 capital program. Cana oil and liquids production is expected to grow over 85% to an average of 16,000 barrels per day in 2012.","From a reserves performance perspective, Cana was a leading growth area for the company in 2011. Extensions, discoveries and performance revisions at Cana accounted for 160 million barrels of oil equivalent of additions. At year end, we had 328 million equivalent barrels booked in the Cana-Woodford. With almost 2 billion barrels equivalent of risked resource potential and more than 5,000 risked locations remaining, we expect Cana to deliver many more years of highly economic production and reserves growth.","Shifting to the Barnett Shale Field in North Texas. In the fourth quarter, we brought 70 Barnett wells online and are continuing to see outstanding results from our drilling in the liquids-rich portion of the play. Our fourth quarter net production held steady at a record 1.32 Bcf equivalent per day, including 47,000 barrels of liquids per day. We continue to achieve excellent results in the Barnett with the pad drilling. In the fourth quarter, we brought a 22-well pad online with average IPs of 3.2 million cubic feet equivalent, including 175 barrels per day of natural gas liquids.","In 2012, we plan to invest approximately $950 million of capital in the Barnett and drill approximately 300 wells. We currently have 12 operated rigs running, but plan to drop 2 of these rigs sometime in the second quarter. This decision was made in conjunction with the decision I mentioned earlier to add the 3 rigs in the Permian to focus on our extensive inventory of oil opportunities. Remarkably, even with a 10-rig program for a good part of the year, we still expect our Barnett liquids production to grow almost 15% over 2011 to  an average of 53,000 barrels per day in 2012.","From a reserve performance perspective, extensions, discoveries and performance revisions in the Barnett Shale accounted for 120 million barrels of additions, including 5 million barrels of positive performance revisions. This marks the eighth consecutive year of upward performance revisions in the Barnett that in aggregate total over 235 billion barrels equivalent. At year end, we had 1.15 billion barrels equivalent booked in the Barnett of which 86% is proved developed.","On the exploration front. As John mentioned, the execution of the JV with Sinopec marks the beginning of a significant effort to de-risk these 5 new venture oil and liquids-rich plays. In the Mississippian oil play located North Central Oklahoma, the partnership has now secured approximately 230,000 net acres. We drilled our first vertical well in the second quarter of last year to gather data and have since drilled our first horizontal Mississippian producer, yielding very encouraging results. The Matthews 1H was brought online in the fourth quarter and achieved a 24-hour sustained IP rate of 960 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which greater than 80% was oil. Through the first 30 days of production, the well averaged 590 barrels of oil equivalent a day. These results are among the best reported in the play to date. And with an API gravity of around 40 and low sulfur content, this appears to be some of the best-quality crude oil in the lower 48. We are obviously very encouraged with these results and plan to drill or participate in approximately 15 Mississippian wells by year end.","In the Niobrara, industry results to date have been mixed and somewhat challenged in some areas, but we are still in the early stages of evaluating our acreage. However, we recently completed our first well in the Turner formation on our Niobrara acreage with encouraging results. After being online for 22 days, the Waterbuck 2342 had averaged 427 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In addition to the Niobrara and Turner formations, we expect to drill Cordell, Mowry and Frontier wells in our Powder River and DJ Basin acreage this year. In total, we expect to have 35 wells drilled here by year end.","In the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, we have completed our first 2 horizontal wells in the play. The Beech Grove 68H was a short-lateral horizontal and had a series of mechanical problems but still managed to deliver a 24-hour IP of 186 barrels per day. This well is not indicative of what a properly completed long-lateral horizontal well can do in the Tuscaloosa. The second well, the Soterra 6H-1, is just starting to flow back, following the fracture stimulation. We are adding a second rig in the Tuscaloosa in March and expect to have 10 wells down in the play by year end.","In Michigan, we drilled 2 vertical test wells last year and just drilled the first horizontal well in the A1 Carbonate. We plan to complete the first well later this month and are now beginning to drill our second horizontal. We expect to have approximately 15 wells drilled in this play by year end.","In the Ohio Utica, Devon and Sinopec have assembled 235,000 net acres in the play. We just TD-ed our first horizontal well, the first of 15 horizontal wells that we expect to drill here this year. While we are still in the early stages of evaluating these plays, we have seen positive subsurface data and encouraging rate indications in several of them. By the end of 2012, we expect to have drilled approximately 125 wells in aggregate across these 5 plays, giving us a much better understanding of the potential of these positions.","In summary, our 2011 capital program delivered strong liquids growth and record production reserves from each of our key development areas. Importantly, we also made tremendous progress in efficiently captured -- efficiently capturing significant acreage positions that will provide the next leg of oil and liquids growth in 2012 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will take you through a brief review of our financial and operating results for 2011 and provide commentary on our outlook for 2012.","Starting first with production. For the full year of 2011, production came in at the top end of our guidance range at 240 million equivalent barrels or approximately 658,000 barrels per day. Our 2010 results included production from the Gulf of Mexico up to the point of sale, which we completed in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the Gulf, our production increased 8% in 2011 driven by an oil and natural gas liquids growth rate of nearly 16%.","Fourth quarter 2011 production was very strong, averaging 680,000 BOE per day, exceeding the upper end of our guidance provided in the previous earnings call by 5,000 barrels per day. This impressive result represents a top line production growth rate of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2010 or an 18% growth rate on a per share basis. Once again, excellent execution in our liquids-prone development regions drove our strong quarterly performance. In total, our company-wide liquids production was 238,000 barrels per day, up 21% from the year-ago quarter.","In 2012, we expect an increase in oil production of more than 20% to drive overall production growth of about 6% to between 253 million and 257 million barrels for the year. This year-over-year oil growth will be driven mostly by the ramp-up of production from the Permian Basin and our Jackfish 2 project. We will also continue to exploit liquids-rich gas opportunities within our portfolio, increasing our 2012 NGLs at double-digit rates. As we focus our activity on oil and liquids-rich gas opportunities, we expect that our dry gas production will decline slightly. Looking specifically at the first quarter of this year, we expect sequential production growth of about 1.5% to a range of 685,000 to 695,000 barrels per day. Beyond the first quarter, we expect production to steadily increase as the year progress.","Now for a brief review of our revenues. Throughout 2011, our balanced product mix helped to offset the effects of lower natural gas prices. This was especially evident in the fourth quarter, with nearly 65% of our upstream revenue derived from oil and NGLs. Our natural gas hedges also enhanced our Q4 E&P revenues. Overall, cash settlements of hedges contributed an additional $151 million of revenue and boosted our company-wide price realizations by $2.42 per BOE.","Looking at our hedge position for 2012. Roughly 50% of our expected oil production, or 76,000 barrels per day, is hedged through various swaps and costless collars. Of this amount, 22,000 barrels were swapped at a weighted average price of $107, with the balance collared at a weighted average ceiling of $126 and a floor of $86. We also have 880 million cubic feet per day of natural gas hedged with a weighted average protected price of $4.73. This represents about 1\/3 of our expected natural gas production for the year.","Turning now to our marketing and midstream operations. They once again delivered another high-quality quarter, generating $134 million of operating profit, bringing our full year midstream profit up to $542 million. That's at the high end of our guidance range and a $32 million improvement over 2010. Looking ahead to 2012, we expect lower prices to cap our full year operating profit in the $470 million to $520 million range.","Moving to expenses. We continue to do an excellent job controlling costs in spite of industry inflationary pressures. In the fourth quarter, expenses in most categories were in line with our expectations and our pretax cash costs were only 2% higher than last year at $13.61 per BOE. This is especially noteworthy given that our growth in oil production, which is generally more expensive to produce. Our consistent focus on cost management and the significant scale we enjoy in our core operating regions continue to place Devon in the position of being a low-cost producer. This contributes to our ability to generate full-cycle returns that are among the best in our peer group.","The final expense I will touch on is income taxes. After backing out the items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates, our adjusted full year 2011 income tax rate was 34% of pretax earnings. This adjusted rate is comprised of a 2% current rate and a 32% deferred rate, right in line with our expectations for the year. In today's earnings release, we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from analyst estimates.","Going to the bottom line: A strong operating performance in 2011, combined with the sale of our assets in Brazil, translated into record earnings of $4.7 billion. Backing out the sale of Brazil and all of the other items that analysts generally exclude, 2011 non-GAAP earnings totaled $6.14 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP earnings were $1.55 per diluted share, exceeding the First Call mean by $0.07.","Now for a quick review of our financial position. For 2011, Devon's cash flow from continuing operations before balance sheet changes totaled $6.5 billion, which represents a 23% increase over 2010. Also, we received $3.2 billion from the sale of our Brazilian assets during the year, boosting total cash inflows to $9.7 billion. We utilized these sources of cash to easily fund our capital program, driving 8% top line production growth, record oil and gas reserves and the acquisition of valuable leasehold that enhances our long-term liquids growth prospects.","In addition to our capital program, we returned capital to our shareholders by repurchasing $2.3 billion of common stock and paying $278 million in dividends. We exited the year with $7.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and an enviable net debt to adjusted cap ratio of only 11%. As mentioned earlier, we continue to organically develop additional liquids-focused opportunities. We have the luxury of being able to comfortably fund these activities while maintaining our strong financial position.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to John.","John Richels","Thank you, Jeff. As you can see, our 2011 results reflect our disciplined approach to our business. In 2012, we will continue to execute our strategy by delivering oil and liquids production growth of roughly 20%, driving our production mix to 40% oil and liquids by year end, by continuing to bolster our future growth through accelerating our exploration activity and opportunistically adding acreage in new oil plays and by maintaining our position as a low-cost producer, allowing us to deliver some of the best full-cycle returns in the peer group. As we've said many times in the past, we're fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength and optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. This approach places Devon in an advantageous position to deliver competitive per share growth in any environment.","And at this point, we'll open the call up to your questions.","Vincent W. White","[Operator Instructions] And with that, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about what's happening in the Barnett Shale? It sounds like overall production was up, but more of it's liquid. Are you starting to see some of the dry gas production turn, or is that going to happen later in the year? And remind me again, you've got 12 rigs running, you're going to drop 2? And how many of those will be actually in the dry gas area?","John Richels","Let me make a general comment about the number of dry gas rigs we have working in the company: 0. We have no rigs at all drilling dry gas opportunities in the company. Everything we're drilling is liquids-rich or oil. And specifically in the Barnett, even with this, we do anticipate, because there is associated gas with the liquids-rich plays, that we are going to continue to grow the gas portion of the Barnett as well as the liquids-rich. We anticipate the total equivalents to go up, including the liquids-rich, by about 10% this year.","Vincent W. White","I might add to that. Since we did have, from years ago, many dry gas wells drilled there, and now we're focused entirely on the liquids-rich, the rich is shifting to become -- the mix of overall production is becoming more liquids-rich with this year's program.","John Richels","And we still have 2,500 to 3,000 locations in the liquids-rich. And at the current rate we are drilling, the 350 to 400 wells a year, you can see we have a very deep inventory in the liquids-rich portion of the play.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, maybe I misunderstood. I thought I heard a comment that the dry gas is going to decline by the end of the year for Devon. Did I mishear that?","Vincent W. White","That is company-wide because we're allowing some dry gas areas to decline. Company-wide, our gas production will be flat to down a little. It's just that in the Barnett, we will continue to grow gas production by drilling in the liquids-rich portions.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And for my follow-up. In the Permian Basin, obviously, things look like they're going pretty good there. Is there going to be any kind of constraints in the system over the next couple of years that you guys kind of envision for industry or Devon as a whole because of the activity increases there?","Darryl G. Smette","Yes, this is Darryl Smette. As you know, right now, there is constraints as it relates to NGL takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin. However, industry is eliminating those restrictions with 2 pipelines that are being currently built that should be on stream, the first one in the first quarter of 2013 and the second probably the second quarter of 2013, that will add about 500,000 barrels of NGL capacity and move the NGLs down to the Gulf Coast. So we are seeing some restrictions as an industry in the Permian right now and that should probably continue as we go through 2012 but should be eliminated early in 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler from Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Following up a little bit on the last question with respect to potential infrastructure constraints. With the growth you guys outlined in the Permian on the liquids side, in the Cana-Woodford, Barnett, looking at your success in the Miss and current IPs in the Niobrara, can you match up for us just where processing capacity is for you guys in each area to basically help us understand if it'll be sufficient to the growth drivers you've outlined?","Darryl G. Smette","On the Permian -- this is Darryl again. In the Permian, virtually all -- not all but a large portion of our acreage is already committed to third-party midstream companies who have existing process facilities in the Permian and they are either in the process of expanding those or building new processing facilities. So that process is ongoing and that should right itself at the same time we have the NGL takeaway capacity. As we look at Cana, as you know, we have, the Cana plant is operational currently and extracting natural gas liquids. And we have firm transportation to move all of those natural gas liquids down to Mont Belvieu for processing and not up to Conway, where you're seeing a significant discount to Mont Belvieu pricing. In addition to that, we are currently expanding our Cana plant, and that will become operational, right now, we think, second quarter of 2013, it will add about 150,000 Mcf of capacity to Cana. As we look at the Barnett, we currently have 650 million a day of processing capacity in our Bridgeport facility. We are also in the process of expanding that plant by about 150 million a day, and that'll become operational, we think, the fourth quarter of 2012 or the first quarter of 2013.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful, I appreciate it...","David A. Hager","Dave, just a general comment there. We obviously work very closely between the drilling side of the business and the ability to transport it and so we tailor all of our activity and make sure that we are not conducting drilling activity, that we can't move the product at a good price. So that's, we've addressed that in all of our capital program.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, appreciate that clarification. And then as a follow-up, with the stock buyback at least temporarily off the table and a number of assets coming up for sale in the Permian, how do you guys think about maybe potential acquisitions, going forward and kind of put that into comparison to, obviously, a proved reserve level that would be incredibly competitive on a dollar-per-barrel reserve metric versus an acquisition?","John Richels","Well, Dave, it's John. As you know, when we look at these opportunities, we're adding a lot of opportunities and through some ground floor, grassroots leasing. That's obviously the most attractive to us if we're adding it in the right places because we bring it in at a very low-entry cost. We can control the amount of a royalty that we're going to pay and it's really important for us when we -- because we've got a deep opportunity set. It's really important that anything we bring in will compete well against the opportunities that we already have in our opportunity set. Otherwise, we're not adding value for our shareholders. So when we look at these other opportunities for acreage acquisitions, we have to compare them to the opportunities that we're adding through our grassroots leasing efforts, which we're pretty excited about. In the future, as we look at purchasing stock, I think we've had a pretty good track record over the years of buying stock when times are right and following through once we make the commitment. And what we try to do there is to stay very disciplined, to understand our asset base and to compare the repurchase of stock against the injection of more capital into our existing asset portfolio. And we try to do it on the basis over a 3- to 5-year period of what will add the most cash flow per share, adjusted for debt. It's really important that we keep focusing on that. And so those are the kind of considerations. I think the fact that we're taking a breather right now from our share repurchases should give you a pretty good idea of how excited we are with the opportunities that are in our portfolio for the next few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've -- my first question is really going back to the production growth numbers, John, if you could help us understand a little bit about what's going on with the gas side. In order to allow the gas to decline a little more, I was under the impression you really weren't drilling any dry gas in 2011, at least the majority of the CapEx was going on liquids, so are you actually choking back wells, or are you doing anything a little bit more proactive on some of your dry gas production? So if you could help us a bit there. And I have a follow-up, please.","John Richels","No, we're not at all. The only reason that our gas production has been staying up at all is because we're drilling in liquids-rich gas areas. So in the Cana, the core areas of the Cana, for example, where we have terrific liquids component. In the core areas of the Barnett, we have high liquids contents, but it's producing some gas. In the other areas, the dry gas areas like the Rockies and our conventional business in Canada, East Texas and a bunch of other areas that are dry gas, we haven't been directing any capital to that, and that's just declining.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Okay, John, that's very clear. A very quick follow-up on the share buybacks. John, if the tax implications of bringing your overseas cash back to the States changed, would your share buyback philosophy change? And I'll leave it at that.","John Richels","Well, I guess I want to reiterate the point that when we make that decision, it's not solely because -- it's not because we're constrained for the cash. We do have $6.9 billion sitting offshore and we're going to leave that offshore for the time being until we get some better visibility on a repatriation holiday. But really, it's driven more by the fact that, our analysis of our future capital requirements and, importantly, the accretion that, that brings to our cash flow per share as opposed to buying shares back. And that's why I said earlier, it should give you a pretty good idea that we're pretty excited about our opportunity set right now. Now factored into that, too, we got a very low-gas-price environment, we've got a lot of uncertainty in the world economy and it's a good time, we believe, for us to maintain some financial flexibility by keeping the strong balance sheet. But we're going to be driven by the returns, not by where the money is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","As you think about T&D capital beyond 2012, how do you think about kind of level of spending and liquids growth rates on a multiyear basis?","David A. Hager","Well, David, this is Dave Hager. Again, we have a deep inventory of liquids-rich opportunities within the portfolio and so we think that we can continue this focus of liquids-rich and oil drilling opportunities for a number of years. And I would suspect that, again, we haven't put our total plans together for the years beyond 2012, but I would suspect that we would continue to have a growth rate on the total liquids somewhere in the teens in the out years. And we'll provide some more details on this when we have our Analyst Day meeting here in early April. But I suspect it's going to be somewhere in that order of magnitude because we have the opportunities to execute.","Vincent W. White","And of course, should the external environment change, in our view, as to the relative value of dry gas versus liquids-rich, our capital mix will change as well.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, you have the portfolio of dry gas still.","Vincent W. White","And oil, right.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then on, maybe a little more specific on oil sands, hearing some faster ramps to new projects in the 9- -- 6- to 9-month time frame as opposed to previous projects have been 12 to 18 months. Are you experiencing that or expecting that for Jackfish 2? And then, should we starting thinking about the same thing as you get into Jackfish 3?","John Richels","Actually, right now, on Jackfish 2, we're running a little bit ahead of where we had budgeted, and we're very happy with the performance. And so no real issues to discuss there.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Do you think you can do it in 6 months to get to peak, or is that too fast?","John Richels","That's probably too fast.","Jeffrey A. Agosta","David, for a project this size where we're talking about 35,000 barrel-a-day projects, you're putting a lot of steam in the ground and it just takes a number of months to ramp it up. And we'd rather, given that these are 25-year projects, we'd rather ramp them up on what we think is an operationally sound manner than trying to bring them on too fast.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So it's mainly through use of solvents and that type of thing that was speeding up some of the pace of it? That was it.","David A. Hager","Well, we obviously look at all those things. And just, our experience right now is that a little bit slower ramp-up is what's appropriate for our projects and achievable for our projects. So we obviously are looking at solvents and things like that. And if some of those become applicable, we'll look very hard and perhaps then we can speed it up, but right now, we just don't see that scope.","Vincent W. White","David, I might add that we're not solving for the shortest ramp-up time. We're solving for the best rate of return, so the number of initial wells you drill versus the plant size and that kind of thing all impact rate of return.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had a question on the $400 million in fourth quarter leasehold that went to the Utica and the stealth oil play. If you acquired 125,000 acres of Utica and if you say that was at $3,000 an acre, you would have consumed that full $400 million. So are you getting sort of bargain Utica acreage, or is that a stealth play just getting a small share of that $400 million?","Jeffrey A. Agosta","Well, your assumption on the price is probably not quite accurate on the Utica acreage, and we really just started acquiring the acreage in the stealth play. And frankly, we've been continuing to build, past the end of 2011, we're building on that stealth oil play position as we speak. And we see a path, frankly, for a position there somewhere in the 300,000- to 500,000-acre rage as we continue to build that position.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So the, on the Utica, the follow up, you're spending more or less than $3,000 an acre?","David A. Hager","We do not want to get into specific acreage prices for plays that we are continuing to acquire acreage in. It's just not in our interest, for commercial reasons.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman from The Benchmark Company.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I've been seeing a little bit of industry results in the Cana suggesting some good results toward the southeastern portion of the trend and I was wondering whether you might be reconsidering or reevaluating what you consider the core of the play to be.","David A. Hager","Well, we've seen -- obviously, we agree, Mark. We've seen some results out there that are somewhat encouraging on the southeast side, but we still think that we have what we think is really the best core position in Cana. We're happy with our position that we have there. And again, we have probably about between 2,000 and 3,000 locations in the liquids-rich portion of the core to drill. And so when you look at what we're drilling at pace of 200 wells or so per year, we have a very deep inventory there for many, many years. But there have been, I agree with you, there have been some good wells made on the southeast side. But I think we need to see some more results to be really sure how, just how sustainable that is.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My follow-up, Dave, relates primarily to the Bone Springs in the Permian, an area where, in the recent past, results have been pretty good. I wonder if you could update us. I didn't hear you specifically mention Bone Springs activity in your review of the quarter.","David A. Hager","Well, we've had a number of good Bone Springs wells in the quarter. I think we highlighted, actually, in the earnings release that we had a number of good Bone Springs wells on the order of around 600 barrels a day or so that we achieved out there. I think we had 8 wells average more than 600 barrels per day, 8 operated wells in the fourth quarter that achieved more than 600 barrels a day so we're seeing very good results out there. We see a good inventory of opportunities sitting out there. We estimate we probably have 350 to 400 locations remaining in the Bone Springs just on our existing inventory and will probably drill somewhere around 80 this year. So again, you can see 4- to 5-year inventory of Bone Springs opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris from Citigroup.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one question here on the acre expenditure. I think you said early in the call that your CapEx of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion had only $25 million in it for leasehold acquisitions. But given that you're continuing acquiring this stealth oil play and there might be other plays that you'll acquire acreage in and you spent $1 billion on acreage last year, what is a realistic expectation as to how much you'll end up spending on acreage this year?","David A. Hager","Well, first, a correction: We said $225 million in that base budget plan that we had. And that really is just kind of our base level of activity coring up around existing locations that we have, et cetera. We're opportunistic so I think it's a little bit hard to say for sure exactly how much we may want to spend on new acquisitions. But again, we are focused on oil opportunities, we are -- and we're focused on building significant scale in these opportunities when we can. We want to build positions that are meaningful for a company the size of Devon. And so when we see this type of opportunity, we're -- we'll make an evaluation on the economics, and if it's justified, we will pursue it. Now exactly what that means in terms of total acreage or lease acquisition costs in 2012, it's still a little bit early to say. And we're in the process of putting together a couple new areas right now, but we need to see how they develop to say exactly what that number may be.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the $225 million does not include anything on this new oil stealth play or any other stealth plays you may pursue?","David A. Hager","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Given your diverse horizontal breadth in the Permian Basin, can you just comment on how you see the relative rates of return in the various horizontal opportunities and what you would need to see a further raise or shifts to your rig counts, specifically the Wolfcamp Shale in the Midland Basin, how that looks in your mind versus the Wolfcamp Shale in the Delaware Basin versus the Bone Spring in Avalon?","David A. Hager","Well, I'd say that, in our mind, that the Wolfcamp Shale in the Midland Basin, the Bone Springs and the Wolfberry all offer strong rates for return to us. The Wolfcamp Shale in the Delaware Basin so far has been more gas oriented, and so obviously, at these depressed prices, that is not drawing the attention of our capital near the way the other 3 plays are. But I wouldn't try to differentiate too much between those other 3 plays because they all offer strong rates of return.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then my follow-up is you talked about the 5 Pike projects in your release at 35,000 barrels a day each. Can you just refresh us on the timing that you see? And how, if at all, the CapEx per flow in barrel, might be different than what you're seeing at Jackfish 2?","David A. Hager","Yes, the first phase of camp [ph] Pike, which again would be essentially 3 Jackfish-sized projects we anticipate, we anticipate filing for a regulatory approval sometime in 2013 or so and then have a first steam for that perhaps late 2015 and then full-scale operations late 2016, early 2017. The fourth and fifth Jackfish-sized projects in Pike are still awaiting full delineation, and it's a little bit hard to say exactly what the timing they would be until we have those fully delineated; probably sometime out closer to the 2020 range to really to achieve production on those. As far as the costs go, I think we're anticipating similar costs, but there is obviously some cost inflation pressure that's taking place up there. And there's a tightness of skills, a tightness of labor up there. So each one of these are probably a little bit higher than Jackfish due to those inflationary pressures.","Vincent W. White","Brian, this is Vince. I might add that the long-term forecast we gave through 2020 for thermal oil production doesn't include any contribution from any Pike projects beyond this 105,000 barrels per day that we expect to take to, into the regulatory process in the -- sometime this year.","David A. Hager","Okay, that ends today's call. For those of you that we did not get to your questions, the IR staff and other members of management will be available throughout the day to take your questions. And thanks for participating.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7067":["Devon Energy Corp.

Welcome to Devon Energy's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will a question-and-answer session. This call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you and good morning. I hope everyone had the chance to review our financial and operational disclosures that were released last night. This data package includes our earnings release, forward-looking guidance, and detailed operations report.","Additionally, for today's call, we have slides to supplement our prepared remarks. These slides are available on our website, and we will make sure to refer to the slide number during our prepared remarks so that everyone can follow along.","With today's call, I will cover a few preliminary items. Then our President and CEO, Dave Hager, will provide his thoughts on the key takeaways from the quarter. Following Dave, Tony Vaughn, our Chief Operating Officer, is going to cover a few key operational highlights and review our infill development strategy in the STACK. And then we'll wrap up our prepared remarks with a brief financial review by Jeff Ritenour, our Chief Financial Officer. Overall, this commentary should last around 10 minutes. Then we'll open the call for Q&A.","I would like to remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call today will contain plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially. For a review of risk factors, please see our Form 10-K.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Hager.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you and good morning, everyone. For the purpose of today's call, my comments will be centered on four key messages.","Turning to slide 2. The first key message is that we are raising our 2018 guidance for U.S. oil production due to the outstanding operational performance we are experiencing in the Delaware and STACK. With this production raise, the midpoint of our updated guidance for 2018 U.S. oil production now represents an estimated growth rate of 16% compared to 2017, up from our previous guidance of 14%.","The improved outlook is driven by higher well productivity, as our development activity is focused in the economic core of the Delaware and STACK, and the efficiency gains we are achieving at our multi-zone developments. With our initial multi-zone developments, we have executed these projects with greater efficiency than planned, which is compressing cycle times and pulling forward incremental activity into 2018.","Given this outstanding execution, it is likely upstream capital spending will trend toward the top half of our full year guidance range, benefiting our production profile in 2018 and 2019.","I want to emphasize the only reason CapEx is trending towards the top end of guidance is because we're completing our plan 2018 program quicker than anticipated, and we'll most likely accelerate some 2019 program into 2018. This is a good news story.","The next key point is we have the marketing arrangements and supply chain in place to deliver on our growth plans. With regional takeaway constraints becoming a serious issue for the industry, our marketing plan has provided us both flow assurance and price protection across all areas of our asset portfolio. Specifically in the Delaware Basin, through firm transport on the Longhorn Pipeline, we have access to premium Gulf Coast oil pricing and have regional basis swaps near WTI pricing covering the remaining production sold in the basin.","These physical and financial hedges are becoming increasingly valuable with Midland differentials currently trending towards $10 off WTI.","Given our advantaged location in Southeast New Mexico, we also have good line of sight to move our Delaware gas production, as we flow our volumes directly to the West Coast completely avoiding the WAHA hub.","In the STACK, we have direct access to Cushing for WTI pricing. And we have firm transport agreements covering the vast majority of our gas production. The firm transport of gas in the STACK and our basis swaps provide effective price protection in 2018.","The last area I will touch on is our attractive WCS hedges in Canada. In 2018 we have roughly half of our production hedged at $15 off WTI.","On the supply chain front, the service market is certainly tight right now, especially in the Permian Basin. However, our supply chain team has proactively secured rigs, supplies, and pressure pumping services in our high activity basins at competitive prices to execute our capital plans in 2018 and 2019.","The multi-year develop plans and commodity hedging program we've designed for the Delaware and STACK have provided Devon the opportunity to secure longer term relationships at below market rates with top providers.","So to summarize, Devon is in great shape to deliver on our growth initiatives, as our marketing and supply chain are providing certainty of execution.","The third key message is that Devon will efficiently grow cash flow throughout the remainder of 2018. With current strip prices, we expect to increase our upstream cash flow by approximately 35% by year end compared to first quarter levels.","This will be driven by three factors. A key contributor to our cash flow growth is an increase in higher oil margin production in the U.S., where we are on pace to deliver exit rate growth of approximately 30% in 2018.","Next, we expect higher margins in Canada over the remainder of 2018, due to WCS prices recently improving by more than $10 per barrel compared to the lows experienced in Q1.","The third factor contributing to higher margins over the remainder of 2018 is the aggressive steps we are taking to improve our cost structure. With the ongoing restructuring of our workforce, along with the recent tender of high interest debt, we are now on pace to reduce G&A and interest costs by $175 million annually.","And my final key message is we successfully advanced several shareholder friendly initiatives during the quarter. In March, our Board of Directors approved a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend and authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program, which we are on pace to complete by year end. Jeff will provide more details on these initiatives later in the call.","Looking ahead, as we generate free cash flow from operations and asset sale proceeds, we will continue the return of cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase program and growth in the dividend.","Given the potential for significant cash inflows through asset sales, I'd like to provide additional clarity to our portfolio simplification strategy.","Moving to slide 3. As we discussed at length in the past, given our resource rich asset base in the Delaware and STACK, we see the potential to monetize in excess of $5 billion of noncore assets. And while we've already achieved $1.1 billion of noncore asset sales to-date, we have multiple initiatives underway at various levels of maturity to further simplify and focus our portfolio footprint.","To be clear, we're not going to become a Delaware and STACK pure play. But we are targeting a more focused asset portfolio. We are actively pursuing larger asset transactions. And we are concurrently marketing roughly $1 billion of smaller, noncore assets sales throughout our portfolio.","While there are a lot of initiatives going on, I do want to emphasize that we're working each of these opportunities with a high sense of urgency.","And with this point I'll turn the call over to Tony Vaughn for additional commentary on our operations.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Dave. I'd like to begin by covering a few noteworthy operating highlights on slide 4. A great place to start is with our Delaware and STACK assets, which delivered 20% plus oil growth in the quarter, a driving force behind our Q1 oil production beat.","This strong growth was driven by record setting well productivity. For the quarter this activity was headlined by two stunningly prolific Boundary Raider wells in the Delaware Basin that achieved a combined 24-hour IP rate of approximately 24,000 BOEs per day, of which approximately 80% is oil. 24,000 BOEs per day. These are the highest rate wells brought on in the 100-year history of the Delaware Basin.","The STACK also delivered outstanding new wells with the most prolific rates belonging to four wells from our Coyote development that delivered average 30-day IPs of 4,400 BOEs per day per well.","We also had a strong quarter of efficiency gains, as we shifted towards multi-zone developments. In the Delaware, this included record drill times at Boomslang and drilling improvements at Seawolf that translated into savings of $800,000 per well. In the STACK, our Showboat execution was exceptional, as we attained first production 40 days ahead of plan.","Overall, a great start to the year for our capital programs. And these outstanding well results reflect the quality of our underlying asset base and our staff's top tier operating capabilities. I'm very proud of the effort that they have put in this quarter.","Moving to slide 5. I'd like to focus my remaining commentary on a subject that is of great interest to our investor base right now, and that is our STACK infill spacing strategy.","As many of you who follow the play closely know, our STACK acreage position resides in the economic core of the play within the volatile oil window. This sweet spot delivers the best combination of high oil productivity and lower well cost.","Devon's asset quality, technology leadership, and technical understanding of the play have consistently produced best-in-class well results in the play, which compete very well for capital within our high quality asset portfolio.","Now that our leasehold drilling is largely complete, the next step for our STACK asset is to optimize the infill spacing with our multi-zone development projects. With more than 95% of our Meramec resource undeveloped, the next three projects \u2013 Showboat, Horsefly, and Bernhardt \u2013 are designed to inform our future development strategy.","These projects will test development concepts, including well densities of 9 to 12 wells per drilling unit, and are designed to improve returns through multi-layer well stacking, intra-layer well staggering, and further completion design improvements.","The most advanced of the initial infill projects is our Showboat development. Showboat is in the early stages of flowing back. And we are excited with the efficiency gains and cost savings we achieved compared to the legacy parent well drilling results.","Drilling times were 30% faster, and we had a 2 times improvement in completion stages per day due to the benefits of zipper fracking. Due to these efficiencies, we achieved cost savings of $1.5 million per well at Showboat versus legacy activity in the area.","For a better understanding of vertical and horizontal communication between wells at Showboat, we are staggering well tie-ins over the next two months and expect to obtain peak rates by mid-year.","Even with conservative well productivity assumptions for our next three infill projects, we are projecting burdened wellhead returns of 40% at today's strip pricing.","These will be great projects for Devon. With a lower capital and LOE cost associated with these multi-zone developments, we expect our go-forward infill development returns to be superior to the historic well results in the play.","And in addition to the strong project level economics, I would like to emphasize that we have a huge runway of resource and inventory, providing a multi-decade growth opportunity for Devon.","We have 130,000 net acres in the core oil window of the play with most of these acres possessing multiple landing zones that are highly economic at today's prices. We have conservatively risked our Meramec inventory at six wells per surface section. But we fully expect infill drilling results to increase our inventory over time.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Tony. As Dave mentioned in the opening, I will provide an update on the shareholder return initiatives underway at Devon and will touch on our debt position and interest cost.","However, first I'd like to cover the new revenue recognition accounting rules that changed the way our financial statements present certain processing fees for natural gas and natural gas liquids.","Historically, these processing fees have been recorded as a reduction to revenue. But beginning this quarter, the fees were recorded directly to production expense. This accounting change had no impact to earnings or cash flow, but the change did result in increased upstream revenues and increased production expenses.","Our historical results have not been restated in our financials. But we have provided a table in our earnings release restating the historical result so the quarter-over-quarter trend is evident.","Moving to slide 6. In March, we announced our $1 billion share repurchase program. To date, we have repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $33 per share, bringing the total cost of our program to $204 million. We expect to complete this stock repurchase program by the end of 2018.","In addition to our share repurchase authorization, our board also approved a 33% increase in our quarterly common dividend. The new quarterly dividend rate will be $0.08 per share, compared to the prior quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share.","From a dividend policy perspective, we are targeting a manageable payout ratio of 5% to 10% of our upstream operating cash flow. With our upstream business well-positioned to efficiently expand cash flow for the foreseeable future, we expect to reward shareholders by sustainably paying and steadily growing the dividend over time.","Turning to our debt position. We successfully repurchased $807 billion (sic) [$807 million] (15:42) of notes in the first quarter, reducing our gross upstream debt to $6.1 billion. Strategically, this repurchase focused on higher coupon maturities in an effort to lower our go-forward interest expense by $64 million annually.","Looking ahead, with the retirement of the $277 million debt that will mature over the next nine months, we will have completed our $1 billion debt reduction plan.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott.","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. We'll now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have further questions, you can reprompt as time permits. With that, operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is open. Bob Morris?","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Very nice results this morning, Dave.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","As things are running ahead of schedule and you look to pull some activity forward from 2019, I know previously you were planning on dropping three to four rigs at year end. Is that still the case? Or are you going to keep all 20 of the current rigs that you have operating going to the end of the year now?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, we're still making an assessment on that, Bob, and exactly what we're going to do. The thing that we like so much is that we have, with these multi-zone developments, that we are seeing such efficiencies by maintaining the same rigs, the same crews, that we are actually executing our program quicker than we \u2013 we knew there was going to be efficiencies. But we're seeing even more than we anticipated. The costs are lower and the efficiencies are greater.","So what we are really focused on overall are the returns. And we don't want to risk degrading those returns by dropping very efficient rigs and crews. And then picking up potentially new rigs and crews at the beginning of 2019, where we don't see as much efficiencies as we're currently seeing with the program.","So that's the thought process we're thinking through. We have a decision to make here. And we're making the comments, we're kind of guiding towards the top end of guidance, because we think that probably some of this were going to continue on. But exactly how much of it, we're still making a final decision. It has to do with the maturity of the projects.","But a key point I want to emphasize, it's a returns based decision to make sure the projects are ready and balanced out with the efficiencies we're receiving with these rigs and crews, versus the risk of losing that if we drop the rigs.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sure. That makes sense. Thanks. And my follow-up question is, you had a small, but very interesting joint venture you announced in the Barnett Shale. And is that something you'll continue to look to do more of, given what the environment is for natural gas asset packages out there in the market? Or how do you think about that, versus stability to continue to monetize the Barnett and doing more of these such deals? Does that necessarily preclude you from continuing to look to monetize the Barnett, even parts that might be subject to some of these sort of deals?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah. Great question, Bob. And I want to be clear. This does not change anything with regards to the potential long term strategy of what we do with the Barnett.","This is just we think a very creative business opportunity to take an asset that has identified development opportunities and to form relationship with a great company, such as DowDuPont, where we essentially are now bringing them in on a promoted basis to drill some wells that otherwise we would not execute. So it'd just be an asset that we're not maximizing the value of with these pud opportunities just sitting there.","So we are bringing them in with the promote. It makes the returns to Devon competitive with the rest of our portfolio. So it's we think a great way to bring value forward in the short term. But in no way does this change our optionality or decision process in regards to what we'll do with the Barnett in the long term. We're still working through that.","Obviously it's more challenged at these lower natural gas prices. Also provides benefit to EnLink, which accrues back to us as well obviously by additional provided incremental EBITDA, of which we are the majority benefit.","So we think it's a real great shorter term solution and decision that brings value. We like DowDuPont. And there may be possibilities that we can expand this relationship in the future for similar type situations.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, that's great. Thanks a lot, Dave. Appreciate it.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. Tony, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the three spacing pilots. And you mentioned that you kind of conservatively risked the production from these pilots. And I was just wondering if you could maybe comment a little bit around your risking for the projects.","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, Arun, I think we've commented in the past that we've got quite an extensive library of information and participated in about a dozen different pilots in the play.","These are three more projects that we have that are going to fill in some key data points with us. I have to tell you \u2013 and I'm going to turn the call over to Wade Hutchings in just a minute, who is managing that asset base for us. But, Arun, there's more to it. It's a more complicated question when we manage these unconventional reservoirs than just simple spacing. And Wade will be able to dial into that a bit.","But we fully utilize this database that we have. We built the 3D earth models. We put a lot of time and attention into the technical competency that we put into it, at least to the optimum design and also leads to the granular attention to execution that we have in our technical groups.","You're seeing some prolific well results in both the Coyote areas and across STACK, and the same thing in the Delaware Basin. None of that's really by accident. It's all by just competency and technical fact based work that the guys are doing.","So, Wade, why don't you describe a little bit more what you're trying to get out of the pilots? Maybe even explain a little bit of how we work in the greenfield and the brownfield type areas.","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure. Thank you, Tony. When we look at these three projects that we've highlighted here, we certainly have a range of spacing that we're testing, all the way from 12 wells per section in Showboat to 10 wells per section at Horsefly, and then 9 at Bernhardt.","All three of those projects are in the core of the Meramec play. All three of them are landing in the best reservoir, which is essentially what we call the Meramec 200. And then they all are staggering wells in between a couple zones just lower than that core reservoir.","So they're all testing roughly the same reservoirs but at slightly different staggering and well spacing. And we anticipate learning a lot from these, in addition to the other industry and non-operated investments we've made.","Ultimately, we're testing a lot more than spacing though, because we recognize that the stimulation approach in an infill mode needs to be different than it was in the parent HBP mode. And so we're testing multiple things in each one of these projects. We'll certainly give you a lot more detail on that as those projects come online.","But we're really looking at how do we optimize the stimulation spend to get the most value out of each of these projects. The Showboat particularly is one where we've invested a lot of science dollars around monitoring the pressure between wells and between layers and trying to determine if the tweaks we're making to our stimulation design are being effective or not.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's really helpful. I wanted to shift gears a little bit, talk about the asset sales program. Dave, you highlighted kind of multiple packages, maybe $1 billion of potential proceeds. We also note that I think 28,000 acres of that is in kind of the central Delaware Basin.","But as you receive some asset sale proceeds, what is the first call on that cash to the extent you get to that $1 billion? How do you plan to invest that capital?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","We see the bulk of that going to share repurchases.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could follow-up. I appreciate all the detail you just gave on Showboat, focused a lot on the below ground stuff. You clearly had a very encouraging performance on cost and efficiencies on the larger development there. Can you talk a little bit about above ground, what you've seen in terms of your ability to drive down cost and capture efficiencies? And what you think that means for your programs going forward?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Ryan, this is Tony. I think we've talked over the last probably two years about this multi-zone concept. And we felt like all told, we had the ability to increase our valuations about \u2013 up about 40% in comparison to the historic or the legacy type development concepts that you see across these basins.","And we fully expect to have not only just surface efficiencies associated with quicker and more efficient permitting with larger permits being established at the onset, because we have a full surface description of how we're going to flow into the centralized production facilities.","We are designing these, and a concept we have here is really a drill-to-fill concept. And so what you will see in these general areas is we'll build a centralized production facility that'll be able to handle multi-pads as we go forward. And so while we will not design for a peak rate on a given pad, we'll design for a very efficient and cost effective design that will maximize the rate of return for that project.","And then as additional pads come on, they will flow back into that same centralized production facility.","So if you start looking at the burdened cost for all the developments that will ultimately flow into a common centralized tank battery, it's not going to be the $750,000, $800,000 per well when we were just doing the conventional legacy type work. It's going to be much more efficient than that.","And it varies project-by-project, but it'll certainly be below about $0.5 million per well. And that just continues to gain efficiencies as we go forward, because these centralized production facilities are structured to be around for a long period of time as the wells in the given area come on and maximize that space.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And so what you've seen so far, is it in line with the 40% uplift that you kind of envisioned over the past couple years?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Actually, Ryan, we knew we were going to be learning into this space. And we've completed one, the Anaconda Project in the Delaware Basin. We're virtually through the Showboat project in STACK. And we have other projects going on.","We're actually accelerating our learnings much quicker than what we anticipated. So we're quite encouraged with this. We know this is the direction that we're going to go. We're already starting to look at \u2013 potentially we have about 30 different projects that are in one stage of our project management or another.","And so we're approving projects and reviewing projects right now all the way out into mid and late 2019. So this is really a well-oiled machine. And the efficiencies associated with this concept are coming quicker and are probably larger than what we originally anticipated.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","So, Ryan, Tony described a surface facility savings. Obviously we've previously talked about the drilling cost savings as well. And then also we are seeing real efficiencies on the hydraulic fracturing side too.","And, Wade, I think you have a stat probably just for example at Showboat on the stimulation side of how much more efficient we are with that versus historical.","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure, Dave. Specific to Showboat, what we found there was essentially we completed the stimulation of that project in about essentially two-thirds of the time that we had planned.","So we anticipated some of those efficiencies, as Dave noted. But we were pleasantly surprised that we found even faster learning curve than we had anticipated.","And really want to give the team a lot of credit for that. I mean a lot of hard work out in the field executing these programs and being willing to lean forward and try to do things a different way to get better results.","So we essentially drove our stages per day up by 2 times from what we had done in the past. And that really accelerated the early production that we saw from this project so far.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe a quick follow up. We appreciate the incremental clarity on takeaway capacity and pricing out of the Permian Basin.","I mean can you \u2013 it looks like you're quite well situated until, as we look from now into through the bulk of 2019. Can you talk about how you see \u2013 how you balance the need for the potential to sign up for incremental FT out of the Permian beyond that, versus maintaining longer term flexibility?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah. And I'm going to ask \u2013 we have several people here we're going to let talk, because they're the real experts on this. And so, Ryan, I'm going to ask Kevin Lafferty, who heads up our midstream and marketing business here, to give you a little more granular answer on that.","Kevin D. Lafferty - Devon Energy Corp.","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, Ryan. Yeah, as we noted in the ops report on slide 13, we have put ourselves in a really good position. And this is a strategy we have in place with all of our key products across all of our plays both in the U.S. and Canada.","So we use a combination of both physical or firm transport and financial hedging to really mitigate risk of both flow assurance and making sure that we can have dollars go to the bottom line.","So as we've noted on slide 13, especially for the Permian and starting with oil, so we transport on Longhorn. And that gets a certain amount of barrels out of the basin and over to the Magellan East Houston marker, where the pricing, as Dave noted in his comments, is stronger. And we're actually building out our MEH hedge book as well, just to lock that in and have certainty of cash flow there.","And then the rest of the sales, we have a little bit to go in the local refineries. And the key here, and it's an intangible for us, but our marketing group both in the U.S. and in Calgary do a really good job of building relationships with key people. So we are selling our products, not just oil but gas as well, to other people that have firm transportation to make sure that our product is going to get to market.","And then of course we highlighted that we have financially hedged both in 2018 and 2019 at just under $1 and then $0.50 a barrel.","What we see though is that you have a whole another wave of pipes that are going to come online in 2019, probably starting first with the Cactus line in mid-2019, and several other projects have been announced. So this strategy solidly gets us through this period of tightness, where again as Dave commented, the differentials have blown out pretty substantially. And then we will continue on this strategy, shipping, downstream, and\/or financial hedging as we go forward.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, Dave, to you and the rest of your team there. I would like to ask, I know you guys touched on the Boundary Raider wells, those really remarkable wells in the Delaware Basin. But can you talk a little bit about what led you to target this area? And perhaps elaborate a bit on how those results came in versus your pre-drill? And what if anything has changed on your view in that zone or that area or in any respect?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Sure, Charles. And I'm going to ask \u2013 again we have several people in here. We're going to ask Rick Gideon, who is our Senior Vice President in charge of the Delaware Basin and Rockies, to comment further.","But I just want to make one thing really clear before he goes into his comment. You didn't ask this, but I'm going to make it really clear.","This is not due to us opening the chokes up really wild to get a huge 24-hour IP. This is truly an exceptional area, where we're seeing not only great wells with strong pressures, but also you can anticipate the EURs on these area \u2013 wells in this area to be two to three times what our normal type curve is out there. So this is truly an outstanding area that we have discovered.","So, Rick, you want to talk a little bit more about it?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Absolutely. Thank you, Dave. And great question, Charles. I was hoping somebody would ask about these wells.","How did we find them? Well, I'll tell you. I think we have the best technical teams in the industry working these basins. And these teams are focused on identifying the best parts of these basins or the sweet spots.","So when we went into this, this was an identified sweet spot. We were aware these wells would be much better than typical wells. I think they surprised us a bit that they were even better than what we thought.","As Dave indicated from a choke management, we did nothing different than we typically do on any of our wells from a choke management standpoint. None of these wells were opened to full open chokes. They were managed in order to maintain the value of the reservoir.","And as we've identified this, as we said in the operations report, we have additional wells we'll be drilling in this area over the next 1.5 years.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And I guess, Rick, has it changed your view on other sweet spots you've identified in the Second Bone Springs, or is it \u2013 are there things you're going to be doing differently going forward, having seen what these wells actually delivered?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","I think it's confirmed our view. I don't know that this changed our view. We knew what we were looking for. The teams did a great job again in identifying the different metrics to make these better wells.","On top of that it was the outstanding execution of these wells and the ability to flow these back into a large battery and test them.","So I don't know that it changed it, but it did affirm our views. And I think we'll continue to identify these throughout all of our basins.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","And, Charles, maybe to help out, give a little context of I think where you may be going with this too. First, there is obviously a great area. We are going to have to build out the infrastructure more in the area. And we're going to be building that out commensurate with drilling the wells.","We think we have about 25 wells in this area. We can't say they're all going to be this good, but we think they're all going to be well above our type curve. And we feel really good that we've identified a sweet spot here.","The production impact of this is going to be more a \u2013 and the biggest part is going to be more of a late 2018 on into 2019 and beyond type impact, just given the timing of the drilling of these wells and actually bringing them online.","So it obviously has impacted a little bit here our results already by that and other wells allowing us to raise our production guidance. And frankly, we see some upside to our production guide, U.S. oil production guidance as we continue to execute throughout the year.","But the bulk of the benefit will be late 2018, 2019, and beyond as we bring these wells on. So, Tony, you had one more comment on that?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, Charles, it's hard for me to keep quiet on this. We've talked to you quite a bit over the last couple years. But really made this data driven approach, a big shift in our mentality about three \u2013 probably three, four years ago. It's really coming to fruition right now.","And so as Rick mentioned, these weren't random events. These were well planned. And we're seeing this across all the areas that we work, not just in the Boundary Raider localized area, not just in the Coyote area. But you're starting to see what we've always claimed and since late 2015 and beyond. We've always been number one in IP90s, which we feel like is the best time to approach and estimate the ultimate recovery and value of a well.","So we're starting to see an expansion of our results going forward. And so we couldn't be prouder from a leadership perspective of the technical work that our teams are really doing. We think this is really culminating some good across the board type work.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Well, Tony, Dave, and Rick, thanks for all that added commentary. It's helpful.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, just maybe a dumb question. But in the presentation, page 8, I just want to clarify something where you say, actively pursuing larger asset transactions. Is that a distinct bullet point from the bullet below it, about the $1 billion that's out there for sale? Or is there \u2013 or is it a just intro to that bullet? So just trying to understand if there's other asset sales that are in the initial stages that are not described on that page. And secondly, if it disqualifies acquisitions.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, it is a distinct bullet. So that we are \u2013 and let me try to frame the whole question up.","So when we say we anticipate more than $5 billion of potential asset sale proceeds, we have executed already on the first $1 billion of that. And that culminated in the Johnson County sale in the Barnett.","The second $1 billion are what we are marketing this year. And that is high multiple properties, such as the acreage that we have on the Texas Delaware side. It's not part of our long term development plan within the Delaware, but we think has a significant value. You don't have a lot of production there. We think it has significant value in the marketplace, so obviously that's a very high multiple property, since it's primarily undrilled acreage. So that and some other asset sales are the second $1 billion. And we're going to plan to execute that largely here in 2018.","Beyond that, we are looking at some strategic transactions of larger magnitude and actively working some of those as we speak. We are purposely being nonspecific on what those are, because we are saying that the primary growth engines of the company in the future are the Delaware Basin, the STACK, and the Rockies.","We are looking at other areas where frankly we see undeveloped opportunities that we may not be maximizing the value of within our own portfolio, because of the extreme high quality that we have of development opportunities. But yet, they're other opportunities that other companies, may be worth more in their portfolio than are worth in our portfolio.","So we are currently in discussions on some of these larger transactions. Now the reason we aren't being more specific is because in several of these situations there's a limited buyer universe frankly. And so we want to make sure that we maintain the power and that we have \u2013 and we have optionality around which of these we may actually execute on, to maximize the value that we receive for the shareholders.","So we have some ideas around it. We're going to be \u2013 I'm going to continue to be non-specific on that though, so that we can maximize that transaction value.","And we do have options obviously. We don't have to go one way or another. We have options on which way we may go. But we are actively pursuing other opportunities of a more strategic nature to reach that $5 billion number in total.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. My follow-up is, any more color you can provide on the proprietary completion techniques you've identified before in STACK? And maybe an update on whether it was applied in some of these wells this quarter? And whether it's being applied in the Delaware?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","This is Rick Gideon. Absolutely, we continue in both areas to progress the tight spacing of clusters, the number of clusters, the rates, the sand volumes, the sweeps, multi, multi variables.","Again, our technical teams currently model these. We watch the production and flow back and continue to optimize these. So very similar in STACK and Delaware, the different techniques we're using, you're seeing it in the results of all of our wells. That, tied along with the real-time monitoring of our completions and the real-time monitoring of our flow back, is providing the better wells that you're seeing.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Rick, I'm curious if it's still a discrete application? Or if we should assume that's sort of being applied across the program?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","It's being applied similarly across the program. I never want you to think that every completion we pump in every horizon across every basin is the same. Everyone has a discrete part to it, but they're all very \u2013 way that we're executing.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","I think the key thing is that we are communicating constantly across all of our business units. So there, we have completions experts that look across the entire company. And so they may apply different techniques in different areas, but it's out of knowledge of what is the best technique for each of those areas. It's not due to lack of communication.","And the other thing is I've heard described, and this is my explanation of it. That sometimes you hear people talk about frac 1.0 or frac 2.0 or things like that. To my mind the best way we do it internally is almost like frac continuous, because we are constantly updating our actual techniques based on the real time information that we're receiving on all of our completions.","And so it is \u2013 we have a continuous improvement program that is truly real time, even on individual wells. And so it's hard to describe it as a discrete one change that we've made, and we're going to go with that change across the entire program, because that's not the way we work.","The way we work is through our 24\/7\/365 drilling and well control room and flowback room that we are constantly updating how we're doing it. So...","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Well, great update, guys. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with TPH. Your line is open.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Morning, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","From a gas perspective you've been able to secure a strong level of flow assurance by transporting volumes to the West Coast in 2018. As your and industry volumes accelerate regionally, and as capacity west-bound likely toughs out, how does Devon view its medium term strategy around gas marketing and the potential need for FT to clear the basin?","Kevin D. Lafferty - Devon Energy Corp.","Hi, Matt. This is Kevin Lafferty again. First of all, let me walk through, all the way through the value chain just to try and be clear about this.","On the upstream side \u2013 and when I say that, I'm referring to getting the gas from our wellhead and site to the gas processing plant. We think that there is an ample amount and a strong amount of new build gas processing that's happening both in New Mexico but largely even on the Texas side, which really gives us plenty of access to gas processing. So we don't see any constraints there at all.","When it gets to the residue side, Dave's comments, really the way that we market our gas and the benefit we have being in New Mexico, is that we can tie-in relatively easy to very large pipes. This would be El Paso and Transwestern and Northern Natural and others that tend to go west and move a lot of volume out west. And so any limitations that we would have are really mitigated just because of location and geography.","So we have contemplated whether or not we need to look at firm, and different projects are being built. We're pleased to see the Kinder Morgan project, Gulf Coast Express, move forward and have shipper commitments. And there are a lot of other projects that are going to follow that to get gas out of the basin. So right now we feel like we can sell into other people that have firm capacity.","But we look at taking firm on gas the same way we do on oil. And we're always considering those projects and what it means for us.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And my second question is a follow-up to some of the color you provided on cost savings. We've seen pretty material savings announced on Anaconda and Steamboat from an efficiency perspective. I was wondering how much that's factored into your 2018 capital program. And as you continue to progress your learnings, how is this kind of factored into your long term views around your free cash flow guidance?","Kevin D. Lafferty - Devon Energy Corp.","Matt, this is Kevin again. I'm first going to start and then hand off either to Tony or Dave here. But let me first talk about our procurement and supply chain strategy. So this is \u2013 and we've talked a lot about our decoupling efforts. This has been a differentiator for us.","We still see going from Q4 of 2017 to Q4 of 2018, while the industry is inflating at double digit type of numbers, especially in the Permian, because of all the increased activity headed to the Permian, we have largely taken control of our own destiny. And we still see a low single digit type of inflationary number, because of our approach and the debundling and how we've locked in contracts and secured services.","So for us when you combine that with the efficiencies on the drilling in the frac side, we literally see no inflation for the rest of our 2018 program. And as we've stated on pages 13 and 19 in the ops report, we continue to lock in these services and contract out throughout 2019 as well to really place ourselves in a good situation.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","And, Matt, maybe going specifically to your question. Kevin gave you a great description of overall what we're doing.","But specifically to your question, I would say largely what Kevin talked about is baked into our capital comments already. So it's really more about the efficiencies that we're getting in the projects with those being executed quicker than anticipated. This just means we have the opportunity to do more activity than we anticipated. And that's where, as I said before, we're looking at a decision point based on returns as to what the right decision is on that.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Dave, I wonder if I could go back to the STACK development plan longer term. I guess I must be the only one that's still confused with 12 wells per section in Showboat, but 6 wells per section on your assumed inventory. Clearly there's some upside risk there.","How do you think about the development plan going forward as it relates to not leaving any of those sections undeveloped? Because obviously if you're going to pursue a Showboat, Bernhardt, Horsefly type of model going forward, the risked backlog, location backlog presumably has to go materially higher. Can you just frame that for me?","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah. And it's a great question, Doug, as one that our teams wrestle with to come up with. And there's no perfect answer to that question.","But I think the thing I would say first is that we are more focused on returns and rate of return of our project than anything else.","Now having said that, it is we do look at the overall NPV or NPV per dollar invested in the project. And if we're seeing a degradation of the NPV per dollar invested in a project, then that's when we get to the point where we say, well, our spacing or whatever else we're doing has perhaps reached a limit. And then we shouldn't go any further.","Now early on, it's important to remember, we're so early on in the appraisal and the development of the STACK play, where 95% of the wells are still in front of us. So we are testing the limits on some of these. And then we'll optimize more as we move forward.","But in general, it's a program that focuses on returns, NPV over I and maximizing from that standpoint, not only on spacing but all the other things, all the other factors that come into it.","So there is upside obviously. I mean we're doing 12 wells per section in Showboat. They don't all look like Showboat necessarily. Then there's going to be variability across the program. But obviously there is we think longer term upside to the six wells per section. Wade, do you want to add anything to that?","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","I think the only thing I would add, Dave, is that it's important I think to understand the recent historic development of the play, in that a lot of the early estimates for the play and even our last set of official guidance around six wells per section, that was done under the context of, in each section there's clearly a best reservoir target.","And as we have prosecuted the play and appraised the edges and appraised different landing zones, the upside we saw is that more than one landing zone in most of these sections is productive and economically competitive. And so clearly that likely will increase overall inventory for the play.","And so we're obviously purposely testing that in each of these developments this year. When we finish those, we'll be able to kind of put our pencil down and provide revised guidance around what we think our inventory numbers will be and what our actual full field development plan will be in the core of the play.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys, I don't want to labor this point. But just to be clear, Wade, you enter a process of updating type curves over the last year or so. I'm guessing that's just a grossly over simplistic way of looking at this full field development. But I just want to be clear. Was that a full field devolvement type curve? Or was that like a single parent test type curve that you had given out previously?","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","Well, this is Scott. I'll explain the nature of the type curve. And then maybe Wade could provide some additional context.","But the type curve that we put out over a year ago was predicated on largely a parent leasehold drilling with some modest infill spacing assumptions in the upper Meramec zone, which is the top reservoir target in the volatile oil core. That being said, I'll hand it over to Wade, and any context of how you think about it going forward.","Wade Hutchings - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think that your comment about a single type curve been overly simplistic is spot on. Because as I've noted, we now have multiple landing zones that we're going to target in each section. Those different landing zones have slightly different reservoir properties.","We also are mindful that we've shifted from a parent well, developed \u2013 or a parent well approach to now we're doing full field infill development. And I really reference back to Dave's comments around trying to maximize the return and capital efficiency of every dollar we spend.","So ultimately, we are likely going to be willing in some places to take a little bit lower EUR per well, as we can drive even lower capital costs per well. And so we're really working to find the sweet spot balance there.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very, very clear.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","All right. Just say, Doug, don't forget about the capital efficiencies. We are \u2013 these are great questions around the type curve. But also the capital efficiencies that we're getting with these developments are really driving the returns higher.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I think your partner, Continental [Resources], laid it out pretty well last quarter. I think we know where we're headed with this.","Scott, that wasn't question two. My follow-up is really just a very quick strategic question, Dave. I don't want to put you on the spot too much on your strategy, your strategic asset sales and so on. But I wonder if I could just ask you to just opine quickly on your strategic commitment to Canada and the current EnLink ownership structure. And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Doug, as you might suspect, that's a great try from you. But I'm not going to get any more specific than I currently described on it. And so we have a lot of options around it. We understand these options really well. But I don't think it's in our best interest to be any more specific.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Awesome. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks, guys. Bye.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Going back to that probably debate from a great position with regards to efficiencies and CapEx. Definitely hear you, you don't want to lose the operational efficiencies and synergies.","Are there other areas within the capital program that become less core as a result of the efficiencies you're seeing in certain plays? And as you think big picture, when you see efficiencies or for that matter greater cash flow from higher oil prices, is it better to push growth in CapEx higher over the longer term? Or rather maintain growth with less CapEx, leaving more room for free cash flow and share repurchase?","Jeffrey L. Ritenour - Devon Energy Corp.","Hey, Brian, this is Jeff Ritenour. Yeah, I would say the latter. I mean that certainly is our game plan and approach. We're expecting to generate significant growth in cash flow as we work through the remainder of this year.","As Dave talked about, we may trend towards the higher end of our capital program. But we expect to generate significant free cash flow. And right now we have that excess free cash flow earmarked for share repurchase and return to the shareholders.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then I don't believe anyone has asked an Eagle Ford question. It's noticeable that you expect a bump higher in production during second quarter. I think you've commented in the past some of the best rate of return wells are in the Eagle Ford. Is that still the case? And while realizing there's a partner involved in the capital decision process, what do you see as the limitations to yourselves or anyone else running those assets, increasing activity?","Tony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.","Brian, we like the Eagle Ford. It does have the highest margin production in the company. It's got probably some of the most prolific returns of anything we do in the company. And it's extremely predictable. So we do like that.","I think we've talked in the past that we have a fairly narrow horizon associated with just the lower and the upper Eagle Ford opportunities. We're continuing to prosecute those. And you're seeing some IDs come on here shortly that will boost production over the previous quarter.","In addition to that we're getting a lot of maturity about the opportunities associated with the Austin Chalk and also an opportunity that we call redevelopment, where we can go back in and lay some wells and mitigate some of the partial pressure depletion we've had from some of the existing wells.","And so all told and on an unrisked basis, we still think there are 500, 600 wells out there that we're still chasing with additional data.","The relationship with BHP is very close and very tight. We feel like we're aligned on the technical side. They're going through a process right now. We have a couple of rigs working and some frac crews in the field. And we'll continue really about the pace that we are at right at this point. But we will be pushing and excited to see some data points come in second half this year, early 2019 in the Austin Chalk and the redevelopment concept. And we feel like that's going to open up a new opportunity for us in the project.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Morning.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Congratulations on the quarter.","David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Could you talk about the Second Bone siltstone a little bit. Seems like it's a new play that you brought out this quarter. How is it geologically unique, thickness, typical commodity mix? And in particular is it an additional Second Bone zone? Or is it substituting for some other [Second] Bone zone that maybe drops off elsewhere?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","Yeah, this is Rick Gideon again. It's an additional Second Bone zone. I will tell you, it depends on where you're at in the field on the thickness. It's a siltstone that sits at the top of our \u2013 between our First and Second Bone. It depends on where you're at.","But we're seeing good permanent porosity in this given area, enough H, as you see. I think we've called out a couple of wells there in our Boomslang area of around 1,700 BOE per day.","As we take a look, the size of the prize, it won't span across the entire basin. But it is prolific enough that we will continue to develop in this area.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great, yeah, that's helpful. And my second question, I was surprised to see the Parkman and the Teapot activity is driving growth in the quarter, plus the attractive low well cost. Because I thought the Rockies program was primarily focused on the Turner, so that may have been my mistake. But I was just wondering, is there an increasing interest in these other zones? Or were these wells sort of one-offs?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","This is Rick Gideon again. Those wells are not one-off. We are continuing to focus on the Turner.","While we're in our early appraisal in the Turner in our spacing, we're continuing to execute on our Teapot and Parkman wells, which we've executed historically on. You'll see us continue to bring some of those into the program, as we work up and down those channels and continue to bring on additional Turner wells.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","But is it safe to say that \u2013 because I know that you've talked about longer term you'd like to get to the point where you can get into some sort of manufacturing mode in the Rockies. And that's a little bit troublesome, because it tends to be sweet spots.","But is the overarching plan at this point to try to find the largest Turner area that you can develop in a way similar to what you're doing in the STACK and in the Delaware Basin? Then maybe exploit some of these Parkman\/Teapots as little sweet spots when they come up? Is that sort of the way to think of it?","Richard A. Gideon - Devon Energy Corp.","I think you stated that well. I would say we're looking at multiple Turner areas and multiple horizons in the Turner. So we're looking at how we can best develop, and you've seen some of our spacing tests in the upper and the lower Turner.","Let's not forget we're still looking at the Niobrara in that area also, which we think could have very large upside. But as we continue to execute through those programs, you will see some additional Parkman and Teapot.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. That's very clear. I appreciate it.","Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.","And we're now at the top of the hour. We appreciate everyone's interest in Devon today.

(Operator instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Vince White","Thank you, and welcome everyone to Devon\u2019s third quarter earnings call and webcast. Today\u2019s call will follow our usual format. I\u2019ll cover a few preliminary items, and then turn it over to our President and CEO, John Richels, he will provide comments on the quarter.

When we use these measures, we\u2019re required to provide certain related disclosures and those can be found on Devon\u2019s website.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels.","John Richels","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was another solid one for Devon, both, operationally and financially as we continued to deliver on our strategic plan. Higher oil production combined with better prices drove significant improvements in our margins, allowing us to comfortably exceed Wall Street expectations for both earnings and cash flow for the quarter. We achieved third quarter US oil production growth of 38% year-over-year, largely driven by success in our Permian Basin development programs.","Over the past two years we have doubled our light oil production in the US to 81,000 barrels per day and by yearend we expect our US light oil production to top 90,000 barrels per day. Most importantly, our success in growing our US light oil production has resulted in higher margins and improved profitability in the current commodity price environment.","Looking beyond the low-risk development projects that are driving today\u2019s growth, we\u2019re also investing in opportunities that will provide the next leg of high margin production growth for Devon. In the US, we\u2019re highly encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made with our Mississippi and Woodford and our Rockies oil plays, our light oil production in these plays is growing rapidly and it\u2019s currently approaching 20,000 barrels per day. Dave is going to speak to this later on in the call.","We\u2019re also laying the ground work for continued long-term growth with investments in our world-class portfolio of thermal oil projects in Canada. These projects remain on-track to produce at least 150,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of the decade. And this highly visible oil production growth out of Canada will be significant contributor to our long-term success.","Our company-wide focus on oil production is not only delivering volume growth but it\u2019s also improving our revenues and cash margins. In the third quarter, oil revenue increased 19% compared to last quarter, accounting for nearly 60% of our total upstream revenue. This growth in oil revenue has helped increase our cash margin per barrel by 16% year-over-year to its highest level in recent history.","Another contributing factor to our margin expansion has been our ability to effectively control costs. In the third quarter, our upstream cash cost per unit of production remained flat from last quarter. This is noteworthy considering our rapid growth in oil production. At the same time, our focus on capital discipline has resulted in total capital expenditures for 2013 remaining on-track with the full-year guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. And in the third quarter, cash inflows exceeded our capital demands.","On the liquidity front, we exited September with $4.3 billion of cash with the majority of these funds residing in foreign subsidiaries. Our tax position now affords us the opportunity to repatriate an addition $2 billion of cash to the US around year-end at a tax rate in the mid-single-digits; Jeff will speak to this in a little more detail later on in the call.","Finally, before I hand the call off to Dave, I\u2019d like to briefly review our recent announcement to combine substantially all of our US midstream assets with Crosstex to form a new midstream business. This strategic combination creates one of the largest midstream companies in the United States with assets located in some of the country\u2019s premier oil and gas regions. Devon will retain significant influence on the direction of the new company through our majority ownership interest in both the general partner and the MLP and majority representation on both boards. This transaction allows us to obtain a marked-based valuation for our US midstream business in a tax deferred manner that\u2019s immediately accredited to our shareholders. As you may recall, our contribution of midstream assets and resulting equity ownership in the new company was initially valued at $4.8 billion. Based on yesterday\u2019s closing prices, the market value of our ownership interest totals $6.6 billion or 16-times EBITDA of the contributed assets. This valuation equates to roughly 25% of Devon\u2019s current market capitalization.","Just as important, the transaction improved the growth trajectory of our midstream investment. A key component of our improved growth trajectory is Devon\u2019s 70% ownership in the new general partner. The new general partner will have incentive distribution rights in the MLP in the highest tier, allowing us to disproportionately increase our share of the MLP\u2019s distributable cash flow going forward. Additionally, the new company\u2019s investment grade credit profile will enable us to secure and execute sizable organic development and acquisition opportunities across the midstream value chain. This positions the new business to deliver attractive long-term growth in distributions.","Another significant advantage of this transaction is our improved capital efficiency. Upon closing of the transaction, future capital requirements associated with our contributed midstream assets will reside with the new company. This will lessen our overall capital intensity and preserve cash flow for our growing E&P upstream business. Furthermore any buildout of new midstream assets supporting our E&P business could be completed by the new company. This approach eliminates the capital call on Devon while allowing us to maintain influence over the development and management of the assets via our majority ownership of the new company.","Our relationship with the new company also provides us the opportunity to attractively sell additional midstream assets currently held or developed by Devon in a manner that's accretive to our shareholders. So overall the transaction in the resulting new company greatly accelerates the value proposition of Devon\u2019s previously announced standalone MLP and is another clear and successful example of our efforts to unlock value for our shareholders.","So in summary, we continue to successfully execute our business plan, both operationally and financially. This is evidenced by the continuation of strong oil production growth from our development projects and the progress we\u2019re making on emerging plays that will enhance our long-term oil and liquids growth profile.","Furthermore our pursuit of high-margin production, combined with effective management of operating and capital costs, is improving profitability. And finally, we took another significant step in unlocking unrealized, or unrecognized asset value within Devon through the formation of a new midstream business and the planned repatriation of an additional $2 billion at very favorable tax rates.","So at this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed review of our quarterly operational highlights. Dave?","David Hager","Thanks, John. As John mentioned, the third quarter was one of solid execution by our asset team, resulting in strong oil production growth. This growth in oil production, combined with effective cost management, allowed us to expand margins and grow cash flow.","Looking specifically at costs, our results year-to-date have benefited from our supply-chain efforts and improved drilling efficiencies. As a result, our service and supply costs have declined by roughly 5% compared to 2012. In addition, we are realizing cost savings through drilling efficiencies in each of our core operating regions, allowing us to complete our full year programs with fewer rigs than originally budgeted. Due to this enhanced productivity, as of the end of September, we had reduced our rig count by 10% from last quarter to 64 operated rigs.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the key operating highlights in the third quarter. Beginning with the Permian, our production averaged a record 82,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with light oil accounting for 60% of our total volumes. We are currently running 23 operated rigs in Permian and by year end, we expect to have drilled more than 350 wells for the full year.","In the Delaware Basin, our Bone Springs horizontal program continues to be a key driver of our Permian oil growth. We currently have 12 operated rigs working in the play. In the third quarter, we brought 24 Bone Springs wells online with average 30-day IP rates of 609 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which more than 70% was light oil. These production results are about 20% better than our tight well profile.","With a large portion of our acreage de-risked and in the development stage, pad drilling is playing an increasingly important role in our development plans. With current well costs already meeting our type well economics, we expect the efficiencies of pad drilling to further reduce costs and enhance our already outstanding Bone Springs returns. We have roughly 1,400 Bone Springs locations identified, and we fully expect that our ongoing drilling and geologic work in this top-tier light oil play will allow us to further increase our inventory over time.","Also in Delaware Basin, there have been a number of positive Wolfcamp wells drilled by other operators around our acreage in both Ward and Reeves County. In the fourth quarter, we expect to begin completing our first horizontal Wolfcamp test in Ward County. Keep in mind, our 2013 program in the Delaware Basin has been focused on our low-risk high return oil development opportunities in areas like the Bone Springs but we are paying close attention to the exploration drilling and de-risking industry is doing in the Delaware-Wolfcamp.","We are well positioned in the Delaware-Wolfcamp with approximately 140,000 net prospective acres.","Across the entire Permian Basin, Devon has over 300,000 net acreage prospective in the Wolfcamp. This includes our Wolfcamp Shale position and the Southern portion of the Midland Basin where we have been adding to our position and now have more than 100,000 net acres.","We continue in full development mode with our five written [ph] program. During the third quarter, we spud 35 new horizontal Wolfcamp Shale wells and brought 26 online with average 30-day IP rates of 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which nearly 75% is light oil. Landing and completing our wells in Lower Wolfcamp continues to yield consistent production results that are in line with our tight well profile for this play.","On the drilling front, we continue to improve returns in this play by reducing drilling time and completion costs. During the third quarter, our average well costs came in at $5.5 million about 10% below our tight well. We have approximately 800 undrilled locations in this light oil resource play and we expect to expand our inventory over time as we begin to de-risk our recently added acreage.","In summary, Devon\u2019s 1.3 million net acres in the Permian represents one of the largest and highest quality acreage positions in the industry. We continue to be one of the most active Permian drilling and as a result we are on-track to deliver basin wide oil production growth of more than 30% in 2013. We have established thousands of undrilled low-risk locations in the Permian and our inventory continues to grow with exciting opportunities in emerging plays like the Delaware-Wolfcamp.","Shifting to the Mississippi and Woodford trend in North-Central Oklahoma, we are excited about the progress we are making across our 650,000 net acre position. We have 15 operated rigs running in trend. In the third quarter, we tied in 49 operated wells across the trend, many of which were drilled in previous quarters. We continued a very active program in the Woodford Oil Shale in the third quarter and spud 57 new Woodford oil wells. During the quarter, we tied in 10 Woodford wells on our joint venture acreage with initial 30-day production rate averaging 535 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which more than 75% was light oil. This is well above our tight curve for the trend.","These results include the Jardo [ph] that achieved an average 30-day IP rate of nearly 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 1,700 barrels of oil. Even excluding this outstanding oil, our third quarter Woodford program exceeded our tight curve for the trend.","Seismic has played a key part in the early success for our Woodford drilling. Of the 27 Woodford wells brought online this year on our joint venture acreage, we have seen more than a 100% increase in 30-day IP rates in our wells drilled with the benefit of 3D seismic as compared to those wells drilled without. We are also achieving some encouraging results in Mississippi Lime on our joint venture acreage during the third quarter. Our Miss Lime results were highlighted by 14 wells brought online with average 30-day IP rates of nearly 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 345 barrels per day of light oil. While our Miss Lime results across the trend continue to vary depending on the location, reservoir quality, landing zones and completion techniques, we fully expect the integration of 3D seismic into our geologic modeling to optimize our Miss Lime results over time. To-date, we have acquired 3D seismic over majority of our acreage inside the joint venture area.","We\u2019re also seeing encouraging results outside the JV in both the Miss Lime and the Woodford oil shale formations. In Grant County where we have approximately 79,000 net acres, we completed the well subsequent to quarter end in the Miss Lime with an average 24-hour IP rate of more than 920 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including over 800 barrels of oil.","Additionally, during the quarter we drilled our first Woodford oil shale well in Grant County. This well had a 30-day IP of 225 barrels of oil equivalent per day and was drilled without the benefit of seismic. With this well confirming the existence of an oil [ph] charged Woodford interval comparable to that of our wells in the JV area, we are excited about obtaining seismic in Grant County.","While it\u2019s very early in our testing this acreage, these results demonstrate the productive capability of the Woodford and Miss Limes in the north of our JV core. Combining our Woodford oil shale and Miss Lime results, our third-quarter production across the trend averaged 8,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day; that\u2019s 65% increase over the second quarter. This production growth is especially impressive given our inventory of over 100 wells yet to be tied in or completed.","As of mid-October, this included 19 wells held up by pad drilling, 27 wells awaiting completion, 37 wells currently in some phase of completion and another 25 wells awaiting infrastructure buildout. While this level of inventory is to be expected in an emerging play, we believe the backlog will level off early next year as more and more of our midstream infrastructure is placed in service. We exited the third-quarter production accelerating to 10,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, putting us on track to approach our 2013 exit rate of 15,000 BOE per day for the Mississippian Woodford trend.","Also on the emerging play front, our Rockies oil program, the Powder River basin delivered excellent results in the quarter with oil production increasing 34% over the year ago period to 11,000 barrels per day.","In the third quarter, we tied in two Frontier wells with initial 30-day production rates averaging 740 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which more than 85% was light oil. We are also excited about two additional high-rate oil wells we brought online earlier in the fourth quarter targeting the Frontier formation. The 24-hour IP rates for these two wells each averaged in excess of 1400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with light oil comprising almost 90% of the production.","In addition, we are currently completing our first two long lateral wells in Powder River basin and should have those well results by our next call. To date we have identified approximately 600 risk locations across our Powder River acreage, and we expect this inventory to grow as we continue to derisk as the emerging light oil opportunity.","Shifting to our thermal oil projects in North-eastern Alberta, third-quarter production from our two Jackfish projects averaged roughly 46000 barrels of oil per day net of royalties. The significant improvement in heavy oil pricing boosted our Jackfish price realizations by 36% over the previous quarter, helping to improve our cash margins for the quarter.","Jackfish 1 production averaged 29,600 barrels per day during the quarter due to a step-up in royalty rates as a result of reaching payout in June. However continuing the improvement in our steam oil ratio allowed us to achieve average gross production of 36,000 barrels per day in the quarter, exceeding the facility\u2019s nameplate capacity of 35,000 barrels a day.","As we indicated in our last quarterly call, Jackfish 2 was taken down during the third quarter for scheduled maintenance. The plant turnaround was completed ahead of schedule on budget and with an accelerated ramp up. This is a significant improvement compared to previous turnarounds at our Jackfish facilities and is a testament to the hard work and expertise of our thermal project team.","Since each SAGD facility requires plant maintenance downtime every 2 to 3 years, efficiency gains on turnarounds lead to higher old cycle returns. Also of note at the end of the third quarter, we began steaming a new well pad at Jackfish 2. This pad at peak production is expected to contribute up to 8000 barrels of oil per day gross from nine new well pairs. Full ramp-up of the pad is expected to occur over the next 12 months.","Our Jackfish remain ahead of schedule and on-budget with nearly 80% of the project complete. First team is anticipated in the third quarter of 2014; roughly one quarter sooner than originally expected.","Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, our third quarter production averaged a record 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our expanded processing facilities help to increase oil and liquids production to 21,000 barrels per day, up 58% compared to the prior year quarter. Liquids now comprise nearly 40% of total Cana Woodford production. And with our drilling activity focused in the very best parts of the liquid rich core, we are producing a more valuable liquid stream. Combining with our strong liquid rich production growth and low operating cost, Cana Woodford unit operating margins increased 39% year-over-year.","Our record production performance in the quarter was underpinned by excellent drilling results. We brought 39 operated wells online with 30-day IP rates of 950 BoE per day including 475 barrels of liquids per day. These well results exceed our play type curve by nearly 15%.","In addition, we continue to improve our drilling efficiency at Cana. In just this year alone, we have seen a 25% improvement in the number of days from spud to rig release. This improvement in drill time will allow us to finish our 2013 program of nearly 150 wells with only nine operated rigs, three less than our original budget.","And finally, in the Barnett Shale in North Texas, our liquids rich drilling program continues to generate competitive returns. Our expanded capacity at our Bridgeport facility helped drive oil and liquids production increased 15% year-over-year to 58,000 barrels per day, a record production level. Our initiatives to reduce lime pressure and utilize artificial lift, to-date, have been very successful with net production in the third quarter averaging 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day.","So, in summary, we had another strong quarter of execution across our entire North American Onshore portfolio. The core focus areas, that I discussed today on the call, are delivering highly economic and robust production growth for Devon. If you apply a relatively conservative oil to natural gas price ratio of 20:1 to Company-wide production in the third quarter, our top-line growth increased nearly 10% year-over-year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review and outlook. Jeff.","Jeff Agosta","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our third quarter results and, where called for, provide updated guidance. I will also elaborate on the good news about our cash repatriation plan that John mentioned earlier.","Looking first at production, in the third quarter, we produced approximately 64 million oil equivalent barrels or about 691,000 equivalent barrels per day. This was in the top-half of our guidance range and most importantly was underpinned by strong high margin oil growth. For the quarter, Company-wide oil production averaged 165,000 barrels per day, an increase of 16% compared to the same period last year. As John detailed earlier, this growth was driven entirely by our US properties with light oil production up 38% year-over-year.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect strong oil growth in the Permian Basin and the Mississippi and Woodford trend to continue, driving US light oil production up more than 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. This impressive growth will increase our expected total Company-wide oil production next quarter to a range of 170,000 to 175,000 barrels per day. After taking into account declines in dry natural gas, we expect total Company-wide production in Q4 to range between 680,000 and 700,000 BoE per day. Overall, this keeps us on-track to deliver on our full-year production guidance of 250 million to 254 million BoE.","Moving to price realizations, overall our third quarter regional price realizations by product were generally in line with our expectations. Looking specifically at Canadian oil prices, in the third quarter higher season demand and improved flow rates on export pipes for heavy oil out of Canada, improved our realizations to 75% of WTI or $80 per barrel. This represents the best oil prices we have seen for Canada since 2009.","Even with this excellent result, the supply and demand dynamics for Canadian crudes remain very tight. In fact, subsequent to the third quarter, increased supply from new oil sands projects, refinery downtime and outages at third party pipelines have resulted in downward pressure on Canadian oil prices.","Based on what we've seen so far in October and November trading, we now expect our Canadian oil realizations to temporarily decline to a range of 50% to 60% of WTI in the fourth quarter, before the impact of hedges, offsetting the lower pricing of the attractive Canadian heavy oil hedges we have in place.","For the fourth quarter, we have 40,000 barrels per day of WCS blended crude swap at a discount to WTI of $22 per barrel. These attractive hedges cover well over 50% of our expected thermal oil production output for the quarter.","Looking ahead to 2014, the increase in the heavy oil capacity at BP\u2019s Whiting refinery will improve demand and increased export pipeline and rail capacity will help alleviate transportation bottlenecks. These favorable catalysts should reduce the overall pricing volatility of Canadian crudes and support the narrowing of the differentials as we go through 2014.","Looking briefly at natural gas, the only notable change to our previous guidance is a minor adjustment to account for acre differentials in Canada. Now that we are seeing improved flow rates out of Canada, export flow rates out of Canada we expect Canadian gas price realizations to improve in the fourth quarter to a range of 75% to 85% of Henry Hub. For natural gas liquids, we expect our companywide fourth quarter price rationalizations to remain essentially flat with the last few quarters ranging from $25 to $27 per barrel.","Turning now to our midstream business, once again our marketing and midstream operations delivered excellent results, generating $137 million of operating profit in the third quarter, a 25% increase compared to the third-quarter of last year. Increased throughput at our newly expanded Cana and Barnett processing facilities, higher natural gas prices and strong cost controls drove our solid performance.","Based on the results for the first nine months and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect our full year operating profits to come in between $475 million and $525 million. This is a $25 million increase over our previous guidance.","Moving to expenses, in the third quarter our total pretax cash costs came in at $15.13 per BOE. This result was right in line with our expectations, maintaining cost essentially flat with last quarter. This is an especially positive result considering the negative volume impact and higher LOE costs associated with our plant turnaround at Jackfish 2 during the quarter. Overall our cost structure remains one of the best in the industry even as we transition our portfolio to higher margin or higher cost oil production.","Going to the bottom-line our third-quarter performance translated into non-GAAP earnings of $526 million or $1.29 per diluted share. This represents a 47% increase in earnings per share year-over-year and comfortably exceeded Wall Street expectations by $0.09. This level of earnings translated into cash flow per share of $3.89, also exceeding the street\u2019s expectations.","Before we open the call to Q&A, I will conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial position. During the third quarter, Devon generated operating cash flow of $1.6 billion, an 18% increase compared to the year ago quarter. When you include the nearly $300 million of proceeds from the closing of minor asset sales during the quarter, our cash inflows totaled $1.9 billion. These cash inflows comfortably funded our total CapEx of 1.7 billion.","It is also important to note that for the full year our total capital spending, which includes E&P, midstream and corporate capital remains on track to be near the midpoint of our guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective we remain exceptionally strong. We exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted cap ratio of only 22% and cash balances of $4.3 billion.","Of these cash balances, approximately 3.6 billion resides in subsidiaries outside North America. As John mentioned earlier, our tax position now affords us with the opportunity to efficiently repatriate an additional $2 billion of cash to the US around year end. We expect NOLs and other credits to limit our tax rate on this repatriated cash to somewhere in the 46% range. By year-end we will have repatriated $4 billion of foreign cash at an estimated tax rate of approximately 5%.","To provide some perspective on the significance of this, you might recall after divesting our international assets in 2010-11 we guided toward a tax rate of about 20%. The lower actual tax rate on the amount repatriated to the US and the tax-free transfer of $500 million to Canada we made earlier in the year will result in an incremental $700 million benefit to Devon shareholders, roughly the equivalent of about $1.75 per share.","In summary, it was another solid quarter for Devon. We delivered strong oil production growth. We expanded our margins through growth in light oil. We maintained strong cost controls and we remain positioned with one of the best balance sheets in the industry. So with that, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A.","Vince.","Question-and-Answer Session","Vince White","Thanks Jeff. (Operator Instructions). With that operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC. Your line is now open.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC","Thanks. Good morning. Looking at the Permian Basin, the Southern Delaware, you know, kind of a couple of questions. You talked about expanding your inventory there, can you give us a little bit more color on that, like, how many of the benches down there you all have tested and which ones you think are going to be prospective and which ones in your current well count? And then the other thing is, I think you all just recently acquired Forest Oil\u2019s acreage down there, can you give us a little bit of thoughts on what you\u2019re seeing there?","David Hager","Yeah, Scott, you\u2019re talking about the Southern Midland Basin, I think, aren\u2019t you? Not the Delaware Basin.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC","Oh, I\u2019m sorry if I said Delaware, yes, you\u2019re correct.","David Hager","Yeah, right. Yeah, we have tested and there\u2019s obviously a nomenclature issue within the industry that we prefer to call it that we have tested both the Middle and the Lower Wolfcamp, those are the primary prospective zones on our acreage. We are right now, for the most part, have very little across the acreage, but for the most part we are completing in the Lower Wolfcamp and we believe that allows us to actually frac up to the Middle Wolfcamp as well. So, by industry nomenclature, I think that would be completing more in the F and then the frac would contribute on up through the D in there.","Regarding the Forest acreage, that\u2019s the part that I didn\u2019t mention in my comments earlier. That\u2019s the additional acreage that we acquired. It\u2019s a little over 50,000. I think, around 53,000 or so total. We haven\u2019t drilled any wells on that acreage yet, we will start drilling those next year. And that\u2019s the comment I was making that I do believe that we\u2019ll expand our inventory. We have not expanded our inventory at all in the comment that I gave to you already on the \u2013 but we fully anticipate that it\u2019s going to work and will be additive to the overall position.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC","Okay. And just to again clarify on your current inventory count in the Southern Midland Basin, I think it was 800 locations. Is that assuming an Upper and a Lower Wolfcamp?","David Hager","It is considered what is appropriate to complete in each of those. And we have not really plugged into there that we would have multiple completions at the same location. So, that\u2019s a single completion at each of our locations. It is possible, through time, we may see that we may complete in more than one zone from the same location but we haven\u2019t included it in our location count.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC","Okay. Because I think some of your competitors or peers are talking about anywhere from two to four different formations prospective in each zone location, is that \u2013","David Hager","That\u2019s certainly a possibility through time and we have the same opportunities our peers do, it\u2019s just how we choose to classify our locations, perhaps a little more conservative.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC","Okay. And based on your acreage contracts, do you have to drill lowest formation to hold everything.","David Hager","Scott, I\u2019d have to check on that. That is typical that you would, but I\u2019d have to check \u2013 let me think about it whether it \u2013 I\u2019m going to \u2013 yeah, I\u2019ll give you some clarification here, they are saying we are in the same zones. So it doesn\u2019t -- don't think we have to. Now more I think about that, I think that\u2019s right that if drill in the operator, we still the hold the lower.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vinnie Wong of Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","I know that Crosstex deal hasn't closed yet, but can you tell us how you are thinking about maybe the drop-down pace of assets into the MLP just so -- you mentioned the benefit of the combination versus doing IPO in terms of speed to market?","John Richels","Vinnie [ph], there's really a couple of different drop-downs that we can do in the MLP. As you know, we put half of our assets into the GP and half into the MLP. So there will be a continuing drop-down from the GP to the MLP of interest in our midstream company. And then we do have other assets, the one that we flagged at the time \u2013 other assets that we didn't put into the MLP, one of the assets that we've flagged at the time was our interest in the Access Pipeline, which is the pipeline that services our Jackfish and Pike acreage and also has third-party volumes from other operators in the area. And that's certainly something that we can drop down.","When we do that, it's a little bit up in the air right now, and of course, we are constructing that. I think it's going to be completed by the end of 2014 roughly and third quarter 2014. And so a 2015 drop-down is certainly possible. We'll have to kind of take stock of things at the time that we finish it. I think the really important part and the really exciting part for us is that not only we kind of got a market valuation of what those assets are, but in the future it gives us a lot of flexibility around building new assets, dropping down some existing assets that we haven't put in yet, and also doing acquisition and by doing that it accelerates the value over what we'd otherwise have seen.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And just my second question is in regards to $2 billion in cash being repatriated, can you update on what you are thinking there and particularly where you guys want to put it?","John Richels","As Jeff mentioned, it's likely to be around year end before we can repatriate those funds. Vinnie, as you may know and most of the folks on the call are probably familiar with the factors that we've talked about in the past that we take into account as we allocate our capital and the objective we've always enunciated is to optimize cash flow for debt adjusted shares.","So, when we bring that cash back around the end of the year, we'll allocate using the same parameters. We're right now in the middle of and \u2013 or continuing to develop our 2014 capital budgets and we'll do that over the next couple of months. And as we move into 2014, we'll finalize our capital allocation decisions. At that time, share buybacks are always included in our consideration to capital investments and we\u2019ve got a great track record of buying stock back over the years. But to give you any more definite guidelines around that right now would be a little premature.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell, Tuohy Brothers Investment.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment","Questions on the Woodford oil play. My first question is as I wasn't entirely sure from what I heard, is all of your current drilling on JV lands or are you also doing some drilling aside from the Grant County, kind of sounds like a wildcat, are you doing any drilling on your non-JV acreage?","David Hager","This is Dave. We just have one rig that's working outside of the JV. The rest of the rigs are working within the JV. And that's the rig in Grant County.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment","And my other question with regard to the Woodford, I'm looking at the map of your acreage in the area. Do you believe that you have prospectivity in any of the other counties besides Grant? I'm thinking non JV again, like maybe Kay or Sage County.","David Hager","Well, it's possible. We need to drill some wells over there and determine it. Again, we are seeing such an advantage here of getting 3D seismic and that's what's really helped us out dramatically within the JV. We're going to drill a few wells up here in Grant and Kay County without 3D just to \u2013 3D in and of itself costs a fair amount of money. And so we want to make sure that we have a working petroleum system up there before we actually spend the money on the 3D.","We now have in Grant County enough confirmation that through the wells that I discussed that we are shooting 3D up there. We will be going through the same process in Kay County and that \u2013 the overall comment that I\u2019ve made before is that we have 650,000 acres in total in the Mississippi and of that we believe there are sufficient thickness of the Woodford to have potential prospectivity across 400,000 of that 650,000 acres. To-date we feel we have de-risked 100,000 of that 400,000 acres. So, we have the thickness across the 400,000 but there are other elements that factor into there as far as the maturity of the oil, do you have sufficient permeability, et cetera, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have to determine across that other 300,000 acres we\u2019re talking about, some of which is in Grant and some of which is in Kay.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment","Okay. Great. That was great color. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Portillo of TPH. Your line is now open.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor, Pickering & Co.","Good morning, guys. Just a quick question for me in regards to your oil growth guidance for Q4. Looks like kind of a step up on a quarter-over-quarter basis, is pretty flat especially with the ramp-up in the Canadian volumes. So, I was just wondering if you can comment maybe where we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a deceleration in the growth into year-end or if that was in line with your planned expectation going to the fourth quarter here?","David Hager","Yeah, Matt, it\u2019s a little bit less than we guided to last quarter. The first thing I want to make clear to everyone, though, about this is our wells are delivering exactly as we anticipated. I went through it area-by-area. The capabilities of the wells are there. That is not the issue. The issues \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of other issues that have factored into it though overall. First, we are seeing some down time with our ongoing production in the Permian, especially as related to electrical submersible pump that we\u2019re running in all of these. Our run time of those has been a little bit less than we anticipated. We\u2019re working through that issue as we speak but that has caused our base production to fall a little bit short of what we anticipated. Nothing to do with the productivity of the wells, just the efficiency of the pump.","Secondarily, in the Rockies because of the success we had with the Rockies drilling program, we took a little bit of capital out of CO2 that we\u2019re going to expand, that were going to deliver a few thousand barrels a day and kept a rig running in the Powder River Basin because of the outstanding results we\u2019re getting there. Those volumes, associated with that rig, will show up next year but not this year.","And then finally, because of the stronger prices when we put our projection out there that we were seeing in Canadian oil because of the stronger realizations we anticipated royalties would be a little bit higher. And so that would cause the net production to go down a little bit as well.","But having said all that, I want to make sure that you understand the US oil growth in Q4 is going to be greater than 30% versus Q4 of 2012. So we\u2019re still having very, very strong oil growth, it\u2019s just some minor issues like that, these have nothing to do with the productivity of the well, that have caused it to decrease it a little bit.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor, Pickering & Co.","Great. Thanks for the clarification there. And just in regards to some of the initial well results you\u2019ve seen in the Woodford. I was wondering if you could potentially compare the rates of return you\u2019re seeing on your Woodford programs versus your Southern Midland program? And if you continue to see strong initial rates here, in line with your or above your type curve could we potentially see capital allocated away from the Permian into the Woodford or an acceleration in Woodford drilling? Thank you.","David Hager","Well, we\u2019re going through that entire evaluation process right now, of comparing the returns. And we\u2019re obviously a little bit less in the overall maturity of the program in the Woodford then we are in the Southern Midland Basin. But having said that, we\u2019ve had some outstanding results this quarter with well, well above the type curve and, of course, highlighted by the Jardo [ph] that had a 30-day IP of 2,200 BoE per day. So we like both these plays an awful lot. And to ask me to make a decision between one or the other is kind of tough because they are two of our top plays and we like them both but we\u2019re certainly very pleased with the Woodford results.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor, Pickering & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. John, it\u2019s been a busy year on the strategic front. By year end you will complete in a two major repatriations and you\u2019ve got the midstream transaction. So just wondering if you could maybe comment on where Devon is in terms of the overall portfolio. Anything else that you are working on in terms of the portfolio changes, or is this the asset base going forward?","John Richels","Well, Arun, as you know, in this business that's a constant. We are always looking to bring good opportunities into the asset base and sometimes that means that other opportunities don't look as attractive anymore and you move them out. So, that's not something that we \u2013 that's a continuum. We're not at the end of it. We always got to look at that. So, it's an ongoing process to continue to try to increase our productivity as a company and our value for our shareholders. It's something we're looking at all the time.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","John, just to maybe elaborate on that. At one time you guys had \u2013 was doing some analytical work around Canada, maybe a spin-off or something like that. Have you come to a decision on that, or are you still evaluating that?","John Richels","I think these things are all things that we're evaluating all the time, and I think you know that in our history, we've proven that we're not afraid of making bold moves when we have to, but a lot of things people talk about and reflect on from the outside don't always add long-term value particularly when you look at taxation and everything else that's involved. So we're always looking at how we might bring value forward, and as we've previously said, we're not leaving any stone unturned. But we're not going to do things that \u2013 we're only going to do things that add long-term value and we're not going to take action simply for action's sake. So, these are things we're always looking at, but sometimes they\u2019re not quite so simple.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s helpful. Dave, I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit more on this ESP-related downtime. Is this something that could have a knock-on effect as we think about 2014, or is it more isolated to the fourth quarter?","David Hager","Well, it's something that we're working on right now, and we think it\u2019s very solvable. Basically, we're running these ESPs in an unconventional environment, and frankly, running a lot of sand through these ESPs, which as you can imagine, running sand through pumps is not a great thing for long-term life. But we are working with some of our vendors on ways that we can get a better design out there. We're also working on ways that we can improve the efficiency of replacing these ESPs, and so, I don't think it's going to have a long-term impact.","We have a special team, I can tell you internally, that\u2019s working at very hard along with our vendors. And I think it's something that we're going to come to a good answer on here in the next three or four months. And frankly that's just one of the things that contributed to it. The other I mentioned was a change in the Rockies program to the additional rig and also the impact of potentially higher royalties due to improved realizations in Canada. So, I wouldn't overplay that. It's just one of the several factors.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","My last question would be just what your new midstream spending levels could look like post the closing of the transaction?","John Richels","That of course is dependent upon where we choose to spend capital and so we're going to \u2013 we're in the processing of working our 2014 capital budget. And until we've got the upstream piece we won't know exactly what the midstream piece is, but directionally surely, I mean, we certainly expect it to be down.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Going back to the Woodford, can you give us an idea if that 75% to 80% oil cut that you see in the Jardo [ph] well is representative of what the oil gas spilt is for the rest of your wells there?","David Hager","Well, in all of our wells in the Woodford, it's going to have a higher oil cut early in the life, which certainly is beneficial from a rate of return and NPV standpoint. Although over the life of the well, we anticipate they will become more gassy and the ultimate -- and when you looked at total EUR, it will probably split about equally, one-third each for oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","And then I know it's early in the play and clearly this Jardo [ph] well is a great well, but I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on if this well \u2013 if you had an idea ahead of time that this well might really perform well, whether because it's a long lateral or whether there is something you saw on the seismic that gave you an indication whether this was just a surprise to everybody?","David Hager","Well, it was a long lateral, so that certainly helped but there also were some other geological characteristics which, of course, I\u2019m not going to tell you that we had observed ahead of time and we think that that benefited that. Your obvious follow-on, is it repeatable, I\u2019m sure. And to some degree, yes, but it\u2019s not going to be \u2013 we\u2019re not going to be able to drill those wells everywhere across the acreage but we think we have a good idea for what allowed that and we\u2019ll have some of those type wells across our acreage position, we think, again.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Dave, you understood exactly what I was after. Thank you for the added detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tameron of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning. Can you guys just talk about, in the Permian can you \u2013 and you addressed this a little bit but you can you give me some color on Delaware versus Midland, the differences between the two and kind of the rates of return and well cost?","David Hager","Are you talking specifically, David, about the Wolfcamp or across our entire portfolio?","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","No, I mean, just what you\u2019re seeing on the Bone Springs versus you know \u2013 and I was just studying the wells you put in the press releases as far as the Permian well and the Bone Spring well look to have higher IPs by couple of hundred barrels or so, I guess, close to 300 barrels, on those 30-day rates. And I kind of looking at that versus \u2013","David Hager","Right. Yeah, in general to answer your question, the Bone Springs are our highest returns in our portfolio in the Permian Basin and amongst the highest in our entire portfolio as a company. Although all of them generate strong rates of return, the Bone Springs are a little bit better, no question.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Alright, I\u2019ll leave it at that. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Hanson of Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Mark Hanson \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning, guys. Two quick questions for you. First, how would you characterize the Miss Lime\u2019s performance relative to your expectations based on results to-date? I know you\u2019ve given an awfully good color this morning across the trend, both, Woodford and Mississippi Lime. Just seems, from commentary you provided, you\u2019re a bit more enthusiastic about the Woodford at this point?","David Hager","Well, we still like the Miss Lime an awful lot. It is meeting out type curve expectation, certainly within the JV and is actually above our type curve expectations slightly. So we\u2019re very happy within the JV. North of the JV and in Grant and Kay County we\u2019ve had mixed results. I had talked about one very good well that we had out there in the past quarter. We\u2019ve had some that are not as good. But you have to understand, this is done without the benefit of seismic. So, the primary thing we\u2019re trying to do up there outside of JV right now is see if we have enough evidence to have a good strong working petroleum system and which we now are confident in Grant County that we do have that. And now that we have that, we\u2019ll shoot 3D up there and we\u2019ll really refine where we\u2019re drilling those wells and I would anticipate the results to become much more consistent and to improve with the benefited of 3D. But overall as far as the Miss goes, it is meeting our expectations just at this Woodford particularly within the joint venture area. Now, we\u2019ll have at least one well up in Grant County that\u2019s somewhat encouraging as well. It\u2019s working spectacularly.","Mark Hanson \u2013 Morningstar","Great. Very helpful. And then the second question, just with your Permian rig count, I saw that it dropped by a meaningful amount, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related to the ESP issues, but any more information on where rigs were dropped and the things \u2013","David Hager","Yeah, it has nothing to do with the ESP issues at all. We dropped our rig count because we become significantly more efficient in drilling our wells. We executed our entire program for 2013 and we could execute it with less rigs. So, if we had kept the same amount of rigs we would have overspent our capital for this year. And so we were just exercising capital discipline to stay within the overall capital by reducing our rig capital. We executed the program we had intended to this year.","Mark Hanson \u2013 Morningstar","Great to hear that. Thank you.","Operator","And your last question comes from Biju Perincheril of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Richels","Biju, we apologize for butchering your name.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","That\u2019s quite alright; I\u2019m used to it. The question I had was on the Wolfcamp. It looks like the 30-day rate this quarter was maybe a little bit lower than what you had in the past. And I was just wondering if that\u2019s because you\u2019re changing anything around on the completion front or is that just the normal variability?","David Hager","Nothing significant there, Biju. The change around, it\u2019s just what pads we happen to be bringing on this quarter but I wouldn\u2019t read anything else into it. Next quarter, it could go back up just as easily as it went down a little bit this quarter, nothing significant there.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Aerially or geographically, were you drilling in the generally same areas?","David Hager","Yes, generally we're drilling in the same areas still. One comment I want to make to Scott Hanold, asked a question that kind of stopped me earlier about holding all rights and the reason, I wasn't thinking about it as clearly as I should have been. The answer is it's kind of an academic question, because we're actually completing in a lowest Wolfcamp zone. So because we are completing in the lowest Wolfcamp zone, we're going to have all the rights above that, so it's really an academic issue. We'll hold all that.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","And one question along those lines is do you have any plans in the near-term to test different horizons at the same location?","David Hager","Nothing immediate. We recognize the prospectivity there, but we are right now just delineating our entire acreage position.","John Richels","Well, folks I'm showing the top of the hour. So that concludes today's call. As usual, our investor relations staff will be around the rest of the day to answer any questions that didn't make it into the call or if you come up with other things during the day.","So before signing off, I'd just like to go over a few key takeaways. First, our core assets are performing very well leading to higher oil weighting for our portfolio. This is driven by the 38% year-over-year growth in light oil production from our U.S. portfolio. Results from our emerging U.S. light oil plays and long-term investment in Canadian thermal oil are providing visibility on the next leg of oil growth for Devon.","Our pursuit of high margin production is improving profitability and we are doing excellent job of controlling, operating and capital costs. By year end, we will have repatriated $4 billion of cash at very favorable tax rates translating into about $1.75 per share benefit to Devon shareholders, and finally, we took another significant step forward in unlocking unrecognized asset value within Devon through the formation of our new midstream business.","Going forward, our approach to the business remains unchanged. We will continue to pursue our top strategic objective, and that is to maximize long-term growth and cash flow per share after adjusting for debt. So, we look forward to talking with you again on the next call, and thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

Our oil focused drilling programs not only accomplished impressive oil production growth, but also successfully expanded margins and improved our operating cash flow. Additionally, we\u2019ve taken some bold steps in a relatively short period of time to high grade our portfolio and improve Devon\u2019s growth trajectory. We did this through an accretive Eagle Ford at our shale acquisition, an innovative midstream combination and the initiation of an asset divestiture program.","Now let\u2019s briefly recap some of the past year\u2019s highlights in a little more detail. In 2013, we had outstanding success growing U.S. oil production, our highest margin product driven by our development programs in the Permian Basin; we increased our light sweet crude production in the U.S. to 78,000 barrels per day, up 32% compared to 2012. This highly profitable U.S. oil production growth is particularly impressive considering the large base of oil production that we are [drilling] [ph] off, a base that ranks Devon as one of the largest independent oil producers in the U.S.","Our pursuit of oil production resulted in higher revenues and improved profitability as well. In 2013, company-wide oil revenue increased by 23% compared to the previous year and accounted for more than half of our total upstream revenue.","This revenue growth combined with the strong focus on cost containment improved our operating cash flow in 2013 by 10% year-over-year, significantly exceeding Wall Street estimates.","Looking beyond our reported results we also made some exciting portfolio changes at Devon during 2013. In October, we announced the strategic combination of our U.S. midstream assets with Crosstex to form EnLink Midstream. The creation of EnLink greatly improves the diversification, capital efficiency and growth trajectory of our midstream holdings. Additionally, this innovative transaction allowed us to obtain an immediate market-based valuation for the U.S. portion of our midstream business.","At the time of the announcement, Devon contributed assets valued at $4.8 billion. As of yesterday\u2019s closing prices, our ownership interest in EnLink was valued at more than $8.3 billion or roughly a third of Devon\u2019s market capitalization.","The combination has already resulted in an additional $3.5 billion of value or the equivalent of more than $8 per share and we expect additional value to accrue as EnLink grows and develop its assets.","And further significant transaction for us announced in late November was our acquisition of Eagle Ford assets. This transaction allowed us to secure a world-class light oil acreage position in the very best part of the Eagle Ford offering some of the highest rate of return drilling opportunities in North America. We were able to acquire these premier assets in the economic heart of the play at a price well below our current EBITDA multiple.","Given the attractive purchase price, the Eagle Ford acquisition is immediately accretive to Devon shareholders on virtually every metric including most importantly double-digit growth in cash flow per share adjusted for debt.","In conjunction with our Eagle Ford transaction, we also announced our intent to monetize non-core E&P properties both in the U.S. and in Canada. This initiative further sharpens Devon\u2019s focus on core assets, delivering material growth rates or substantial free cash flow. This morning we are pleased to announce the sale of our entire Canadian conventional business, excluding Horn River for approximately C$3.125 billion or at current exchange rate US$2.8 billion.","This transaction values are natural gas levered Canadian conventional business at approximately 7x 2013 EBITDA. This is a substantial premium compared to our current trading multiple and is immediately accretive to Devon shareholders.","Additionally, this was a very tax efficient transaction for Devon. After adjusting for Canadian taxes and tax on repatriation of funds to the U.S. we expect net proceeds of approximately US$2.7 billion.","We will utilize these net proceeds to reduce the debt that we are taking on with the Eagle Ford acquisition and we expect to close this transaction in the second quarter. The sale to Canadian Natural is in addition to minor asset sales of other Canadian conventional assets in early 2014 of about another C$155 million. The attractive monetization of our largest divestiture properties in such a short time period is a significant step forward in the execution of our overall divestiture process.","For our remaining divestiture assets in the U.S. even before opening our data rooms we are seeing significant buyer interest. We expect to have all these asset packages on the market in the second quarter and remain confident that we are on track to finish this divestiture process by year end.","We will provide additional updates on our progress as we move throughout the year. So the New Devon has greater focus with our retained asset base in five-core development plays, three of which reside in some of the most attractive oil prone basins in North America, the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, and the Canadian oil sands. Each of these core oil assets represents a low risk and high margin production growth opportunity with the scale to significantly impact the results of the company our size. The retained liquids rich gas component of the New Devon is anchored by our Barnett and Anadarko basin assets, these core areas currently generate large amounts of free cash flow and provide significant gas optionality. So in aggregate, Devon emerges with a formidable and balanced portfolio position to deliver multi-year same-store sales oil growth of around 20% per year. ","The New Devon is also delivering top line production growth in spite of letting gas volumes decline all while living within operating cash flow. With large high quality acreage positions in each of our core assets, we have no shortage of investment opportunities. Focusing on our go-forward business, we expect E&P capital spending to range from $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion in 2014, excluding about $250 million of capital associated with the divesture assets. This spending focused primarily in low-risk oil development plays is expected to increase average oil production for our go-forward properties to a range of 198,000 to 216,000 barrels per day in 2014. This represents a company-wide oil growth rate of approximately 35% year-over-year on a reported basis for our go-forward assets or about 20% on the same-store sales basis. ","The majority of our oil production growth in 2014 will come from aggressive development of Eagle Ford and Permian, driving our reported light oil production in US about 75% higher than 2013 levels. After taking into account declines in natural gas, we expect the mid-point of our total BOE production on our go-forward properties to increase by roughly 10% on a reported basis over 2013. This high margin production mix in 2014 will lead to further margin expansion and translate into improved cash flow growth for the company. As already mentioned, we expect to deliver these attractive results while keeping total capital spending within operating cash flow for the year.","Looking beyond the attractive growth that the repositioned Devon is going to deliver in 2014, our go-forward portfolio is also positioned for excellent high margin growth in 2015. Assuming today\u2019s price environment and constant costs, our organic oil production growth in 2015 is shaping up to exceed 20% while delivering free cash flow. The Eagle Ford and Permian will once again drive competitive production growth in the US and we should see significant oil growth out of Canada as our Jackfish 3 project begins to contribute meaningful volume in 2015. This increase in Canadian oil volumes coincide with our expectation for improved demand and take away capacity. ","Increased refinery demand and critical new pipeline and rail take away capacity will allow Canadian crudes unprecedented access to the US Gulf Coast. This will likely narrow the volatile price differentials we\u2019ve seen on Canadian crudes over the past few years, providing a catalyst that should further enhance our profitability in 2015 and beyond. ","So in summary, we\u2019re very pleased with the way Devon is positioned for the future. As we integrate the recent acquisitions into our portfolio, maximize divesture proceeds and deliver on growth expectations, we are poised to create value for our shareholders in the upcoming years. So at this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Hager for a more detailed operations review. David?","David Hager","","Thanks John, good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start my comments this morning with a brief review of reserves. Crude reserves for oil, gas and NGLs totalled three billion barrels of oil equivalent at year end. On the Euro side of the portfolio, reserves increased to a record 837 million barrels.","During the year, our oil-focused drilling programs added 112 million barrels of drill-bit oil reserve additions and by drill-bit, I\u2019m referring to extensions, discoveries and performance revisions. These drill-bit oil additions replaced approximately 180% of the oil we produced in 2013.","This was largely driven by our continued success in the Permian and is particularly impressive given that 2013 was not a year of significant heavy oil bookings in Canada. On the gas and natural gas liquid side of the portfolio, not surprisingly 2013 was not a big year for reserve additions given our level of drilling activity.","While we did see positive reserve revisions for higher natural gas prices, this was largely offset by negative revisions mostly attributable to the SEC five-year rule. Given our outlook for gas and NGL pricing relative to oil in the near-to-medium term, these negative revision represent a reduction in the lowest margin barrels within our portfolio and are of little consequence from a value perspective.","In contrast, extensions, discoveries related to our oil-focused development activity generated $4 billion in future net cash flows year-over-year, more than offsetting the negative gas revisions and driving our overall PV-10 up year-over-year. All-in our F&D for the year came in at $22 per Boe. Excluding the negative revisions related to the five-year rule, our all-in F&D would've been approximately $18 per Boe.","Another metric commonly tracked by analyst is proved developed F&D. This metric measures an E&P company\u2019s ability to convert undrilled locations to proved developed reserves in a cost-effective manner ultimately translating into earnings and cash flow.","In 2013, we did an outstanding job of this as we focus on converting the highest margin resources in the cash flow. During the year, we added 392 million Boe of proved developed reserve additions and by this I\u2019m referring to our year-over-year change in proved developed reserves plus production.","These proved developed reserve additions replaced 155% of our 2013 production and were achieved with development capital of approximately $5 billion, translating into a very competitive proved developed F&D cost of just under $13 per Boe.","Before I move into a detailed review of our operations, it is important to understand how we're approaching capital allocation in 2014. With the addition of the Eagle Ford assets and our decision to limit capital spending to our expected cash flow, we have high-graded activity across our portfolio.","This optimization has resulted in a prioritization of our Eagle Ford and Permian and reduced activity levels across several other areas compared to previous years. In 2014, we planned to spend approximately $1.5 billion in the Permian and $1.1 billion in the Eagle Ford, $1.1 billion on our heavy oil projects in Canada as Thermal and Lloyd, $600 million in the liquid rich areas of the Barnett -- of the Barnett shale and Anadarko basin combined and $600 million in our emerging Rockies and Mississippian-Woodford oil plays. With this context in mind, let\u2019s look at new Devon\u2019s key assets in more detail.","Beginning with our core oil areas, fourth quarter production in the Permian averaged a record 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, a 29% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Light oil production continues to account for roughly 60% of our total Permian production. In the Delaware basin, our Bone Spring horizontal program continues to be one of the most significant drivers of our Permian oil growth.","In the fourth quarter, we brought 21 Bone Spring wells on line with average 30 day IP rates of 800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 70% was light oil. These production results were about 40% over better than our published tight oil profile. We continue to have considerable success in regenerating our inventory in the Bone Springs. ","Our record recent drilling activity to third Bone Spring across portions of South East AD and South East New Counties as they were adapt to add roughly 200 additional risk location to our inventory. This marks third increase over the past 12 years to our Bone Spring's inventory. We now have roughly 1600 unreal Bone Spring locations identified and we fully expect at our on-going drilling and geological workable region further inventory increases in the past year right oil play.","We currently have 11 operated rigs running in the Bone Spring. Also in the Delaware Basin, we completed our first horizontal Wolfcamp test in Ward County. During the fourth quarter the Martinsville 124H was brought online with an average 30 day IP rate of 950 barrels of oil equivalent per day including 800 barrels of oil. This is an encouraging result that has positive implications for our more than 100,000 net perspective acres in Delaware Wolfcamp. ","So, in total across the Delaware Basin we planned to invest approximately 900 million of capital and drill approximately 160 wells in 2014. Our Bone Spring program will once again be the primary focus of our activity in the area where it was planned to stand about $600 million of capital and drill roughly 130 wells. With continued success in the Bone Spring and additional gas take away capacity anticipated over the next 12 months. We expect to have the option to increase our pace of development in the Bone Spring in 2015.","Although our 2014 program in Delaware Basin will be almost exclusively focused on our low risk high return Bone Spring oil development. We do plan to continue appraising our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp acreage this year. Shifting to the Midland-Basin we continue to see solid results from our oil development program and the Wolfcamp Shale where we have a joint venture partnership with Sumitomo. During the fourth quarter, we tied in 24 new horizontal Wolfcamp wells with a niche of 30 day production rates averaging 410 barrels of oil equivalent per day, right in line with our type well expectations.","On the drilling front we set a record in the fourth quarter, taking just four days to drill a well at TD. Well not the average, it does illustrate the success we are having and achieving greater efficiencies and lowering costs. We are currently drilling or currently running five operated rigs and expect to add a six rig in April.","In 2014, the partnership will spend approximately $800 million and drill of about 140 wells after the benefit for our drilling [indiscernible] Devon's portion will be just over $200 million in the play this year. In summary for the Permian, we expect $1.5 billion capital program to drive strong oil production growth for the company in 2014. Our $1.3 million net acres in the Permian represent one of the largest and highest quality acres positions in the industry.","We have established thousands of undrilled, low risk locations in the Permian and with our success scenarios like Bone Spring, this inventory continues to grow. In addition, the success of our on-going efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce cost is further enhancing the returns in our light oil development plays. As we announced in November, Devon has acquiring 82,000 net acres in the world class Eagle Ford oil play.","This acreage is located in DeWitt and Lavaca counties, which was proven to be in the very best part of Eagle Ford, capable of delivering outstanding well results that ultimately translate into exceptional rates of return, with the majority of our acreage de risks, adding this top tier light oil development opportunity to our portfolio provides additional low risk repeatable oil growth for years to come.","Causing this transaction remains on track for the beginning of March, for those of you modelling Devon we expect our net product in Eagle Ford to average between 70,000 and 80,000 BOE per day for the ten months that we will have assets in 2014. Also, assuming our March closing we expect our capital investment in Eagle Ford to be about $1.1 billion in 2014. These forward looking estimates for product and capital are right in line with our previously provided 2014 guidance after you adjust for not only Eagle assets in January or February.","At our thermal oil projects in Northeast Alberta, fourth quarter gross production from our two Jackfish projects averaged roughly 58,000 barrels of oil per day or 53,000 barrels per day after royalties. As a reminder, our reported net thermal oil production can fluctuate due to the slidings royalty scale imposed by the Alberta government on these projects.","The factors that impact the sliding scale include cost recovery, commodity pricing and the foreign exchange rate. At Jackfish 1, gross production averaged 35,000 barrels per day or 31,000 barrels per day net of royalties. At Jackfish 2, fourth quarter gross production continued to ramp up, averaging all-time high of 23,000 barrels of oil per day or 21,800 barrels per day net of royalties.","Production from our new well pad that began steaming in the third quarter, have been ramping up as expected. This pad had peak gross production, is expected to contribute up to 8,000 barrels of oil per day. It is worth noting in spite of record low temperatures this winter, our Jackfish 1 and Jackfish 2 facilities have maintain 99% uptime, continuing their recurring of excellent reliability and efficiency.","Construction of Jackfish 3 is nearly complete with total capital expenditures for the plant and an initial well pad projected to come in on budgets at a $1.4 billion. Plant commissioning activities will begin in the second quarter, and we expect to begin injecting steam in the third quarter this year.","Delivery of first oil is scheduled to occur late this year with production ramping up throughout 2013. As John mentioned, we are excited about resumption of oil growth out of our Canada assets as our Jackfish 3 project continues to contribute meaningful volumes in 2015.","It appears that the timing of our oil growth and Canadian oil volumes will coincide nicely with the improved demand and takeaway capacity expected in the market. We\u2019ve continued ramp up of heavy throughput at BP\u2019s Whiting refinery, the addition of new rail facilities that could add up more than 500,000 barrels a day of capacity and the new 600,000 barrels per day Flanagan South pipeline in U.S. Gulf Coast are all expected later this year.","These factors should have a narrowing impact on differentials and reduce the overall pricing volatility we have seen on Canadian crudes over the past few years. Ultimately, we expect these factors to further enhance our profitability in 2015 and beyond.","At Pike, our thermal oil sands joint venture with BP, we expect to make a decision on the first phase of Pike development and receive regulatory approval later this year. As a reminder, the Pike 1 development project will have ultimate gross production capacity of 105,000 barrels of oil per day. Devon operates Pike with a 50% working interest.","Shifting now to our two core liquids rich areas, the Barnett and Anadarko Basin, with decreased growth capital allocated to these areas, our focus remains managing based production. Between the Barnett and Anadarko Basin, we plan to invest about $600 million and plan to drill approximately 200 wells in only the most economic portion of these plays.","In aggregate, we expect these properties to generate about $1 billion of free cash flow in 2014. These areas also represent significant gas optionality for our portfolio, should the economic environment improve for gas. And finally, on the emerging play front, we continue to evaluate potential across our Mississippian-Woodford Trend position in North Central Oklahoma.","December production for their play averaged 16,000 Boe per day, representing a 47% increase from the September average and exceeding our target exit rate of 15,000 Boe per day. For the fourth quarter, total production averaged 14,000 Boe per day. This solid production was driven by 66 wells tied in on our joint venture acreage with average 30-day IP rates of about 300 Boe per day, right in line with our tight curve expectations.","As I mentioned earlier, the anticipated addition of the Eagle Ford assets to our opportunity set and our decision to grow within operating cash flow has resulted in high grading across our portfolio and the Mississippian-Woodford is no exception. In 2014, we expect to maintain positive momentum in this play focusing our activity on our joint venture acreage where we have the benefit of the JV carry. The partnership will spend approximately $850 million to run an inter-rig program and drill more than 200 wells. After the benefit of Devon\u2019s drilling carry, Devon\u2019s portion will be about $200 million in the play this year.","So in summary, we had strong execution in 2013 and we\u2019re on course to deliver another year of robust growth in 2014. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to John for the financial review and outlook, John?","John Richels","Thanks, David. Our new Chief Financial Officer, Tom Mitchell joined us on Monday of this week and of course, a lot of you know Tom and I\u2019d just like to take this opportunity to welcome Tom to the Devon senior leadership team. For those of you who don\u2019t know Tom, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have the opportunity or many opportunities to get to know him over the next while. Since Tom has only been here for a couple of days, I\u2019m going to cover the financial review today. But you can expect to hear from Tom in future quarters.","So let me start with a brief review of the financial and operating results for 2013 as well as a bit of a commentary on our outlook for 2014. For those of you modeling Devon, we will file a Form 8-K after the call today that contains detailed first quarter and full year estimates for both our go forward assets and the divestiture assets. Estimates for our divestiture assets assume a full year of results. As we close on these divestiture packages throughout the year, we\u2019ll provide updated guidance. So let\u2019s start with production. Our top line production in the fourth quarter averaged 696,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which was well above the midpoint of our previous forecast.","Looking specifically at the oil side of our business, we again delivered excellent volume growth. Fourth quarter oil production averaged 177,000 barrels per day setting a new quarterly record and exceeding the top end of our guidance range by about 2000 barrels per day. Our most significant growth came from the U.S. where high margin, light oil production increased 32% year-over-year. Looking forward to the first quarter and assuming one month of contribution from the Eagle Ford properties, we expect our average daily oil production from our go forward properties to range between 172,000 and 180,000 barrels per day which excludes about 14,000 barrels per day that are associated with the divestiture assets.","This implies a first quarter year-over-year growth rate of around 20% for our go forward properties on a reported basis. Driving this first quarter growth is a 50% increase and high margin oil production from our go forward U.S. operations. Combining this meaningful oil growth with our projected growth in NGLs and the declines we expect in natural gas production, we expect our first quarter production to range between 556,000 and 579,000 BOEs per day for our go forward properties. Now that excludes roughly 130 BOEs per day that\u2019s attributable to the divestiture assets.","This represents a top line growth rate in the mid-to-high single digits for our go forward properties on a reported basis compared to the same period a year ago. We\u2019ll post a historical reconciliation of retained and non-core asset production on our website later today. Moving to price realizations in the fourth quarter, our regional pricing by product was generally in line with expectations. One notable exception was wider than expected differentials on Canadian oil production.","For the fourth quarter Devon\u2019s realized Canadian oil price before hedges averaged 50% of the WTI benchmarks price or about $48.50 per barrel. However, we did mitigate the impact on realizations with the cash settlements on our Western Canadian select basis swats. The basis swats enhance their overall oil price in Canada or the quarter by more than $4 per barrel or nearly 10%. ","As many of you know by now, the fourth quarter weakness in Canadian oil pricing resulted from high levels of refinery downtime and restricted oil rates on key export pipelines. The good news is that these temporary bottlenecks have gradually improved, narrowing differentials in the first quarter. As a result, we now expect our Canadian oil price realizations in the first quarter to be approximately 60% of WTI.","Turning now to our midstream business, our marketing and midstream operating profit reached $513 million in 2013. This result came in at the top half of our guidance range and represents a 25% increase compared to 2012. The increase in operating profit was attributable to improved natural gas prices during the year and also strong cost control.","Moving to 2014, we expect our first quarter midstream operating profit to range between $125 million and $155 million. This forecast assumes the transfer of most of our midstream business to EnLink Midstream during March, which will have only a minor impact on first quarter reporting.","After accounting for the inclusion of EnLink, our full year 2014 midstream operating profit is expected to range from $685 million to $755 million, which is a 40% increase compared to 2013. Beyond the first quarter, the EnLink transaction will have more significant implications on our go-forward financial reporting.","Because we are the majority owner of EnLink\u2019s general partnership at 70% and the MLP at 53%, accounting guidelines require that 100% of EnLink\u2019s revenues, expenses, debt and capital be consolidated within our financial statements. The minority ownership interest from the financial line items that we do not own will be netted together and deducted on a line item in our financials entitled, non-controlling interest. We expect our non-controlling interest cutback for the full year 2014 be less than $50 million.","It\u2019s worth nothing that the economic reality of the EnLink transaction is very different from the accounting presentation. Devon, in fact, does not own EnLink\u2019s assets or revenues, we\u2019re not obligated for EnLink\u2019s expenses or indebtedness and EnLink\u2019s capital expenditures do not come from our cash balances.","The economic reality is that we own a large portion of the entities that make up EnLink and receive a large chunk of EnLink\u2019s cash distributions. Assuming that we had closed the transaction on January 1st of this year, our share of distributions would have been expected to be approximately $270 million for 2014. And as EnLink executes its growth plans and increase its payout, our distributions are expected to grow.","Moving now to expenses, we did a good job controlling cost across our portfolio throughout 2013. In the fourth quarter, our total pre-tax cash cost came in at $15.05 per Boe, that\u2019s about a 1% decline compared to the year ago quarter. Overall, our cost structure remains one of the best in the industry, even as we transition our portfolio to higher margin, but higher cost oil production.","Looking at cost trends in 2014, the 100% consolidation of EnLink Midstream will place upward pressure on a few expense line items, but the net effect of EnLink is positive to our earnings and cash flow.","As I mentioned earlier, 8-K filings that will be available after the call today contains detailed first quarter and full year estimates.","Now before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial condition.","In the fourth quarter, our operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, a 26% increase compared to the year ago period. When you include the $419 million of cash payments received from asset sales during the year, Devon generated total cash inflows of $5.9 billion in 2013.","From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we remain exceptionally strong with investment grade credit rating and cash balances totaling $6.1 billion. In December, we repatriated another $2.3 billion of foreign cash back to the U.S. You may recall we repatriated about $2 billion of foreign cash balances earlier in 2013, so in total we\u2019re able to successfully repatriate $4.3 billion of foreign cash back to the US in 2013 at an estimated tax rate of only 4%. To provide some perspective on the significance of this you might recall after divesting our international assets in 2010 and 2011, we guided towards a tax rate of about 20%. The lower tax rate on the amount repatriate to the US resulted in an incremental $700 million benefit to Devon shareholders are nearly $2.00 per share. In the fourth quarter, we also issued $2.2 billion -- $2.25 billion of senior notes through a combination of two, three and five-year offerings and entered into an undrawn $2 billion senior term loan facility. ","Proceeds from the senior notes, the term loan facility and cash on hand will fund our previously announced Eagle Ford acquisition. As a result of these debt offerings at December 31st our net debt was $6 billion. Our year end capital structure pro forma for the closing of the Eagle Ford, EnLink and Canadian Conventional transactions increases our net debt balances to just over $10 billion of which roughly $1 billion is attributable to the EnLink consolidation. So even before any proceeds from our US divesture process that would further reduce debt, Devon is very well positioned financially with solid investment credit rating. So with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A, Vince.","Vince White","","Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, your line is now open.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","","Can you put your E&P budget in context versus 2013, $250 million moves out for the Canadian sale then we had $1.1 billion for the Eagle Ford, can you talk more specifically about where are you\u2019re seeing the high grading what the total change in carry is and whether capitalized interest is included in your $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion?","David Hager","","Hi Brian, this is David Hager, I\u2019ll take a stab at that. First off, capitalized interest and G&A is not included in the $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. When you look at where we\u2019ve high graded the program I\u2019ll say roughly the Permian activity is about the same; we\u2019ve obviously added $1.1 billion in Eagle Ford, the overall capital is slightly lower than we had last year, probably a couple of hundred million or so, so there is a little bit of reduction. The biggest reduction will be in our Barnett and Cana areas where we are drilling less of the liquids rich opportunities and we\u2019re also spending less money in the Canadian Conventional as well, and then finally we have a little bit smaller land budget this year as compared to last year. So if you look in our key development area of the Permian it\u2019s essentially flat, key oil development area essentially flat, the heavy oil essentially flat, the addition of a oil or condensate area in the Eagle Ford and cutting back in liquids rich drilling land and the Canadian Conventional. ","John Richels","Brian, just to close the loop on that let you know that capitalized G&A and interest are about $400 million and that those are included in the total capital when we say we intend to live within cash flow in 2014.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","","Great, thanks, is there a major change in the carry, you didn\u2019t mention what your after carry numbers would be in a couple of the areas but do you expect a major cause in the carried interest?","David Hager","No, it's essentially flat.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks. And then in the Permian, can you talk more specifically regarding the Bone Spring wells that are trending well above your type curve whether this is something that\u2019s regionally concentrated or specifically area concentrated or whether that broader takeaway is across your Delaware position?","John Richels","Well, I would say, we're hopeful and optimistic that it is broader takeaways across the entire Bone Spring\u2019s position. What we've done, Brian is we have moved our activity from the North Western portion of our acreage position in Lea and Eddy counties expanding that to the South and Southeast in the same counties so to where we have additional acreage.","We are starting to appraise those areas and what we're finding is that we're getting as good a well result if not better in the South and Southeast area as we had in the Northwest portion of our acreage position. Now we don't have as many wells there yet but so far the results are very encouraging.","So that's why we're optimistic this inventory is going to continue to grow and frankly, we haven't booked hardly any PUDs, just being a little bit conservative there, we haven't booked hardly any PUDs on the basis of all the results that we've had there as well. So we're very optimistic that the results are going to continue and that we are actually going to be able to continue to grow the inventory as well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","John Richels","Operator, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Hey. Good morning guys. Can you hear me now?","John Richels","Yes. Thank you.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Oh! Good. So first question maybe a follow-up on the Permian, that largely flat CapEx guide there but could you provide a rig and well count assumptions there? And then also a very strong horizontal Delaware Wolfcamp well in Ward county, just any other additional color around the well and costs, lateral length, and whether you\u2019re targeting any other shallower zones here in 2014 or just going after the deeper formation? Thanks.","David Hager","Yeah. And we're going to, again, as I said, our activity level is essentially flat this year at around $1.5 billion, total; we're going to be drilling somewhere around the order of 350 wells across the entire Permian position all while utilizing 22 to 23 rigs, they will vary a little bit during the year, somewhere on that order.","As I said during the call about $900 million of that is going to be spent in the Delaware Basin, primarily drilling Bone Spring wells, about 130 Bone Spring wells, about 160 overall wells, we\u2019ll have 11 to 12 rigs working on that play this year.","I also mentioned the Midland-Wolfcamp where we are going to spent about $200 million, in that area we plan to drill about 150 wells -- 140 wells or so in the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale and maybe about 10 or so in the Cline.","We'll also spend about $200 million in the Wolfberry drilling about 40 wells using a couple of rigs there; in the Central Basin platform we\u2019ll have about 10 wells using a couple of rigs and then we'll spend about $150 million additionally for leasing facilities, OBO, and other type projects. So there is a, I think a pretty comprehensive breakdown of our $1.5 billion.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","That's great. And any other in terms of the\u2026","John Richels","I'm sorry, on the Delaware\u2026","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Yeah.","John Richels","On the Delaware Wolfcamp, we're very excited about it and so we think there is potential, we have a significant acreage position not only on the Texas side, but as you move up into New Mexico, we have some geological modeling and thoughts, I would say, about where we think the most prospective area is. I obviously don't want to get into lot of details around that, but we're encouraged by what we see, we're going to continue to drill a handful of wells this year to evaluate portions of our acreage position and see if we can get some additional opportunity to capture.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great. Just secondly if I could on the CapEx. I don't know if you gave a midstream component, if that was within the guidance that was flat year-on-year, and I mean, how do you think about midstream capital spend when living within the cash flow, meaning should that be included now that there is a strong inventory of assets that can be tax efficiently monetized into EnLink post deal close?","John Richels","Yeah. When you look pre-consolidation numbers for Devon, so excluding EnLink any capital expenditures that we will undertake are included in our segment that we intend to live within cash flow. And obviously a lot of the capital expenditures on a consolidated basis will really be EnLink\u2019s capital.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Right. But that ultimately could be monetized through the MLP as you think about it going forward. Is that fair?","John Richels","That is fair. And we\u2019re spending about $400 million on completion of the expansion on the Access Pipeline and that\u2019s clearly a potential dropdown item.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Good morning","John Richels","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","I have a quick question, just kind of clarifying the oil guidance for 2014. Is it 198 to 216 MBOE per day \u2013 BOEs per day, pardon me, just on oil excluding Canada?","John Richels","","No, that\u2019s oil including Canada, Arun.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","","Including or excluding Canada, just wanted to clarify that.","John Richels","That\u2019s including Canada, but not \u2013 exclusive of the barrels we\u2019re selling.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","","That\u2019s what I wanted to clarify.","John Richels","Yeah, there\u2019s some oil in that \u2013 there some minor oil properties in the Canadian asset package and that number that we gave you excludes those barrels, excludes that 15,000 \u2013 excludes about 15,000 barrels that we\u2019re selling.","Vincent White","So that is the go forward company.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Thanks for clarifying that. And then John, you mentioned 20% growth on top of that for 15 would be your expectation as we stand here today?","John Richels","Yes.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Okay, just wanted to clarify that.","John Richels","Yeah, thank you.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","The second point I just wanted to comment John, you talked about obviously a lower CapEx number for \u201914 and you expect to see kind of 20% oil growth going forward. Do you expect to be able to do that within cash flows on a go forward basis?","John Richels","Yeah, absolutely. The position we\u2019ve put ourselves into Arun, is with these steps that we\u2019ve taken over the past while, is we\u2019ve got a company now that we can grow or we can grow oil on a multiyear basis at about 20% even after we\u2019ve let gas decline because we\u2019re not investing in gas properties or dry gas properties at this time. We\u2019ll still see top line growth in the mid single digits on a six to one basis probably around close to 10% on the 20 to one basis if you want to look at it more in an economic equivalency basis. And we can do all of that while living within cash flows. So it really reflects the big step up in margin that we\u2019ve been able to accomplish and the much more prospective and efficient asset base that we have today going forward.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","","That\u2019s helpful. And my last question is I don\u2019t know if Darryl Smette is on the line. I know [inaudible] is expected to come on line about the middle part of the year, just wanted to \u2013 Darryl could maybe comment on expectations on heavy oil differentials going forward after find [indiscernible] online.","Darryl Smette","Certainly, I\u2019ll be happy to. You know, Dave mentioned in his comments and John also mentioned in his comments, over the last two and a half or three years we\u2019ve had supply in demand get fairly low balanced for oil coming out of Canada. When I use the term demand, I\u2019m talking about refining capacity, the oil capacity, pipeline capacity. We are starting to see now a speculation between that supply in demand as new refineries come online or have [indiscernible] and that is more heavy oil to that. And we\u2019re also seeing increase in pipeline exploits coming out of Canada to the United States. One of those as you mentioned is planned in south.","We\u2019re planning it just outside of Chicago, for those of you who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a pipeline that will move about 600,000 barrels a day from Chicago down to Kuching where it will interconnect with a couple of other pipelines and take oil to the Gulf Coast. The reason that is very important for us is about 9 million barrels of refining capacity exists in the Gulf Coast, about 35% of that is for heavy oil.","So it provides excellent opportunity to move more heavy oil to the Gulf Coast market and that\u2019s why we think as we go through the last part of this year, we actually could find South is going to be on the end of the third quarter, later fourth quarter. But we will start to see differentials become less volatile that they have been and that those differentials will continue to get narrow.","","Vincent White","This is Vince. I want to correct something I said earlier. I said that we were going to spend about $400 million in 2014 on the expansion of the Access Pipeline. That\u2019s actually our total Devon portion of midstream expenditures. And about three fourths of that is the Access Pipeline.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hsulin Peng from Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird","Good morning, everyone. So the first question is also a clarification question. I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but could you give out the production associated with the U.S. non core asset sale that you are expecting this year in your guidance number?","John Richels","It will be in our detail guidance and we did provide the production associated with the Canadian reserves and it previously provided -- okay.","David Hager","","I\u2019ve got it here, so the production, maybe fourth quarter 2013 production. First on the Canadian conventional, that we just divested, it was a total of 88,000 Boe per day consisting of 412 million cubic feet of gas a day, 9000 barrels of NGL a day and 10,000 barrels of oil a day. The remaining assets that we\u2019re looking at divesting in the U.S. and again this could vary a little bit depending on what we actually sell. But our anticipated assets sales would have production of around 57,000 Boe per day of which a little over 250 million or so will be gas, about 9000 barrels of NGL a day and 4000 barrels of oil a day.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Got it.","David Hager","Did I gave what you wanted?","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird ","Yeah, that number is excluded from your going forward, that\u2019s a going forward number.","John Richels","That\u2019s not in the new Devon or in the retained assets. And when we talk about new Devon or retained assets, that does not include that number.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird ","Okay. Got it. And if you [inaudible] basis and also potential basis, maybe the tax basis or the assets in the U.S., this will trend out in this tax implication there potentially?","John Richels","In the U.S., our tax basis is fairly low. As you can see that was in the case in Canada. We had a very high basis and we\u2019re able to take advantage of several other opportunities to keep our taxes down. They\u2019re very low number coming on Canada. Now, even though we have a low basis in the United States, these properties would be available for 1031 like kind exchange, that\u2019s something that made a sense of the time.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird","Okay, yeah, now that will be good. And then my further questions, the first one is regarding the Jackfish 3. So I think you mentioned that the first oil is expected in late \u201814. So is it fair to assume, I guess, I\u2019m just trying to understand the ramp to the 35,000 in 2015. How is that ramp shape, is it graduals that function, how should we think about it?","John Richels","The way that these heavy oil projects work, we are going to start steaming later on this year within the third quarter. And it takes about a period of something like 16 months, 14 to 16 month to ramp up, to get enough heat in the ground, enough steam in the ground to really get that working. So that\u2019s a typical ramp up and so when we talk about that ramp up in oil production, anticipate starting to steam this fall, you start to see an increase, the slight increase in oil production, then it continues to ramp up all the way through \u201815 and then from \u201815 onward, its pretty much running flat at 35,000 barrels a day.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird ","Okay, so it is\u2026 ","John Richels","Think of it as a steady ramp-up, not a step function.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird ","Okay. But the full -- the peak production is not expected until \u201816.","John Richels","Probably late \u201815 or early \u201816 somewhere near.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird ","Okay, got it. And then in this Woodford area, I thought the production growth was pretty good quarter-over-quarter, this quarter. And you also mentioned that you exceeded your exit rate. I was wondering if you have a new exit rate for 2014\u2026 ","John Richels","We didn\u2019t catch that area of that. It\u2019s at the Miss-Woodford, you\u2019re talking actually.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird ","Right. Miss-Woodford area.","John Richels","Yeah, we had an exit rate around 16,000 in December, average about 14,000 for the quarter and exceeded our expectations of 15,000. We don't have an absolute exit rate for 2014, we are optimistic as some more 20,000 to 25,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re still doing a lot of appraisal work out there and so there\u2019s going to be variability. So the results probably somewhere on that order of magnitude.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird","Okay.","John Richels","Okay. We got a lot of questions. So we\u2019re going to move on to the last caller.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird","Sorry.","John Richels","No problem, thank you.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird","Okay, thanks. ","John Richels","Operator, we're ready for the final, final question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Yes. Thanks for getting me in here guys. One quick question, I'm sorry to believe it this point, but John you said that the topline was going to be -- I believe you said top line is going to be 10% for a week in 2014 and let you know update, that is over the year as you saw some of those US assets, is that right?","John Richels ","Well, I think what we said is on a going forward basis, multi-year basis, we drill the oil at somewhere around 20% and topline on a 21 basis somewhere around 10%.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it. Okay. And then switching to your Eagle Ford. Can you talk a bit about, I know you haven't closed on the acquisition yet, but have you been able to engage with your partner there at all and do you have any thoughts about how you might try to perhaps change, how operations have been running there last year?","David Hager","Yeah, this is Dave. Yeah, we've been able to engage with BHP quite a bit and of course we haven't closed on the transaction yet, but we have had numerous meetings with them, talking about how everything is going and how we might be able to help out with the partnership. I think the one thing in particular that we're going to really bring to the table, it is our ability to execute what you might want to call the machine. The ability to manage the large number of rigs and then actually bring those wells on production with -- in a very timely manner, that's something we're very good at. We have 35 plus rigs running in Barnett at one point and we've been very active with this unconventional plays for a long time. It's of course skillset and I think that's something that we're really going to bring to the table.","We're very impressed with the technical work they are doing, I'll tell you that. So, we think we are going to have a good exchange of technical information, they are very open to listening to us, so we think it's going to be great partnership.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Thanks for that detail John. ","John Richels ","Thanks, Charles. Well for [inaudible] I'm showing we're a little past at the top of the hour, but just before signing off let me leave you with a few key take away. First, we've taken some bold steps in a relatively short period of time to high grade our portfolio and improve the growth trajectory of our go forward business with our acquisition of the Eagle Ford, the creation of End link and the divesture of a Canadian conventional business as we talked a lot about today. ","We have an emergence with a formidable and balanced portfolio positions to deliver oil production growth around 35% in 2014 led by a 75% increase in U.S oil production. We are going to achieve this attractive growth without spending within operating cash flow and lastly, while the remaining exciting changes occurring at Devon, our approach to business remains the same. We will continue to pursue our top strategic objective and that is to maximize long-term growth in cash flow per share after adjusting for debt. So, we look forward to talking with you again on the next call. And thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference you may now disconnect. "]}}
