My name is Brad, and I'll be your operator on the call today. Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks so much, Brad. Hello everyone. We really appreciate you finding time to join us this morning. We're going to kick things off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, reviewing our results and then we'll open the call up for questions. We're really happy to have Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking with us.","Of course, I need to remind everyone that in addition to today's press release, we have also provided presentation, financial supplement, and you can find these materials at investor.citizensbank.com.","And our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ from expectations in our SEC filings, including our 8-K that we filed today.","And then we utilize non-GAAP financial measures and we provide you information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings materials.","And with that, I will hand to Mr. Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.","We're pleased to announce strong quarterly results today; it's always great to get off to a good start to the year. But importantly beyond the short-term results, I feel we're really doing a good job of staying focused on evolving our long-term strategy, given the rapid changes in technology, customer expectations, and the competitive dynamics that we face.","We've changed from opportunity and risk; we seek to exploit opportunities that will strengthen our franchise, while minimizing potential risk. We have a significant cross section of our leadership team engaged in these efforts and the key will be to make good decisions to prioritize wealth and then go out and execute. The balancing the long and short-term requires skill and I believe we're doing a good job overall on this.","Let me give you a few high-level takes on the quarter, before John gives you the full details.","Now the quarter had some seasonal impacts but the year-over-year comparisons are the most meaningful. Our underlying earnings per share was up 19% year-over-year aided by the strong operating leverage which was 3.2% and even more impressively was 5% excluding acquisitions. What really stood out for me was strong fee income growth of X% ex the acquisitions compared with only 2% expense growth ex-acquisitions. We have consistently invested in our commercial fee businesses and regaining real traction in deepening relationships.","Our capital markets revenue hit a record in the quarter; up 38%, has been our Global Markets business which is foreign exchange and interest rate products where revenues were up 33%. We just handled some great talents and were able to compete highly effectively against the biggest banks and our peers.","And our TOP programs really are differentiating allowing us to become more efficient while serving customers more effectively. We bumped our TOP 5 estimated impact to $95 million to $105 million which is up $5 million and were hard at work on TOP 6 which is expected to be bigger and potentially more transformational.","Another highlight for the quarter was our strong year-over-year average loan growth of 6% along with sequential loan growth of 1.5%. We continue to focus on attractive areas to deploy capital and improve our risk-adjusted returns.","On the deposit side, we grew average deposits 6% year-on-year and 2% sequential quarter. We bought the spot quarter and loan to deposit ratio down below 95% with some nice performance from Citizens Access which has $4.6 billion in deposits as of quarter end.","Even with the strong deposit growth, our deposit costs were manageable and our NIM held steady. We now have some additional balance sheet flexibility as we look ahead.","On balance sheet management overall, I'm pleased with our DSO efforts which provide us a razor sharp focus on enhancing our growth, our NIM, and our return on capital.","We continue to deploy some great new technology to better serve customers and to run the bank better. Slide 14 of our presentation provides you with some of the color including four new fintech partnerships in the quarter. Sufficed to say we expect a big leap forward in our technology capability and delivery in 2019. To me, it is one of the keys to our year.","So overall we maintain a positive outlook for the balance of 2019 as we expect another year of good execution and further progress across the board.","Let me stop there and turn it over to our CFO, John Woods.","John Woods","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone.","We're pleased with solid first quarter results that highlight steady execution against our enterprise level initiative, with particular focus on robust positive operating leverage. We continued our momentum in delivering cost efficiencies, while making the long-term investments required for sustainable success.","So let me kick-off by covering several important highlights of the quarter. So on Page 4, we delivered EPS growth of 19% year-on-year with PPNR up 13%. A strong focus on growing the top-line, while being disciplined on expenses, drove positive operating leverage of 5% before the impact of our recent acquisitions. Overall credit quality remains very good with a relatively stable net charge-off ratio of 31 basis points and a decrease in the non-performing loans ratio.","Our consumer and commercial banking segments are delivering strong and prudent loan growth, 1.5% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year and we continue to gain traction in fee income with this quarter's results highlighted by record capital markets and FX and interest rate products fees.","Deposit growth outpaced loan growth during the quarter in part due to ongoing momentum in Citizens Access, and as a result, we drove a nice improvement in our spot LDR to 94.9%. This puts us in a strong liquidity position as we head into the second quarter.","In addition, DDA was stable year-over-year as we continue to do a nice job of executing on our initiatives together low cost deposits more efficiently and effectively.","We also continue to actively manage our capital base returning $349 million of capital to common shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. We delivered underlying ROTCE of 13.1% which is up 141 basis points year-over-year. And our tangible book value per share was up 9% year-over-year and 3% sequential quarter.","We finished the quarter with a strong 10.5% CET1 ratio.","Across both business segments, we continue to make significant investments in broadening our capabilities and strengthening the franchise, as we balanced delivering on our near-term objectives and executing against our long-term strategy. We have some exciting things to talk about this quarter and I'll expand on our strategic initiatives in a few minutes.","On Page 6, our net interest margin came in broadly stable for the quarter, even though average LIBOR rose than the prior quarter and the long end of the curve was lower than anticipated. The December short-term rate drives drove higher loan yields but this was tempered a bit by robust growth and shift mix in deposits which put some upward pressure on deposit costs as well as by an increase in securities premium amortization due to drop in loan raised.","Turning to fees on Page 7. We delivered very solid results despite some seasonal headwinds. As I mentioned earlier, we saw record results in both capital markets and in foreign exchange and interest rate products, reflecting continued benefits from investments in broadening and enhancing our capabilities, as we are increasingly able to win lead less mandates against the larger national players. This helped overcome expected seasonal headwinds in mortgage, service charges, and card fees.","Capital markets delivered a 38% increase in fees year-over-year, with strengthened loan syndications, M&A and advisory fees, and bond underwriting fees, overcoming lower market volumes and loan syndications which were down significantly.","Results were up 20% linked quarter largely tied to an increase in M&A and bond underwriting activity as market conditions improved from the fourth quarter which helped offset the impact of the typical seasonal decline in loan syndications.","In global markets, FX and interest rate products were up 33% year-over-year led by the IRP team, which was able to win some nice lead transactions and take advantage of the flat yield curve by restructuring the existing client hedges. In FX, higher dollar volatility created the opportunity for favorable hedging across a number of currencies. Because of what we saw happening with the long end of the curve, we took the opportunity to lock in some securities gains and executed on targeted asset dispositions which increased other income in the first quarter. This helped offset headwinds in mortgage where Franklin fees was down $14 million linked quarter largely as lower rates and an $11 million of MSR losses and also origination levels dropped reflecting tough market conditions.","The integration of Franklin is on track and while the first quarter was challenging, we see an improving environment in 2Q and continue to believe this is an attractive and important customer business for us to be in over the long-term.","Turning to Page 8. Expenses were up 3% linked quarter reflecting seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by seasonally lower outside services costs. Year-over-year before the impact of acquisitions, non-interest expense was very well controlled up 2% reflecting strong expense management and benefits from our TOP program.","We are identifying further opportunities to streamline our operations and activities across the organization to capitalize on the next level of efficiencies which include a strong focus on end-to-end automation across the front and back office. These activities will be critical to maintain our operating objectives over time. As a result, we remain committed to self fund our growth initiatives and deliver compelling products and services to an increasingly digitally oriented customer base.","Let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On Page 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and generate nice returns from the investments we've made in our geographic and industry verticals expansion strategies with strong progress and higher growth geographies like the Southeast and Texas.","We are also seeing attractive risk adjusted return opportunities in commercial real estate with growth tied to high quality projects largely in office and multifamily.","We remain disciplined around client selection where we are focused on larger MSAs. On the retail side, we also continue to drive growth in innovative and attractive risk adjusted return categories like education refinance and unsecured including our merchant partnerships.","Overall, we grew loans by 1.5% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year, despite the impact in the planned runoff and auto non-core and leasing as well as some modest impact from asset dispositions tied to balance sheet optimization.","Loan yields improved by 13 basis points in the first quarter reflecting continued mix shift towards higher returning categories and a backdrop of higher short-term rates driven by the December rate increase.","As you can see on Page 10, we are doing a nice job of growing deposits which were up 2% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year with stable results in DDA, as we continue to do a nice job of executing on our initiatives to gather low cost deposits and capitalize on the inherent value of our franchise.","Our total deposit costs were relatively well controlled given the strong growth of 15 basis points linked quarter reflecting the impact of higher rates and a shift in deposit mix as we drove new customer acquisition and managed down the LDR from 97.6% to 94.9% at the end of the quarter. Note that interest bearing deposit costs grew 16 basis points sequential quarter.","We continue to make investments across Citizens Access digital platform where we are gaining share nationally in the mass affluent and affluent segments. This platform has contributed nicely to our funding diversification and optimization of deposit levels and costs. At the end of the first quarter, we reached $4.6 billion in Citizens Access deposits.","Year-over-year, our asset yields expanded 49 basis points reflecting the benefit of higher rates and the impact of our BSO initiatives.","Our total cost of funds was up 48 basis points reflecting a shift towards a more balanced mix of long-term and short-term funding and higher rates.","Next, let's move to Page 11 and cover credit, which continues to look quite good with the continued mix shift towards higher quality low risk retail loan and a relatively stable risk profile in our commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio improved to 66 basis points of loans this quarter down from 78 basis points a year ago.","The net charge-off rate of 31 basis points for the first quarter was relatively stable linked quarter and up modestly year-over-year from relatively low levels. Overall, we feel good about the credit metrics and trends in the book including a downward shift and criticized asset levels.","Provision for credit losses of $85 million was relatively stable with prior quarter and prior year levels.","Our allowance to loans coverage ratio remains relatively stable ending in the quarter at 1.06% and as we increase the mix of higher quality retail portfolios in our overall loan book.","The NPL coverage ratio improved to 160% as we saw improvement in NPLs and runoff in the non-core portfolio.","On Page 12, we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.5% which came down from 10.6% in the fourth quarter. Also this quarter, we repurchased $200 million of common stock and returned a total of $349 million to common shareholders including dividend.","Our planned glide path to reduce our CET1 ratio remains on track and we remain confident in our ability to drive improving financial performance and attractive returns to shareholders. Our current plan is to announce our buyback plans later in the second quarter. As a broad comment, we expect to meet expectations.","On Page 13, I want to highlight a few exciting things that are happening with our enterprise wide initiatives. As we work on running the bank better and improving our customer experience, we've launched a new digital mortgage application and home buying platforms that we're very excited about as it will drive cost efficiencies and an improved customer experience.","Given our strong focus on strengthening our advice based model and consumer, we recently opened a new banking and wealth center in Downtown, Boston. This approach allows us to deliver tailored advice ideas and solutions to help our clients with all of their banking and investment needs.","We are full steam ahead on the integration of Clarfeld which is progressing ahead of schedule. We continue to gain traction on our merchant partnership platform where we recently signed agreements with several new partners including ADT which should be announced later in Q2.","In commercial, we continue with the build out of our Treasury Solutions business as we begin piling -- we began piloting accessOPTIMA our new cash management platform which offers clients a comprehensive suite of online cash management resources and real time mobile capabilities.","We also launched real time payments to make customer payments more efficient and we are partnering with Worldpay to expand our international payment capabilities. These are just the latest examples of the significant investments Citizens is making in the commercial banking technology and solutions in order to meet and exceed the ever changing financial management needs of our clients.","Finally, we continue to exceed expectations in our TOP programs where we have now increased the expected benefit from our TOP 5 program by about $5 million with an expected estimated benefit in the range of $95 million to $105 million.","Our outlook for the second quarter is on Page 14 and it reflects continued momentum in both our top and bottom-line results. We expect our linked quarter average loans to be up approximately 50 basis points and we are considering selling some loans in the quarter as we seek to redeploy capital under our BSO initiative.","We also expect net interest margin to be stable to down slightly due to continued but decelerating deposit repricing that will abate over the back half of the year. The NIM should bottom out in the second quarter and gradually rise in the second half of the year given less deposit pressure and the benefit of fixed loan and securities repricing at higher rates, along with further balance sheet optimization impacts.","In non-interest income, we are expecting to see growth in the mid-single-digits range given continuing strength in commercial and a seasonal uptick in consumer. We expect non-interest expense to be flat to up 1% as seasonal decreases are offset by higher revenue related expenses. We also continue to expect to deliver positive operating leverage and further efficiency ratio improvement.","Additionally, we expect provision expense to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million.","And finally, we expect our CET1 ratio to be broadly stable. Overall, we expect our full-year results to be broadly in line with our overall guidance. But there will be puts and takes with modestly lower net interest income offset by better fee income and expense performance.","Also in response to the rapidly changing environment and a little less tailwind from rising rates, we've been doing some early work on a transformational expense program designed to boost efficiency and effectiveness. This will provide additional capacity to invest more heavily in revenue producing capabilities, while ensuring that we maintain strong financial performance into the future. Stay tuned for more details on our second quarter call.","To sum up on Page 15, our results this quarter demonstrate our continuing strong performance as we execute against our strategic initiatives, carefully manage our expense base, and improve how we run the bank to drive underlying revenue growth.","Let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, thanks very much John. Brad, I think it's time to open it up for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions].","And the first question in the queue will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Just looking to get a little bit more color on the deposit efforts this quarter. In what areas, what types of deposits were you pushing, was there any broad-based increase in stated rates and then what's your outlook there. Is there a continued push beyond your existing national platform that you're going to continue to push the products and therefore deposit rates higher? Thanks.","John Woods","Yes, so how are you doing? Its John here, I'll go ahead and comment on that. So average deposits to total deposits were up very strongly this quarter we were very pleased to see the take up. It was driven primarily by term and savings. Those were the two drivers. I think we saw some good performance in the DDA area as well. We've been making lots of investments in that play -- in that space. So year-over-year DDA was relatively flat. We were very pleased with that. We had a strong 2018 and we look to continue that momentum going forward.","Citizens Access had an excellent quarter. That'll continue into the future. I'd say that strong deposit growth really drove the LDR down to around the 95% level as you heard earlier. I think looking forward, I think you could see that LDR level staying relatively stable into the second quarter and continuing to see growth looking forward in the term and saving space.","But I think big picture a big deceleration. I would say in interest bearing deposit costs, the further away you get from the Fed rise in December is going to see that deceleration in the second quarter to where that solidifies in H2 which connects back to our NIM guide which will look to increase in the later part of the year.","Bruce Van Saun","I would just add a little color there is that there is broader efforts in just Citizens Access. Citizens Access in and of itself is a huge success story, but on commercial we've been investing in certain areas where we think we can gain some real traction in picking up natural share deposits with our pre-existing customers where we maybe didn't have the capabilities we talked about ex-growth, we talked about bankruptcy. So we're building those out. Those don't turn on a dime, they build gradually with time. So we're pleased with how that's developing.","And then on the core consumer side, continuing to invest in data and analytics and being a little sharper in our offerings and targeting them to different segments of the market particularly mass affluent and affluent, we are seeing traction there. So pretty good performance across the board and very pleased the LDR is at a lower level now so which gives us a lot of flexibility going forward.","John Pancari","Got it. Thanks Bruce. And then, separately just on what you just mentioned in your -- in the end of your prepared remarks transformational expense program that you're looking at. I know you said it would be fair to give us details on the second quarter call but just in general how do you view it being transformational and using that phrase, I mean is it more about how you're looking at your branches or is it a longer-term profitability change in terms of where you're operating on an efficiency ratio basis. Just a little bit more color there on how you view it as transformational? Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. So I think what we've done for the five years prior has been really just work on ideas and coming up with deployment of different strategies around organizational design, spans and layers, automating starting to look at process automation and robotics. I think what we're -- and also some branch thinning and the like.","I think what we're after in this go round is something that's a little broader in scope and so really deploying new technologies, artificial intelligence, and the like to new strategies for technology development. So there's a lot around technology and operations and they've guts of how we're running things. There's a lot in looking at processes end-to-end in terms of the transactions that we have customer-facing transactions and how are we going to improve those both in terms of their cost efficiency and their effectiveness and customer experience. So we have a fair amount there.","So it's a broader look and typically in the TOP programs up to now, we've looked for very quick paybacks. So we didn't look at having significant technology investments and we wanted things that we would pay back within 18 months. And so in this version, we'll look at things a little more broader that might require some technology and might payback over two or three years but I do think we'll be able to move the needle on the efficiency ratio with the payback from these efforts. So we're quite excited, it\u2019s early days. We're working through some ideas.","The thing I would also emphasize here, John, is that we want to pair that with efforts that are going on for finding new revenue growth and finding different trusted ways to serve customers or create new products and services potentially a bit disruptive. There's a huge effort that we're undertaking now to really focus on how can we differentiate ourselves and similar to how we grew the education refinance business or we do the Apple relationship and having a very strong point of sale financing offering.","We want to drive forward, so we can have more revenue growth in our peer set and actually keep the top-line going and then create a virtuous circle where we've got a good top-line we can afford the investment et cetera. So it's really a one, two punch. So part of it is let's really go after the cost base and transformational, and some of that will drop to the bottom-line. But some of that will help fund these investments to really drive future revenue growth.","Operator","And our next question will come from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hey guys, good morning. Couple of questions. First can you give a little surprised with the outlook that you've actually seen NIMs ratcheting up in the second half and you gave some broad strokes as to why but if you could us, John, give us a little bit more detail on what's underlying -- what kind of assumptions are underlying that outlook? I assume you still expect deposit costs creep. But how much of it's being driven by balance sheet optimization, what kind of balance sheet optimization and also where you expecting the security deal to gravitate up as well in that assumption?","John Woods","Yes. I will jump on that. So I think if I'd taken in two pieces. I mean I think if you look at what we expect in 2Q and then how those forces expect to unfold over the second half of the year. I think where as we mentioned stable to down slightly in 2Q. The real driver there is rates. I mean I think when you look at where LIBOR is expected to be in 2Q, all the other drivers which I'll cover in a second basically offset and you're left with short-term rates being potentially down a couple of basis points which has an impact on our floating loan portfolio.","The other drivers that all seem to offset are expected to offset in the second quarter is all of those front book, back book dynamics. So you've got loan front book and loan and securities front book, back book which is positive in the second, it's positive in the first quarter, it's positive in second quarter, it will be positive for the rest of the year although possibly diminishing a bit as loan rates stay where they are.","But that's been offsetting the front book back book dynamic on the deposit side. And so I think you'll see, as I mentioned in my remarks, a significant abatement of deposit cost increases the farther away you get from the Fed rate rise in December. And so then -- so a combination of that front book, back book plus our balance sheet optimization initiatives is offsetting those other forces on the deposit side in 2Q and all you're left with is rates.","So when you get out of the second quarter as rates stabilized both on the short and the long end. You see deposit costs stabilizing and therefore you're left with front book, back book on our fixed portfolio driving some uplift. And I think those are the dynamics that we see at the moment in terms of the back half of 2019.","Saul Martinez","So even if rates remain where they're at long end and rates remain where they're at. The Fed funds remain where it's at. You still have positive new money yields over portfolio yields on your loan and your securities books right now?","John Woods","We do. So in the first quarter that was 80 basis points or so in terms of that net difference in the first quarter for investments. As an example a variety of our loan books or you could call it ranging from 25 basis points all the way up to 150 basis points but basically almost every category has a positive front book, back book across all of our earning assets.","And as if rates stay where they are, it's possible that will shrink a bit over time but it'll and maybe a portfolio too will eventually convert to something more neutral as you get later in the year. But all in, our overall portfolio as a positive front book by dynamic 50% of our loans are fixed and so that momentum continues through the rest of the year as a positive dynamic.","Saul Martinez","Got it. That's helpful. If I could change gears on credit. I think John in various forums recently and in the past you've talked about the challenging environment in the casual dining space. And can you just comment a little bit about where -- what you're seeing there. Is that a concern and what the size of the book is and then just more broadly what you're seeing in terms of credit and what drove the uptick in your loan loss provisioning guidance for 2Q, is that just normal the fact that it is so low and you're seeing some normal seasoning on the book?","Don McCree","So it's Don. I'll comment on casual dining, it's a relatively small portion of the book and it's actually coming down a little bit. So we're working through that which we signed a couple of quarters ago. We've really slowed down if not see certain segments of our franchisee in restaurant originations. So we don't see large loss content, it's not reflected in provisions already. So we feel like we've got our hands around that book and I'll just mention we had a charge-off this quarter which was in our real estate book which was reasonably significant. It's a kind of 2013 vintage origination, so it's quite old and we've been working it through our workout groups for about four, five years now. So it kind of went a little sideways, so we charged it off this quarter and almost --","Bruce Van Saun","Really it is idiosyncratic, I would add it's Bruce. But I think that was one that was in a unique bubble wrap and trying to part it over, so we don't see any read across anything else in commercial real estate.","Don McCree","And I agree that, that's true of the overall book. What we've seen is as problems over the last five or six quarters have been very idiosyncratic. We feel very good about the overall book and the condition of the economy and what we're seeing in terms of performance by our underlying credit.","Bruce Van Saun","Let me also add that credit class came down again.","Don McCree ","And all the credit ratios are very historically low and we don't see those changing.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","John Woods","And I said it's just the outlook for 2Q being up a bit. I mean I think we've historically had a significant amount of recoveries that come through the book and credit has been excellent. And so the outlook there remains so but possibly recovery is moderating a bit and I'm not sure --","Bruce Van Saun","The overall [ph] LIBOR.","John Woods","Yes, exactly. So that's the reason for that.","Saul Martinez","Do you disclose the size of the casual dining book?","John Woods","No, no, I don't think we give.","Operator","Question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks morning. I was actually wondering, can you guys talk just a little bit about how your plans around your balance sheet optimization are changing now that Fed maybe done raising rates this year?","John Woods","Yes, I'll go ahead and start on that. I'd say I'm not sure they changed very much. I mean we've been talking about the broad strokes of that program primarily on the deposit side where you would focus on all of the things you've heard from Bruce earlier. In commercial, new interesting I think ways to fund our loan growth in the escrow space and in consumer a lot of the data analytics and efforts around customer experience that are driving DDA take up. So I mean, I think all of that remains just as important in a world where the Fed is not raising rates as it is in a world where they are. So that that continues in that direction.","On the asset side similar I mean when you look at our rotation into we call it the asset categories that have really solid risk return profiles for us like such as student or unsecured investments we want to make in our commercial business to get more swings at the bat. With respect to our customers all of that is not meaningfully impacted by the Fed going on hold. I think that that continues and it's really something you would do with or without I think the Fed.","Bruce Van Saun","I'd say that the one thing there where we might be pivoting a little bit is that mortgage growth that we've had -- we'd like to taper that off a little bit and actually we could consider some sales of mortgages that we have on the balance sheet. So back in a low rate environment fully 30-year fixed on your books is a great trade. And so we think we can offset that. We've been talking for a while about how we're going to leverage our point-of-sale offering to some new partners.","One of the things we're quite pleased about is that we've now signed several important new partners including one which we can mention today, ADT it's in the press release will be out shortly on that but there's several other significant ones that will come out over the next several weeks. John, you want to comment on that?","John Woods","I will just say we've got a very good pipeline. We felt like we built a very unique value proposition with the Apple program and there's tremendous interest in the marketplace and we've got a really strong pipeline and I think there will be more news after ADT. I'm really excited about ADT.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay, perfect. And then your capital markets business held up really well this quarter especially relative to peers, looks like some of that was due to bond underwriting. Can you just remind us how your capital markets business or the business mix may differ from some of your peers?","John Woods","Sure. So I will take that. So first of all, we really have a very small equity business. So if you broadly talk about capital markets, I'd say ex-equity we do a little bit of equity in the REIT space with a partner who does the equity underwriting. Our business is really threefold, it's bond underwriting with both high yield and investment grade. It's syndicated financing which is largely leveraged syndicated financing aimed at the mid-market sponsor community, and thirdly it\u2019s M&A.","So this quarter we benefited from bond underwriting particularly high yield bond underwriting as things recovered from the weak market last year and there was some pent-up demand, so a lot of our clients issued in the high yield market. And then we saw Western Reserve in particular kick in and we had a quite, quite a strong M&A quarter and that we expect to continue through the end of the year both with Western Reserve and with Bowstring which was our latest acquisition. And the way I think about M&A is it took two or three quarters to have the capabilities on our platform to begin to see deal origination. And so our win rates are very high on the M&A side, our client base is very active. We did have quite a weak quarter in our syndicated financing business and that should be bouncing back as we go through the balance of the year. So what I like about the mix of our capital markets business is far more diversified than it was in terms of different fee streams a couple of quarters or a couple of years ago. So we're getting nice degrees of offset based on different markets being active.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. And what I would also add to that, it\u2019s Bruce, Ken is I think that what Don and his team have been able to do very effectively is marry the solution set by having our coverage officers work very closely with these enhanced product capabilities.","So when we go out and call on clients we show up with value-added ideas and we're able to win the jump ball against very significant competition out there. We do a really good job of that and start to see the traction we get records -- capital markets speaks, we get records, FX and interest rates. So coming up with good ideas on how to hedge risks is also something that I think we've got huge traction. And so very pleased to see the maturation of the model and the very strong team approach in terms of how we're covering funds.","John Woods","And I'll just add to that Ken. We're very disciplined as we add new clients around capital deployment against opportunities where we will -- where we do think there will be good cross-sell. So I think our new business process of several years now is beginning to yield flow based on where we've deployed capital and added clients on a net basis.","Operator","And our next question will come from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Just had a follow-up question on the comments in capital return. I think there was some confusion on how to treat your press when investors were putting in your financials in the Fed template. And John, I just wanted to clarify you said that capital return would likely meet expectations. I have a consensus of about $2.15 billion right now for capital return, is that the bar that you're looking to potentially meet?","John Woods","Yes, without necessarily commenting on a particular number, we have seen a range of estimates externally where I think we're broadly in line with where the market expects our buyback capacity to be. We have that flexibility. I mean the Fed template as you know we're a Category 4 firm where we're subject to the Fed template this year. We overall have a glide path that that Fed template allows us to continue to execute against and we have a dividend return expectation over time of 35% to 40%. We've talked about our expectation of getting the CET1 ratio down to about 10.2% by the end of the year.","So I think the main message is number one the Fed template allows us the flexibility to execute against what we want to do and we think that will deliver against broadly against what the market expects for buybacks in the windup.","Bruce Van Saun","And so the 10.2% projection for CET1 at year-end is still in production, so.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just a follow-up Bruce in terms of the TOP 6 program that you're looking to announce, as we think about the potential impact right now the consensus is expecting something like a 57% efficiency ratio for your company this year. That's about in line with peers should we expect that TOP 6 could bring you to a position that's better than peers, let's say in the mid-50s from a natural efficiency standpoint?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, so we have a stated medium-term objective to bring that down to 54%. And so I think a TOP 6 like program is going to be required to accomplish that. So I do think it's important particularly if the Fed is done raising rates and maybe I will hold for a while here to get less in tailwinds than we had previously. So I think we have to go back and look at what are some of the offsets that you can deliver certainly control of your expense basis. One, but doing it smartly doing it in ways that actually provide the funding capacity just so by office, so that's what we're all about. Thanks.","Ellen Taylor","Operator, can you mute that, please. Okay.","Operator","Okay, please go ahead.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, another area that we're really focused on is the growth in the fee based businesses where I think we have gotten off to a great start on the commercial side in Q1 and the outlook remains strong for the year. We got off to a little bit of a rough start on the consumer side but the outlook for Q2 is quite, quite good on the consumer side. So I'd expect to see some bounce back in mortgage and then also bounce back in wealth. So things move around there's puts and takes but I think the expense base is going to be important and then also driving that fee growth.","Operator","And our next question in queue will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning guys. A follow-up on the capital structure question, it's nice to hear that that guide pack to 10.2% is intact and your long-term target you talked about in January to get to 10% CET1, some peers are distinctly talking about much lower than that at this point. And then given the tailoring in the Category 4 that you just talked about, how do you evaluate at what point you might be able to run the company even lower than 10%. And then how do you also evaluate the choice of how you choose to get there or was it just the buyback or just leaving room for balance sheet growth? Thanks guys.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. So I'll go first, John you can chime in. But I think we're gradually bringing it down to 10% and we don't really take the decision though until we get there. And then I think we need to look at a number of considerations including where our peers, what's the regulatory and rating agency comfort with operating at a lower number including our own that's importantly comfort with being there. I think there's no reason structurally or from a business standpoint that we should maintain a ratio that's above peers, our kind of business risk profile certainly is in line with peers. In fact I think we're slightly on a prudent side. So if you look at how we model the stress scenarios we come out quite robust and even in that modeling certainly our credit losses were at a median or slightly better than the median. So I think we'll have that flexibility.","When we think about how we deploy our capital obviously if we can deploy it smartly to further organic growth that's kind of Mission one. So if we can get loan growth, if we can do some of these accretive small acquisitions that broaden our capabilities, we can get more from our relationships on the commercial side and the consumer side those are things that we're continuing to put on the list ahead of buybacks I think frankly. But again if we certainly don't want to have capital lying around. So we'll try to keep that ratio sharp and relatively in line with peers. John?","John Woods","Yes, I would just say just to emphasize the last point, I think given where we are in our lifecycle, I think the opportunities to deploy capital organically and in strategic initiatives including fee based bolt-ons that we've been doing remain into the future. So that's job one is to put that capital to work on behalf of our shareholders in an accretive way.","And then we monitor all the other sources and uses, the outlook for earnings et cetera, organic loan growth and then we take it from there. I think we also have another lever which is our capital stack is a little bit more oriented towards CET1 and some others and most peers have more preferreds outstanding than we do. So that's another lever we can look at over time that provides benefits as well. So just really solid cash strength in the capital positioning.","Bruce Van Saun","Five [ph] points to go.","John Woods","Yes.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","Ken Usdin","Yes, thanks and my sort of follow-up on that, John, you just hit on it was going to be just you did have done a couple of those preferreds to start to move the capital stack towards that more efficient place, you're only about halfway there, so is that something we should expect over time as you continue to bring CET1 down we logically see that preferred stack that went underneath it?","John Woods","Yes, I think that's logical over time. I mean we're not going to have commensurate to an exact execution day on that but I mean I think that we've done this in the right way. I mean as our ROTCE has improved over the years, it becomes much more appropriate to consider the repositioning of the capital stack such that if preferred, the cost of preferreds are attractive and they are versus ROTCE and we find a good execution point, we'll consider that. But that's a nice bit of flexibility as you heard earlier in terms of our ability to reallocate and remix our capital profile.","Operator","And our next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. ","Peter Winter","Good morning. In the prepared remarks you mentioned that net interest income was coming in a little bit lower for the full-year, is that mostly driven by less margin expansion than you originally thought?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. So it probably reaffirmed the full-year outlook. And I think whenever you start moving through the year there's going to be some modest puts and takes.","I think when you look at NII; the volume side of that equation is solid. So I think we're still looking to be solidly in the loan growth range that we set out to achieve. I think the NIM given the flatness of the curve and some of what we've experienced here early on in the year will be maybe a couple of basis points lower than what we anticipated, still positive in terms of NIM for the year-on-year. But maybe there's a little leakage there.","I say where we'll make that up is I think a more robust view on fees and a better performance on expenses. So our ability here is to protect PPNR I think is pretty solid.","And then we've had beats in the past couple of years on credit. So we'll see how that plays out. I feel pretty good right now where we sit in terms of the credit outlook. So that gives us the confidence that broadly reaffirms the outlook, Peter.","Peter Winter","Thanks Bruce. And then just on credit, I'm wondering can you make any comments on how you're thinking about CECIL?","John Woods","Yes, I will go ahead and cover that. I mean as you saw we Regional Bank, Peter had some commentary that we were engaging with regulators and the fact beyond and just more recently that has been -- that has been adjudicated to result in moving forward full steam ahead with executing on CECIL. We never really stopped our programs. We are launching data related pilots for the pipes and plumbing in the first quarter here and full dress rehearsals as you get into the second and third quarter on CECIL just from a process standpoint.","Later in the year we'll have some more views about what that will do and how that might impact the day one capital impact of adopting CECIL. But in general as you know longer dated loans will have a bigger impact than some other categories. We do think that CECIL is cyclical which is not exactly what we think is the right way to portray exposures going into downturn. And it's very sensitive to your outlook of the economy going forward. So we are on track for our internal program, we'll talk to you a little -- talk to you some more about this later in the year in terms of the impacts but we do think that our capital glide path and our ability to execute against that is not at risk as a result of CECIL.","Operator","And our next question in queue comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us clearly the direct deposit -- the Digital Deposit Program has gathered a good amount of deposits. Can you share with us, are you hoping to develop deeper relationships with those customers aside from just the savings product that they're using right now? And if so are they going to be some metrics that we can look at as outsiders to see the success of deepening those relationships?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. So let me start, it\u2019s Bruce and I will flip it over to Brad for more color. But I would have to say that this is the tremendous success this development since Citizen Access launched and I described all these goals. So what's goal today is gathering deposits in this environment, gathering new customers. We have $4.6 billion in deposits, we have over 60,000 new households that are customers in Citizens Bank and we have developed digital capabilities and the ability to use data that I think puts us in the Vanguard of our peer group and that's cold us well, so a lot of real positives coming out of this.","I think that the next day now this is up and running we certainly want to fine tune the offerings to make sure we're gathering those deposits cost effectively, while meeting customer expectations. But if you have 60,000 customers what else can you do with them. And so that's really a Phase 2 project that we kicked off. And if you think about it Gerard, we had roughly 60% of our consumer loan products today are digitally originated. So there's a possibility -- there's a potential we have a digital robot advisory service that we can also marry with ability to Skype a person right here. So there's a hybrid -- there's pure digital event, there's a hybrid person\/digital offering that also could work through that channel. So there's some really interesting things to think about but I think it's going to take us a while to actually bring that to market.","With that, I will flip it over to Brad.","Brad Conner","Yes, Bruce, I think you've covered it really well. There are some immediate things we're doing to enhance the platform including the fact that we're adding trust accounts which we launched with our trust account. But we see tremendous opportunity, it's a perfect client base for us, it hits right in our target customer segment of mass affluent and affluent customers.","Digitally savvy as you mentioned we built Specify which is one of the first digital advisory capabilities in the market. We think that's a perfect complement to this customer base and then several lending opportunities and lending products that we're working on all of those and what are the next steps for continuing to enhance the relationships.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then pivoting to the loan growth which again was strong for the quarter as you guys pointed out and I think you guys highlighted that in the commercial real estate area, you saw some growth in the office and multi-family. Can you give us some color on the geography, where are you guys seeing the best growth geographically in your footprint and outside the footprint?","John Woods","I think it's our real estate business is national and it's really, I'd say it moves quarter-to-quarter. So I'll give you two examples of expansion. We actually move people into Texas and people into Los Angeles where we have seen growth over the past few quarters. So that's both be active on the existing book of business but also do some origination. But it's really across the Southeast and in growth areas of the country where we're seeing the highest levels of growth.","I say our real estate business in general, the growth will slow down over the balance of the year and that's strategic because we're focusing on the better end of the opportunity set that we see. So we have to originate a fair amount just to replace what's on our books already. But I think you should expect to see our real estate growth on a gross basis be a little slower than it's been in the past from a strategic standpoint.","Bruce Van Saun","And I would also say there's still attractive opportunities in the footprint in Boston and the Seaport District for example. So it's a combination of things that are in the traditional footprints some these growth markets that Don mentioned. And when it comes to office, we typically focus on owner occupied, so there's a low risk type of project that we're financing.","John Woods","And what's flat lining is really multifamily and anything retail. We're really not growing those with any kind of significance.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question here will come from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks for taking the questions. Got kind of a rapid fire here of about three or four questions, your mortgage hedging this quarter was a negative, was that just unusual, some basis risk in there or were you just not had it hedged or as a percent of the portfolio or you make any adjustments. So is this going to be unusual or should this be something we expect as rates go up and down have positives and negatives?","John Woods","Yes, Marlin, I will take that. This is John. So I mean I think that you're going to have, when you have an asset of this size that is $600 million, $700 million depending upon if we have a split between fair value and low comp but large assets, it's a complex asset to hedge and you're going to have some variability from quarter-to-quarter. Last quarter we had a $2 million net positive MSR valuation net of hedge. This quarter we had $2 million negative MSR valuation net of hedge. So quarter-over-quarter that's $4 million.","There were other rate impacts as well. When you look at outside of just the straight hedging piece you also have to estimate what's your amortization is just in the mean servicing P&L and we had an increase of $7 million from $25 million to $30 million -- $32 million in amortization that was largely rate related as well. So all-in and quarter-over-quarter you got $11 million of largely rate driven MSR related valuation impacts. So hopefully that gives you some context.","Marty Mosby","It helps and I really appreciate your guidance. So this is kind of a statement as well as a question. We talked about the front book versus the back book. That's really what we've been trying to outline for investors is the fact that you have this historical spread between what's still in the market even though rates have come down versus what's on the books just because rates were so low for so long. And then over time that's kind of a grind up as you kind of just see that coming through. And in relation to that, you mentioned some balance sheet flexibility. I just didn't know if that was liquidity wise because your loan to deposit ratio would come down or there was some other flexibility that you were talking about there?","John Woods","Yes, I think that we have some flexibility primarily due to the fact that we've had a really strong deposit quarter after several prior quarters that were strong. But our first quarter was particularly strong and that led the LDRs come down to around 95%. I mean that provides some flexibility. We have -- we've demonstrated the ability to grow deposits at least as quickly as we grow loans.","When you think about, as a good example, when you think about the big impact that growth has on the increase in interest bearing deposit costs as were 16 basis points in the quarter approximately half of that was driven by just deposit growth. So if you get ahead of things a little bit, then and you can fund your growth without necessarily having to grow a lot in future quarters. That has a beneficial impact and underpinning of net interest margin going forward.","Bruce Van Saun","The other thing, so John is describing the flexibility on the deposit side that we have. I think we had some nice flexibility on the asset side as well. So we've been well positioned to have an origination engine both on the commercial side and the consumer side that is pretty robust that gives us the wherewithal to then look into the back book and make asset sales and we made approximately $300 million of sales in the first quarter. And so we can look to do that as we go through the year and still report net loan growth. So that's all part of BSA -- BSR it's working for us on the deposit side but it's also working for us on the assets side.","Marty Mosby","And then just two bigger picture questions. You've been the easiest bank to kind of estimate what's going to be market consensus every quarter. Just wanted to get you to kind of think about, why and this may be a highlight for us because you all do ask for models every quarter. So I know you're tracking, what are buyers putting out there but what are the earnings surprises that people just start catching up to. And then Bruce I just wanted you to give us a little bit of a thought given some of the other transformational let's call mergers or placements of banks in the country. How does Citizens fit into this competitive landscape? I mean how do you see the bank being able to evolve over the last five years really talking about how you're competing a lot with everybody around you but just wanted to kind of get your thought on how you fit in there?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, sure. So with respect to the consistent track record of being able to beat pretty much every quarter that we've been a public company, I just think it's a reflection of our very strong focus on execution and we're all I think very aligned on where we're trying to take the banks and what the key drivers of a successful turnaround were and what the next phase is going to require to become a Top performing bank. So I think we've got great people, great leadership team, and we've good alignment through the organization that people know of what's expected of them. They're empowered and then we hold them accountable and they're doing a great job. So hats off to our colleagues here at Citizens.","With respect to where we fit into the landscape, I do think we have really come a long way from where we started. So foreign ownership foreign parent had a bunch of difficulties and left us with a strong potential franchise but had accumulated some baggage, some lack of investment in key areas like technology, our people program, and our risk capabilities, build business model wasn't fully built out to really serve customers on an integrated way both on the commercial side and the consumer side.","Balance sheet had shrunk to a position where our profitability was really emasculated. So we had a lot of work to do and I think we've now certainly made our way back into the pack and in many cases I feel that we're doing better than our results indicate and certainly better than our stock price would indicate. But I'll leave that for another day.","But certainly on the commercial side, I'm so pleased that Don and his folks have put together the level of talent that we have, people who worked in big banks, who are covering the middle market and the big corporate clients so well and then we can go out and we can lead deals we could have money center banks on the right of us. We can go out and compete for an interest rate hedge and win it against money center banks which we did several times in the first quarter. We've got really, really good talent and we're well positioned.","And then on the consumer side, some of the things that Brad talked about Citizens Access and our fintech partnerships and thinking about end-to-end customer experiences and the customer satisfaction is moving up nicely. I think we're doing a really good job there too.","So I think we have a strategy and a capability to continue to drive this company forward and become a great bank. But I certainly would have to say as you look around the landscape and people are making scale arguments. You always keep an open mind about those things, if there's opportunities to benefit our shareholders, we have an open mind towards that but I think the more important news is that we're well positioned to continue on the path that we're onto it.","Operator","And it does conclude the questions for today.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. It was great. I know it\u2019s a busy morning for you all; you probably have to hop to the next call. But certainly appreciate that you dialed in today and we appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. Thanks for participation. You may now disconnect."],"5527":["Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2018  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Ellen Taylor - IR","Bruce Van Saun - Chairman and CEO","John Woods - CFO","Brad Conner - Head of Consumer Banking","Donald McCree - Head of Commercial Banking","Analysts","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Peter Winter - Wedbush Securities","Saul Martinez - UBS","Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods","Kenneth Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill Partners","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Lana Chan - BMO Capital Markets","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","John Pancari - Evercore","Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray","Operator","Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference call. My name is Brad, and I\u2019ll be your operator on the call today. Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks so much, Brad, and hello everyone. We really appreciate you joining us today. We\u2019re going to start things off with prepared remarks from our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, he will review our third quarter results, and then we're going to open up the call for questions. We\u2019re also really happy to have in the room with us today Brad Conner, who's Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking.","In addition to our release, we have a presentation and financial supplement available at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course I need to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are absolutely subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ from expectations in our SEC filings, including the 8-K we filed today. We also need to remind you that we utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and our material.","And with that, I'm going to give it over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay thanks, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to report another very strong quarter today, paced by strong top line growth of 7% excluding FAMC, Franklin and good expense discipline which combines for positive operating leverage of 4.4% year on year. And we continue to achieve good balance sheet growth in the current environment with sequential loan growth excluding FAMC of 1% and year over year growth of 4%. That's a very good result considering we're still running off non-core assets and reducing our auto and leasing portfolios.","We've focused on some great niches, on the consumer side, and we've invested in broader coverage on the commercial side to achieve this growth. Our strong execution to-date in 2018 has led to some very nice improvement in key metrics. EPS growth year on year is 37% underlying and 34% on a year to date basis. Our ROTCE reached 13.5% underlying which is into our target range of 13 to 15% and the efficiency ratio was 58% underlying. We are confident in our Q4 outlook and we expect to finish the year strong.","Our capital strength continues to be a real advantage as we have the capacity to grow our balance sheet and drive organic growth to make small smart key based acquisitions and to return significant capital to our shareholders which we did and exceeded 500 million in the current quarter. We've had a couple of great slides in the deck today covering our progress against our strategic initiatives and some of the recognitions we've been garnering.","I've just crossed my five year mark at Citizens and I feel really good about how we've been able to turn around the bank and shift from defense to offense. We now have a clear view of what it will take to be successful longer term and become a fast performing bank, and we're making significant investments to position us well for the future. That said, we understand the need to deliver consistently strong and improving results each quarter, and I feel our team has done a great job of getting that balance right.","So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods, to take you through the numbers in more detail and provide you with some color, John.","John Woods","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. We delivered another strong quarter that highlights steady execution against their enterprise level initiatives with particular focus on robust positive operating leverage. We continued our momentum in delivering cost efficiencies while making the long-term investments required for sustainable success.","Some quick highlights, we grew our underlying EPS 37% year on year. We delivered operating leverage of 4.4% excluding the impact of the Franklin American Mortgage acquisition, which closed on August 1. We continue to make progress on improving returns with underlying ROTCE for the quarter of 13.5%, up nearly 60 basis points linked quarter and 340 basis points year-over-year.","Our consumer and commercial banking segments are delivering improved returns by driving prudent balance sheet growth and controlling our deposit costs in a very competitive environment, across both business segments we are growing our customer base, deepening relationships, running our capabilities and investing in new technologies to enhance the customer experience. I'll expand on our strategic initiatives a little later.","On Slide 3, we provide information on the Franklin American acquisition and related integration costs, and in order to make it easier to see underlying trends, we show you our results without the integration costs and provide further color on our result, excluding Franklin on Slide 4 and 5. As I mentioned, you can see that we delivered positive operating leverage of 4.4% excluding the impact of Franklin with an efficiency ratio of 57%. Also, PPNR growth year-over-year was 13% excluding Franklin.","On Page 6, net interest margin results came in as expected with a two basis points increase excluding the impact of Franklin even though average LIBOR rose less than anticipated. We are pleased that despite a fairly competitive landscape, we continue to drive disciplined balance sheet growth and delivered a 2% sequential quarter increase in net interest income.","Turning to fees on Slide 7, you can see a $28 million improvement driven by mortgage banking fees given the addition of Franklin. Excluding net impact, fees were up 1% linked quarter and up about 3% year-over-year. Our capital market fees were relative flat sequentially this quarter, notwithstanding some pretty significant headwinds in the space.","Overall loan syndications market volume was down approximately 40%, but we were down less than the market in the space and offset to syndication volume with bond underwriting where we continue to gain traction and M&A advisory fees given our ability to leverage the Western Reserve Partners acquisition.","In global markets where we continue to build out our offerings, fees were down slightly from record second quarter levels, reflecting a $3 million adjustment related to CDA methodology change. Interest rate product fees were down 4% due to a decline in variable rate loan demand and the impact of the flattening yield curve.","In FX, we held our ground by being proactive with clients against the backdrop of increased dollar volatility and looming trade policy concerns. On the consumer side of the house, we saw good traction on our wealth business with increased sales volumes and a 5% linked quarter increased in managed money revenues and 23% growth year-over-year. And in our mortgage business, we've hit the ground running with the integration of Franklin.","We are very excited about the scale that business brings us in servicing and the opportunity to serve over 200,000 new customers. The integration is on track and while the current environment is challenging, we continue to believe this is an attractive and important customer business for us to be in over the long-term.","Turning to Slide 8. On our reported basis, our expenses were driven up by the impact of Franklin and about $9 million of integration cost largely in salaries and benefits outside services and other expense. Excluding Franklin, we are pleased to report that linked quarter expenses were flat given continued strong expense discipline and benefits from our top program. Let me elaborate a bit on that.","Our commitment to self funding investments continues to drive our ability to ensure our expenses remain well controlled, this is a direct result of all of the work we\u2019ve done over the past two years with our top programs. The efficiency and revenue benefits from those programs have a compounding effect that has funded our growth initiatives allowing us to expand our capabilities across the bank and facilitate various business initiatives such as Citizens Access and many others.","Let\u2019s move on to discuss the balance sheet. On Slide 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. Despite slower growth across the industry, we continue to see strength in certain segments and commercial. This was against the backdrop of heightened non-bank competition and very liquid corporate balance sheets given the benefits of tax reform and repatriation. And while we are very selective about CRE, we are still finding some attractive opportunities for growth.","On the retail side, we saw nice tractions in some of our attractive risk adjusted return categories like education and secured as well as important categories like mortgage. Overall, we grew loans by 1% linked quarter. As a reminder, we sold corporate loans late in the second quarter which had about 25 basis points impact on third quarter growth. Loans grew by 4% year-over-year, notwithstanding headwinds from the planned runoff in auto, non-core and leasing which was around $1.6 billion year-over-year, which impacted the growth rate by about 1.5%. The gross of our planned runoff, our loans were up 5.5% year-over-year.","Loan yields improved by 12 basis points in the third quarter, which was lower than what we saw in the second quarter, this reflects the backdrop of the lower increase in average LIBOR over the same period which had a corresponding benefit to our overall funding costs. Also we continue to results from our balance sheet optimization efforts and remain well-positioned to benefit in a rising rate environment. I'm pleased with what we are able to accomplish in deposits this quarter.","As you can see on Slide 10, we continue to do a nice job of growing deposits, which were up 2% linked quarter and 4% year-over-year. And in particular, we continue to gain traction on DDA balances, which were up over 1% linked quarter and 4% year-on-year excluding the escrow balances contributed by Franklin.","Our total deposit costs were well-controlled, up 10 basis points compared with 11 basis point increase in the prior quarter. Interest-bearing deposit cost rose at a slower pace this quarter as well, increasing 14 basis points compared with a 15 basis point increase in the second quarter.","For the most part deposit costs have been relatively well-behaved, despite increased deposit competition we are seeing in the industry overall. Our cumulative data on interest-bearing deposits is in the low 30s as expected and remains in line with our overall expectations given where we are in the rate cycle. And given the actions we are taking, we expect cumulative betas to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter.","We continue to be optimistic on the trend of deposit costs. We are benefiting from investments that began back in 2016 in areas like increasing our brand marketing spend to closer to peer levels and in analytics to improve our targeting through digital and direct mail offerings on the consumer side.","In commercial, we are making investments to build out additional product capabilities like escrow services and are rolling out our new cash management platform early next year. Also in July we launched Citizens Access, which contributes to our funding diversification and optimization of deposit levels and costs, through the end of the quarter we raised about 1 billion dollars, and we expect to hit about 2 billion of deposits by the end of the year.","While this is a relatively modest part of our overall deposit strategy. We're very pleased with the progress so far. About 97% of these deposits are from new customers and the average account size is about $70,000. We are right on target with the type of affluent customer, we are looking for. Year-over-year our, asset yields expanded 47 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and the impact of our BSO initiatives.","Our total cost of funds was up 35 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher rates and a continued shift to greater long-term funding. This included the impact of the 750 million senior debt issuance late in the first quarter of 2018. Our borrowing costs were positively impacted by the slowing pace of LIBOR this quarter. We also benefited from the mix shift this quarter as we redeemed higher cost sub debt at the end of June and replaced it with lower cost filled advances.","Next, let's move to Slide 11 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be strong, reflecting the continued mix shift towards higher quality lower risk retail loans and a relatively stable risk profile in our commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio improved to 73 basis points of loans this quarter down from 85 basis points a year ago. The net charge-off rate of 30 basis points for the third quarter was relatively stable linked quarter and up modestly year-over-year from relatively low levels.","Retail net charge-offs were up modestly, reflecting seasoning in the portfolio which is very much in line with our expectations and performing in line with the model loss curves. Commercial net charge offs for the third quarter were relatively stable versus last quarter and up from the prior year which benefited from higher recoveries. Overall, we feel good about the credit metrics and trends in the book including a meaningful drop in criticized asset levels reflective of continued favorable credit quality.","Provision for credit losses of $78 million declined from the second quarter with particular improvement in the real estate secured portfolios. Our allowance to loans coverage ratio remain relatively stable and in the quarter at 1.08%. And as we increase the mix of higher quality retail portfolios in our overall loan book, the NPL coverage ratio improved to a 149% as we saw continued improvement in NPLs and run-off in the non-core portfolio.","On Slide 12, we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity position ending the quarter with the set-one ratio of 10.8% which came down from 11.2% in the second quarter with approximately 18 basis points of impact from the Franklin acquisition. Also this quarter, we repurchased $400 million common stock and returned a total of $529 million to shareholders including dividend.","Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.27 a share and we have the ability through CCAR to increase the quarterly dividend another 19% to 0.32 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2019, subject to our board's approval. Our plan glide path to reduce our set-one ratio remains on track and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive improving financial performance and attractive returns to shareholders.","Third quarter achievements against our enterprise initiatives are highlighted on Slide 13. I\u2019ll point out that we are making traction on our balance sheet optimization effort as we recycle capital out of lower return categories like auto and leasing. With the core yield have improved and portfolios have decreased by more than 7% and redeploy it against higher return categories like our education refi and merchant finance portfolios as well as in higher return relationships in commercial.","Additionally, we continue to deliver beyond expectations in our top programs where we now expect top four to be at the higher end of our range and deliver $105 million to $110 million in benefit. As we work on running the bank better, we\u2019ve launched the next phase of process reengineering opportunities with the focus on consumer operations, mortgage and project delivery. As we\u2019ve seen some real benefits from the work so far, for example, in consumer banking our efforts to improve new relationship experience for deposit account opening have reduced new to bank customer attrition increased the net promoter score by 10 points and increased mobile enrollments by more than 30%.","And for our commercial clients, we\u2019ve implemented our concierge service model which has significantly increased the speed with which we address client requests. We are also leveraging enhanced data analytics and transformative technology such as AVIs, robotics and cloud to improve the customer experience and work more efficiently. We have been able to use robotics and process reengineering to improve cycle times for key clients processes. For example, we\u2019ve reduced on boarding times for new cash management clients by 60% since the first quarter this year.","On Slide 14, we highlighted some of the longer-term investments we are funding in order to precision us for sustainable success. Bottom line, we have been able to successfully lean forward with our longer-term strategy while also executing well and delivering strong results in the near-term.","On Slide 15, you can see the steady and impressive progress we are making against our financial targets. This quarter we hit the lower end of our 13% to 15% medium-term ROTCE target. Since 3Q '13, our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 13.5% underlying, and our efficiency ratio has improved by 11 percentage points from 68% to 57% excluding the impact of Franklin. And EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well up to $0.93 on an underlying basis from $0.26.","Our outlook for the fourth quarter is on Slide 16 and it reflects continued momentum in both our top and bottom line results. We expect to produce linked quarter average loan growth of around 1% to 1.25%, given strong commercial lending pipelines and solid growth in education and retail unsecured particularly with a strong showing in third quarter Apple iPhone upgrade loans. We also expect net interest margin to expand by approximately 3 to 4 basis points linked quarter reflecting the ongoing impact of our BSO activities, particularly our deposit initiatives and the benefit of rising rates.","In non-interest income, we're expecting to see growth around 5% to 7%, with a strong quarter for capital markets, given strong pipelines and some seasonality. Also, we will see an additional lift from the full quarter impact of Franklin. Excluding Franklin, core growth is expected to be about 2% to 4% linked quarter. We expect noninterest expense to be up around 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter also including a full quarter impact from Franklin. Excluding Franklin and notable items expense growth is expected to be around 1% to 2% with positive leverage and further efficiency ratio improvement.","Additionally, we expect provision expense to be in the range of 85 million to 95 million. And finally, we expect to manage our step one ratio to end the year around 10.8% and we expect the average LDR to be around 98%. In addition, we are anticipating a tax gain as we finalize the impact of tax reform, which is expected to be largely offset by costs associated with top five.","To sum up on Slide 17, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our continuing strong performance as we execute against our strategic initiatives and continue to improve how we run the bank to drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We are very pleased to have closed the Franklin acquisition and successfully launched Citizens Access this quarter. Our outlook remains positive as we continue to work to become a top-performing regional bank.","Let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks, John. And Brad, why don\u2019t we open it up for some questions from our viewers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question, here is going to come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","I was wondering if you could about the prospects to accelerate the share buybacks just given how weak your stock has been and obviously the earnings and capital levels are quite strong.","John Woods","I will go ahead and start off with that Matt. I mean I think, I think we done a nice job this quarter of returning capital to shareholders. As you saw in our remarks, we have returned $529 million, 400 million of that coming from repurchases. And we like the opportunity to return capital to shareholders over time as we talked about. We have a glide path that we are pursuing that allows us to balance, not just the return of capital, but also deploying that capital into growth opportunities. We still see nice opportunities for growth and we will continue to monitor that over time and react accordingly in terms of how that glide path plays itself out.","Bruce Van Saun","I guess within the parameters that we set, Matt, in CCAR, we did have more weighted earlier in the fourth quarter period, and obviously on this, we're taking in more stock. So, we can\u2019t exactly market time. But as you said, stocks that kind of astonishing valuations at this point. So we'll take advantage of that.","Matt O'Connor","And then just separately, if you look at the revenue growth, not just this quarter but year-to-date, among the highest in the industry, and obviously, hopefully, that's sustainable. But if it's not, do you have leverage to cut costs? You can continue to meet your targets, obviously, you got the top initiatives and even focused on the operating leverage, but frankly you haven't needed to maybe manage the cost as much because of revenues been so strong. But if it does, slow you have the flexibility to meaningfully bring down the expense growth.","John Woods","Well, Matt, I think we've had a very consistent model here to deliver that top line growth. And so, we've got very strong capital position, we\u2019re growing loans prudently with that by finding niches in consumer and by our expanding our coverage for us, and overall size of our business in commercial, and I think there is still room to go with that. So, if you start with roughly 70% of your revenue is net interest income and you can grow your loans, we been able to grow roughly 5%. But a nice level of loan growth and an asset sensitive balance sheet with in a rising rate environment plus our DSO initiative means that\u2019s the formula to get very strong kick up in revenues.","Then combine that with the investments we've been making in our fee based businesses and deepening relationship with our customers, we should be able to keep growing feeds. I think and certainly in this single-digit level ex acquisitions. So, I\u2019m still optimistic that the formula that's worked will continue to work. And if you look last year, we had 10% revenue growth, which was top in our peer group. I think my memory serves me against 3% expense growth with 7% positive operating leverage. We\u2019re probably now in a 7% or 8% top line growth, keeping expenses down around 3%. So we\u2019re 4.5% operating leverage on an underlying basis.","And I think the good news on, if you can achieve that revenue growth, you can continue to fund the investments for the future that we've made and keep your expense growth in check. So, one thing I would point out that I think differentiates us versus peers, is the consistency of the top programs that relentless focus on improving end-to-end processes and customers experiences while extracting costs that frees up dollars, so that we can hire more customer facing people, invest in the fee business, invest in great technology.","We were first to market in our peer group with online mobile advising with our specified product first to roll out to national digital bank. So, I think we\u2019re doing a great job and having a top line growth allows us the flexibility to make those investments and still deliver the positive operating leverage and still drive our ROTCE higher.","Operator","And our next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","I'm just wondering if I look out, are you seeing any let up on pay down activities or borrowers getting near the end of tapping some of this excess liquidity for growth that could lead to better loan demand next year?","Bruce Van Saun","John, you want to take that.","John Woods","Yes, I'd say, there is not a perceived trend where we've seen it is a little bit of drop in utilization. So, we pretty consistently strong new business pipeline across the board, all year long, and we continue to see that as we look into the fourth quarter and into next year and that\u2019s both lending in our fee business. That's is going to offset a little bit by what Bruce mentioned, which is a little bit more selectivity on our part, we see terms and conditions overstretched and a little bit lower utilization. So, I think that the utilization trend, we don\u2019t see it changing right now and are seeing a particular change in sentiment among borrowers, but we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity across the board. So, we continue to be optimistic around growing our business.","Peter Winter","And then the loan to deposit ratio, it's 98% I guess it's supposed to be stable in the fourth quarter. Do you think that ratio could move lower next year with some of these deposit strategies that you have?","John Woods","Yes, I will go ahead and take that. I mean I think the idea here is that we want to have deposits fund our loan growth, and the outlook that we have now is for deposit to grow at least as fast as we grow loans. And so, we've seen great frankly take up in our deposit growth, and I should add that a big part of that deposit growth comes in the DDA space, which we\u2019re really pleased to be able to -- to be able to continue to do that here throughout 2018, consistently growing that. And in terms of where the LDR goes, I mean I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable in that upper 90 range call it 97, 98, 99. And we've had a demonstrated ability to manage to that and feel like that's likely to be durable into the future.","Operator","And our next question will come from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","First question and I know you spent some time on the strategic initiatives. So forgive me, if this is a little bit repetitive. But where do you think you are just more broadly on the balance sheet optimization efforts? And maybe to use a baseball analogy with the Red Sox going to the World Series, what inning are you in? And where do you see the most opportunity still? Is it still in education lending? Can you just walk us through the various initiatives to optimize the left and right side of the balance sheet, and kind of how much further you can go there?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure, it's Bruce. I will start and flip it over to John. But if I have to put it into baseball terms, I would say we\u2019re still maybe only in the middle innings, fourth inning or so. If you go back 3 to 4 years ago, we were doing this on an informal basis. So it was really kind of myself, CFO, Treasurer working with the Vice Chairman, trying to figure out which way we needed to tilt capturing deposits, regaining our deposit market share after -- under our, yes, the balance sheet had shrunk and we needed to reflate the balance sheet, that was pretty easy pickings. And so, commercial really was going out doing the heavy lifting getting the deposits back on the balance sheet.","But as times moved by, we thought the success we've had with top, we could try to replicate and put in place a more formal PSO program where we would have specific initiatives on the left side of balance sheet and the right side of balance sheet with actions that would be monitored ownership, et cetera, same kind of structure that we have running top. And so, I think we're making traction on the asset side. We are running down certain portfolios. So, you can see auto is running down, leasing running down, those are not credit concerns. Those are simply not a good use of capital. We\u2019re not making the returns that we would like there.","And then you saw us make a loan sale in the second quarter out of corporate, and so I think we got to be very disciplined, if we\u2019re not getting deeper relations and cross sell than we have to exit credits, and we can do some of that naturally but we can also punch some and sell them. So those have been kind of minuses and then growth is really focused on consumer trying to find attractive niches, education refinance we\u2019re one of the pioneers of that market it is still a very attractive market. The upgrade program we have with Apple and merchant financing at point of sale as another very attractive area we have another relationship and another one coming soon. And so, we're excited about that, so we will continue to push into areas where we see opportunities.","On a commercial side, I think we build out our industry verticals, so we can go up market a bit into the mid corporate space. Those tend to be full relationships where we can get a good share of wallet. So, we\u2019re seeing some nice traction there. In commercial real estate, we really have become very under scale, in RBS, under RBS ownership because they were running off commercial real estate exposures globally. So, we really just been regaining our market share and again, being very, very selective about where we\u2019re playing. In fact, I should point out we have a sell of these from work out is running commercial real estate. And with Don and his acumen, I feel really good about what we\u2019re doing in commercial real estate.","On the right side of the balance sheet again, we wanted to have more tools in the tool kit. So, we launched Citizens Access, which is off to a fantastic start. It's exceeding all of our metrics that we set out at this point, so very pleased with that. We have noticed that in commercial, we're not always playing with a full toolset there as well. So, we're investing in having full escrow capabilities. The bankruptcy capabilities, there is a new cash management platform we're rolling out, so we want to gain a bigger share of natural deposit relationships, which should come with less pricing pressure.","So, those are a few other things, I feel there's still and one of the great thing about Citizens is we've been a self-help story. And if something is not great that's a good thing because that means we can fix it and continued to propel our earnings higher. Let me go around the horn here and see if anybody wants to add to that. It was a longwinded answer, so I don\u2019t want to take the whole call out of it. John, next","John Woods","I will just add just a high level point or two, if that was well covered. And I think I would highlight the fact that, year-over-year net interest margin is up 15 basis points and 5 basis points of that comes from BSO. And so even without rates, we remain self-help on the net interest margin space, and that's good. And I think we got a lot of room to run. We\u2019re still about call it 10 or 15 basis points short of peers in terms of net interest margin, and one of the places that manifests itself is in non-interest-bearing deposits where about 25% of our deposits are in non-interest-bearing space.","We continue to grow that space because we\u2019re making up ground that since the IPO and even you could see that getting overtime, north of 30 that's really our target is to get north of 30. And all of the initiatives that we have in place in the consumer side and commercial side, which we won't go into in too much detail, but investing in data and analytics, increasing our markets spend back to peer levels, our product offerings in commercial, replatforming the cash management business will all support that engine of net interest margin growth overtime.","Bruce Van Saun","Just let Brad.","Brad Conner","Yes, I was just going to add one other things and it really ties in what you guys would say. One of the positive stories for us has been our ability to grow DDA in lower and no cost deposits. And part of the reason for that goes back to Bruce, what you are saying is, we were underway. We have a very attractive -- we\u2019re not getting our fair share from our own customer base. So, we have a very attractive affluent customer base and we weren't getting our fair share of the low cost deposits. And I think with all the initiatives we have around, rebuilding the value proposition for our affluent customers and then the investment we\u2019re making in segmentation and targeting that gives me a lot of confidence. We can continue to grow. We can outpace the growth of those low cost deposits.","Saul Martinez","That's Great. If I could follow up on regulations, we should get proposals on S.2155. I would think fairly soon, and if we do move to a more of a potential standards that are based on complexity versus risk. Does that change at all? How do you manage capital and liquidity? Specifically on capital, could it help trigger at least a rethink of 1025 CET1 target potentially going lower?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, look, I think we have always said that our risk profile is certainly no worse than median. In fact, we think it's slightly better than median. So, there's no reason over time for us to carry capital surplus versus the peer median. So, most peers are professing that they are going to move down, but they think, they have plenty of capital to safely run the bank. And so, we will calibrate off of that, so if the peer median moves down, we will move our goal post down.","But I think the nice thing of the rethink on the bracket we\u2019re in under 250 is that it would just increase flexibility around decisioning. So just like Matt said earlier, in one of the first questions on the call today now that the stock price of regional banks and ours in particular washed out would you maybe want to buy more stock, you have to go through a process today, the way CCAR works that you probably gain some new flexibility based on the rethink that\u2019s taking place. Anything, John?","John Woods","Yes, I think that's exactly right. I think flexibility on the capital side increases, I would say that occurs either with us as 155 or with the SEB. Both of those things are either financially would allow for that flexibility and would allow us to balance RWA deployment against capital return much more effectively. On the liquidity side, we got less of an impact. I mean we tend to run ourselves in a conservative way in terms of our internal models with respect to that. And so from that standpoint, I think capital is going to be the bigger impact versus liquidity.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brian Klock I believe its Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","A bigger picture question I guess first for you Bruce. The progression and profitability and expansion profitability in the best in the group, and anything about your bottom lower end of your 13% to 15% ROTC guidance range. I guess, is there a thought process maybe enter into this yearend planning process and for next year that, would that be an opportunity to think about updating? And how do you think about maybe moving that up since you guys have executed pretty well here?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. So, look we\u2019re quite pleased that we\u2019ve run ahead of pace to get into that 13% to 15%, we\u2019re certainly ahead of the budget for the year and I think coming into the year consensus has been taken up about 10%. So, again reflects very good performance throughout the year. We typically look at all of the metrics and the targets at yearend when we put our budgets to bed, and then on the January call we\u2019ll give you detailed guidance for '19. And then potentially look at whether we want to refresh those medium targets.","I think the thing that everybody is aware of is that, as you get farther into this expansion, at some point you\u2019ll have credit costs rise and start to normalize, which would create some headwinds against PPNR. But at this point, we feel good I mean we feel good about the economic outlook for 2019. We don\u2019t think any recession is around the corner. I feel good personally through 2020. At this point, we don\u2019t see the build ups and accesses that you would start seeing, if you were getting closer to a recession. So, I think we\u2019ll take all that into account when we consider whether we\u2019re going to move to 13% to 15% higher.","Brian Klock","And maybe to follow up on some questions and discussions on the NIM earlier, and John, I just wanted to get double check that. The NIM expansion, the guidance for the fourth quarter, so they would include obviously the impact of the good growth from Citizens Access, which that has come in at a higher deposit beta and even the impact of the FHLB advances. Was that sure the $2 billion of long-term borrowings increased on a spot-to-spot basis so that from FHLB advances in that increase?","John Woods","Yes, I think that what you\u2019re seeing there, maybe just I\u2019ll take the deposit part of this first in the context and then I\u2019ll cover borrowings. But that does include in the fourth quarter, the impact of Citizens Access going from $1 billion to $2 billion. Really what that does is, it basically balances and optimizes our promotional activities across the whole platform. So as we\u2019re profitably supporting the loan growth in the fourth quarter, we can do that in a much more efficient way with the combination of our input print activities connected with Citizens Access trajectory. So that\u2019s all included and is beneficial to the NIM in the fourth quarter.","As it relates to borrowings, yes, I mean borrowings are up on a spot basis. On an average basis they\u2019re pretty flat over the last couple of quarters going into the third quarter. You may be seeing an increase in spot that occur just in terms of natural variability that you\u2019re seeing in the commercial deposit flows. And so at the end of the quarter, you have some deposits what was that they come back in and that\u2019s really you\u2019re seeing not really a signal that is headed north in the significant way.","Brian Klock","And then I can just squeeze one more in. One of the things that you guys have done this quarter, which you\u2019ve kind of bucked the trend for the industry this quarter and for the full year, for that matter is have DDA growth. And I know you mentioned even excluding the First American Mortgage escrow deposit that\u2019s up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So maybe just kind of highlight the fact that to me it sounds like that\u2019s growth in customer accounts, and I think Brad you commented on that to, but it does seem like to me that commercial customer accounts that you\u2019re growing. So maybe can you just talk about how you guys are executing better than the rest of the industry is on DDA growth?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I will start with that and it's really a combination of deepening with our existing customers and new household growth. So, we've got good strong household growth. And part of that is the investment we made in data and analytics which allows us to spend more on marketing to acquire customers, and then I mentioned this in my comments earlier.","We've long had a very attractive household base at Citizens very steeped in affluent customers, and we really haven't got our fair share over time of their low cost, their DDA deposits. And a lot of work we've done in the last year or two is really very hard on the value proposition we launched and we platinum values, lot of segmentation work around building the right value proposition, and that has allowed us to grow our DDA balances with our existing customer base.","The last point I'll make and then turn it over to Don is just to that point of household growth. I do want to make a point that\u2019s been very, very high quality household growth. So our primary household relationship our mobile active metrics are some of the best we've ever had, so it's not only good household growth but its primary and active households.","Donald McCree","On our side, I will just add, Bruce mentioned the investments we\u2019re making in our cash management business and that goes really from the product level all the way through to the service level and it's allowing us to add business on our credit services platform. And that should accelerate as we roll out the new platform in 2019.","Operator","Your next question here will come from Kenneth Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zerbe","With Citizens Access, obviously, you're up to a really good start. I know you\u2019re targeting the 2 billion by year end. But I guess the question is, how do you stop that growth because I just went online, I saw you\u2019re offering 212 on savings accounts. Like, how do you get people to not continue to go into that product?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I will start and, Brad, you can chirp right on it. But it\u2019s a very elastic market with respect to pricing, so you can turn the dial up or down based on where you are kind of in the forced ranking of those offering. So that's one thing Ken, if you wanted less deposits from that channel, you could just drop your pricing and it will kind go to the level that you want. So that's one thing. But what I would say more broadly than just competing on rate, I think one of the reasons we've been so successful is that we really, really focused on delivering a great customer experience which we try to do everything, but I think we really nailed it here.","Then you can you can go online Ken, we will happy to have you as a customer, but you could -- after this call, you could get on our website open and fund an account in under five minutes. That's basically proven. So it's really a great, easy to use experience and ability to get reporting on what you got and some nifty stuff. The other thing that I think we done exceptionally well is I think we have really regional peer leading data capabilities. And so, we put back to work to target households and keep our overall account acquisition costs quite well. And so that's part of the equation as well.","So, it's really your functionality where you are on the pricing ladder. And then your account acquisition your data capabilities that determine your success factor, and I think on all those dimensions, we've pegged it almost perfectly.","Brad Conner","Yes. Bruce, I agree with all that. And then one of the points that I would make is, if the question is sort of around this concept of cannibalization and you just going to continue to encourage your own customers to take that the higher cost offers, the answer is. We\u2019re getting 75% of our customers out of footprint, so this has given us a national capability. So 75% of customers are coming in our out of footprint and only 3% are coming from our own customer base. So, this is a whole new customer segment that we\u2019re attracting that we weren't reaching because they\u2019re not traditional branch users.","Kenneth Zerbe","Got it.","Bruce Van Saun","I think it also gives us just more confidence around. It's almost a petri dish to improve our digital and data capabilities which is only going to help us in the long run with our core franchise as well.","Kenneth Zerbe","And I understand you can drop the rate on. I guess that presumably implies that your customers are pretty much hot money customers and you're going to lose the customer so they are, I mean is the right way to think about this customer base more or like on a wholesale borrowings to some extend like you\u2019re\u2026","Bruce Van Saun","Not at all.","John Woods","Let me jump in. It\u2019s John. I mean I think just throwing some numbers out there, just to give you a sense of where we are. So, after the last rate hike we did, we lagged our rate rise, and so it\u2019s not just dropping rate, but it's also lagging rate. There is a customer experience part of this story and there are product enhancement in the future phases of this platform that we\u2019re going to invest in to deepen the relationship. This is not intended to be a won and done launch.","And so, you\u2019ll see more build out in the test and warm way, using this is the backbone of a digitally savvy channel that serves incredibly attractive customer segment that we want to learn, learn more about how to serve. So, again we lagged at the last 25 basis points rise from the Fed, we rose by 12 basis points. On the next Fed hike, we\u2019ll take a look at what make sense there and is clearly a very efficient way lower cost channel that is superior to wholesale funding.","Bruce Van Saun","I think, Ken, the stress test assumptions around that and really would say, that this is analogous to just your own affluent customers. If you have a lot of cash, you care more about the rates that you\u2019re getting. And so in our core customer base, the folks who of means are going to try to make sure they\u2019re getting a good break on the deposits and that\u2019s really all this is. The average account size as John indicated was $70,000. So, these are relatively affluent customer.","Operator","And we have Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill Partners. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","I think most of my questions have been hit. I guess one though which is on the fee guide, John said it\u2019s a little actually quite a bit stronger than I had anticipated. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks, capital markets should be a good quarter. But I wonder if you can just spend a moment or two talking about sort of what\u2019s going well what\u2019s not going as well as you hope to as you look at that fee guide into the fourth quarter and beyond?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I\u2019ll go ahead and start and then maybe Don, can follow up. But in the outlook, the cap markets and global markets are both expected to be drivers. But really a lot of our fee categories contributing to our expectations for 4Q, including service charges and frankly onsie-twosies across several of the other categories including investment and trust. So, in the cap market space our pipelines are strong, that's the business that you have monitor the external environment very closely because of the ebb and flows there and we probably made a lot of investments and capabilities there and in global markets that is providing that lift. And I'll let Don elaborate.","Donald McCree","I would say that\u2019s all correct. Go back to where what John said in his remarks, the syndicating lending business was quite weak in the third quarter, just to the market down raps across the board and we\u2019re seeing that come back. In the fourth quarter, I would also the M&A business is kicking in as we begin to benefit from Western Reserve now that we're a year and half in. So those obviously transactions take a long time to mature but what we\u2019re beginning to see transactions lined up to close in the fourth quarter.","John Woods","And then Don, in global markets, which is FX and interest rate, risk management we built a great team. We've got a great platform and we're expanding our capabilities, we\u2019re now offering options capability to some of the things that we had to standoff as we separated from RBS we\u2019ve now got those in place, we\u2019re gaining traction there.","Donald McCree","I think that\u2019s important. I think you have realized a lot of these businesses were two or three years into and it take a while to build the products build the team and get out in front of the client base and market them. And I think the number of wins we\u2019re achieving across the board is quite encouraging.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Given your strength in lending trends, I was wondering, if you could give us your perspective on how non-bank competition has potentially accelerated in the businesses that you have been expanding in? And how sort of the structure and the rate offerings are different from that over the traditional banks?","Bruce Van Saun","So, obviously, the growth of the non-banks has been something that we've been dealing with for years. I go back 25 years ago when we begin to sell risk to non-banks when the old age FHLB designation came in the commercial banking industry. But we see in that twofold, obviously, they're competition, but they're also a distribution channel for us. So, we originate a lot of leverage risk and sell to the non-banks as part of our distribution efforts.","And our strategy in leverage finance is to hold very little of the origination that we undertake particularly responses, so our whole levels versus our volumes are quite well. So, we view them as a different type of competitor. They don\u2019t have some of the same accounts challenges. We have as banks as some of the ratio that we didn\u2019t manage to, but I don\u2019t see them as a massive limitation in terms of the ability to continue to grow the business.","John Woods","Yes, on the consumer side, I would say there is two asset classes where we\u2019re non-banks compete. One is on personal unsecured lending program and the other is education refinance. And we particularly in the personal unsecured space we have seen the non-banks be pretty aggressive there. I think the big differentiation between us and the non-banks is they're playing a lower credit, profile then we are. So we maintained our discipline of staying really up in high prime space and were seeing our competitors go down credit.","Erika Najarian","Got it and just, oh I am sorry, don't mean to interrupt.","Bruce Van Saun","That\u2019s fine. Go ahead, if you have another one.","Erika Najarian","Just a follow up, could you help us size the residual risk that is on the balance sheet? And also do you have any term exposure on any sponsor back transactions that you do keep?","Donald McCree","We have about 2% of our assets in sponsor leverage finance right now, so it's relatively small. Some of it will be\u2026.","Bruce Van Saun","That's commercial.","Donald McCree","Some of it will be trend. Some of it will be revolver.","Erika Najarian","Got it.","Donald McCree","We kind of play and maybe a five-year kind of maturity bucket on the pro rata side.","Operator","And the next question in line will come from the line of Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets.","Lana Chan","Just a quick question, have you given an estimate on terms of FDIC surcharge savings going into next year?","Bruce Van Saun","No, we haven\u2019t done that. But we\u2019re very much looking forward to it because it is an attractive number, so stay tuned. We\u2019ll probably that will be in our guidance when we do that in January.","Lana Chan","Okay.","Bruce Van Saun","You want to add something, John.","John Woods","Yes, I just mentioned, it's about $15 million a quarter for us. And if anybody\u2019s guess when, it will actually and the general sentiment is that by the end of this year, we\u2019ll go ahead and stop that of the surcharge from being applied, but a $15 million a quarter and we\u2019ll -- as Bruce said we\u2019ll build that in to our outlook as we consider how we want to make investments and drive profitability into 2019.","Lana Chan","And just a follow-up on the securities book and you will see a backup of the long end of the curve recently. Does that change how you view securities deployment or investments opportunities?","Bruce Van Saun","No, I mean I think securities portfolio is primarily a liquidity store as we try to manage against LCR and our internal view about liquidity stress. It also helps us moderate our interest risk exposure. Those are the top two reasons and then we attempt to ensure that we\u2019re doing that in, with the lowest cost way with the highest profitability. In the third quarter, I think front book yields were about 350, 360, run-off yields were about 245 or thereabouts so you\u2019re going to see continuing improvement in that book if the long end continues to behave as the way it\u2019s been behaving. So that\u2019s a good trend for us.","Operator","And our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us, clearly as you\u2019ve already discussed about your capital levels being very strong. One of the largest mortgage originators out there Wells Fargo and in case that there's excess capacity in mortgage bank, residential mortgage banking, now that you have Franklin. Are there opportunities to make other acquisitions to build up even more economies of scale? And if so, do you kind of have to wait until integrate Franklin before you could do something?","Bruce Van Saun","I think Franklin was the silver bullet that got us where we need to be in mortgage. So, I wouldn\u2019t see us stepping out and doing any more acquisitions in the mortgage space. Having said that, I do think there will be consolidation in the industry, there\u2019ll be marginal players that are driven out of the business given where gain on sales has moved and that bodes well for the scale players. So, I think we should benefit from that trend.","Gerard Cassidy","And second when you look at optimizing your balance sheet and when you get it to the level where you, where it's optimal. Where do you think, I know ROE is the function of the denominator equity of course and the numerator. But, when you look at it from an ROA perspective some of our best regional banks have ROAs that are in 160s, 170s. What do you think in an optimal environment your ROA could get to?","Bruce Van Saun","I guess we haven't focused that much on that metric, Gerard, you know I think we continue to see that move higher as we run the bank better. You know we have, you have to consider where you are in the cycle and your business mix and so I think our focus is really been on ROTCE we mentioned earlier we\u2019re currently targeting 13 to 15, we\u2019re now in that range. I think if we continue to run the bank well the way we've run it and we can keep delivering operating leverage and get the balance sheet optimizer, there is certainly room for those metrics to move higher.","John Woods","That would imply, I mean there's just the math associated with that that would imply that we would get to the mid ones or thereabouts. You get to the mid teen, on returns you\u2019re basically talking.","Bruce Van Saun","Into the reserve math our focus has really been on the ROTCE.","Operator","And next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","On the margin side, I just want to engage your updated sensitivity for an increase of 25 basis points by the Fed. What would that equate to in terms of your expected margin benefit at this point?","John Woods","I think that would be on a parallel shift, which is really the issue there, I mean on a parallel shift you\u2019re in that call it $10 to $15 million range in the first quarter and that compounds thereafter close to around 15. In the short end, our sensitivity is about 75%. So we get most of the benefit even if the long end does not rise.","Bruce Van Saun","The stat that we quote typically has been to a gradual 200 basis point rise what would be the impact there. And I think last quarter that was high fours. I think were actually trending up a little bit towards the mid fives some of that is just fine tuning our models but we kept the asset sensitivity reasonably stable. We think that's the proper position to have in a raising rate environment. So we'll continue to benefit as the Fed lifts rates.","John Pancari","And then also on the NIM, is that, that 5 basis points of structural upside to your NIM annually that you see from the balance sheet optimization. Is that still intact that still around 5 basis points that's in your outlook?","John Woods","Yes, we said that previously that without rates we're looking to get somewhere in the neighborhood of approximately five basis points.","Bruce Van Saun","And on a year-over-year by quarter basis this quarter, I think we got 5 out of the 14. So I think we are trending towards that this year and we can update that as part of our guidance for next year in January.","John Pancari","Thank you and last thing for Don. What you mention that you do lead a good number of leverage transactions, but a syndicate a lot of it out what percentage of your leverage deals that you syndicate? Are you in the lead position? And then what is your average hold level?","Donald McCree","I would say our hold level is in the 10ish range, I don't have the exact number so just to call it 10 million, so relatively small. We plan a lot of deals that are kind of 300 million to 400 million in size so that will give you a sense. I think the general rule in my careers been you want to hold less than 5% of the risk you're originating that\u2019s what we try to do. And I would say we\u2019re probably leading of that 65% to 70% of the deal, these are I believe leads or jointly.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","In regards to some of the movements around the liabilities, we know the wholesale deposits went up quite a bit this quarter. And some of that could be seasonality and how you are funding your balance sheet specifically at period end. Given that Citizens Access has come on board and you should see an acceleration of deposit growth there. Do you expect wholesale deposits to decline in the fourth quarter? Or was there some seasonal aspect that you would see a shift between your interest bearing deposits and your wholesale funding?","John Woods","Yes. I think on the wholesale side we tend to see that relatively stable where the trade off is that at least in the near-term on Citizens Access is, as we\u2019re trading off promotional activities that might otherwise have occurred in the businesses, in the branch businesses that we can do more efficiently through Citizens Access. So, there is a little bit of trade off there. And sure at the margin, you might find a little bit of impact on the wholesale, but that tends to be structurally a bit stable and we\u2019ll be in place of the near-term.","Kevin Barker","And then when you think about your fee income going forward, you expect Franklin to continue at this rate with the margins that they\u2019re generating given the capacity constraints within the mortgage industry beyond the expense phase that you\u2019ve already laid out?","John Woods","Yes. I\u2018ll start up with that and maybe Brad will add, but I mean our margins are down in the industry for both our legacy Citizens business and which we\u2019ve seen, and we\u2019ve seen that in the data that came over in the history for Franklin. I think there is, two forces there that are going to correct that. One is, we are endeavoring to get much more efficient and take capacity out ourselves which Brad can talk about. And therefore to offset that decline in revenue due to margin by being more efficient on our platform.","And then as Bruce mentioned earlier, the other participants in the marketplace there is some non bank players they\u2019re just aren\u2019t going to make it. And we expect that the capacity will come out therefore you\u2019ll see margin stabilize a bit over time, it\u2019s just a natural ebb and flow of the mortgage market. But I\u2019ll stop there and see Brad has anything more to add.","Brad Conner","Yes, really not much more to add beyond this. I think you said it right, we would fully expect and we\u2019re already started to see it with the competitors taking capacity out and that will have the natural balancing impact of bringing margins back to more normal level. And then in the mean time, we\u2019ll be very, very disciplined about expenses.","Bruce Van Saun","Look, I would just add. It's Bruce. That we\u2019re very excited about this acquisition that is really gets us the scale that we needed. It diversifies our originations channels. It\u2019s a real quality operation with great technology. We\u2019re going to keep moving aggressively to better customer experience and digitizing frontend origination got some great plans in the business.","And so, we have high hopes for the business, and the market is a little soft that we'll work our way through that. But this is something that we wanted to be in and we think it\u2019s an important product capability that we need to offer to our consumer customers on their life journey where we can be their trusted advisor and help them go through a very big personal transaction for them. And now I think we\u2019re in the business with the right scale and the right way.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Well thanks again for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. I think there is a great opportunity to make money in this stock. I\u2019ll just add fortuitously. We continue to execute well and we maintain a positive outlook for the fourth quarter. So, have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And that\u2019s concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5472":["Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 19, 2018  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Ellen Taylor - IR","Bruce Van Saun - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","John Woods - Chief Financial Officer","Brad Conner - Vice Chairman, Consumer Banking","Don McCree - Vice Chairman and Head Commercial Banking","Analysts","John Pancari - Evercore","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill and Partners","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Peter Winter - Wedbush Securities","John Hearn - RBC Capital Markets","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Operator","Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Hey, thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining us this morning. We know it\u2019s a busy day. We\u2019ve got a lot of really positive ground to cover. Our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods will review our results and provide an update on our financial targets. And then we're going to open up the call for questions. Also joining us today in the room are Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking.","And of course, our lawyers want me to remind everyone that in addition to today\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve also provided a presentation and financial supplement and each materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. And our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from our expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings release materials.","And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong and improving results and a great finish to a year of significant progress and good execution. We continue to run the bank better each and every day. We're taking good care of our customers and we enter 2018 with some nice momentum.","The highlights of the quarter from my perspective were the continued delivery of good top line growth with 8% year-on-year underlying revenue growth as well as robust positive operating leverage of 6.4%. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 10% and the operating leverage was 6.8%. The commitment to positive operating leverage has powered improvement in our key metrics. Our underlying ROTCE hit 10.4% in Q4 and our efficiency ratio improved to 58.5%. ","Our success in hitting our medium term IPO financial targets has led to our establishment of new medium term targets, which we will cover in some detail later in the call. Suffice it to say, we believe we have a good plan and a good leadership team that is executing well across the board, giving us confidence in our outlook. We continue to deliver well on our strategic initiatives and we continue to do more and better for our key stakeholders, for our customers, our colleagues and the communities that we serve. We remain focused on raising our capital return to shareholders. ","We announced an increase in our Q1 dividend of 22% to $0.22 per share and we returned $424 million to shareholders in Q4 from both dividends and share repurchases. As we look to 2018, we expect our agenda to be largely consistent with 2017. We are hopeful that the macro environment will deliver some tailwinds, given the recent tax legislation, faster economic growth, a path to higher short rates and regulatory reform. But as always, our focus will be on execution and the things that we can control.","So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO John Woods who will take you through the numbers in more detail and provide you with some color. John?","John Woods","Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our fourth quarter results. We\u2019ll start on page 4. As Bruce mentioned, our reported results reflect the impact of tax reform and other notable items that we\u2019ve detailed on page 5 of the earnings presentation. Including these items, we generated net income of 666 million, EPS of $1.35 and a return on tangible common equity of nearly 20% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, including the notable items detailed on page 37, we delivered net income to common of $1.6 billion, EPS of $3.25 and ROTCE of over 12%. ","Excluding the notable items, underlying fourth quarter results were very strong. ROTCE was 10.4%, net income to common of 349 million was up 24% while EPS was up 29% year-on-year. And we delivered positive operating leverage of 6.4% with strong NII and fee income result across our businesses, which drove the improvement in our efficiency ratio to 58.5% for the quarter. Overall, credit quality continues to be excellent with non-performing loans coming down to 79 basis points of loans. ","We continue to actively manage our capital base with a 7% year-over-year increase in our tangible book value per share to $27.48 and a robust year end CET 1 ratio of 11.1%. We are focused on shareholder returns and payout 1.1 billion to common shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. That's up 70% from 2016. And we continue our positive trajectory with the 22% increase in our quarterly common dividend that we announced today.","Moving to page 5, let me cover the notable items in the quarter. Given the tax legislation in December, we\u2019ve revalued our net deferred tax liability and recorded a one-time tax benefit of $331 million. We utilized 22.5 million to invest in our colleagues and the communities we serve. All in, these items contributed 318 million to net income and $0.64 to EPS this quarter. In addition, in connection with our continued balance sheet optimization program, we completed the sale of a $67 million TDR portfolio of home equity and mortgage loans at a pretax net gain of $17 million. We utilize those proceeds to cover TOP IV initiative costs.","On page 7, we present our fourth quarter results, excluding these items. As you can see, we continue to deliver strong results with net income to common of 349 million, up 2% and EPS up 4% linked quarter. We continue to deliver on operating leverage, which came in at 6.4% year-over-year with revenue growth close to 8% and expense growth less than 2%. We posted another strong quarter from a return perspective with ROTCE of 10.4%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Our efficiency ratio was 58.5%, an improvement of 3.7 percentage points. Both of these metrics are well ahead of our medium term IPO target. These strong results reflect continued execution against our strategic initiatives and our commitment to focus on continuous improvement to drive further revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline.","On page nine, for the full year, we delivered underlying EPS growth of 34% with positive operating leverage of 6.8%. Also, we grew our balance sheet nicely. Notwithstanding an increasingly competitive environment, average loans were up 6%. At the same time, we expanded our net interest margin by 16 basis points. We are also seeing the solid return on the investments in our fee businesses as underlying non-interest income was up 7% in 2017.","Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on pages 10 and 11, we continue to deliver attractive and disciplined balance sheet growth, which helped us drive a 2% linked quarter increase in NII. Net interest margin improved 3 basis points linked quarter and 18 basis points year-over-year, which reflects a nice improvement in loan yields and better result in deposits, given the benefit of our balance sheet optimization efforts and a more constructive rate environment. On a linked quarter basis, retail and commercial loan yields were each up 5 basis points. Partially offsetting the higher loan yield, deposit costs were higher by 2 basis points, reflecting the rising short rates. Total average deposits increased 1% from the prior quarter, driven primarily by growth in demand and term deposits. Period end deposits were up 2% with increases across most categories.","Turning to fees on page 12, on an underlying basis, noninterest income increased 2% linked quarter, largely reflecting strength in FX and interest rate products and trust and investment services fees along with positive results in mortgage banking and letter of credit and loan fees. These growth areas were partially offset by lower capital market fees, which were still strong but came off the record levels we delivered the past couple of quarters. Year-over-year, our noninterest income was up 3%, driven by strength in the capital markets business, given our expanded capabilities, higher trust and investment services fees, given the improved sales productivity and fee based sales results. Card fees were also better, given the higher purchase volumes, along with the benefit of the first quarter revision of contract terms for processing fees. While mortgage banking fees were down driven by a decline in servicing fees with a relatively stable production fee income, our origination volumes outperformed.","Turning to expenses on page 13, on an underlying basis , expenses were stable compared to the third quarter. Lower salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were offset by an increase in outside services, which includes costs related to our strategic growth initiatives. Year on year, our expenses were up 1%, as salary and benefit expense was higher, reflecting the impact of strategic hiring, merit increases and higher revenue based incentives. We also saw an increase in outside services costs tied to our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to remain highly disciplined on the expense side as we identify opportunities to redeploy expense dollars out of the lower value areas in order to continue to self fund our growth initiatives and enhance capabilities to serve customers. Continuous improvement is part of our DNA and we continue to become more efficient, which allows us to fund our growth initiatives and maintain strong operating leverage.","With that, let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On page 14, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. Overall, average loans were up 1% on a linked quarter basis and 4% year-over-year. In consumer, we grew the portfolio 5% year-over-year with continued expansion in residential mortgages and high risk adjusted return categories like education, which is largely tied to our refinance product as well as continued strength in other unsecured retail loans, which continues to be driven by our product financing partnerships and our personnel unsecured product. ","As you know, we have been reducing the size of our auto portfolio and that should continue over time. As a result of these efforts, in addition to higher rates, we've expanded consumer portfolio yield by 5 basis points in the quarter and 38 basis points year-over-year. We also saw nice growth in commercial with average loans increasing 3% year-over-year where we continue to execute well in mid corporate and private equity, commercial real estate and franchise finance. This growth is muted somewhat by our efforts to reduce capital historically deployed against lower return areas like select portions of the C&I book, where we aren\u2019t gaining in crosssell and in asset finance where we had historically focused on big ticket leases, given RBS ownership. ","Our overall goal in commercial is to raise returns and build strong relationships, while still achieving good loan growth. The net results in commercial reflect a 7 basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a 70 basis point increase year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and optimization efforts. Also, Citizens remains well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with our asset sensitivity relatively unchanged at 5.1%.","On page 17, looking at the funding side, we saw a 2 basis point sequential quarter increase in our cost of deposits, reflecting the impact of higher rates, but also good discipline and progress on initiatives. We continue to find attractive balance sheet growth at accretive risk adjusted returns, which is driving NIM higher in spite of these gradually rising deposit costs. Our overall funding costs were also up 2 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our cost of funds was up 21 basis points, reflecting deposit cost increase of 17 basis points as well as a shift to more long term funding. This compares with overall asset yield expansion of 39 basis points. Our deposit betas remain in line with our overall expectations, given where we are in the rate cycle and we feel good about our ability to execute against our optimization strategies and become more effective in our future deposit gathering.","Next, let's move to page 18 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be excellent, reflecting the ongoing mix shift towards high quality lower risk retail loans and a relatively clean position in the commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio improved 6 basis points versus the prior quarter to 79 basis points of loans this quarter, while improving 18 basis points from the year ago quarter. The net charge-off rate increased to 28 basis points from 24 basis points in the third quarter, given seasonal impacts and the maturing of our portfolio. ","Our commercial net charge-off was very low again this quarter, while retail net charge-offs were 11 million higher than the third quarter, in part due to higher seasonality in auto and education and a modest reduction in recovery. Provision for credit losses of 83 million was 5 million above charge-offs. The provision was up 11 million compared to a relatively low level in the third quarter and down 19 million versus a year ago, reflecting the improvement in overall credit quality. Lastly, our allowance to total loans and leases ratio was relatively stable at 1.12% and our NPL coverage ratio improved to 142% from 131% in the third quarter and 118% in the year ago quarter.","On page 19, you can see that we continue to maintain robust capital and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with a CET 1 ratio of 11.1% or 11.2% when incorporating the benefit of a proposed FASB accounting standard tied to the recent tax legislation. We ended the year with a CET 1 ratio above guidance, given our strong fourth quarter performance, lower risk weighted assets and the impact of the tax legislation. This quarter, we purchased 8.8 million shares and returned 424 million to common shareholders including dividend. As expected, our board approved a 22% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 a share.","On page 20, we continue to provide color on how we are progressing against our strategic initiatives. Suffice it to say, we are executing well overall and we\u2019ll continue to make adjustments as needed. ","Page 21 provides some detail on our TOP IV initiatives. The TOP programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to self fund investment to provide our platforms and product offerings. We have largely completed the TOP III program, which launched in mid-2016 and we estimate that it has delivered run rate benefits of over $115 million as of the end of 2017. Our new TOP IV program is doing very well and we are on track to deliver another $95 million to $110 million of pretext run rate benefit by the end of 2018.","On page 22, you can see the steady and impressive progress we're making in improving our performance. Since 3Q \u201913, our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 10.4%. And our underlying efficiency ratio has improved from 68% to 58.5%. Our EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well with a CAGR of nearly 30% over the past four years to $0.71 from $0.26. While we are pleased with the performance, we still have opportunity for further improvements, which we will cover shortly.","On page 23, we review our full year performance against the guidance we provided at the start of 2017. You can see the green ticks on the right column, demonstrating another year of strong execution.","On pages 24 and 25, we detail our guidance for 2018. Quite similar to 2017 with good top line growth, a 3% to 5% positive operating leverage target, further efficiency ratio improvements and capital normalization. Let me add a few points of color. We are expecting slightly slower loan growth overall given competitive market conditions, but still in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Growth will be focused in the areas we believe offer attractive risk adjusted returns. We should see strong NIM improvement in the range of 9 to 12 basis points, which reflects market expectations for rate hikes in April and October as well as continued execution on our balance sheet optimization efforts. ","We expect continued growth in noninterest income in the 4.5% to 6% range as we leverage our investments and expand the capabilities and continue to invest for the future. We expect credit quality to remain well controlled as our charge-offs should gradually normalize and some growth in provision will be needed for loan growth. We expect our LDR to be about 98% and CET 1 at the end of the year between 10.6% and 10.8% with a dividend payout ratio of around 30%. This payout ratio would be higher, but for the first half impact of tax legislation and the timing of CCAR.","Next, let's turn to our fourth [ph] quarter outlook on page 26. This is typically a seasonally softer quarter for us, given several factors, including day count, seasonally activity levels and elevated FICA taxes. We expect loan growth to come in at about 1% and we should see about a 5 basis point improvement in NIM for the quarter. We're expecting our effective tax rate to come in at about 23% percent, including a small historic tax credit impact. We also pay our preferred stock dividend in the first and third quarter each year. Overall, our view for the quarter reflects continued strong execution against our plan.","And with that, let me turn things back over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks, John and I think you missed the first quarter there. You said the fourth. Everybody knew what you're talking about. So, let's turn to page 27 and let's focus on where we're taking Citizens over the medium term. We have a mission to really make a difference for our customers, colleagues and communities, so that they can reach their potential. Things that can focus on and deliver this will build long-term franchise value and stand out in a crowded banking landscape. We aim to become a top performing, widely admired bank. To get there, we will rely on our customer centric culture, our mindset of continuous improvement and building excellent capabilities. And our Credo informs and guides our culture and behaviors. This mission, vision and credo really resonates with our stakeholders and is a key foundation of our past success and it's an important reason I am confident in our future outlook.","On page 28, let me identify some of the keys to taking our financial performance to the next level. The good news is that we believe there's plenty more for us to do to drive improved performance. We have plenty of fuel left in the tank so to speak. I\u2019ll highlight a couple of things here on this page. First, we believe that our commitment to continuous improvement through execution of TOP programs and BSO is differentiating and will drive continued outperformance versus peers. Second, we are excited about the opportunities to leverage the investments that we've made in our fee based businesses over the last few years. I think overall, we have a tremendous opportunity to continue investing, to build up these businesses and to realize the revenue potential in our franchise. And lastly, prudent capital management and balance sheet rate positioning will continue to help drive improving returns.","On page 29, we unveil our new medium term financial targets. You can see that we've outlined our expectations for the overall economic environment, which is relatively constructive, particularly given the recent tax legislation. Over the medium term, we expect to deliver continued improvement in ROTCE, moving to 13% to 15%, including the benefit from the recent tax legislation. We expect a rising rate environment to be helpful in reaching our targets, as we are factoring in that short rates will increase on average a little over two times per year, given the current rate curve. ","We expect to deliver solid top line growth while driving annual positive operating leverage in the range of 3% to 5%. This should lead to continued efficiency ratio improvement down to 52% to 56% and we also expect to see some normalization in credit from the excellent performance that we're seeing today. And we continue to be focused on returning capital to shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over this timeframe, we would expect to reduce our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 to 40 basis points annually to a target of around 10%. As we did with the original ROTCE walk, we presented an updated version with a roadmap of how we think we can go from roughly 10% today to 14% on a full year basis give or take with time.","So to sum up, page 30, we feel that we've delivered strong results in Q4 and for full year 2017. We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2018 and we will look to drive more TOP and BSO program benefits. We feel our balance sheet capital and credit position remain robust and as we head into 2018, we feel very good about our ability to grow the business and drive towards our new targets. We're making good steady progress across the board as we aim to become a top performing bank.","So with that, operator Brad, let's open it up for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","Just on the tax side, just wanted to get your updated thoughts in terms of the benefit of tax reform, as you look at your expense base, since you look at your investments, I know you've got the TOP IV plan and the program is very much in place, how much of that tax benefit do you think longer term ends up accreting to the bottom line and sorry if you already alluded to that? And then separately, what areas in terms of technology spend are you putting new money to work? Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. So I think certainly in the near term, most of that tax benefit flows through. We announced at the end of the year the bonus program for certain employees here and a contribution to the community foundation that we run, which I think was the right thing to do. We're looking at our overall technology spend. I think, we've been funding that at a very good clip. So, at the margin, we might try to get a few more things through a little faster, but I think that's really at the margin. So I think that in terms of our own spend, we're going to mainly let it flow through.","I think the question over time is what happens in the marketplace to some of our peers. We don't intend to lead on this, but do some folks offer a little bit back and get more aggressive on loan terms, for example, that takes the market to a different place than it is today. I don't anticipate that happening in the near term, but we'll see how that plays out over time. So we're optimistic that there should be a pretty good benefit that we get to produce in 2018 from the overall tax reform and I think that should be pretty well sustainable in our view, although over time, you might see a little bit of it competed away.","Just in terms of where we're spending money, one of the things that we've been pleased with is we've said that for much of the last five years, we were playing catch up in terms of our technology spend in freshening our application suite and the infrastructure that we run. We're now moving to the good news having been largely caught up, we can focus on playing \u201coffence\u201d. And so there's a lot more funding going into things like digital, so the origination and fulfillment platforms that will create efficiencies and better customer experiences. So I'd say that's really where the future spend is going.","John Pancari","And then on the medium term targets, the ROE outlook and the efficiency ratio, in terms of medium term, how do you define that timeframe, just want to get a little bit of clarity around that and then what type of rate environment do those medium term targets assume?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. So I think the medium term, we're being, I think, just a little less specific than we were during the IPO walk when we kind of laid it out and said, it was three years and we hope to get the 10% by Q4 of \u201916. It actually took us three quarters more to do that. We executed the plan well, but we didn't get the lift in rates that we had anticipated. So I think our view now is to be a little less specific, just call it, medium term, but I still think you kind of think in terms of three year cycles. ","And so, I'd say it's fundamentally roughly a three year view plus or minus depending on what happens in the environment. Again, one of the keys will be what happens with rates over that period. You can see on the walk on the page that still we have an asset sensitive position. We still expect to get a benefit from that. If we look at triage among dot plots, consensus estimates, forward curve, we come up with an expectation right now that we should see two rate hikes per year for the next three years. That includes \u201918, 19 and \u201920. So that's built into the forecast here. ","One of the things I will point out is notwithstanding, we had far fewer hikes than what we assumed when we put the IPO targets out we found other ways to compensate. We got more positive operating leverage than we anticipated. So we're not sitting here reliant on the rates, but they certainly would create a tailwind if that scenario develops.","John Pancari","And then one last thing, if you do get that type of move at the short end, but not much follow through at the longer end, if you get a flattish curve throughout this period, does that take away much, are you still able to offset that?","Bruce Van Saun","It takes away some. So, John, you could add here, but I think we don't anticipate a full parallel shift. But, if we really had a pure flattening of the curve, that would take away a percentage of the benefit.","John Woods","Yeah. That\u2019s exactly right. I mean, we've built in an expectation that short rates will rise, that will rise faster than long rates over that timeframe, so we\u2019ve already got that built in. Even if that occurs, we can still stay on this path and it's anchored not only through our 5% asset sensitivity, but the fact that that will actually moderate over time along with the flattening, so that\u2019s built in.","Operator","And we can go to the next question. It will come from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners.","Scott Siefers","John, maybe best for you, but question just on the loan growth guidance, so it looks like as you look into the first quarter, pretty steady rate of growth with what you've been doing recently, but to get to the full year guidance, it looks like it might take a little bit of an acceleration throughout the course of the year. One, am I interpreting that correctly? And two, just maybe a little more color on what the drivers would be behind any acceleration?","John Woods","Yeah. I mean that's right. You\u2019ve got that right. We're coming in around 1% for the first quarter and to get to that 4.5% to 5.5% that we're talking about, things will pick up later in the year. I mean, we came out of 4Q and saw that in the industry as well as in our own businesses, a little bit of softening in some of our areas that which drive that loan growth, but we're seeing some pick up and the pipelines are strong. And as we go through the first quarter, if we can realize those pipelines and see the pull through that we expect and we'll see a pickup later in the year. ","The key areas that would drive that on the consumer side continue to be education loans and mortgage as well as on secured. And on the commercial side, we've been investing in our geographies, in our growth markets and opportunity and talent along with that geographic expansion. And so, those things will continue to drive growth into 2018.","Bruce Van Saun","I would add to that John and say that I think the consumer side has been relatively consistent. So we kind of get the run rate of 5% annualized growth almost quarter in and quarter out where we need to start to see the build is on the commercial side. And I think as John indicated, the pipelines are good. I think, there's been some pent up demand looking into Washington and some uncertainty. What was going to happen now that that's been resolved and I think there's positive sentiment towards the tax cut. Hopefully, that releases some animal spirits and we get more loan demand and a follow through as the year goes on. So we would expect to see the commercial side pick up a bit. Don, do you want to add any color to that?","Don McCree","I think that's right. I think just to echo what John and Bruce said, I think we are seeing the pipelines build. We're seeing the M&A pipelines build faster than the loan pipelines. We think the loans will follow the M&A pipelines and are indicative of new money demand we might see and I would remind people that we really rolled out the regional strategies midyear last year, so they're going to begin to take hold this year as we add new clients. So we\u2019ve got a combination of more activity with our existing clients and then adding new opportunities into the book.","Scott Siefers","And then if I could just ask one more on the margin, so obviously some pretty decent expansion here, as you look into the first quarter, I guess, I'm just curious how you see the progression going throughout the year? I guess my initial guess would have been the guide could have been even a little bit higher, just trying to figure out if that's conservatism or any sort of change in anticipated deposit betas or how you see things progressing?","John Woods","I\u2019ll go ahead and I\u2019ll start off on that. The outlook of 9 to 12 basis points for 2018, in terms of deposit betas, those are built in, where deposit betas are behaving as expected at this point in the tightened cycle for us. We did have some expectations that betas would continue to increase. The farther we get into the tightening cycle, so that is built in to the 9 to 12 basis points that we're talking about. And so, I think by \u2013 if we do get that April and October move from the Fed, we'll be right on target with moving towards the potential of the 300 basis points through the cycle move and we\u2019re right on track from that perspective. So we felt pretty good about that NIM outlook, given what we've built in on betas.","Operator","And our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","On capital, it looks like you've got some run down built in but really not targeting CET 1 much lower than you did previously, despite the fact that we seem to be entering an elusive regulatory environment, why is that?","John Woods","We\u2019ve been targeting this approximately 40 basis points or so of capital decline glide path over time. I think that serves us well over a couple of -- through a couple of lenses. We still have opportunities for deploying that capital and when we find opportunities to deploy that capital organically and in an accretive way, we think that's a good use of the capital. We continue to compare the ability to deploy the capital against what the economics would be of a buyback and when we find opportunities that are accretive, we would deploy that on behalf of shareholders and that glide path over time will -- we will resume that march downward. This past year, we were the victim of basically higher earnings and a little bit lower RWA usage as we talked about earlier on the call in terms of loan growth and of course the tax legislations. So I think there are some unique factors that were at play in 2017 and I think we'll get back on that glide path reduction on CET 1 in 2018 and beyond.","Bruce Van Saun","I think Geoffrey, getting down to 10 to 10.25 is part of the medium term targets. And there's a bunch of things that go into that. It's the spot posture that the regulators have regarding the stress test, but then also the rating agencies and what you're targeting in terms of your credit rating. And so I think the good news here is that we can get a very acceptable ROEs, medium term ROEs and still maintain what we think is a strong capital position that gives us flexibility as John described.","Geoffrey Elliott","And I think in the past, when you've been asked about bank M&A as a channel for deploying capital, the answer has been not yet, but three years out, post the IPO, you\u2019ve hit the initial target, is that changing at all? Is there any more appetite for bank M&A?","Bruce Van Saun","I'd say there's really no change there. There is beginning to be an appetite to do what I would describe as fee based bolt-ons. So the, Western Reserve M&A boutique that we bought in 2017 I think was a great transaction and it's working really well, integrated well and we're getting lots of two way flow with that property. I think we could do more things in commercial, in the capital markets space to keep building out our capabilities. Over on consumer, we have I think a desire to really capture the potential that we have in wealth management in the organization. ","We've been doing that organically and so there could be opportunities potentially to add through acquisition there. And then, I'd say there's other opportunities around mortgage, for example, buying MSRs, if you want to account that as an acquisition is another thing and maybe some things in the payment space and some of the things we're doing with fin-tech. So I think we've built the capabilities now. We have a strong team that can look outside the organization to spot opportunities and react to opportunities. ","But again, I think it's walk before you run. It's to relatively safe, well thought out deals that are right in the middle of the fairway that are accretive and get us, like I like to say, farther down the track faster versus an organic pathway and then the rest of it is, let's keep focus on running the bank better and getting that organic growth and let's not get distracted going off and looking for bank M&A.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","I\u2019ve noticed that some of your deposit growth has been decent and then your deposit betas have also started to slow a bit from the beginning of the year. Could you just give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing as far as deposit competition, specifically in the northeast? And how you see some of the go forward deposit betas at least in the next couple of quarters?","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. I think this will be a team effort, but Brad, why don't you start with the color on the consumer side and some of the geographic markets that we have.","Brad Conner","I would say for the most part, competition has been pretty well behaved. We've seen a little bit of increased competition on the money market side, but for the most part, the competition has been pretty well behaved, the deposit costs have been well behaved and competition has been pretty attractive. We are continuing to make investments in our ability to be more targeted in our deposit offerings. So, we're really moving away from promotional pricing and investing in analytics and the ability to do targeted digital offerings, targeted direct mail offerings, which we think will help us keep our deposit costs lower and keep our betas in check, but competitively, we feel pretty good about where the market's been.","Bruce Van Saun","Don, do you want to talk about the commercial?","Don McCree","Yeah. I\u2019d say the same thing. I mean, it was really beginning -- at the beginning of last year, where I felt we really organized the business around strategic deposit gathering. And before that, I think we were lurching a little bit in and out of the market in terms of gathering deposits and we're now managing over a multi-quarter basis, so that\u2019s helped us gather with our core clients in a much better way and contain costs at the same time.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. John, do you want to fill in the blanks on the betas?","A - John Woods","Sure. Yeah. So on the betas, you\u2019re right. I mean I think when we mentioned last quarter that we expected betas to be lower this quarter, that wasn\u2019t a Fed move. That would drive it in 4Q. And so that occurred and as expected, I think looking forward, you could think about similar behavior in the quarters in which there's a Fed hike, in the quarter that after the Fed hike, you can see betas rise and that\u2019s as expected. We're right on our glide path in terms of where we expected to be on betas. We're in the low-20 on beta, just up a tiny bit from \u2013 in 4Q and we expect that to stay in the 20s as we see things progress throughout 2018, maybe getting up towards 30. If we get those two hikes, we'll be more than halfway through an overall tightening cycle and we\u2019ll be about halfway through our overall beta estimate of around 60%. So, things are progressing on plan.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then a quick follow-up of the other side of the balance sheet, the other retail consumer loan growth has been fairly robust, especially this quarter, up 23%. And it's one of the higher yielding asset classes, could you just describe some of the puts and takes on why that's growing at the level it is.","John Woods","It\u2019s been a good quarter for us on the unsecured side. So our partnerships, including the Apple relationship, has been strong, so we\u2019ve seen good growth there. We\u2019ve seen good growth in our core product, our personal and secured loan and we see upside in both of those areas and we've seen continued strength in demand for the product as well. So all of those are good risk adjusted assets and we see some good runway in all of those products.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. And I think what's interesting to note is that we have a pipeline of potentially some other partners that are going to be coming on stream as the year goes by, which should continue to add to the growth.","Operator","And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Can you talk about some of the fee revenue drivers in 2018? I think, you had some pretty big upgrades in the treasury management and mortgage and obviously the mortgage market is a bit influx here with lower refis, but maybe talk about fees in general and then those two specific areas, how meaningful the opportunity could be in those.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. Why don't I start and then John you can provide more of the details. But I'd say that we still remain quite positive on the trajectory we've had on the commercial side of the house. So we've been adding clients and building up our capabilities so that we can do more for those clients. So that's a very strong powerful combination to have broader capabilities and a growing client book. And so if you look probably over the last three years, I think our fees on the commercial side have grown in double digits, low double digits, 11%, 12%, really on the back of capital markets and then also, what we call, global markets, which is FX and interest rate hedging, which we used to do in conjunction with RBS, and we\u2019re able to break that away and set up a great operation on our own. So, those we expect to continue to grow. ","And as you mentioned Matt, what we call treasury solutions here, the cash management business being the biggest element of that should get a real kick probably not till late in the year, because the re-platforming starts to roll out late this year, but I think we've made steady improvements to the platform and now we're going to take a step function to having a really terrific platform. And so I think we\u2019ll start to get even more traction on treasury solutions. Treasury solutions, I think, has been growing in the high single digits, even without that. So we've had strengthened our card offerings and our payables offerings and some of the other areas, but not as much in the core cash management space.","And then on the consumer side, really the wealth to us remains the really big upside area and we've fought a few headwinds, by having mix shift and kind of how we approached the business and how the business plays out in terms of products, but we're moving much more towards a managed money orientation as opposed to a transactional orientation around annuities. And so, in the short term, that's been a headwind. But in the long term, that's actually quite positive, because it will build up more annuity like book of revenues and I think those lines are getting pretty close to crossing and you can see in Q4, we had a nice step up and we would expect to see that continue. ","Mortgage, as we've talked about, we've had fits and starts in that business. I think we now have a strategy that focuses more on conforming in the mix. So let's really get the retail channel the way we want it, more focused on conforming. Let's move and invest in our direct to consumer business and then let's get scale in the servicing by buying some MSRs. So I think we have a good strategy there. We've actually built a very good platform. Our fulfillment and service and capabilities are very strong. So we think that business will contribute as well. So that would be my kind of long winded highlight. And I don't know if I left any for you, John to fill in, but go ahead.","John Woods","You got most of it, Bruce. And you covered and I think the theme is we've invested in all of these fee income capabilities by adding seasoned wealth, adding one-off, there is mortgage, the leadership investments that we make across the commercial phase, re-platforming, we've done product enhancements and advanced with the re-platforming. So, all of that will drive towards the mid single digit growth that we're targeting for 2018 on the fee side and we\u2019re going to be working hard to achieve that goal.","Don McCree","I might just add one thing on the mortgage side. You talked about the shift to direct to consumer. Really, our growth up until now has been almost exclusively through hiring loan officers. But as we've been doing that, we\u2019ve been making 1 billion investment in building the capability for direct to consumer, so building the data now really need to underpin your ability to do direct mail and digital offering and that investment has been made. So we think we really are at a point [indiscernible]","Operator","And we will go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the BSO part of TOP plus BSO and maybe help frame us in terms of whether it's in terms of the 9 to 12 basis point NIM name expansion for \u201918 or just a broader sense of how much upside do you see from that program specifically and separate that from rates maybe?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. So if you look historically, Ken, we\u2019ve probably approached close to 50-50 on the contribution from our NIM expansion from BSO. It wasn't necessarily a formal program, but just the steps that we're taking to focus on the mix and sharpen our pricing and being selective about where we play. I think when we\u2019re at \u201918, maybe 8 of that or so was coming from BSO and the rest was coming from rates. So, we tried to really look through and capture that. And then I think going forward, so in recent quarters, it's been a little less, it's maybe 35%, maybe 40%, but still a meaningful contributor. ","So I think one of the goals we have is to close the NIM gap that we have with the peer median. And we know where the gold is. We got a gold mind and the gold. So we know we still have mix work to do, we still have some pricing work to do and we have now, I think at this point, under John\u2019s leadership, put this into a more formalized program where we'll have tasks and we'll monitor progress and just like we do with the TOP programs. So that's really the background there.","John, you can add some additional color?","John Woods","Yes. Just a point or two, I think, a good way to think about it in an environment such as 2018 where we expect rates to move and we've got 94 basis points, I think the number that you heard from Bruce around 30% to 40% is a good way to think about would be to contribute. And in a period where there is no rate moves, really, a lot of the drive comes from BSO. So for example, in 4Q, there was a little bit of rate overhang left in 4Q, so 3 basis points that you saw in 4Q, maybe close to 2 of that came from BSO, because we didn't have a rate move. But again, when you get out to \u201918, they will go back to 30% to 40%, Ken, as you heard from Bruce. So that probably helps you think about it. And actually, really it doubled down on -- in an environment where there is no rate move, we're still focused on self-help and we're still driving net interest margin in an environment like that.","Ken Usdin","And then just a follow-up specifically more on some of the loan buckets that continue to run down as part of it, do you actually get a line of sight into the home equity and auto and where and how far out do you see this stabilization in those parts of the buckets or are they just going to kind of continually drift down?","John Woods","Yeah. I'll start off and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Brad or Bruce or whoever wants to add in, but -- and I think the -- I think auto will be a gradual glide over the medium term and we frankly use that as a way to drive upside by finding higher risk return opportunities in the education space or in other areas in unsecured and that allows us to run down the auto book on that kind of path. So that will give you a sense for basically what we expect there and maybe I\u2019ll let Brad to add a lot of detail.","Brad Conner","Yeah. So let me add on the home equity side. So there's an interesting dynamic on the home equity side, which is that home equity line of credit has a 10-year draw cycle and then it moves into repayment. So for the industry and for Citizens, the big books of origination were back in the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 timeframe. So, our largest books that are hitting the end of the draw period come to an end in 2008. So that's really what more of the drag has been for both the industry and the Citizens and senior home equity portfolio grow. We have a big step down in home equity line starting in 2009 that hit the end of their draw period. So we do think that, I\u2019m sorry, 2019, is when you will start to see home equity grow because we won\u2019t have that headwind of a large book sitting in the end of the draw period.","John Woods","Yeah. So we would -- when we look at the HELOC on a risk adjusted return basis, it's very attractive and it's a great product for the mass affluent, which is a key segment of our consumer base. So we're still investing in that business. We've really improved the customer experience. We have great net promoter scores. We're going through a much faster fulfillment cycle. So I think we're very keen on that business. ","On auto, I'd say we've been using that when there was not much loan demand, we ran it from 10 billion or 11 billion, up to 14 billion and now we have it back down in the 13s and it's running back down to 10 or 11. So that is -- because it's a two year duration, relatively short portfolio, we can use that as a shock absorber based on what other loan demand is out there in the marketplace. And right now, we're in a mode of withdrawing capital from that business, but the HELOC has been, as Brad said, more environmental. We want to grow that business. We're actually putting new lines on the books, but we're still suffering from paydowns.","Brad Conner","And those paydowns drop about a third between \u201918 and \u201919. So it\u2019s certainly dynamic.","Ellen Taylor","And so I was just going to add one thing that our direct to consumer marketing effort in home equity has been really successful following the build out in data and analytics and we improved our originations in that channel from about 150 million in 2015 to over 1 billion in 2017. ","Bruce Van Saun","So that investment is not just paying dividends in the mortgage business. It\u2019s also in the HELOC business and it will be in all our portfolios.","Operator","And our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Couple of questions. Consumer efficiency ratio, Bruce, John, still pretty high, up given or take 72% last few quarters. What's your outlook in that, what will it take to get that down meaningfully, because obviously we've had rate hikes, the rate hikes have obviously greater benefit upfront. So, is that a question of scale or what do you think you need to do to get that down meaningfully?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. I'd say it's a combination of things, but the same positive operating leverage that works for the company is what we have to effect in the consumer business in order to keep driving that down. I think it -- actually when I was here, it probably was close to 80%, so we've had good headway in getting it this far. There's a number of things that are going on on the cost side of the equation. Brad has been a leader in the TOP programs and looking for efficiencies and straight through processing and that will continue. ","We're trying to reduce the overall size of the branches in terms of our branch transformation efforts. So there's a little bit of pruning of the number of locations, but the greater element of that program is trying to take 4200 square foot branches and turn them into 2500 or 2200 square foot branches. And so we're, I\u2019d say, by 2021, I think we'll have gone through 50% of the branches as the target. So we're focused on that. That'll continue to hive down some of the costs and a good chunk of that will be reinvested in digital. But I think you can get more efficient in terms of your touch points with your customers in a digital sense than versus the higher cost full branch structure. So -- anyway so there's good work going on, on the expense side of the house. ","And then on revenues, we've got to get back to growing households. We think some of the investments that we're making in having well thought out products that for different segments for the affluent, the mass affluent, the mass customer is gaining traction. So that's helpful. We've invested in something we call, customer journeys, to try to really make like for example, the account opening experience, be really pleasurable for the new customer and that has a good impact on keeping that customer, the fraud experience, problem resolution, there's a number of these journeys that we\u2019re re-engineering from front to back, which I think will help boost the top line by reducing attrition, increasing loyalty and increasing crosssell and the consumer portfolios also are contributing. So as we grow personal and secured and education, et cetera, those portfolios drop a lot of net interest income to the bottom line. ","So, I think what we're expecting for the whole company in terms of driving that efficiency ratio down, we have to get that from consumer and we see it. We have a path to do that.","Vivek Juneja","Completely different question and we\u2019ll shift gears. Any commentary from you folks and from Don and Brad on loan pricing terms you're seeing in the various categories?","Don McCree","Yeah. On the commercial side, it's as aggressive as it\u2019s ever been and it's basically a deal by deal, borrower by borrower. I think it's been down drafting materially for several quarters, if not several years. So I think we're getting to a point where you're probably not going to see material incremental downdrafts. So I think we've seen a lot of it, although every transaction is quite competitive, both on bank balance sheets and on site balance sheets through this intermediation of the bond market and the non-bank markets also. So it's an environment that we've been operating in for the last several years and we expect this to continue, but we're navigating.","Bruce Van Saun","And I think Don you can comment on this, but probably the new thing is the non-bank\u2019s competition has really picked up.","Don McCree","And that's significant in the leverage finance business as in the underwriting business. I think for us, some of that\u2019s being offset and the one thing we didn\u2019t talk about in terms of the progression of the fee revenues is in addition to the investments we've been making. We want to take increasing leadership positions in the transactions that we\u2019re involved in. So while we were a participant several years ago, we were moving to a joint leader ranger, now moving to a ranger, which while we\u2019re growing the business also is allowing us to capture a greater share of both balance sheet economics and fee economics on a transaction by transaction basis. So the fact as you know, it's kind of a put and take constantly, but net net, we're doing pretty well.","Brad Conner","I would say on the consumer side, we haven't seen a lot of change. It\u2019s been pretty \u2013 certainly, the market has been rational without question, a few competitors have entered in the rural space, the education and refinance space, but it really hasn't moved the market much, and in fact obviously on the auto side, we\u2019ve maybe seen margins even widens a little bit on the auto side, which is encouraging.","Operator","And our next question in queue will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","The provision expense, when I look at credit quality, it's been very good and then the guidance for the provision expense for \u201918, the range is a little bit higher than what I was looking for and I'm just wondering the reserve build is not a function of keeping reserves to loan ratio fairly steady with the loan growth or would you want to start build building the reserve with more growth on the consumer side?","Bruce Van Saun","What I would say Peter first off is that's about the guidance that we gave for 2017 was I think the same exact range that we're giving for 2018. So we were very favorably surprised by how strong the environment was and how all of our credit metrics improved. I think when you now turn the calendar and look at \u201918, one of the questions is we want to get the loan growth in the range that we talked about, midpoint of that is 5.25, something like that. So you would be adding to reserves to fund the loan growth. ","What happened this year is that even though we thought that covered was pretty bare in terms of problem credits or back book issues, we still had a lot of positive surprises. So whatever we needed to fund in terms of the allowance build, we actually had offsets coming in, in terms of back book improvements. I don't know if you can -- again if you're really clean, can you count on that happening again. So I think we're being conservative here and just saying, well, let's assume we get the loan growth and let's assume we don't have a lot coming from back book credit improvements, then that would start to move your provision number higher. ","There's also a little bit of seasoning in some of the consumer portfolios that will start to move the charge-off number up a little bit, certainly, well behaved and in control, but that would also be a factor that comes with a good thing, if all the net interest income is being delivered. So anyway, I'd say that's our call at this point, if 2017 -- 2018 plays out like 2017, there could be some positive upside there.","Peter Winter","And just a quick follow-up, if Congress were to raise the SIFI threshold, would that accelerate the medium-term target on your common equity tier 1 ratio?","John Woods","I don't think so. I mean I think that we set that target in part related to business opportunities that we talked about before and the fact that we continue to have organic and other opportunities to deploy capital over time that are accretive that we want to balance against the capital return and just where we are in our life cycle as a company post IPO. It just feels like an appropriate glide path, whether that SIFI threshold was at 50 billion or 250 billion. We of course are supportive of that directionally and believe that that would help moderate the interactions that we're having with the regulators, but I think the glide path would remain.","Operator","And the next question in queue will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","John Hearn","This is actually John Hearn on for Gerard. Just a quick question on the commercial utilization rates in the quarter. Could you tell us where they were and then just how that compares to where they performed in the past?","Don McCree","I think they're right around mid-30s and I think relatively stable across the year, up and down a tick, and up a little bit year-over-year, so maybe low-30s ending 2016, getting into the low to the mid-30s here at the end of 2017. So about as expected.","John Hearn","And then just one follow-up from earlier comments on the merchant financing programs, you're expecting to announce some partnerships this year and another is a degree of risk sharing there with the partner, so is that expected to continue as new people join us.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. So I\u2019ll start and Brad you can complement. But, yeah, I think we will have more announcements this year. We're working on some things that are in pilots and so stay tuned. But this is a -- I think we provide a very high quality customer experience and a good partnership experience for our partners. And so there's other folks who want to see if they can do a program similar to what we pioneered with Apple. And I think each of the arrangements has its own negotiation around how the economics are going to work and so kind of the pricing that we get is oriented around a targeted rate of return. And so if there is more loss sharing that we don't need as much for the use of our balance sheet and vice versa. So anyway, we're pleased in general that we can offer the flexibility. We can construct these things around the rate of return and we think that the risk adjusted rate of return that we're getting are attractive at this point.","Brad Conner","Yeah. I really don't have anything to add other than I really completely -- we expect to have more partnership announcements this year and expect to have then, some degree of risk sharing through all the partnerships.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","On slide 17, it looks like most of the funding growth has been coming from the term deposits or timed deposits. Can you just talk about that, like, I'm just curious more about the strategy, it doesn't obviously seem to be having an impact on your margin or your deposit base today, but I\u2019m kind of wondering how that plays out over the next year or so?","John Woods","Yeah. And I think, we have all of those tools in the toolbox with respect to our deposit categories and from time to time, we will have a promotional strategy on term, which allows us to control cannibalization and other things that may happen in a promotional approach, but we're more pleased with our DBA growth and really that's the driver of all of the initiatives that you're hearing about, coming out of the consumer space with all the investments that we're meeting there in terms of better pricing and investments in data and analytics. And the targeting that we're doing there from a digital perspective, so our emphasis is on DDA and from time to time, we can serve our customers in a promotional way through term.","Brad Conner","I think you said it well, we think there's a good opportunity and continued DDA growth. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we have there this year.","Ken Zerbe","And then just last question in terms of the capital markets business, obviously, it ticked down a little bit this quarter, but from a higher pace over the last couple of quarters, I mean was there something unusually negative in this quarter, I mean, should it bounce back towards that $50 million range or is it just, I\u2019m trying to think of what the outlook is. I mean, I understand the total fee guidance is what it is, but \u2013","John Woods","Yeah. I think the way to answer that is, it's going to be a moving mix of fees across M&A and bond underwriting and syndicated lending and leverage finance based on deal flow that\u2019s materializing. I will say with the changes in tax legislation, we expect more activity in general. There was one slight anomaly in the fourth quarter that we called a couple of deals forward in the third quarter in terms of closing. And if you pushed into the first quarter, so it was always a timing difference and we did see people, both on the M&A side and on the syndicated loan side basically migrate around at year end, based on what their individual cash aspects of their transaction are. ","So I look at it not on a quarter-on-quarter basis, but on a year-on-year basis. And you're going to have quarterly anomalies I think. We feel good about the, as I said before, the breadth of that business now, the position we have in terms of underwriting and climbing up the tables and the swings we're having based on the size of the client base and the fact that that\u2019s growing.","Bruce Van Saun","And Ken, you may recall the trajectory that we used to put up quarters in the 20s for capital markets and we had the 30s, the 40s, 50s and I was joking that 50 is the new 30, but I think there will be some volatility based on market conditions and when deals close. And so we're pleased that the investments we have in the business have borne fruit, that the environment has been healthy and we would expect the capital markets on a year-over-year basis to be up in 2018 versus 2017.","Operator","And our last question in queue will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Wanted to focus on the balance sheet optimization and in all your kind of guidances and you get to funding, you talk about loan to deposit ratios and you\u2019re bumping up against that 100% level, but given the methodology of liquidity coverage ratios, shouldn't that be the driving force for liquidity versus your loan to deposit ratio? Do you see 100% as any type of constraint on your balance sheet and loan growth?","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Well, we have actually worked to try to bring that down gradually. So the history was, we were probably in the 93 zone when I arrived and we needed to sell the Chicago region to fund the separation from RBS and some charges we had to take. So we took the gain and that ultimately removed net about 5 billion of deposits that put the LDR up around 99. We printed a year end spot of 97.6. And our guidance has been to bring that to 97 to 98. I do think there's still a psychological impact, if you go over 100. So I do think we are working to keep below that and maybe over time, bring the LDR back towards 95 or so.","Having said that, I think another thing is happening. As you point out, the LCR is actually a much more sharp instrument to determine what's the nature of your actual liquidity and funding position. And so there, we've had a very strong LCR just because we have in the deposits a high percentage of our deposits come from consumer, which stress test very, very well and we've termed out all of our borrowings. We have the same kind of term funding structure that our peers do, which we didn't have originally. So when the LCR begins to be published and I think investors pay more attention to that, I think the LDR over time becomes the secondary measurement. But at the current time, we're still managing it. We're pleased with where we have the LCR and we feel very good about our overall liquidity and funding position.","Marty Mosby","The other thing is, when you talked about your long term kind of goals and profitability, one of the things that you said under your operating assumptions was asset sensitivity moderates as rates normalize. Does that encompass neutralizing the asset sensitivity because you have about $7 billion that needs to be extended, neutralized?","John Woods","No. It just happens naturally. So as rates are higher, deposit betas go up and so you capture less from the moves that are late in a hike cycle as opposed to the earlier ones. And so we're not intending to say, this is the precise moment to put a big hedge on a neutralizer sensitivity. In fact, we've actually tried to maintain it a little bit here and we'll just let it glide down naturally with time.","Operator","I\u2019ll hand the call back over to you Mr. Van Saun.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, great. Thanks, everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and also your support along our journey. We're pleased with the progress that we're making. We recognize however that there is still plenty of work in front of us to build a truly great bank. So thanks again and have a great day.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference call.

My name is Brad, I'll be your operator on the call today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks so much, Brad, and good morning to all of you. We are really pleased that you joined us this morning. We are going to start things off with our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and our new CFO John Woods covering the highlights of our results and then we will open up the call for questions. Also joining us on the call today are Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking.","Of course, I have to remind everyone that in addition to today's press release we have also provided presentation and financial supplement and you could find those at investor.citizensbank.com. And our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. And we provide information about the factors that may cause those results to differ materially from the expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. We also provide non-GAAP financial measures and information and reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and in our earnings material.","And with that, I will hand it over to you Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong results, picking up where we left off in Q4 and well positioned to continue our momentum going forward. We are doing an excellent job of executing on our strategic initiatives, taking care of our customers and demonstrating a mindset of continuous improvement in how we are running the bank.","The highlights of the quarter from my perspective includes strong loan and deposit growth, good net interest margin expansion, excellent results in our fee based businesses, and good control of expenses.","Revenue growth was 12% year-on-year, positive operating leverage was 7%. This drove ROTCE higher reaching 9% after excluding a non-recurring tax benefit. Our efficiency ratio is now at 61.7% and NIM is at 2.96%.","I\u2019d like to recognize our commercial bankers for an exceptionally strong quarter. We\u2019ve built great platform in capital markets and in our FX and interest rate management businesses and attracted first class talent. We also continued to up our game through an ongoing investment program in treasury solutions. Added great coverage bankers and our team approach to how we cover clients and provide tailored solution is really paying off.","This quarter showed quality strength, and potential of each of these businesses. I am also pleased that our continuing ability to innovate. Our Apple partnership is going well and we\u2019ve added two more partners and have a nice pipeline as well.","We continue to access Fintech capabilities trough partnerships and we will roll out our robo advisory product to clients this quarter. And our ed refi loan products continue to address a real market need. We\u2019ve stayed nimble on how and where we deploy our capital, with balanced and attractive loan growth in both consumer and commercial. Growth in consumer is expected to continue in mortgage, personal unsecured and student lending.","We have ended our flow agreement with SCUSA on auto loans, part of an overall strategy to strengthen our auto loan book. We continue with our SoFi flow agreement on education refinance loans. We've been pleased with the results to date. And we remain focused in commercial on both borrowers and industry segments where we see growth and an ability to develop a meaningful relationship.","At the risk of stealing John\u2019s thunder, we working through a top 4 program and hope to have it ready by our Q2 earnings call to provide you with some details. I believe that this ability to consistently find ways to run to bank better and tap the potential of our franchise is a key differentiator of Citizens relative to our peers.","So with that, let me turn it over to our new CFO, John Woods, to offer his first impressions and then take you through the numbers. John?","John Woods","Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to first say that I'm extremely pleased to have the opportunity to join Bruce and the Citizens team on the journey to build the top-performing bank. Since the IPO, Bruce and the team have made tremendous progress with great momentum coming in to 2017.","Since my early days here at Citizens, I am taking on the leadership in three high-priority areas. First, balance sheet funding optimization; second, continuation of our top initiatives to grow the bottom line and self-fund strategic initiatives; and third, partnering with Don and Brad in driving fee revenue growth.","We had some success in these areas and I hope to contribute to further enhancements going forward. I'm impressed by the quality of our leadership team and their clear understanding of our direction and what we're trying to achieve. In short, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie before us. So with that, let's jump into our first quarter financials which start on Slide 4.","We\u2019ve generated record net income of $320 million and diluted EPS of $0.61 per share. These results were up 13% and 11% linked quarter and up 43% and 49%, respectively, year-over-year. I\u2019d like to remind you that we did benefit from approximately $23 million related to the settlement of certain state tax matters that lowered the tax rate by 5.2 percentage points and added $0.04 to EPS.","Excluding the tax settlement impact, net income was up 33%, EPS was up 39% and the tax rate would have been 31.6%. Note also that under new accounting rules for equity compensation, we had a modest benefit in tax expense. This has been included in our first quarter and full year guidance.","Operating leverage was positive linked quarter and year-over- year we generated positive operating leverage of 7% driven by revenue growth of 12%. Our net interest margin increased six basis points linked quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year. And we improved our efficiency ration 50 basis points from fourth quarter and roughly 4% year on year to 61.7%.","These strong results reflect good execution of our strategic initiatives and our commitment to drive revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline. Our ROTCE of 9.7% improved 1.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.1% year-over-year. On an underlying basis, ROTCE of 9% was up 55 basis points linked quarter and 2.4 percentage points year-over-year.","Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on Slides 5 and 6, we continue to deliver strong balance sheet growth, which helped us to deliver a record $1 billion in NII. We grew average loans 1.5% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year and I will provide some additional color on the growth in a few minutes.","Margin improved six basis points linked quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year, which reflects improving loan yields thanks for the pick-up in interest rates and the impact our balance sheet optimization efforts. These benefits were partially offset by higher deposit and funding costs.","The deposit costs increase reflects growth in commercial deposits over the quarter, the impact of higher interest rates and mix shift in consumer to more term and time. Note that we grew period-end deposits by over 2% in Q1, which reduced the spot LDR to 97%.","Turning to fees on Slide 7, linked quarter fees were up slightly as strong results in capital markets and card fees helped overcome some seasonal impact. Linked quarter service charges were slightly down, reflecting seasonality in day count. Card fees increased from revised contract terms commencing this quarter for core processing fees and a reduction in rewards expense.","We had another record quarter in capital markets driven by loan syndications, bond underwriting and advisory fees. We saw $5 million increase in trust and investment services fees, thanks to higher investment sales volumes, as we've added wealth advisors and continue to invest significantly in our wealth platform. ","Foreign exchange and interest rate product fees were down modestly from strong fourth quarter levels, while mortgage banking fees were down from fourth quarter levels that included higher MSR valuations and higher origination volumes. ","On a year-over-year basis, we delivered outstanding non-interest income growth, which is up $49 million or 15%. The story is much the same as the biggest drivers of improvement came from capital markets, card fees and foreign exchange and interest rates products and income.","Turning to expenses on Slide 8. We saw a slight increase in linked quarter expenses largely as a seasonal increase in salaries and benefits and occupancy was partially offset by lower insurance fraud and regulatory costs, Outside services and Equipment expenses.","Compared to first quarter 2016, expenses increased 5%, but there is some noise in those numbers that I want to call out for you that elevates the growth in salaries and benefits and other expense lines. The biggest driver was an increase in salaries and benefits of $19 million but that includes a change in the timing of incentive payments. Last year, the payment was made in second quarter and we pulled this forward this year into the first quarter impacting payroll taxes and 401k expense.","Other expense increased $11 million, which includes the impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge, which was not a factor in 1Q 2016. When we exclude those items, the year-over-year expense growth rate was closer to 3%.","Let\u2019s move on and discuss the balance sheet. On Slide 9, you can see the continued benefit of our efforts to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. We grew average loans 1.5% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year reflecting growth across most of our commercial business lines and in education mortgage and unsecured retail on the consumer side.","NIM was up six basis points in the quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year reflecting improved loan yields partially offset by higher deposit costs. We\u2019ve done a nice job of improving our loan yields giving our balance sheet optimization efforts along with greater discipline on pricing. We've also benefited from higher LIBOR during the quarter as the market anticipated the tightening by the Fed.","We remain well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with asset sensitivity to a gradual rise in rates, at 6% at the quarter end. On Pages 10 and 11 we provide more detail on the loan growth in consumer and commercial. In consumer 6% average growth was led by continued expansion in education, residential mortgages and other unsecured retail loans, which was driven by our partnership with Apple and our new personal unsecured product.","We, continue to improve and enhance our portfolio mix by driving growth in higher-return categories. We are slowing growth in auto and that will likely accelerate in the back half of the year as our partnership with SCUSA comes to a close in April and we further reduce volumes in select geographic areas. As a result of these efforts in addition to higher rates, we\u2019ve expanded portfolio yields by 10 basis points in the quarter and 22 basis points year-over-year.","We also saw nice growth in commercial where we continue to execute well in commercial real estate, mid-corporate and middle-market, industry verticals and franchise finance. The increase in rates and enhanced rigor around the acquired portfolio of returns have helped drive a 23 basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a 41 basis point increase year-over-year.","On Page 12, looking at the funding side, we saw a five basis point increase in our total funding cost with a 4 basis point increase in deposit costs mostly tied to growth in commercial deposits. Year-over-year, our cost of funds were up nine basis points reflecting substantial growth in higher cost commercial deposits to fund robust loan growth as well as the impact of higher rates in terming out some of our borrowed funds.","Next let\u2019s move to Slide 13 and cover credit. Overall credit quality continues to be strong, reflecting the continued mix shift towards high-quality lower risk retail loans compared with growth in the larger company segments of our commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio remained flat to fourth quarter levels at 97 basis points of loans and improved from 107 basis points a year ago.","The net charge-off rate decreased to 33 basis points from more elevated in 4Q levels that included a $7 million increase in the auto portfolio related to a onetime methodology change. Retail net charge-offs decreased $20 million, while our commercial net charge offs were up slightly.","Provision for credit losses of $96 million, decreased $6 million from relatively high fourth quarter levels. As we continue to grow higher quality retail portfolios, our allowance for total loans and leases ratio has moved down modestly to 1.13%.","On Slide 14, you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions. This quarter, as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we\u2019ve repurchased 3.4 million shares and returned over $200 million to share holders including dividend. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.2%.","As a reminder our CCAR capital plan targets the repurchase of up to $130 million in shares in the second quarter of 2017. It's also worth noting that the total and not returned to shareholders to date is 3 quarters of the 2016 CCAR window at $756 million including dividends.","On Slide 15, we show an update on progress against our strategic initiatives. I\u2019d like to highlight that we continue to drive attractive loan growth across a number of areas. In consumer, we continued with strength in our mortgage loan officer recruitment efforts reaching 560 at quarter end, which should help provide an offset to industry wide origination headwinds. ","We continue to reduce the auto program to enhance return and we've seen really strong growth in our education refinance loan products, which has attractive risk-adjusted returns. In wealth, we saw nice plus in fees this quarter with the total investment sales up 13% linked quarter and 25% year-over-year. We continue to make progress in a year-over-year basis in shifting the mix of our sales towards more fee-based business, which came in at 36% compared to 14% in 1Q 2016.","In addition our FB headcount is up 9%, which is contributing towards the scale in the business. Commercial continues to deliver impressive results with a strong quarter and capital and global markets demonstrating the potential of these businesses given our expanded capabilities. The build out of Treasury Solutions is also on the right track with higher fee income growth linked quarter and year-over-year along with strong momentum in our commercial card program.","Moving on to Slide 16, the top programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to self-fund investments to improve our platforms and product offerings. In 2016, our top 2 program delivered $105 million in annual pre-tax benefits across our revenue and expense initiatives.","Our top 3 program, which launched in mid-2016, is on track to deliver targeted run rate benefit of $100 million to $115 million by the end of 2017. We have been working on a top 4 program and we expect to provide additional details on this on our second quarter call.","On Slide 17, you can see the steady progress we are making against our financial targets. Since 3Q 2013 our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 9.7%, which equates to 9% on an underlying basis. Our efficiency ratio has improved by 6% over that same time frame from 68% to 62%, and EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well. More than doubling from $0.26 to $0.57 on an underlying basis.","Let's turn to our second quarter outlook on Slide 18, we expect a pretty linked quarter loan growth of around 1.5% on a period-end basis and 1% on an average basis. We continue to project full-year loan growth to be within the 5.5% to 7% full-year guidance range. We also expect net interest margin to continue to expand by about three basis points to four basis points linked quarter given the forward curve benefit.","In non-interest income, we are expecting to see a sequential decrease given the strong first quarter results in capital markets. The commercial activity pipelines have moderated somewhat as the market reassesses the political and economic outlook. ","We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the second quarter with positive operating leverage and efficiency improving. We expect stable to slightly higher provision reflecting loan growth with relatively stable net charge-off levels. And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11.1% and we will manage the average LDR to around 97% to 98%.","With regard to the full year 2017, outlook we broadly reaffirm on the balance sheet. And expense guidance that we previously provided but expect to come in at or above the high end of the range for NII and operating leverage.","To sum up on Slide 19, our strong results this quarter demonstrated our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocators and enhancing our returns for shareholders.","In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making further progress for all stake holders. With that let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks John before we start the Q&A, let me turn it over to Brad for some brief words on a media article on our Checkup program. Brad.","Brad Conner","Thanks, Bruce. We have confidence in the Checkup program as an important part of our strategy to serve customers well and ultimately be better positioned to deepen relationships. We believe it's important to note that recent media coverage did not suggest customer harm nor have we identified any.","Nevertheless we have commenced a through review to determine whether there are any issues in the delivery of the program. My current expectation is that we are in a good position based on feedback and survey results we already have. Our surveys show that customers who go through the review are highly satisfied and most would recommend a Checkup to someone else.","An engagement and organizational health index at our braches is up, customer alignment is up and the [indiscernible] is down since we moved to this mode of interaction that our branch based customers. However we're open to things we learn from review that we can adjust to become even better. So back to you Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, thanks Brad and with that operator we're ready to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","John Pancari","Could you update us on your \u2013 your updated thoughts on the ROTC expectation at this point. I know you had a target of 10% medium term. You're certainly close to that now, so can you talk about where you expect that could go over the course of the next year and how soon you could be, up towards your original targets, when you spun off. Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","John I have repeatedly not want to be drawn in on putting a pin in the exact timing that we get to the 10%, what I would say is that we've made nice progress, kind of consistently last year and now in the first quarter and we are getting closer, a lot will depend on first the environment and continued movement in the interest rates, which provide some tailwind and then our continued ability to execute on our strategic initiatives. ","So I think we have momentum, I think we\u2019re as you say getting relatively close. So hopefully it won't be too long but what I would ultimately say is that once we get to that 10% we won't be satisfied. We will look out, we will be doing our strategic planning effort this summer and we'll consider whether at the appropriate time it is appropriate to raise that target even higher. ","John Pancari","Okay, all right thanks and then separately or just around the auto business, I know you indicated outside of the of the SCUSA purchases, ending that you are shrinking that that portfolio, so if you can talk about the rationale behind it and the magnitude of the shrinking we could expect and then separately any update on credit there. Is that influencing that decision?","Bruce Van Saun","Now it's really John, you can add to what I say or Brad, but I think that the real reason is that we grew the auto book when there wasn't much happening on the consumer side. So there side. So there was very little demand for credit from consumers except in the auto arena. So we ramped up our own self originations and we supplemented that with the SCUSA flow agreement, which got us into the prime space in the super prime space and delivering quite returns. ","Our view is always that the runoff in auto was a bridge to hold us and deploy some capital until ultimately the consumer can back and if you will got his\/her mojo back and so we've seen that now. We've seen increase in demand for personal unsecured and revolving credit, student lending, mortgages. And so as those other portfolios grow, there's less need to have the auto and frankly the auto now that our returns have lifted is dilutive to our overall ROTCE and overall returns. ","So I think you'll see us we probably peaked at maybe $14 billion in total loan balance. I think that will probably be lower by about $1 billion and I would expect that trend to continue into next year. I do know, John or Brad?","John Woods","The only thing I would add in the specific question around in any way related to credit performance, the answer is no. Our credit performance has been strong, right in line with our pricing expectation and our expectation is, to your point, it's all about the return on the business. It's not in any way related to the credit performance. ","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, anything from you.","Brad Conner","Yes, just getting back to the point about reallocating that capital to hire a better use. I may have mentioned in my remarks that this generates higher risk-adjusted returns for us when we rotate that capital into those other consumer businesses, so we're excited about that. ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes","John Pancari","Okay great thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Eads","Hi, good morning, and welcome John. Maybe starting with you, I think when you talked about kind of the strategic priorities, you started with opportunities for to optimize and improve on the funding side. See if you can kind of drill into more detail of where you think opportunities might be there, whether it is on the consumer side or the commercial side \u2013 how you think that\u2019s going end, what opportunities are going to be shaking out given the changes to the dynamics for deposit given higher rates? ","John Woods","Yes, thanks. And I think I've just talked about it on both sides and partnering with Don and Brad on this. In early days, there's been nice momentum in both of those businesses on funding. I'd say that we're entering into an environment here, which we'll all talk about rising rates and how we all operate in that environment. But looking forward, when you look at overall balance sheet, we're looking to remix and as we just talked about on the asset side and better use of that capital, we're constantly looking for better ways to fund that portfolio and that's part of our franchise.","And we have some momentum there in terms of getting the right mix of commercial and consumer, so I think you'll see a bit more on the commercial side and getting a better representation of commercial deposits in our footprint. And there's also \u2013 we've seen good control of deposit cost in the consumer side. So like everybody, we're going to constantly look at that and look for ways to better fund the balance sheet.","Bruce Van Saun","Brad, we want to add some of the initiatives may be that you have going on in consumer, targeting of that segmentation of the customer base, mining products and having data analytics to really tease out the products from with good offers to different segments of the base?","Brad Conner","Yes, you bet. A couple of things we've got. I think we talked about this a little bit on last quarter's call. We have redesigned our value proposition for our massive and affluent consumers. I think you\u2019d get a much better value proposition to serve the needs of those customers. And then we invested very heavily in analytics and really understanding our customer segments and how to reach them with very specific and targeted offers so that our offers are much less about putting broad offers out, if you will, across the entire branch base that\u2019s targeting the specific customers and specific customers sets. And we think that will really allow us to be much more efficient in driving lower-cost deposits.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. And Brad, you're also looking to focus on where the opportunities are for deposits?","Brad Conner","Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019ve got materially more sophisticated in our deposit strategies over the last couple of quarters and added staff and added specific programs and added industry base focus to where we work with those deposits that are attractive and attractively priced, so we\u2019re very confident there.","Bruce Van Saun","And we will start to emphasize some of the industry segments that have that are cash rich as supposed to on a credit needy. I think it's part of the rotation that we're looking at as well.","Brad Conner","Correct.","David Eads","Great. Thanks, guys. That\u2019s very helpful. And may be second question, obviously a really good quarter on the fee side, you talked about may be a little bit of pullback on the capital markets. I'm curious, is the equitation that this step up in the card fee line should be sustainable and kind of a may be fluctuating, but broadly sustainable at this higher level?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Let me take that and then I\u2019ll ask my partners to color. But first off, with respect to capital markets, it really was an exceptionally strong quarter and I think it really shows that we built some great capabilities. We had to move off of being a partner with RBS for many of these products, and we've now stood them up on our own. We've got really good teamwork going between coverage bankers and our product specialists, and we're making great traction and the market conditions were very favorable and I think we hit the ball out of the park.","I think what we're cautioning is that we were at record levels when the capital markets fees were in the mid-$30s very recently, we just hit a $48. I still think the numbers this year, the outlook is strong but it's kind of capturing lightning in the bottle at this point for $48. But like I used to kid with Don and his team, when we were in the $20s, $30s, the new $20 and then we were in the $30s, $40s, the new $30, so I think we will continue to see as we built up our book of customers and continue to expand our capabilities that will push that number at over time.","On the card side, what I would say is that, look, the renegotiations that we had with our core processing vendors creates a sustainable lift. There was some of rewards expense adjustment in the quarter which would not repeat, but that will be partially offset by seasonality in Q2. So I think we'll see a good percentage of this lift stick but not all. So, Don, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any color?","Don McCree","No, I think you\u2019re exactly right on capital markets. I mean, the only thing I'd add is it is incredibly competitive out there right now and aggressive, so we're trying to maintain a level of discipline on the transactions we do. Highly encouraged by the quality of the franchise and the transactions that we are doing, we're winning in disproportionate share of what we're seeing. So as you said it is the function of activity in the market, discipline, and then quality of franchise. I think we will continue to have strong quarters going forward. ","Our treasury services business, just to mention that, my other fee line has got tremendous momentum and it's really led by card which is growing at 30% to 40% a year. So that's the way for the future in terms of our treasury business, so on both \u2026","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","Don McCree","Really nothing to add, Bruce. I think you said it right.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay.","David Eads","Great. Thanks so much.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks Eads.","Operator","And our next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just focusing for a minute on commercial lending. What are the trends you're seeing there in terms of demand by size or maybe industry verticals? A couple of your competitors over the last few days have mentioned a growing demand in mid-market and maybe below mid-market relative to where it's been the last few quarters. Can you give us a little more color in terms of those trends and the utilization rates?","Bruce Van Saun","Don, you want to take that?","Don McCree","I'd say utilization just to start with that, it's up slightly not in a material way. So we're seeing pretty standard utilization. Our pipelines in our mid-market business are actually quite strong. And the question is what closes and when does it close and how does the demand continue to materialize? We saw quite robust kind of conversations in demands early, early in the year off the back of the changes in administration. And I would say, given some of the uncertainty of delivery of some of those programs and potential delay into the back end of the year, it's moderated a little bit.","But we're encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of pipeline growth and activity in conversations. I will say that it's been offset by two other factors. One is there has been very tremendous capital markets activity and in our mid-corporate and some of our industry vertical businesses, we've seen a lot of refinancings into the capital markets given the strength of the capital markets. You can see that in our fee lines as we capture some of that opportunity. And at the margin we've got more disciplined on returns, so we are turning certain parts of the book to try to build better returning portfolios.","So we've seen shrink in places like our leasing business, which has been offset by growth in other parts of our business. So I guess I'd summarize it by saying client activity is strong. We think the franchise is strong. We're adding a lot of new clients. So we're optimistic as we look out through the next several quarters, whether it materializes in the second quarter or third quarter is the timing question get's in the back of my mind.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And just staying on the idea of commercial, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times so far this call about growing commercial deposits prudently. And I'm curious, John, if you think that that's going to add to pressure in terms of deposit beta over your relative to what your prior expectations have been.","John Woods","I think we are going to talk a little bit about how those funds are being deployed as well. You have heard a little bit earlier. We're putting that money to good use. We're making prudent decisions on the pricing side. And we have \u2013 we're doing better on the loan yield side. So you've got to look at those sides of the balance sheet there when you talk about what we're doing with those funds. Sure, commercial deposits have bit higher beta than a consumer deposits. But as you heard earlier from Don, we are under-penetrated on that side. We've got some very interesting things going on in the products front that will help to create some momentum on raising commercial deposits. And we feel good about where that will go in terms of from a mix standpoint and how we will put that capital and liquidity to work.","Matt Burnell","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ricky Dodds","Hey guys, this is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Just a quick question on the buildout and wealth in mortgage. It seems to be going pretty well and appreciate the update and the press release. Just wondering if you could give a little more color on sort of what's left to do there? And how you think you guys are doing on the build versus maybe your initial expectations? Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","Brad, you want to take that? ","Brad Conner","Sure. I would say we're feeling pretty good about both of those areas. I will start with mortgage. We were up 22 this quarter, up 125 year-on-year. I think the key for us has been we feel really good about the progress we're making in turning our operations around. So we've really seen improvement in our customer satisfaction operations, which has allowed us to recruit loan officers and retain loan officers. Obviously the entire industry is seeing a little bit of slowdown in terms of demand.","But all in all, we feel good and the progress that we're making with hiring our loan officers have been in our conforming geographies as well, which will help drive fee income. So we feel very good about that. I'd say on the wealth side, good quarter for us and we feel good about the progress we're making. We continue to see improved growth. We talked about it last quarter. One of the things that slowed our trajectory a little bit in growing fee income was a movement from to more managed money, fee-based products and we're seeing that trend continue but we feel like we've sort of crossed over that threshold where not yet that sustainable source of fee income and so continuing to have good success and good progress. And I would say yes, maybe to your question about how do we feel against our original projection, we feel like we're pretty much on track there guys.","John Woods","Well, I'd say it's probably taken us longer\u2026","Brad Conner","Taken us longer.","John Woods","\u2026to get here, but we have made some I'd say slight adjustments in the mortgages to make sure we are focusing on the conforming geographies to make sure we get fulfillment on servicing where it needs to be. And in wealth, I think we're just building it the right way, putting the right products in place, we're putting the right customer segmentation and delivery mechanisms in place. We've got the robo advisory now up and running this quarter, and so I am really excited about really where both businesses are today and the outlook although I'd say to be fair, it's taken us a little longer to get there.","Ricky Dodds","Okay, great. Thanks. And just a quick one on occupancy cost this quarter. It looks like you called out about $5 million and branch rationalization or upgrade cost. Wondering if you can give a little color on that and then is that something we should expect going forward as you continue to sort of make improvements to your footprint?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, there's probably of that increase. I think it was maybe 3 or 4 was related to the branch charges. But what we're focused on here is what we call refer to as branch transformation, which is to take a look at all our branches and try to figure out how to reconfigure them. So in most instances, we don't need as much space as we have, so we want to reduce the overall square footage in the branches and we want to take what was space dedicated to transactions and the remaining space should have more private rooms for conversation. So we can deliver advice to our customers, and we can also use the foyer , the entrance room for putting in some very sophisticated machines that people can do a lot of the banking that require tellers right on those machines.","We're probably looking at a 10-year timeline based on our lease expiries to get to all our branches and we're kind of in the early stages of that. So initially, you'll see the charges for the refurbs exceed what we get in terms of the back book of lower rent from the restructured branches. But as time goes by, that becomes a nice driver because ultimately, we'll be driving the occupancy expense, lower and because of the less square footage, and that will swamp the cost of a handful of branches each quarter getting refurbished. So anyway, that's what you saw in Q1.","Ricky Dodds","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, Bruce. Hi, John.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","I wanted to talk a little bit about reserves, reserve levels for your loan portfolio, obviously crisp and very good, but how you're thinking about reserves to loans have come down a little further to 113% and where do you see that leveling out?","John Woods","Look, we're comfortable with where that is Vivek and I think it partly reflects the shift in some of the portfolio that you've seen, you've seen someone runoff of \u2013 some of the legacy poor assets that service by other home equity portfolio being replaced with very high prime and super prime consumer assets, which has been an upgrade. And I think in the commercial side, you're seeing growth in the kind of mid-corporate space, which tend to be higher rated credit. So I think it's really just overall function of the decisions we're making in terms of how we plan where we play. If you look at the coverage ratios of things like NPLs, that continues to go up. And I think we're up to 118% on that basis. ","So overall, I think we're probably getting to a point where you won't see significant further reductions from that 1013%. But hopefully if we keep working down the book of NPLs, you might see that number continue to improve somewhat.","The other thing I'd say that's quite interesting is while we\u2019re focused on getting higher yields and we're also improving the risk-adjusted returns on our loan book, we're seeing that our stress test losses are actually reducing because of some of the impacts that I described that's running off these legacy portfolios and putting really good quality back on the book. So you kind of have the hatch wrecking effects, better yields, better risk adjusted returns and lower stress losses, which is really great to see.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great. You basically [indiscernible] into my next question, which was CCAR. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that and given your continued very strong capital levels, your plans for how you're thinking about capital return and capital deployment?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. And again, we've been, I think very consistent and predictable that we've been on a glide path that we want to have strong returns of capital to shareholders and strong loan growth. The fact that we were birth from RBS with a high capital ratio has allowed us that flexibility. We're coming closer and closer to where peers are but we still have, I think, relatively high rates. I think you could expect more of the same in terms of our approach this year.","When I think about what we want to do with capital, certainly, increasing the dividend you saw us raise the dividend and the payout ratio is going up. We'd like that to continue, and we'll also want to continue to fund loan growth as a high priority. And then when we have excess, we'll use that to repurchase the shares. So that's it in a nutshell.","Vivek Juneja","And are you still targeting, Bruce, as you look out what kind of target capital ratios rather than me putting words in your mouth let me just give that too. What are you thinking? Where you would like to run with that?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, we haven't really freshened that view. As you recall when we did the IPO roadshow, we said we wanted to bring it down to around 11%. I think last year, we came from 11.7% to 11.2%-ish. So the glide path in the past couple of years has been down 50 basis points or so. I think it\u2019ll cross over 11% this year and still have a differential to peers. So I think this continued glide path can continue not only this year but into next year, and so we'll stay tuned on that. We'll probably post you on that sometime in the middle of the year.","Vivek Juneja","Thanks, Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay.","Operator","And our next question will come from Scott Valentin with Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Scott Valentin","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just on the unsecured portion of loan origination, just wondering, I know you guys used combination of partnerships and I guess internal initiatives. Just wondering over time if you plan to internalize all of that, will partnerships remain a key component into driving that unsecured loan growth, consumer loan growth? ","Bruce Van Saun","Let me start and Brad can add some color on this. But clearly, we've had \u2013 I think we've taken the view that to grow our card portfolio is challenging because the payback period for actually growing that book takes some time and so there were better uses of expense dollars to grow other portfolios.","One of the things when we looked at the unsecured space and struck up the partnership with Apple, was that the returns are accretive much faster, so we were able to make an investment to build the capabilities to support Apple, but then as the balances come on the books, we're not paying for zero balance transfers and heavy marketing expenses. So we like that aspect about the program and the risk-adjusted returns on that portfolio are very good from our standpoint.","We have \u2013 because of that, being partnered with an iconic company like Apple, we've had other reverse inquiries and we've actually gone out and solicited some, so we've got two new partnerships set up that will gain some traction as the year goes by. One is with Vivint, a smart alarm company and the other is with HP, and stay tuned because there could be more in the works. So we like that capability that we have developed and partnering with real class companies and so that I think will be a growth feature going forward.","We've also determined that there is an opportunity, much in the way with add refi lending products that we can offer attractive propositions to borrowers who are carrying high-cost debt. There is other customers of ours who maybe carrying multiple revolving credit balances who can consolidate that into an unsecured line of credit, and so we introduced our pearl product last year and that has real traction too. So I think you'll probably see a combination of it too. You will see some direct mailing and branch offers to our customers on the pearl product and then married to an overall trust on the partnership side. So, Brad, you want to add to that?","Brad Conner","[indiscernible] I think you said it right, I mean, we have a very high quality list of other potential partners that have reached out to us. I think we have new capability and we think we can continue to expand with a very attractive set of customers. I\u2019d just point out to that Vivint is a very good commercial bank customer of Don and I think it\u2019s also related to build rate synergy between the consumer and the commercial bank and we will continue to look at those opportunities as well.","Bruce Van Saun","Great ","Scott Valentin","Thanks very much.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Well, thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We really appreciate your interest. As I said in the press release, I think we're really firing well on all cylinders. I remain very confident in our full-year outlook. Thanks again, and have a good day.

Now my name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks so much, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. We really appreciate you joining us today. We're going to start things off with prepared remarks from our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, who will review our first quarter results, and then we'll open up the call for questions. We're really happy to have in the room with us today, Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking.","In addition to our release, we have a presentation and financial supplement available at investor.citizensbank.com. And I need to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are absolutely subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations in our SEC filings, including the 8-K -- this Form 8-K we filed today. We also need to remind you that we utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and our earnings release materials.","And with that, I'll hand over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to report that we're off to a good start to 2018. We continue to deliver good top line growth. We had 5.6% year-on-year revenue growth. We're also doing a nice job of managing expenses. This resulted in positive operating leverage of 2.1%. Our ROTCE improved to 11.7% as we chart our course towards our new medium-term targets of 13% to 15%. We achieved year-on-year average loan and deposit growth of 3% in the first quarter. We saw linked quarter spot and average loan growth of around 1%. Based on our pipelines, we feel this will pick up as the year progresses.","Similarly, based on strong Capital Markets pipelines and the benefit of seasonality, we expect to see some good fee growth in the second quarter. We continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives, building out our customer coverage and our product capabilities, while making critical investments in technology, in our digital platform and data capabilities as well as in our customer experience initiatives. We continue to find new ways to streamline our processes and organization in order to become more efficient and to self-fund these investments.","Our projects, TOP and BSO, are delivering consistent results. And as you may suspect, we are working hard on the development of TOP V. Stay tuned for our July call and for more details. We continue to make progress in building excellence in our capabilities. We're now gaining some external recognition for our progress. For example, we were named the #1 bank in the U.S. in terms of customer experience by Temkin. We also were ranked the Best Bank by Global Finance magazine in the Northeast and in the Great Lakes regions. There's certainly more work to do, but we're making good progress, and we're poised for a strong 2018. We have a good plan. We have a good leadership team. It's executing well across the board, and we have an engaged and motivated colleague base.","So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods, who will take you through the numbers in more detail, and provide you with some color. John?","John Woods","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our first quarter results on Page 4. We continue to execute well and are off to a good start to the year. We generated net income to common shareholders of $381 million, diluted EPS of $0.78 and ROTCE of 11.7%. Last year's first quarter and fourth quarter reported results are impacted by notable items largely related to tax matters. So to make it easier to see underlying trends, let's turn to Page 5, and we will focus on our underlying results that exclude these items.","Year-on-year growth in Q1 was very strong as we grew net income to common shareholders by 31% and EPS by 37%. This reflects our continued focus on driving positive operating leverage, which came in above 2%, along with favorable credit costs and a lower tax rate due to tax reform. Strong net interest income and a continued focus on expense discipline helped deliver an efficiency ratio improvement of 125 basis points to 60.4%. ","We also see the impact of our disciplined risk management on our credit quality metrics as we continue to drive improvement in the mix of the portfolio overall. Provision expense came in at $78 million for the quarter, which was a little lower than expected despite an $8 million build in the reserve. Nonperforming loans remained relatively stable at 78 basis points of loans.","We continue to actively manage our capital base, returning $283 million of capital to shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. Tangible book value per share increased 5% year-over-year to $27.24, and our CET1 ratio was a robust 11.2%. ","Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on Page 6. We delivered attractive and disciplined balance sheet growth, which helped drive a 1% linked-quarter increase in NII in spite of the impact from day count. We've benefited from the earlier-than-anticipated move in 1-month LIBOR this quarter and a relatively steeper yield curve overall for much of the quarter. As a reminder, approximately 75% of our sensitivity is associated with the short end of the curve.","Linked quarter net interest margin increased 8 basis points, reflecting improving earning asset yields, given higher rates, and improved mix, which drove a 16 basis point improvement. This was partially offset by an 8 basis point impact from higher funding costs. Year-over-year, net interest margin improved 20 basis points, reflecting a 42 basis point benefit from earning assets, partially offset by a 22 basis point impact from funding costs.","Our margin performance continues to benefit from our balance sheet optimization efforts, which again drove about 1\/3 of our year-over-year NIM improvement. We also continue to be well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with our asset sensitivity relatively stable at 5%. ","Turning to fees on Page 7. On an underlying basis, non-interest income decreased 4% linked quarter, reflecting an expected seasonal decline in service charges as well as a reduction in mortgage banking fees and trust and investment services fees, largely related to the impact of long-term rates on product demand. In mortgage, our originations were down about 19%, in line with overall industry headwinds, given rates and a shift away from refi volume.","We're making investments to grow our MSR portfolio and to shift production towards more conforming volume. In wealth, investments in the business are helping to drive improvement in the mix of our fee-based sales, which came in at 42% this quarter. However, we saw a reduction in transaction fees from strong fourth quarter levels, which was paced by strength in fixed-rate annuity sales.","Capital Markets fees declined modestly from fourth quarter and first quarter, as there was a market fall-off in Middle Markets-indicated transactions. As a partial offset, we did see a pickup in debt and equity Capital Markets activity, which benefited underwriting fees. ","Our Capital Markets pipeline's very robust heading into the second quarter, including several deals that were originally targeted for the first quarter. Overall, the pipelines have improved significantly since the start of the year.","Turning to expenses on Page 8. On an underlying basis, expenses were up 3% linked quarter, reflecting seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits. Outside services were seasonally lower, and other operating expenses reflect lower insurance and pension costs. Year-on-year, our expenses were up 3% on an underlying basis, as salaries and benefits expense was higher, reflecting annual merit increases, increased stock-based compensation costs, revenue-based incentives and the impact of strategic growth initiatives. We also saw an increase in outside services costs tied to our consumer strategic growth initiatives. ","We continue to remain disciplined on the expense front as we identify opportunities to streamline our operations and organization to find efficiencies. This allows us to self-fund our growth initiatives and enhance our capabilities to serve customers.","Let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On Page 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet while expanding our NIM. Total average and spot loans were up 1% on a linked-quarter basis and 3% year-over-year, with core loan growth rates slightly higher. We grew the average core retail portfolio 5% year-over-year, with expansion in residential mortgages and higher risk-adjusted return categories like education, which is largely tied to our refinance product, as well as nice traction in other unsecured retail loans, driven by our merchant finance -- financing partnerships and our personal unsecured product. This growth was partially offset by planned reductions in the auto portfolio and run-off in home equity, given high levels of payoffs in line with industry trends.","On a spot basis, core retail loans were up 4% year-over-year and relatively stable linked quarter given the auto and home equity trends. Average core commercial portfolio growth of 2% year-over-year reflects strong momentum from our geographic expansion strategies, Private Equity, Industry Verticals and Commercial Real Estate. On a spot to basis, the commercial core loan growth came in at 3% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Growth was impacted by the sale of about $190 million of commercial loans late in the first quarter as part of a strategy to source, underwrite and distribute leverage loans as well as some softer results in small business lending.","We expect to deliver stronger loan growth in the second quarter. This reflects the strong Q1 spot growth in commercial banking and overall strength in their lending pipelines, which are up over 35% from the beginning of the year through mid-April. Additionally, in retail, we expect particular strength in education finance, given higher seasonal volume and our continued investment in the space as well as the renewal of our flow agreement with SoFi for high FICO score loans.","On Page 10, looking at the funding side, we saw a 6.5 basis point sequential quarter increase in our cost of deposits, reflecting the impact of higher rates and spot deposit growth of 1%, partially offset by progress on our initiatives to control deposit costs. We continue to fund attractive balance sheet growth at accretive risk-adjusted returns.","Our overall funding costs were up 9 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our cost of funds was up 25 basis points, reflecting deposit cost increases of 20 basis points as well as the structural shift to more long-term borrowings, including our $750 million senior debt issuance near the end of the first quarter. Year-on-year, spot and average deposit growth was 3%. Note that while funding costs were up 25 basis points, overall asset yield expansion was 43 basis points.","Our deposit betas remain in line with our overall expectations given where we are in the rate cycle. We did see our betas tick up a little, which is what you would expect to see in a quarter following a Fed hike, but we are right on our expected glide path. Our cumulative beta on interest-bearing deposits is in the mid-20s. We've seen some increased competition for deposits, but for the most part, deposit costs have been well behaved. We are continuing to invest in analytics and improve our targeting through digital and direct mail offerings on the consumer side, and we're continuing to migrate away from our historical approach to promotional pricing.","In commercial, we are making investments to build out additional product capabilities and roll out our new cash management platform early next year. We feel good about our ability to execute against our optimization strategies and drive greater efficiency and deposit gathering.","Next, let's move to Page 11 and cover credit. Overall credit quality remains strong, reflecting the ongoing mix shift towards high-quality, lower-risk retail loans and a relatively clean position in the commercial book. The nonperforming loan ratio improved slightly to 78 basis points of loans linked quarter, while improving 19 basis points year-over-year.","The net charge-off rate improved to 26 basis points from 28 basis points in the fourth quarter, given seasonal impacts. Our commercial charge-offs were very low again this quarter, and retail net charge-offs were $3 million lower than the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonality in auto and education. Provision for credit losses of $78 million was $8 million above charge-offs. Despite this reserve build, the provision was down $5 million compared to the fourth quarter and down $18 million versus a year ago, reflecting improvement in overall credit quality.","On Page 12, you can see that we continue to maintain robust capital and liquidity positions. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.2%. This quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares and, including dividends, returned $283 million to common shareholders.","On Page 13, we have provided color on how we are progressing against our strategic initiatives. We've changed this slide a little in order to highlight some of the progress we are making against our efforts to optimize the balance sheet, investments in our fee-generating capabilities and our top program revenue and efficiency initiatives. We also wanted to highlight some interesting things that are going on in the businesses. Overall, we are executing well in our TOP IV program, which is on track to deliver $95 million to $110 million of pretax run rate benefit by the end of 2018. The TOP programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to self-fund investments, to improve our platforms and product offerings, while achieving profitability goals. We are already looking at opportunities to find further efficiencies in the future by expanding the work we are doing around customer journeys, lean process improvements and agile ways of working to more areas of the bank. I can tell you that we are constantly challenging ourselves to do better, and we have plenty of wood left to chop in the efficiency area. ","Let's turn to our second quarter outlook on Page 14. We expect average loan growth to come in at about 1.5%, and we expect NIM to be up modestly in the quarter. In noninterest income, we are expecting to see a mid-single-digit pickup from seasonally lower first quarter levels. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the second quarter with positive operating leverage and with efficiency improving. We expect the credit environment to continue to be relatively benign, and that provision expense will push a little higher into the $80 million to $90 million range.","On the tax rate, we came in a little lower than expected for the first quarter, given a change in timing on certain tax items that moved to Q2 from Q1. For the second quarter, we are expecting our effective tax rate to come in at about 23%. ","To sum up, on Page 15, we feel like we've delivered solid results in Q1. We feel our balance sheet across capital, liquidity and credit position remains robust. We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2018 and look to drive more TOP and BSO program benefits.","We are also driving innovation across the bank and investing heavily in technology, our digital platform and customer journeys, which positions us well as we work towards becoming a top-performing bank. We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2018 and look to drive more TOP and BSO program benefits. We are also driving innovation across the bank and investing heavily in technology, our digital platform and customer journeys. And lastly, we are positive about our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of the year. And we reiterate broad full year 2018 guidance, although we expect we'd be better than the guidance range on credit. ","With that, let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Thanks, John. Kevin, I think we can open it up for Q&A now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the fee revenues. We're seeing it in some other banks as well, but just kind of some softness across a number of categories. And you were pretty clear about Capital Markets pipeline being strong and bouncing nicely in 2Q, but just some of the other categories were also a little bit soft, and I'm wondering kind of what that says about just the underlying activity among the customer base and maybe why that is the case.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. Why don't I start, and then we can pass it around here for color? But, Matt, I would say probably the disappointments in Q1, really Capital Markets, where we saw, I'd say, a number of transactions push from Q1 to Q2. We, I think, had seasonal slowness at the start of the year, and things seemed to pick up nicely in March, although, as I said, didn't get everything done. So that bodes well for, I'd say, a quite positive outlook in Q2 in Capital Markets. The other area that I'd call out is the mortgage business, where I think there was just general market softness. There's a shift away from refi. Some rates have gone up. And so it was just a tougher quarter than we expected in the mortgage base. Most of the other lines, I would say, were really just impacted by seasonality. We get an extra day in Q2. We get some seasonal benefit. Service charges and fees is always up. There's -- so there's things that we anticipate when we give the guidance for Q2 that we have pretty good visibility into. So John, I don't know if you want to add to that.","John Woods","No, I think that's right. I mean, I think you're seeing -- as we get to the end of the quarter, we mentioned that pipeline's looking much better in Capital Markets as we get into the second quarter. A little bit of seasonality on -- in the IRP space. And as you mentioned, in mortgage, although it was a down quarter, we're seeing some improvement in our conforming mix. So that will bode well going forward as well.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, okay.","Matthew O'Connor","That's helpful. And then just separately, if we look at the deposits, the noninterest-bearing demand deposits continue to grow year-over-year. Obviously, there's just some seasonality linked quarter, but you're still growing those year-over-year. Some of the bigger banks are seeing outflows, and I'm just wondering if you could talk about maybe how your mix is a little bit different. Or do you think it's more granular in terms of why you're still able to grow the free deposits in this higher rate environment?","Bruce Van Saun","John, why don't you start, and then, Brad, offer some color?","John Woods","Yes. I think that's right. I mean, we did see that we've been investing a lot in this over the last couple of years, as you know. And on the deposit, I think this is a reflection of our deposit initiatives starting to take hold. On the consumer side, we're seeing some traction. We're -- we've been investing in data and analytics. We're improving our targeting and promotional efficiency, and that's starting to play itself out. We've revised our promotional approach to attract more stable deposits at attractive rates. And the emphasis is basically shifting from rate-led to more of a moderating on rate and starting to close the gap a little bit on marketing. We've been extending the duration and targeting direct mail and move mass promos. So that's nice to see on the consumer side. And similar themes on the commercial side where we've been making ongoing investments in our product offerings and targeting certain segments, where deposits are more likely to be able to be driven versus others. So yes, we're pleased to see that improvement, and those investments will continue.","Brad Conner","Yes. John, I think you hit it. I think the big thing for us has been the improvement in analytics and targeted offerings. The other area that you didn't touch on, and we've signaled this for several quarters in a row now, is our focus on our Mass Affluent and Affluent customer base and redesigning the value proposition and the product set for that. So we relaunched a whole new value proposition. Our Platinum product suite, I guess, about a year ago, we just think we're getting good traction from that in investment and analytics.","Bruce Van Saun","And some of the interest rates are coming with that initiatives.","Brad Conner","Exactly, exactly.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe, Morgan Stanley.","Kenneth Zerbe","If we have [indiscernible]","Ellen Taylor","Ken?","John Woods","Ken, we're having a little trouble hearing you, Ken.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, you're on a bad line. Ken, you're on a bad line.","Kenneth Zerbe","Is this better?","John Woods","A little bit.","Ellen Taylor","A little bit.","Kenneth Zerbe","Okay. Sorry. Hopefully, this will be clear.","Bruce Van Saun","That's good. Now you're good.","Kenneth Zerbe","Okay. If we do get SIFI reform, because you're no longer subject to CCAR, can you just talk about how you think about accelerating capital return? Has your thinking changed at all over the last several months or quarters?","Bruce Van Saun","I'd say we're probably more optimistic that we can maybe move down our glide path a little faster overall. But generally, I think we've been measured in terms of bringing the capital down. I think as a relatively new public company with not a very long track record that that's a sensible approach. We're thinking 40 basis points, maybe 50 basis points this year was the target we set out at the beginning of the year. As you know, last year, we stated 11.2%. We were trying to get down to the 10.7% to 10.9% range. But because we overshot and did better than our budget, and we also had the benefit of tax reform on our DTL, we ended up with earnings that we couldn't return to shareholders given the way CCAR works. So one of the things that we're actually excited about is the de-designation, and then also the new proposal for the stress capital buffer, which I think gives more flexibility back into the hands of the banks. ","And so you have guardrails about where you need to operate. But then you also, if you have situations like we had, where you're outperforming and making extra income, you can potentially return that to shareholder as the year -- as you're in the middle of the year as opposed to waiting for the next cycle, which is a real benefit. Or if you were anticipating you were going to get 6% loan growth, and it turns then to be 4%, then you can do something with that extra capital that's piling up. So anyway, I'd say, in general, we feel more positive, but I think we'll continue to be measured, and we'll just bring this down. And as I said in the past, there's no reason that we need to be above the median of our peers. Our stressed credit losses are actually slightly below the medium. And so over time, I think we can certainly provide it right into where the median of our peers are.","Kenneth Zerbe","All right, great. And then separately, with your NIM guidance, can you just help reconcile the 5% asset sensitivity that you guys mentioned versus the guidance that NIM should be up only modesty in second quarter given the rate -- the recent March rate hike? Like what are the pluses and minuses there that would limit the NIM expansion?","John Woods","Yes. I'll go and take that. Thanks. And you know what? I think you should know that, as we mentioned, the NIM performance in the first quarter, we did have an earlier 1-month LIBOR benefit. So that was up maybe about 9 basis points on average. And by March, a 1-month LIBOR was 20 basis points higher than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. And so we're not planning on that recurring. So that would be one item that I would highlight in terms of the second quarter. Also, we mentioned that there was a big increase in the long end in the first quarter, which had an impact on our premium amortization in our securities book, which was slowed down as a result of that movement, and you wouldn't necessarily plan on seeing that happening again in the second quarter. Lastly, I'd highlight the fact that the full quarter of mix shift in our funding, where we did a senior unsecured issuance at the end of the first quarter, and you'll see the full quarter effect of that in the second quarter. So those are some of the takes. But nevertheless, even with all of that, we're still expecting that NIM will expand. And that's given by our ongoing asset sensitivity, driven by the fact that loan yields are expected to be up again and up very nicely with good solid loan beta offsetting our deposit beta in the second quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter, Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","I was curious about the guidance for net interest income for the full year. Last quarter, you said it was 7% to 9%. It does seem like the margin is coming in better than what you expected for the full year, and you're getting that rebound in loan growth. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the guidance for the full year on net interest income.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. What I would say, Peter, we're just broadly saying that we hold to what we said. I think you could go down each of the major income categories, and we haven't been specific on that. But given trends, certainly net interest income is pushing out to the upper side of the bounds with the NIM performance. And I still think that we'll see a decent level of loan growth over the course of the year. And then kind of when you go down, I still think we can hit the range for fee growth. And the expense growth is tracking to be in the range. And the one thing that John called out is that I think given the first quarter result and the guide for second quarter on credit that we're likely to be certainly below the range we set on credit. So that's a little more color for you. But where we really try to focus our comments on these quarterly calls is the upcoming quarter and not get into reforecasting explicitly that full year guidance. But we're certainly comfortable with the numbers we've put out there for the full year back in January.","Peter Winter","Okay. And just a follow-up. Is there any update you can give on your Apple partnership, and\/or -- and also just the personal unsecured lending and how that's going?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I'll just start, and I'd say that our view is that we have a very strong relationship with Apple, that's centered around our shared focus on customer experience, and we would continue to see growth in the relationship. And then secondly, on the personal unsecured product, we've really launched that with a vengeance maybe 18 months ago, and we've had a tremendous takeup. We're using our data analytics capability to target not only our customers, but also prospective customers. And we're bringing new customers into the bank. And I think that's going exceptionally well, but I'll turn it over to Brad for additional color.","Brad Conner","Yes. Not sure I have a lot more to add, Bruce. On the Apple front, we have a great relationship with Apple, and we've stayed focused on giving them great service. I think we do that, and that's a good relationship. On PERL, we're very pleased with the product. It's performing, credit-wise, the way we expected, good demand for the product. We have stayed in the prime-plus space. So we've stayed at the very, very high end of the market. I think there's opportunity to go in the credit spectrum there. But at this point, we're staying focused on our knits -- sticking to our knitting and staying in a really high credit quality area and feel very good about it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian, Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Just following up on Ken's question, could you give us a sense of -- on your variable rate loans on the asset side, if could you give us a sense of what the short-term benchmarks are? And on the liability side, if your long-term debt is swapped out and, if so, what the underlying benchmark would be.","John Woods","Sure, I'll jump in on that one. So basically, on the floating rate side of things, you have a couple of key benchmarks in the C&I book. It's primarily 1-month LIBOR, although we do have a few million dollars of three-month LIBOR indexed on the commercial side, but generally at the one-month LIBOR book. And when you think about the other big floating books, you've got the home equity portfolio, which is essentially a prime base, Feds funds base book. So that's from the asset side. On the liability side, we do have primarily a floating rate book there. And the -- what we swapped that too, is actually one-month LIBOR and three month LIBOR as well. So there's a mix there with, frankly, the majority of that actually going to 1-month LIBOR. And when you think about what's contractual with respect to three month LIBOR on the asset side and three month LIBOR on the liability side, we've been monitoring that because of what's been going on with three month and 1-month LIBOR over the quarter. We're pretty balanced, at least contractually, with respect to the asset side and the liability side of the three month point on the curve. So let me know if that's responsive to what you were looking for.","Erika Najarian","No, that was very clear. And a follow-up question is, of course, we'll hear more about your new -- about TOP V in July. And given how successful these initiatives have been, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense on how much of TOP V will be revenue-driven rather than expense-driven?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. I'll start. John, you can add color. But I think each year, what we try to focus on is an effort around efficiency and extracting inefficiencies to streamline how we're running the bank. And we'd like that to make up, I'd say, at least 40% of the pot to whatever total number we get to. We also then have always great ideas in terms of how we can serve our customers better and deliver additional products and services or expand into some new adjacencies, we've done, for example, geographically into the Southeast region on the commercial side. So I think there's opportunity there as well. And I'd say what we find heartening here is that we're able to come back and do this year in and year out, which I think sets us apart really from peer banks, who might have a major, major program maybe every 3 years or so. But we've tried to instill this into our culture and our DNA at Citizens that it's our responsibility to come up with these ideas about how we're going to run the bank better and do more for our customers and do more for our shareholders. So John, maybe you could add some additional thoughts?","John Woods","Yes. Just maybe a bigger picture when you think about our targets for ROTCE progression over the medium term that we talked about last quarter. We've built in that there would be, on the expense side, something on the order of 60 basis points over that period of increasing our ROTCE. And if you triangulate that back to our expense base, that comes in somewhere between 1% and 2% of our expense base in savings each year coming out of TOP. So that's been an incredibly important part of how we're driving expense saves. So we'll continue to do that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez, UBS.","Saul Martinez","On asset quality, the $425 million to $475 million, keeping that obviously implied a pretty big ramp-up, and you mentioned that there's a high probability of being below that range. But I guess, a couple fold question. One, why not just change the guidance? But maybe more importantly, just as you look across the different parts of your portfolio, obviously, credit has been remarkably good, but are there any areas that either you're concerned about or that you're watching a little bit more closely as being a little bit more vulnerable to a normalization credit?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. So I guess, to my earlier answer, we don't want to be in the habit of updating our full year guidance quarter in and quarter out, so which is why we're using those broadly comfortable. But I think the beat on credit is materially enough outside of that initial range that I think we needed to call that out. So that's the answer to the first part of your question. On the second part of your question, I'd say, certainly on the consumer side, there's nothing in terms of delinquencies or roll rates that gives us pause. So I think we're going to have a very good clean year on consumer credit. And again, on the commercial side, we have a net recovery position, which is pretty fantastic. But again, when you look at what we have in NPLs, what we have in criticized assets, we're in very good shape there as well. So you're likely, over time, to take a hit here or there. Maybe you have a recovery that allows you to offset it on the commercial side, but we could see that migrate up a little bit over the course of the year. Specific portfolios, they all look in pretty good shape. Energy's certainly in great shape. We're keeping our eye in the franchise world on some of the casual dining segment, but that's relatively modest, and I think that will behave okay. But anyway, I'd say those would be the areas I would highlight. John, anything you'd want to add?","John Woods","No. I would just -- just to add to the point on the consumer delinquencies. Even the 30- to 90-day delinquencies quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year are down. So we're just seeing good trends there and wholesale credit quality hanging in there very nicely with net recoveries. So that's really the story.","Brad Conner","No, I think I agree with that on the wholesale side. The things we're struggling with are generally idiosyncratic and not that large. So we feel very good about where we are.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, good.","Saul Martinez","That's helpful. Just on deposit competition, you mentioned the deposit pricing. You mentioned cumulative betas around, I think, mid-20s, but can you just give a little bit more granularity across the different businesses, retail, commercial, wealth, where you're at, what's the dynamic, and also where you feel betas are maybe relative to where terminal beta could be for each of those segments?","John Woods","Yes. I'll tell you what, we'll talk about the terminal betas maybe top of the house. We don't -- haven't necessarily gotten into where it would be across each individual segment. But in terms of within consumer, you'll see terminal betas that are lower than commercial, of course. But overall, we've mentioned that through the cycle, we would be at approximately 60% cumulative beta over the entire tightening cycle, which we tend to think about at approximately a 300 basis point or so Fed funds number. When you break that down, as I mentioned, consumer on the lower end, commercial on the higher end, within consumer, we are breaking that down a little bit further. When you look at the core consumer in the retail space as well as even when you get up into Mass Affluent, we're seeing betas being pretty well behaved in the low single-digit range. It's when you get into the wealth sectors that things start to get a bit higher, and those betas get up into the high 20s and the low 30s. But overall, still very solid single-digit betas cumulatively through the first quarter in the consumer side. Now on the commercial side, you'll see cumulative betas that are maybe a bit higher than that and maybe up into the 30s or so, and that gives us the overall cumulative beta in the mid-20s. So let me see if that's responsive, and if there's any follow-ups.","Saul Martinez","No, no. That's helpful. So if I think about the 60% cumulative beta, obviously, commercial's going to be above that, and the other retails are going to serve both of those?","John Woods","Yes, yes. Commercial is 70% to 75%. Let's call it, cumulative, in apples-to-apples relates, that's 60%, and for consumer maybe 35% to 40% to give you something to anchor to with respect to the 60%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja, JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Bruce, a question for you. I heard a question on capital return overall. I just wanted to talk to you about dividend payout. Where do you see that going? I know you've had good increases, but obviously, you're still well below peers. And recognizing, yes, you're still relatively in your infancy after the IPO, but what are you thinking since the Fed has now said the 30% line has also been removed, and your peers are talking about 40% type getting to those levels?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. No, I think we've said that kind of in the medium term, we were targeting to get back up around 40% or so. And you saw us make 2 moves in the last CCAR cycle, very significant increases. One of the challenges we've had is our earnings have grown so quickly that you end up actually lagging where you'd like to be in terms of your payout ratio. So again, as we get more flexibility under the new kind of Fed proposal, then, potentially, we could accelerate as we're growing our earnings. If we are exceeding our estimates we've set out at the beginning of the year, potentially we could move -- be more responsive and move that dividend up quicker. But again, I think bank stock should trade with a healthy yield. We understand that. I think we, currently, with our capital surplus, can have our cake and eat it, too. We can continue to have nice loan growth and support the organic needs of the business, and certainly return shareholder capital at a good clip. And the dividend would be the top of our list in terms of what we want to do for shareholders.","Vivek Juneja","Question for Don, since I heard him on the line. Don, any color on sort of what's giving you the confidence that some of the slowdown we saw in Capital Markets activity in Q1 should start to dissipate soon? What are you seeing that's giving you -- in terms of timing, and that it actually should start to pick up?","Donald McCree","I'll repeat what Bruce said, is we started the year with pretty weak pipelines actually. And literally, since early February, we've just seen them build and build and build and build. So the activity levels on the teams are quite strong right now. We're seeing it flow through already on the fees that we're printing for the quarter. So we're confident in both our client's desire to transact, given the environment and the tax rate and general growth that people are seeing. Sponsors are quite active right now, and we're seeing it in our pipelines.","Bruce Van Saun","I would say also, Vivek, that we would expect to see M&A pick up as the year goes by. And we feel it's fortuitous or maybe we were good, but doing the acquisition of Western Reserve last year gave us the capability that we can now really serve those Middle Market companies that are looking to use acquisitions as part of their growth strategy.","Donald McCree","And when I said, pipelines, I'm talking about M&A also. And I think we're actively adding to our M&A teams because they can't handle the business that they have in-house right now. So it's quite strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marlin Mosby, Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","A very detailed question, but we have heard a lot of pressure from the mortgage banking and production side. And some mentioned gain on sales. Sometimes, that's when rates are moving higher. You kind of are repricing fast enough. That's just as kind of a norm that you get a little bit of squeeze temporarily. Is this more pricing or rate-related in the sense of maybe gain on sale of margins going down a little bit this quarter?","John Woods","Yes. I think it's more a function of as volume comes down with higher rates, the industry is trying to fill up the capacity that you have the excess capacity you have available, and you see a squeeze on margins. So I think it's just a normal market volatility -- a normal market activity as people are trying to fill up the capacity they have.","Marlin Mosby","Got it. And then when we think about -- your capital ratios have been relatively flat. As you now move into the next phase with more flexibility on returning this capital, do you envision meaningfully kind of bringing that number down? And do you have kind of a target you'd like to get to in the next couple of years?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. So the flexibility actually comes down the road. So it's not really here yet in terms of the CCAR cycle. So I think we gave guidance for this year that we'd like to bring our capital ratio down towards the 10.7%, 10.8% if you look at our full year guidance. We also set out our medium-term targets, which we said we'd like to bring it down to 10% to 10.25% when we set out those targets. So you could see us at 11.2%, bring it down 40 basis points, and then do that again, and then continue to chisel it. And it may be the case that the median moves lower, and that there's opportunities for us to move below that range. But that's the kind of flag that we've planted at this point in our planning process.","John Woods","Yes. Maybe just to add on top of that, I think Bruce is right. I mean, that flexibility point that we're very pleased and supportive of is really an NPR, and we're working our way through that process with the Fed. And if all goes as originally indicated, this would be a CCAR 2019 cycle that -- where the flexibility would come later in '19 and into '20. We're supportive of it, taking away the soft cap on dividends and addressing some of the concerns from the industry around balance sheet growth. That's all very positive. Lots more questions to be asked in the NPR, but the flexibility will come later, as Bruce indicated.","Marlin Mosby","And it's positive in the sense that you have so much earnings growth right now with the tax benefit and just the organic growth that payout ratios are going to be up '19, '20. That keeps the momentum into the last two years -- or that next two years after we get the top-end earnings really creating a lot to give back this year.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us -- you had some, as you've pointed out, some nice growth in your demand deposit accounts, which some of your peers haven't really seen. And when you look at that, could you share what percentage of your consumer customers have checking accounts, where there's no fees associated with them because either they keep a higher balance or there's a special product that they're using that doesn't charge them fees?","John Woods","To give you a percentage that don't have fees, I, unfortunately, don't have that in front of me. I will tell you, our core checking products or our -- sort of our baseline checking product is something we call, One Deposit, which is they have the ability to waive your monthly service charges just by making a single deposit every month. So the majority of those customers do not incur a fee. But in terms on an overall percentage, I don't have that available.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then, Bruce, obviously, as you've pointed out, you're relatively new. As a publicly-traded company, you have very strong capital. Of course, you've got a glide path to give it back to shareholders. Another angle would be, of course, to do acquisitions. Could you just give us your views on what you see on the merger landscape for other depositaries over the next, let's call it, 12 to 24 months?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I think, Gerard, we've been pretty clear that where we're focused in terms of looking for acquisitions would be really in the fee space. So it would be adding to our capabilities, as I'd like to say, getting a little farther down the track faster in areas in the commercial side and Capital Markets or on the consumer side and wealth or in mortgage MSRs, for example. So those have been the areas that we have interest. And we've had dialogue, and I think we'll eventually do some more things this year, much like we did the Western Reserve M&A boutique last year. So I think they'll be of probably modest size because we have a lot of organic growth. So we want to stay focused on executing our plan, but then supplement that with things that we can easily plug and play. The other area that I think we're focused has been on the fintech space. And so we have about half a dozen relationships currently with various fintech partners, and some really great stuff, our specified digital wealth offering, our business banking loan origination and fulfillment platform that we have with Fundation, just to name a couple. But I think our intent is out, and we probably could add a handful of additional ones also this year. So when it comes to straight depositaries, that's really not on our shopping lists, and you won't see us looking to do that in 2018.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Pancari, Evercore.","John Pancari","You have mentioned the better loan beta, where you're trending right now. How much of that is the pricing environment? I mean, we're hearing that it's certainly not terribly accommodative right now, and that there's some spread compression a lot of your peers are dealing with. And then, therefore, how much of that is also just your structure, and that you've got a fair amount of portfolios that you're still sub-scaling, but are higher yielding and you're growing there, so the remix is helping your loan yield?","John Woods","Yes. I'll go ahead and hit that. I mean, loan yield's up 14 basis points in the quarter, and you think about converting that into a beta. I mean, that's really driven by our floating fix mix. And we're basically about 52% or so, as I recall, the percentage, swap adjusted floating loans versus approximately 48% on the fix side. So that's the big driver in loan betas. And you heard a little bit earlier the indices that we're exposed to, that the indices are going to be primarily 1-month LIBOR and Fed funds in terms of driving that beta on the loan side. And you could think about that beta cumulatively being around 60% or so. When you think about a much higher beta on the commercial side, say, call it in the 80s, being offset by more of the term lending that sits on the consumer book. So I think that's how you should think about our loan betas on that side.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then, actually, on that front, the new money loan yields, where you're bringing on new production, do you have that for commercial versus consumer?","John Woods","Yes. I mean, so I would say overall, on the commercial side, new monies coming in, call it, 25 basis points or so over runoff money. And then on the consumer side, basically every book, new money coming in, in a healthy way over runoff, with maybe the possible exception to mortgage, where you've got the negative or the convexed aspects of that kind of portfolio, where you see the bias towards refinancing the higher rate stuff. So I think that's a natural industry-related phenomenon. But basically, across the board, when you run the table across consumer and commercial, we're in a situation where our new front book is accretive versus our runoff. And that's providing upward lift as well, and will continue into the second quarter.","Bruce Van Saun","And that extends, John, to the securities books as well.","John Woods","Absolutely, yes. On the security side, our runoff is about $250 million. Our reinvestment is about $320 million on the securities side.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","John Pancari","Got it. That's helpful. One separate thing on the expense side. I know you indicated a couple of times that you continue to invest heavily in IT. Can you remind us of the size of your IT budget? I believe you have previously indicated about $195 million in CapEx. I'm just wondering what the overall IT budget would be in terms of the...","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, John, we went through a period probably from 2010 to 2016 or probably 6 years there. We've had it up around $250 million. We've pulled it back a bit last year to the $195 million. As you said, I think we needed to pause and digest some of the things that we've put in place. But this year, I'd say we're probably in a $225 million, $235 million ZIP Code. And the nice thing that I'd say about that is it's really moving and pivoting towards offense. So much of that spend now is directed at how do we serve customers better, how do we digitize, how do we use data. And so I think there's an unlimited appetite that folks have inside the company. And I remind folks, Rome's not built in a day. We have to pace ourselves. But I think we're really spending much more on offense, and the results are showing by you can see the awards we're picking up for customer experience or best bank. I think it's really great to see.","John Woods","Maybe just add to that just briefly. So because of the way accounting works, and there's some capital budgets, and across peers, sometimes, it's hard to normalize apples-on-apples. But some of the industry materials that we've been able to get our hands on would indicate that maybe in the neighborhood of 8% of revenues is about where our peers are coming out. And you would see us on an apples-to-apples basis being around 10% of revenues. When you consider our capital expenditures, plus some of the things that get expensed and the other support from an IT perspective of the businesses on a customer-facing standpoint. So when you think about it like that, we feel like we're in line or in pace with the industry or maybe a little better.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin, Jefferies.","Ellen Taylor","Ken? Maybe we lost him.","Bruce Van Saun","Ken? Maybe his question got answered or -- okay. Next? Is there anyone else, Kevin?","Operator","No. At this time, we have no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn things back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks. Please go ahead.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, great. So thanks, everyone, again for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and your support. We're off to a really good start. I think we maintained a positive outlook for 2018, and also for another year of strong progress for Citizens Bank. So thanks, and have a good day.","Operator","Now that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Brad and I\u2019ll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today on Citizens\u2019 earnings call. We\u2019ll start with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Fawcett reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results and then we\u2019ll open the call up for questions. Joining us as well is Head of Consumer Banking, Brad Conner.","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that in addition to today\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve also provided presentation and financial supplement. All three are available on our Investor Relations Web site on citizensbank.com. During the call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K files containing our earnings release and quarterly supplements.","Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, may also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site.","And with no further ado, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, well thanks Ellen and good morning, everyone. Thanks for dialing-in today. Let me start-off with an overview of 2014 and then I\u2019ll proceed to talk about the fourth quarter. But I\u2019d say overall, we\u2019re very pleased with what we achieved over the past year. Let me just touch on four areas. First is our financial progress, which is very pronounced. Our adjusted ROTCE for the year of 6.1% compares favorably with 5.1% last year. But even more importantly, we have good momentum. If you look at the fourth quarter ROTCE we\u2019re now at 6.8%, close to 7%, that compares with 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The second area I\u2019d comment on is we\u2019re making very good traction on our customer agenda. We\u2019re improving our position on both the consumer side, as well as the commercial side. And this is really how you create long-term franchise value. We\u2019re certainly keeping our eye on that ball.","I\u2019ll give you a few details to back that up. First-off on consumer side, we launched our One Deposit Checking offering, which has reinvigorated checking account growth, that\u2019s up 23% on a year-on-year basis. We also continued to strengthen our customer experience, evidenced by our continuous strong trajectory in the J.D. Power ratings. We\u2019ve also further improved our important online and mobile offerings. For the second year in a row we were awarded the best mobile app by Javelin Research.","Now on the commercial side, our Greenwich Survey scores on relationship managers remain best-in-class in nearly all categories. Our formula is we\u2019ve got great people, we show up with great ideas and we add value to our clients. You can demonstrate the success there by looking at our market share, we continue to gain share. For example, we finished 8th in the National Middle-Market League Table volume, that\u2019s up a place from 9th in 2013.","The third area I\u2019d comment on is we\u2019ve made steady progress in improving our regulatory position. I think we\u2019ve put in a really strong effort on CCAR and have made really demonstrable progress there. We\u2019ll wait and see the results, but I feel very good about the progress that we\u2019ve made. And then also in remediating our issued backlog with the regulators, we\u2019ve had a very strong approach there and I think we\u2019ve made good progress as well. And then lastly, I\u2019d say another aspect to the year is that we delivered on all our milestones and major projects. So, whether it be the IPO, the sale at Chicago region, our overall expense initiative called Project Top and then our various other strategic initiatives we\u2019re really executing very well.","And this overall progress reflects well on our people, our colleagues are very engaged, they\u2019re working very hard to make this a better run Bank. And while I mention people, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Robert Matthews who led our commercial business. This is a real tragedy, Robert was a great guy, he had a passion for building a business focused on great customer service, really feel the loss there. But I would say that we\u2019re fortunate to have a strong team behind him. Steve Woods and Bob Rubino, two of Robert\u2019s key deputies are going to provide the interim leadership to make sure that we continue our momentum in that business.","Now turning to the fourth quarter, we delivered a very strong performance demonstrating our ability to execute, as well as our ongoing momentum. Some of the highlights, we had good balance sheet growth and deposit growth which drove 2% sequential growth in net interest income. Our NIM was up slightly versus Q3 at 2.8%. Our underlying fees showed 5 million in growth, if you factor out the swing in MSR. Cap markets in particular had a big fourth quarter. Our expense control remains very solid, credit remains very well behaved and overall I guess one aspect I was very pleased to see was sequential positive operating leverage of 2%. We need that, that feels good to deliver it and it stacks up very well against our peer group.","So we feel that we\u2019re positioned well. We have a very straightforward playbook that we need to execute against. We have good alignment and accountability on that around the management team. Most of our initiatives are tracking okay. Loan growth is broadly at our target, 7.6 billion for the year. Our hiring is largely on-track and expense initiatives on that score we\u2019re delivering against all our milestones. We\u2019ve got 28% in the run rate at year-end which is a little bit better than we had anticipated.","Now the outlook for 2015 calls for continued progress in executing our plan. There is a few things that we kind of remain intensely focused on. We\u2019ve got to continue to grow the balance sheet and our customer relationships. We need to continue to deliver positive operating leverage and focus on running the Bank more efficiently. And we also expect our favorability and credit trends to continue. I am a bit concerned about rates, given our asset-sensitive position, this could be a headwind that we\u2019ll have to manage through, but we already have some things in motion to contend with that, if we have to. So overall, we expect another very solid year.","And with that, let me hand it off to John to go through a bit more detail on Q4 and 2014, as well as our outlook for 2015. John?","John Fawcett","Thank you, Bruce and good morning everyone. As Bruce indicated we rounded out 2014 with solid fourth quarter results as our underlying business performance continues to strengthen. This is reflected in our improved underlying performance across the business, robust asset quality and capital ratios, and continued momentum in our growth and efficiency initiatives.","I\u2019ll start out by focusing on our financial highlights and I\u2019ll reference selective slides from our deck as I go along.","Turning to Slide 3, our fourth quarter GAAP net income of $197 million was up $80 million or 4% from the third quarter and $45 million or 30% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share were $0.36, up $0.02 from the third quarter and $0.09 higher than fourth quarter of 2013. This was driven by our expense management initiatives, continued gain traction, allowing us to fund investment in the business to drive future asset and revenue growth.","We show our adjusted fourth quarter results on Page 5, which exclude the impact of net restructuring charges and special items associated with the Chicago divestiture, efficiency affect in these programs and the separation from the Royal Bank of Scotland. On an adjusted basis for the quarter, we posted strong operating results with net income of $217 million or earnings of $0.39 per share. This is up 7% from the linked-quarter and 28% from the previous year.","Our adjusted pre-provision profit of $388 million is up 4% relative to 3Q, largely driven by growth in net interest income and positive operating leverage. Furthermore, we experienced a $5 million decrease in our provision for the quarter to $72 million driven by improving credit and lower charge-offs despite continued loan growth. There has been a lot of attention on the impact of the drop in oil prices on the Bank\u2019s loan portfolios, and I am pleased to report that our oil and gas related outstandings account for less than 1% of our total loan portfolio and we are continuing to perform reasonably well.","We continue to make strides towards our goal of 10% return on tangible common equity by the end of 2016. On an adjusted basis, we generated a return on tangible common equity of 6.8% during the fourth quarter, up from 6.2% in the third quarter of 2014 and 5.2% from a year ago. This was driven by two primary items; improvement in our underlying pre-provision profit; and secondly, lower tangible common equity reflecting our objective to realign our capital structure to be more consistent with peers.","Turning to the adjusted full year results on Slide 6, net income was $790 million or $1.42 per share, up 18% from 2013. Underlying revenue growth, disciplined expense management and a 33% decrease in provision expense drove the results.","Diving a little deeper into the results for the quarter, on Slide 7 you will see, we grew net interest income $20 million this quarter, which included the benefit of a $1.5 billion increase in earning asset, and modestly improved asset yields. Our net interest margin this quarter was up by 3 basis points to 280 in comparison to the third quarter. This increase can largely be attributed to higher securities portfolio income related to a portfolio duration extension trade executed at the end of the third quarter, as well as broad-based loan growth. We did see some pressure from the impact of higher borrowing cost as we continued to diversify our funding base. Net interest margin was impacted adversely by increased deposit costs and growth in variable rate commercial loans, as well as lower yielding auto loans.","Slide 8 details non-interest income which remained essentially flat in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, as growth in capital markets fees and other income was offset by lower mortgage banking fees. Excluding the impact of a swing in mortgage servicing rates, which moved from an impairment recovery of $5 million in the third quarter to an impairment charge of $2 million in the fourth quarter, underlying non-interest income was up $5 million sequentially. Year-over-year non-interest income decreased $40 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, largely as a result of a $24 million reduction in securities gains and other income, as well as a $24 million quarterly decrease attributed to the Chicago divestiture.","Moving on to non-interest expenses on Slide 9, with our goal in mind of consistently delivering strong operating leverage, we continue to balance our focus on tightly managing our expense base, with the need to grow the business through targeted organizational and technology investments. As a result, our adjusted operating expenses of $791 million this quarter was relatively stable with the previous quarter, with the benefits of our efficiency initiatives largely offset by investment in the business. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 67%, an improvement of 91 basis points from the third quarter of 2014, and 124 basis points from the same period last year.","Now turning to the consolidated average balance sheet on Slide 10, our total earning assets of $118.7 billion were up 1% from last quarter and 9% from the fourth quarter of 2013 driven by robust growth in both commercial and consumer lending. Growth in our commercial loans has been broad-based with virtually all of our businesses posting solid growth. On the consumer side, our growth initiatives are firmly taking hold, as we\u2019ve increased originations in our auto and student platforms.","Deposits continue to strengthen across virtually all categories, with average deposits in the fourth quarter increasing by $3.1 billion or 3% over the third quarter. Organic growth for 2014 has more than offset the impact of the Chicago divestiture, with period-end deposit growth of $8.8 billion, compared with a divesture impact of $5.2 billion. Fourth quarter period-end total deposits increased 10% compared to December 31, 2013.","On Slide 11, you will see more detail on consumer and commercial loans, where we have continued to perform well despite a persistent low rate environment. Compared to the previous quarter, consumer loans increased $1.6 billion largely due to growth in auto, mortgage and student loans. Yields are up 1 basis point reflecting the improved loan mix. Commercial loans increased by $1.1 billion driven by mid-corporate commercial real estate, asset finance, healthcare, and franchise finance. Other loans decreased as a result of continued run-off in the non-core portfolio, which decreased $200 million versus the third quarter.","Slide 12 is a more in-depth look at deposits which increased across the board with growth in the money market and savings, interest, checking and DDA categories. Deposit costs increased by 2 basis points in the quarter, driven by a shift in mix to deposits with longer durations.","Turning to Slide 13, our capital position remains robust with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 12.4% which generally exceeds that of our regional peers. We have already met initial LCR requirement of 90% as a modified LCR reporter and our LDR currently sits at a stable 98%. We also returned to the debt capital markets during the fourth quarter and successfully raised $1.5 billion of low cost senior debt in our first public senior offering.","On Slide 14, you can see that our credit quality continues to strengthen with net charge-offs at $80 million. Additionally, our $72 million provision for credit losses was down $5 million, reflecting continued disciplined underlying and overall improvement in credit quality.","Slide 15 is worth a mention. We\u2019ve laid out the key initiatives in our turnaround plan and accessed how we did in 2014, what the market condition was surrounding each initiative in 2014 and what the outlook holds in 2015. The good news is that we\u2019ve executed well across the initiatives in 2014 and expect that to continue. We are very focused on mortgage and wealth growth, along with combating some of the intense competition in the middle-market.","That leads us nicely onto our outlook slide on Page 17. Given it\u2019s a New Year and we\u2019re relatively new public company, we\u2019ve provided a comprehensive view of both our 1Q15 and full year '15 outlook. For full year, we expect 5% to 7% earning asset growth and a relatively stable margin, though the interest rate curve and competitive conditions pose some challenges. We expect adjusted expense growth to be relatively flat with mid single-digit positive operating leverage and our efficiency ratio moving to the mid-60s. We expect provision expense to be in the $350 million to $400 million range as we modestly built reserves, with broadly stable asset quality trends. We expect restructuring costs for the first half of 2015 in the $30 million to $50 million range and we\u2019re projecting our year-end common equity Tier 1 ratio about 11.5% and an LDR of around 100%, with a focus on cost effective deposit growth.","So the headline is that we have delivered well against the plan in 2014 and are focused on doing that again in 2015. We\u2019ve made up for some challenges on revenues with excellent performances on expenses and favorable credit, which should continue.","With that, let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay thanks, John. To sum up, again I think we had a terrific 2014. We\u2019ve taken decisive steps to enhance our business model and improve our performance and our results reflect our steady progress. We\u2019re well-positioned to continue this progress in 2015 and it really all bulks down to execution. Of course a little tailwind from rates and the economies would also be most welcome.","So with that Brad, I think we\u2019re done and we\u2019re ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We\u2019re now ready for the quick Q&A portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Nash","Bruce, just starting-off when I think about reaching the 10% ROTCE by \u201916, I think one of the key components was interest rate rising. I think since that point the forward curve has moved down and it does seem like the likelihood of rates rising at the pace we thought has become a lot lower. So, you talked about having some things in place, can you just give us a sense of what some of those things are, how much room do you think you have on the cost side if rates don\u2019t end up rising?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. If you recall the target of the 10% ROTCE was kind of the run rate as we leave the year in Q4. And when we did the ROTCE walk from 5% to 10% about 1.3% to 1.5% roughly related to that forward yield curve and I think the numbers that translated to was about 300 million of net interest income. That called for a 1.75 fed funds rate at the end of \u201916 based on the forward curve we were using earlier in 2014. My guess is that we\u2019ll have some increases and they\u2019ll probably be maybe a little later than we originally anticipated and it may not go all the way to 1.75 by the end of \u201916. One of the good news aspects though is that, benefit is frontend loaded so as you have the earlier rate rises, you have an ability to lag your deposits and so I think we\u2019ll capture a good percentage of that as long as there is some movement.","In terms of what can we do if it doesn\u2019t -- if we don\u2019t get that full benefit? Clearly what we\u2019ve seen is that credit costs tend to also follow to some extent the path of rates. And so, if rates are a bit lower for longer than the stress on borrowers should be less, therefore we should potentially have some pickup on the credit cost of the equation, which is an unknown but I think it\u2019s logical that that could be the case. And then on expenses, I mean working on the expense base is a way of life of us, so I think we\u2019ve done a really good job to find a program that can deliver 200 in benefit. As you know we\u2019re turning around and reinvesting a bunch of that in originators, and people close to customers we can drive more business volume and in technology, but basically we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in the second half of the year, we\u2019ve kept our expense growth reasonably flat and we\u2019re getting that positive operating leverage.","Is there more? There has to be more I mean I think we\u2019re continuing to go farther up the tree from some of the things that we\u2019ve put in with one of the program, but looking for ways to streamline, how we\u2019re operating, trying to look at our vendor relationships, is there more we can squeeze out of our vendors. We have initiatives in place to keep turning over rocks and see what else that we can deliver.","Brian Nash","And then just on the outlook for the net interest margin, you\u2019re looking stable with some risks. I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us understand some of the puts and takes, I mean clearly the swaps\u2019 rolling off as a benefit, but where are you in terms of loan yields rolling off relative to what\u2019s coming on and are you planning on making any further changes to the duration of the securities book embedded in that guidance and if so what impact would that have on the rate sensitivity of the franchise? Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","I\u2019ll start-off and then maybe John wants to chime in, but just in terms of the puts and takes, yes the positives as you point out having the swaps roll off that continues to create a benefit. Our efforts to try to grow the portfolio in areas that have evidence of little higher risk appetite, not a huge amount but a little in terms of moving for example into the prime space in some of our portfolios particularly auto that should create a bit of additional yield for us in growing commercial real estate and leverage lending books, selectively that should create a bit more yield for us. So, we\u2019re working on ways to try to improve the yield on the portfolio through either risk appetite moves or mix of asset moves. So, those are the things I think that are going to be positive and obviously if we get some rate move that clearly in the second half of \u201915 that clearly would help.","We\u2019ve seen in 2014 one of the headwinds particularly on the commercial book is in this low rate environment we\u2019ve had customers looking to refinance, we can do that. The bigger company is going to the capital markets and then others just refinancing some of their facilities. We saw a fairly good dose of that in Q3, we didn\u2019t see that much of it in Q4, but I think you have to keep your eye on that as we go through the year and if rates continue to stay this low that could pick up again. In reinvesting, the securities portfolio clearly you\u2019ve got a roughly four year duration, which is tightened a bit, given the lower rates and so that might be back down at 3.5 years at this point and so you\u2019ve left with some tough decisions as to whether you want to kind of extend in the current rate environment or you want to keep some powder dry, so we\u2019re certainly working through that and that could potentially be a little bit of headwind, but we\u2019ll have to see. We saw last year rates came down to this level briefly and then promptly motored back to 225 to 240 range, so it\u2019s a little hard to call that one at this point, but that could be a headwind as well. So that\u2019s what I would think are the puts and takes. John I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything.","John Fawcett","I think the only thing I would add and it interferes repeating the point that Bruce made is that 75% of the sensitivity is centered at the very short-end of the curve, three months. And then I think the other thing is, is that clearly the investment portfolio is something that we very closely managed. At the end of the third quarter we did the duration extension trade, which paid some dividends in the fourth quarter, so we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to avail ourselves of that. I think if you look at sensitivity over the course of the year, it\u2019s up to probably the highest point it has been during the year at 6.8% at the end of the year, I think in beginning here we started at 6.2 but it\u2019s always been in that 6.2 to 6.8 range. I think the last point I would make around the investment portfolio is, is that as Bruce said at some point you wonder when you start to drag your feet in terms of reinvestment, thus far we\u2019ve been reinvesting cash flows on a month-to-month basis. But you might expect if rates get down to around 1.75, I mean it\u2019s something we look at a lot more carefully.","Operator","And your next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey John, just one follow-up on the rate comments there. Can you just help us understand then the front-end benefits that you are not building into your flat NIM forecast? So I guess if you could just help us understand what your rate forecast is within your net interest margin guidance and what would your forecast be kind of ex-rates?","John Fawcett","Well, we\u2019re just using a forward curve at the end of December. I mean so, then that\u2019s the forecast. I mean if you look at that it\u2019s where we budgeted the front-end, it\u2019s got rates moving out a little bit more back ended into the fourth quarter as opposed to rates starting to move in the first half of the year.","Bruce Van Saun","In fact I think we have Ken it\u2019s Bruce maybe the fed funds rate the forward curve is about 65 basis points at the end of \u201918. So there is some benefit in that which again provides solidity to the overall outlook. But this kind of lower for longer and kind of some payoffs on the commercial side and some of the reinvestment issues in the first half of the year I think are why you\u2019d still have a broadly stable handle on the overall forecast.","Ken Usdin","And then Bruce second question just on the fee growth parts of the business, your box chart is an interesting one in terms of the outlook. There is a couple of comments in there about greater competition. But I believe if I do the math your outlook is still for a really strong fee growth rate this year. So I was wondering if you can talk this through growth in fee businesses and on overall what you think the business can grow this year?","Bruce Van Saun","And I\u2019ll ask probably Brad to comment on a couple of the initiatives on the consumer side. So you are referring to Slide 15 in our slide deck. And I think the big fee initiatives here we have mortgage is one, wealth is another one on the consumer side, treasury solutions and cap markets are the biggest ones on the commercial side. And I guess also household growth, if we continue to grow households we\u2019ll continue to gain fee income from that. We\u2019ve scored those three to be I\u2019d say just cautiously optimistic. I think we\u2019ve made good traction on all three. On the household growth clearly you\u2019re just contending with the high level of competition in the market and also less foot traffic going through the branches. So the way we go about adding the households and advertising et cetera, just needs to be flexible, I would say. So, we still feel good. We hit our goals in 2014. But I think we\u2019re just being duly cautious there.","On mortgages, similarly I think we hit the bar in terms of the gross hiring we wanted to do, we had attrition a little higher in the first half of the year and that\u2019s come back down nicely in the fourth quarter. One of the interesting things here is if you\u2019re in this refi boomlet that should start to drive higher levels of income coming from the mortgage business both portfolio balance sheet income, as well as fee income. But at the same time, it might be harder to lift some of the mortgage brokers to hit our longer term goal of doubling the size of the sales force because if it\u2019s an active market people are making a good living where they are. So, I think that\u2019s why we have it cautious. We might still have a resounding victory in 2015, but it may slow the pace in terms of actually hiring mortgage loan officers.","And in wealth, I think that you\u2019re just looking at a very competitive market. So, we\u2019re only trying to hire in terms of financial consultants, maybe 20-25 a year. We came in pretty close to that in 2014. But it is kind of hand-to-hand combat in terms of bringing those people in the door. So we\u2019re being a little cautious there, but we still I think overtime if you look over the last three years, we\u2019ve had nice growth there and the market conditions have been conducive I think it\u2019s more on the competition side, but in terms of the backdrop for making money in the wealth business is pretty attractive.","Treasury solutions, on that one we\u2019ve I think hired a great leader, Mike Cummins to run the business for us. We\u2019ve put some money into technology and we\u2019re out trying to get more market share here. Particularly when we leave less transactions we should always get the operating accounts and always get that cross-sell. So I think it\u2019s more of just getting the rhythm and starting to see the benefits from some of the investments that we\u2019ve made. And cap markets as I said we\u2019ve done really-really well in terms of building up a quality operation that can compete with the best of them, gaining market share, of bringing good ideas to our clients and so we feel good about that one. So broadly speaking Ken I think there is good momentum on fees to match the growth in the balance sheet. But there are some areas of caution that we have to stay focused on and really execute well against. I think I have said enough Brad, I hope I didn\u2019t steal your thunder, over to you.","Brad Conner","Well actually I think you did a pretty good job of covering up Bruce. The only think I would probably add from a mortgage perspective and we are off to a very good start in the first quarter. So, mortgage application line is very strong, which I think is probably pretty consistent across the market and it\u2019s allowing us also to have nice margins from a mortgage perspective. So I think we feel good about the progress that we\u2019re seeing early on in mortgage, but as you\u2019ve said that could have an impact on recruiting over the course of the year, but I think you covered it and the most of our hiring initiatives that are on pace, the growth initiatives are in place, it\u2019s just a very competitive marketplace.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","On the bond portfolio editions, just wanted to get some color on what types of securities did you add to the balance sheet and also what yields and what duration was added to the quarter?","Bruce Van Saun","I can start John you can correct me if not 100% hand grip on this one. But for the most part I think we\u2019ve been buying Ginnie Mae securities and in terms of that duration trade that we did the extension of the duration trade. And those were 30 year agency pass throughs. I think the yield on that has been around, let me see John do you have that?","John Fawcett","Yes I mean the extension, 74 basis points of yield pick up between the 30s that we got and the 15 taskers we traded out.","John Pancari","Okay.","John Fawcett","And I guess one of the other benefits of moving into some of this Ginnie has also helped the LCR ratio a bit.","John Pancari","And then are you looking to do more? Did you imply that I think in your earlier comments?","Bruce Van Saun","I think we just have to watch it and we\u2019ll be opportunistic in terms of in this lower rate environment, the overall duration on the portfolio came in from just about four to around 3.5, weighted average life came from 4.7 to about 4.2. And so I think we\u2019ll -- ideally we like to run that duration at about four years, but you have to pick your spots when you go back into the market and put on that extra length.","John Pancari","And then my follow-up is on the loan growth side. Just want to get here a little bit of color around your expectations for loan growth in coming quarters. And it\u2019s good you gave us the earning asset growth expectation, but I wanted to slice out loan growth and get your thoughts there specifically and then potentially by loan type? Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes there it\u2019s I think the loan growth numbers are maybe in the 7% to 8% range and the securities portfolio much lower, maybe 2% or something broadly. So we want to keep the securities portfolio at a set percentage of assets, we got pretty full on that in 2014. So I see a differential between the rate of pace of growth of loans and the securities portfolio. And that\u2019s how you kind of blend it back down to something like 5% to 7%. I think we\u2019d expect to grow in the same areas that we grew this year, so we\u2019ve been able to grow the commercial book probably for five years now in a 7% to 9% targeted range that I think is derived from two things. One is we keep adding people and originators as we build out commercials. So we\u2019ve got more people with more relationships bringing in business. And we\u2019ve also had a pretty healthy market particularly in the middle-market. So I think those things have allowed us to -- and we focused on places where we see real opportunities, in the sectors of the markets that are growing. So a combination to those things I think gives us confidence we can continue to deliver that.","And then in the consumer side, we\u2019ve got we\u2019ve had a nice year in auto, both our own originations plus the relationship we have with SCUSA on flowing in some prime auto paper. I think we have a very solid position in student both on the underlying core product, as well as the new refinanced product we\u2019d expect to see some very good growth there as well. And then again in mortgages as we build up the size of the force, we\u2019ll be retaining more on balance sheet and that will help that growth, that helps to offset I would say a kind of flat or even slightly declining home equity portfolio, which you\u2019re seeing across the industry, but I think we\u2019re okay with that mix shift to more first mortgage on our book and maybe a little less as a percentage of the heat lock. Brad, do you want to add anything?","Brad Conner","You\u2019ve hit it spot on Bruce. I think that\u2019s exactly the right story.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","Can you talk a bit about how much you had to spend on higher regulatory compliance cost and maybe just a cost associated with splitting away from RBS and then how you think those costs trend from here?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure, we gave some disclosure that the one-time regulatory cost associated with CCAR to get really in position when we saw where the bar was, we had some catching up to do, and that was 25 million which is behind us at this point. And then the ongoing run cost to build sustainability is 8 million to 10 million and we\u2019ve got about I\u2019d say two-thirds of that in our run cost, it was important that we hired those resources up during the year, so when some of the consultants who helped us get in position left that we had the knowledge transferred to our own people, and so I think we\u2019ve accomplished that fairly well.","We\u2019ve also had efforts around our kind of issued backlog in terms of making sure we could accelerate the remediation of that and so there were some costs that went along with that and I think whatever we have now is in our run rate and so there won\u2019t be any need to tick that up. In terms of the cost to separate from RBS, I think there is also a fair amount of disclosure in our broad restructuring costs, it runs the gamut of having standalone capabilities and having our own vendor contracts, so there is a few dis-synergies of scale associated with that. We also had to change our branding in terms of moving to a unified Citizens brand without RBS in the name for the commercial side and sun setting the Charter One name and going again fully to Citizens name. Those costs are also kind of detailed in some of our earlier disclosures and they\u2019re running on-track. So we said if there is still about $30 million to $50 million of broad cost to go some of those associated with the cost program, some associated with separation from RBS and the rebranding, but I think by the end of the first half we\u2019ll have all of those kind of separation and the overall program cost sunset and we\u2019ll just be back to reporting nice clean earnings with nothing below the line at that point.","Matthew O'Connor","So the adjusted expense levels that we see should be not materially impacted by either the one-time separation cost obviously or higher rate compliance\u2026?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, those adjusted expenses with the things moved out into below the line restructuring, is probably a good base to work from. As I said the cross trends going on there is we\u2019re investing in playing offence in people and technology, and our costs program overall is creating enough offset that you saw in the second half of the year we were able to keep expenses at a pretty contained level and pretty flat, which if you can get your revenue engine going and you can get some positive momentum on revenues and keep your expenses flat that\u2019s certainly a prescription to drive your ROE higher.","Matthew O'Connor","And then just separately, there was a footnote about your tax rate just on accounting change related to the low income in housing credit I guess this could increase fee revenues and also increase the tax rate, are those offsetting or is there anything...?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, it\u2019s offsetting. So it\u2019s just a tweak guesstimate to your model to put the fee income up by that amount is in the footnote 48 million and then the expense, if you look at the tax line that takes the tax rate up to we're calling it maybe 33.5 for the next year.","Matthew O'Connor","And then lastly if I could just sneak in regarding this portfolio acquisition of I guess it\u2019s oil and gas from RBS, obviously very small numbers I think it\u2019s 200 million or 400 million, but also the 200 million or 400 million I guess the timing as oil prices come down sharply just any color you can add there and is there any recourse given maybe macro-conditions to change there quickly since the purchase\u2026?","Bruce Van Saun","Look, energy is a key sector to plan if you\u2019re going to be a commercial bank, you need to play in the energy space, and as part of separation it was clear that that was RBS turf prior to separation and RBS is rethinking also who they\u2019re banking and the size of companies they want to bank. And so we negotiated to bring that over, I think it always was a more logical business to be done at Citizens than at RBS but they got there first, so we\u2019ve brought that business over we brought a few people over. I\u2019d that trade over 100 times out of a 100 if I had first of all and I could see that oil prices were going to crack I think we\u2019ve done stress, reverse stress testing on this portfolio and you\u2019ve had to have oil prices below, well below where they are below $50 for over five years before you have credit issues in that portfolio. So, I think the advance rate, the hedging on the part of the borrowers is all sound so we\u2019re not worried from a credit standpoint about that portfolio.","Operator","And your next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","I wanted to follow-up on the cost outlook and I guess specifically around your targeted plan for efficiency savings. I think you noted that if that\u2019s you\u2019ll add about 28% of your targeted efficiency savings by the end of 2014, and so if I remember correctly it\u2019s a little bit ahead of your earlier expectation and I guess I\u2019m just asking if that potentially means that you could reach your full run rate on the efficiency savings ahead of your end of 2016 schedule?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I think it\u2019s a marginal ahead so it\u2019s I think 28 John versus 25 or something?","John Fawcett","Yes.","Bruce Van Saun","So it\u2019s a good spot that you\u2019ve noticed that, but I think in the fixed scheme of things we\u2019re broadly on-track. We have built a very solid ability to track all these initiatives and we have people signed up in blood with our name next to each one that they will deliver on anything below and so John\u2019s people monitor this very closely on a monthly basis and that gives us a high degree of confidence that we\u2019re going to hit those numbers.","Matt Burnell","And then just secondly a question on asset quality, you\u2019d mentioned your outlook assumes relatively stable asset quality, but we did notice higher NPLs in the HELOC portfolio which is about 20% of your total loans if I exclude the HELOC service for others. Can you give us a little color as to what is going on in that portfolio and if there could be further NPL pressure in that portfolio specifically?","Bruce Van Saun","Brad, do you want to take that one?","Brad Conner","Yes, I\u2019ll take that one. So Matt, there is a little bit of accounting noise I guess I would say in those NPLs in that about a year ago we had $550 million group of HELOCs that were on non-accrual status that moved into accrual status based on a year of positive performance, so that was actually improving our NPLs as a result of that, that has really run its course. So what you\u2019re seeing now is really just a return to normalization, all of the underlying trends in the home equity portfolio remain on-track, their delinquency levels look good and the portfolio really appears to be strong. So we haven\u2019t seen the underlying fundamental issues for the HELOC portfolio.","Matt Burnell","And then just finally for me John, you mentioned you\u2019re pretty comfortable with where you sit relative to the LCR, can you give us a sense as to what kind of buffer you would think about going forward above the 90% minimum requirement?","John Fawcett","Yes, I mean right, we\u2019re very comfortable with where we\u2019re right now, I mean right now I think we\u2019re at 102 and we have planked it at the end of December and I think we\u2019d be comfortable staying right in that range, I think we want to be comfortably above the 90.","Operator","And your next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Brad for you, the mortgage business because that is one that you\u2019ve been trying to grow where does that headcount in terms of adding mortgage loan offsets that I know last quarter it had slowed a little bit, where do you stand on that one?","Brad Conner","Yes, we\u2019re actually very much right on-track so we added a net of 41 loan officers in the fourth quarter which was our best quarter to-date. We finished the year up a net 67 loan officers so I think our final year in count was 413 which was spot on the guidance that we had been giving, so very good progress there.","Vivek Juneja","And are you being able to get the production with that or is that impacting pricing given the competition?","Brad Conner","Yes, so here is what I would tell you, through 2014 as you know the mortgage business was challenged. The volume across the industry was down from projections and so we were a little bit behind, our hiring was on-track but we were a little bit behind pace in terms of origination volume. But we\u2019ve seen as rates have come down over the last few weeks we are seeing a very strong pipeline building a lot of very good momentum in applications. So, I would say earlier into 2015 we\u2019re a bit ahead of pace.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes I would just add it\u2019s Bruce that, our objectives in building up the mortgage business was really strategic in nature and not tactical. So, when we said about putting together our turnaround plan, we looked at the size and scale of our mortgage business relative to peers and relative to the opportunity that we saw in the marketplace and we had 350 person operation and an origination rank of say maybe 25. And our deposit market share for traditional banks is 12 or 13. And so we said well is there an opportunity to try to get closer to our deposit market and what would it take and does our market support that. And I think the answer to that was all yes and let\u2019s try to double the size over the three year time period and bring that up to 700. And so you end up challenged when you see the conditions we saw in \u201914 is this still the right strategy, should we slow it down, our view is let\u2019s keep our foot on the gas paddle and let\u2019s keep going because we know the mortgage market is ultimately coming back. And the people that are coming in are still covering their nut in terms of being accretive to overall performance. So anyway I think we\u2019re still on pace. I think our outlook for \u201915 is it should be, better than \u201914 and that should create a bit of tailwind in terms of the impact that comes from this hiring that we\u2019ve been able to achieve.","Vivek Juneja","I have another question Bruce which is that the restructuring cost of 30 million to 50 million that you\u2019re expecting in the first half, how much of that would you say is for if you had contracts versus developing, building new business areas as you\u2019ve been looking on both sides?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, the restructuring is only related to either the pull through of our efficiency initiatives or some of the rebranding costs and we\u2019re just kind of giving you an estimate of what that\u2019s going to be and trying to pull that below the line. And as I said it will be sunset by the end of the first half, we will have completed all of that work and all the costs associated with those programs will have been reflected. The benefits of the efficiency program are coming through above the line in our expense base and roughly they\u2019ve been offsetting the increase in ongoing expenses that comes from these hiring initiatives in consumer and commercial and some of our technology initiatives, the key driving and improved overall technology suite. And so that\u2019s been the kind of challenge for us as to we know we got to play offense and we know we need continued investment. But where can we pinch down on expenses and operate more efficiently and effectively so that we can afford that and so that we can deliver the positive operating leverage. And again our outlook if we\u2019re going to deliver the progress we need to stay on-track to get that ROTCE up towards our goal of 10%, we got to do that on a consistent basis. And I am very pleased that the last two quarters we can see that\u2019s coming through in space we\u2019ve kept expenses relatively flat. We\u2019ve been able to grow the balance sheet which drives income growth and so we are getting that positive operating leverage.","Operator","And your next question will come from David Eaves with UBS.","David Eaves","Just I wanted to touch on kind of uptick in the cost of deposits. I was curious how much of that was driven by loan growth and looking to maintain a loan-to-deposit ratio versus looking to kind of lock-in funding in preparation for rates whenever that comes?","John Fawcett","So a bulk of the growth is that actually the term and time deposits. And so for a very long time we\u2019ve been out of this business, I think we grew term and time deposits of about a 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion quarter-on-quarter. And so this is mostly 14% money. And that\u2019s driven -- '14 money so that\u2019s driven a bit of the uptick in costs. And I think strategically I think we\u2019re going to continue to try and manage the loan-to-deposit ratio that\u2019s 98 to 100 and so we\u2019d keep a very close eye on this. Some of this is a little bit of experimenting in terms of price elasticity in particular markets and so far so good.","So we\u2019re pleased with the way we\u2019ve been able to manage the LDR. I think it\u2019s important to go back to one of the challenges we faced and one of the points that I made in my prepared text is, is that when we sold the Chicago franchise we gave up $5.2 billion of deposits against a $1 billion of loans. I think year-on-year we\u2019ve actually grown deposits by 10% and so we\u2019re reigniting this deposit engine and trying to do it with a very thoughtful way. I would expect that as we go forward on a quarter-to-quarter basis you might expect to see our cost of deposits increase 1 to 2 basis points here and there as we meet the need to sensibly fund our loan growth with raising deposits.","Bruce Van Saun","It\u2019s Bruce I would just add that we\u2019ve got to continue to be good at raising cost effective deposits and for a long time for the better part of the last five years we were running off deposits because we were shrinking the balance sheet as part of RBS\u2019 shrink agenda. Now we\u2019re kind of back in the gym getting our muscle back in terms of growing deposits cost effectively, that means getting better at making offers to our existing customers doing marketing to go out and get that and not just relying on rate, but you are right to point out that some of this also is a bit of a tactical shift in terms of securing some longer-term fixed money, when you combine that with the senior debt offering that we did I think we\u2019re positioned now even better for rising rates as John said earlier the sensitivity to the ramp is 6.8, which is up from 6.3 at the end of the third quarter and that really reflects both the types of deposits that we\u2019re bringing in and plus this senior debt issue that we did.","David Eaves","And I guess just kind of following up on that, do you have any update on your sense of where deposit beta\u2019s might shake out and I am just kind of uncertain?","Bruce Van Saun","I think that the beta\u2019s are moving up just a little bit, but I think we kind of have interest bearing deposits at around 60. John?","John Fawcett","Yes, and it\u2019s 60 and it hasn\u2019t changed dramatically from what we\u2019ve presented in analyst presentations and the road shows, it\u2019s pretty stable.","Bruce Van Saun","And total deposit is 48, yes.","John Fawcett","It\u2019s roughly where it was.","David Eaves","And then just lastly on the Slide 15, which was really helpful. Just a quick question on the student loans, I think that you guys indicated the market conditions there are more cautious. I was curious what was driving that and I guess really how much -- if that market environment improves how much faster could the originations grow there?","Brad Conner","I think -- this is Brad, let me clarify the market condition. One of the things that we\u2019re seeing is tremendous demand for our newly launched refinance products. So I think we believe the market conditions will be favorable there and the demand is actually stronger than we had anticipated. What we have seen is the traditional private student loan market fee is still growing, but it\u2019s growing at a slower pace than what we had seen in the prior two to three years. So we indicated that as cautious primarily based on just a bit of slowing of the traditional private student loan market.","Bruce Van Saun","But I think it\u2019s timely Brad that we this refi clearly on the -- and we\u2019re pleased that it\u2019s exceeding our expectations at this time.","Brad Conner","Correct, yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Clarification question, on Page 17 on the provision expense or more specifically credit cost of 350 million to 400 million. Is that all provision expense or does that include some non-provision credit costs?","Bruce Van Saun","I think it\u2019s all.","John Fawcett","Yes, so it\u2019s the numbers that you\u2019ll see on the face of our statement.","Ken Zerbe","Provision expense only?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","John Fawcett","[Indiscernible].","Ken Zerbe","And then the other question is just on CCAR, I know Bruce you\u2019d mentioned that you are making good progress sort of with the check lists going into this year CCAR process. But is there any big areas that you\u2019re still working on that you wish that you would have had complete ahead of the filing for this year\u2019s CCAR?","Bruce Van Saun","Ken I think we made probably as much progress as was humanly possible in this time period and I think the whole process around your governance, your risk appetite, your whole frameworks for assessing risk inside a company is a continuum. And I think you\u2019ll never be fully satisfied because there\u2019ll be new things to think about and new ways to do things. So I think where we got to in terms of that framework is satisfactory from my standpoint here in the company. I hope the feds ultimately agrees with my take on that. But I don\u2019t think really anyone in our peer group can say that they are the finished products that they are the finished article. I think there is tonne of that work to do, with areas to refine and improve in and so we already know the additional work that we have planned for the next cycle and we\u2019re very transparent about that. And I think all things are when they go through that process to say this is an ongoing multi-year effort and we keep making significant progress year in and year out. And I think that\u2019s the way you have to approach it.","Operator","And your next question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Just a quick question on the loan growth, there is quite a bit of acquired growth and that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters clearly the, also an agreement that you\u2019ve got to purchase loans there you have some acquired loan growth in mortgage in 3Q and the loans that you\u2019d acquired in the oil and gas sector and\u2026?","Bruce Van Saun","Geoffrey could you speak up a little bit. I am having trouble hearing you.","Geoffrey Elliott","Sure, so I am saying there has been quite a bit of acquired loan growth in 3Q and 4Q clearly some of that through the auto channel, the mortgage loans you required in the third quarter, the RBS energy loans you acquired in 4Q. Could you just help us by splitting out how much of the growth that we\u2019re seeing come on to the balance sheet as through your own originations versus loans that you\u2019ve acquired?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure, I guess in Q4 you had about 900 of purchased growth in consumer and about 200 in commercial, and I would say from a ongoing basis the resi mortgage purchases were pretty full on that and one of the strategies we had this year was to do those purchases to lead the buildup of our own force, so that we can do our own originations, so as we bring on these loan officers and the market is looking favorable for '15, I think we\u2019ll do very little or much-much-much less in terms of resi purchases.","On the auto side, we said we had a target to do about 500 a quarter, we did about 400 in fact in Q4 through our relationship with SCUSA, and again the effort there is to ultimately bring on more prime paper which gives us a better risk adjusted return profile than what we have in our back book, which is mainly super prime. We\u2019re trying to orienting our own organization capabilities to do more prime and to change that mix and so ultimately I think we\u2019ll sunset some point that relationship with SCUSA when our own capabilities are where we need it to be, but certainly for 2015, we still have this plan and we\u2019re still planning to purchase around 500 million a quarter. And then I think the commercial side, we\u2019ve done very little loan purchasing, this was a pretty unique opportunity for us to pickup that energy portfolio, so I would consider that a one-off.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great, so sounds like about 1.1 billion out of the 2.4 billion of average balanced growth in the quarter it was acquired?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","Operator","And your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Bruce, you were pretty clear on the outlook on the interest rates with the forward curve by the end of 2016 where it may or may not be. In the Slide 17 where you give your 2015 outlook, what do you guys to keep the margin steady as you\u2019re anticipating, where is the fed funds rate has to be by the end of the year under that scenario?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, we\u2019re again using a forward curve view on that and the forward curve right now I think has the fed funds rate at 65 basis points, so there is I think a debate in the market if you will between whether there is one move or whether there is two moves over the course of '15, and that\u2019s currently what we\u2019re looking at. So we\u2019ll see if that happens if rates -- if there was no rate move at all I think there is maybe 40 million to 50 million impact of a flat rate through the end of the year. So that\u2019s a number that we can kind of put a marker next to and work on ways that we can offset that in case it looks less likely that that\u2019s going to happen.","Gerard Cassidy","And referring to the forward curve what\u2019s your guy\u2019s confidence in the accuracy of the forward curve?","Bruce Van Saun","Well too hard I mean I think that\u2019s the market speaking, so I think if you\u2019re doing budgeting and you\u2019re doing forecasting you\u2019d kind of have to roll this what the market thinks at any point in time, it does move around a lot which makes it challenging when you go from one quarter to the next and you see the curve whipping around, but I think all kind of forward thinking has to be informed by the curve, the markets view of where rates are going.","Gerard Cassidy","And then shifting over to your Slide 15 when you talked about reenergizing the household growth, the reduced foot traffic, is that a seasonal or secular or cyclical, can you guys talk about what you\u2019re seeing there at the branch level?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I think it\u2019s just industry-wide, so it\u2019s a secular trend that with the new offerings of convenience around mobile and online more customers can access their banking services that they need remotely. They still come into the branches, they still like branches and so having a branch configuration is important, but kind of the purpose for why they go into the branches I think is becoming more specific. They don\u2019t need as much help with transactions, they may want to talk to one of our specialists et cetera, so I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying is you maybe have less swings at the back if you will of people coming through your branches so you\u2019d have to get good at making targeted offers through other channels. Brad, I\u2019ll flip it to you, and you could probably elaborate on that a bit.","Brad Conner","Bruce I think you did a very good job of saying that, it puts you in a position of having to be more effective when you do have the interactions with your customers and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on is making the right offer when you do interact with your customers and setting appointments to get them to come in your branches and those kinds of things, but it is an industry-wide trend that everyone is having to adapt to.","Gerard Cassidy","I recall on the last quarter\u2019s call if I recall correctly that you guys really didn\u2019t have any desire to reduce the number of branches as you go forward. If this foot traffic continues to fall do you rethink that strategy or do you start reducing number of branches?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I think the play in the medium-term is really to reconfigure your branches, make them more fit for purpose and smaller. So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re focused on. Is there an expense opportunity? Yes, I think it\u2019s in kind of getting the overall square footage that we have to something that is smaller and to make sure that we\u2019ve enough meeting space, we\u2019ve less space designated for long teller, number of teller stations that we needed in the past and this is not something you can turn on a dime on because we have well over 75% of our branches are leased and you have to kind of time it with lease at rolls but there is a prize there and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on and in terms of consolidations, we\u2019ve done most of the logical ones to do, there might be a few here and there, but I think that plays really around reducing square footage.","Gerard Cassidy","One final question, you mentioned that your mobile app has a very high ranking from an outside independent ranking organization. What percentages of customers today are interacting with Citizens through the mobile app?","John Fawcett","Yes, well let me answer it this way. So we\u2019ve talked a lot about transaction migration, and customers moving to doing their transactions with us in non-traditional ways. We are up to about 8% of our deposit base, 8% of our deposit is coming through mobile deposits, about 25% in total being non-branch activity. I don\u2019t have off to top of my head the number of the percentage of customers that interact with us on mobile, but I can tell you that it\u2019s growing rapidly and our transaction volume happening through mobile is growing really at pace even beyond what we expected and like I said over 25% of our deposit volume now coming from non-branch activities.","Bruce Van Saun","Are there any more questions operator?","Operator","No further questions in queue.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Well, again it\u2019s Bruce speaking, I\u2019d like to just end the call by saying I think we have a very solid quarter here in the Bank and we\u2019re optimistic as we enter 2015. Thanks everybody for dialing-in today. Have a good day.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5402":["Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

My name is Daniel, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks so much, Daniel, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today on the call. We're going to begin things with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and Eric Aboaf providing overview of our third quarter results. And then we're going to open the call up for questions. We're really pleased to have Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking with us this morning.","I'd like to remind you that you can find our earnings materials on the website at investor.citizensbank.com. There is a presentation there that we're going to walk through.","The lawyers have asked me to also remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those expectations in our SEC filings, including the 8-K that we filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and the reconciliations of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and in the earnings release material.","And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Saun","Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialing into our call this morning. We reported some very strong results today as we continued to execute well on our turnaround strategy for Citizens. Eric will take you through all the key numbers and color in a moment, but let me call out some of the highlights.","EPS for the quarter was $0.56, but that included $0.04 of what we refer to as notable items, the TDR sale gain, partially offset by several charges and write-downs. The underlying adjusted result of $0.52 per share was up 13% linked quarter and 30% year-on-year, really terrific. The good momentum we had in Q2 continued into Q3, and the environment broke our way with good capital markets and global markets activity levels, a bump in LIBOR rates, and a lessening drag from the long end of the curve.","Our team is executing very well. We continue to run the bank better for all of our stakeholders. We remain very focused on delivering a differentiated superior customer experience as the key to our long-term success.","It is nice to see ROTCE reach 8%. We've delivered the controllable part of our original ROTCE block. It's the lower for longer rates environment that has held us back from even better results. But rest assured, we are not waiting around for rates to rise. We are focused on continuous improvement. We delivered 450 basis points of positive operating leverage year-on-year, adjusted basis, and our efficiency ratio has improved by 3% to 63%. We're getting some lift in fees, as the investments that we've patiently making are starting to show some traction. Capital markets and mortgage in particular had strong quarters. We did a good job on net recruiting. We added 47 mortgage LOs in Q3 and 11 financial consultants in wealth.","It will be important to stay focused and to continue to execute well in Q4 and in 2017. We can't expect these types of sequential EPS jumps every quarter, but it's pleasing to see the hard work is paying off.","With that, let me turn it over to Eric.","Eric Aboaf","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results highlight strong progress, as we continued to grow our balance sheet, deliver robust positive operating leverage, and smartly manage our capital base. Our key metrics continue to improve nicely: EPS growth, efficiency ratio, and ROTCE, and this marks the ninth straight quarter that we delivered positive operating leverage.","Our earnings of $0.56 on a GAAP basis includes some notable items that we've detailed on page four of the earnings presentation. As previously announced, as part of our focus on optimizing the balance sheet, we completed the sale of $310 million of home equity and mortgage loans classified as Troubled Debt Restructuring at a pre-tax gain of $72 million.","As part of that work, what we did in conjunction with the TDR Transaction, we conducted a broad technology and operational review related to the home equity business. We ended up writing off some software and adjusting some legacy processes to enhance customer experience and outcomes. The cost of these items was $8 million, which resulted in a remaining benefit from the gain of $64 million.","A further balance sheet optimization initiative resulted in a charge of $16 million, as we completed a deep-dive review of our Asset Finance business and elected to put certain single-product leasing-only client relationships into runoff that were tied for our legacy RBS business model. These relationships don't fit our target client profiles and return hurdles. In connection with this type of decision, our experience is that clients are less likely to work with us to resolve issues regarding the value of the collateral. And this fact coupled with the recent decline in several aircraft valuations resulted in impairment write-downs of $16 million on the residual values on the leases. And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with our TOP III expense initiatives related to severance and consultants.","So, with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation starting with page five. These GAAP results include the notable items in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income to common stockholders of $290 million and EPS of $0.56 per share, which was up 19% sequentially and 36% year-over-year.","On page six, you can see the highlights of our third quarter adjusted financial results, which exclude the impact of notable items. We believe this view provides the best picture of underlying momentum. Net income to common of $271 million is up 12% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. We grew net interest income $22 million or 2% linked quarter as we continued to deliver solid loan growth and held them stable. The NIM performance was better than expected as we saw a better an anticipated lift from LIBOR and continued strong results in shifting portfolio mix.","We also continued to make progress on fee income front with adjusted non-interest income up 4% sequentially, driven by strength in mortgage banking and service charges and fees. At the same time, we held expenses relatively stable linked quarter despite our continued investments in frontline personnel. And credit continues to be benign as provision expense was down $4 million. So, on a linked quarter basis, adjusted EPS increased $0.06 or 13%.","Compared to adjusted third quarter 2015 results, net income to common stockholders increased $58 million or 27% with earnings per share up 30%. We grew NII 10%, reflecting strong loan growth and an 8 basis point improvement to NIM. Given higher loan yields and short-term rates, ROTCE was 8.6% in the quarter and adjusted ROTCE hit 8% for the quarter, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago.","On pages seven and eight, you can see the drivers of our NIM performance this quarter. With one month LIBOR increasing and the continuing mix shift within the retail loan book to more attractive categories, we picked up 3 basis points on loan yields. However, we gave up 1 basis point of spread in the investment portfolio and deposit cost increased 2 basis points, largely tied to the commercial book.","Year-over-year, we picked up 12 basis points on asset yield, reflecting pricing initiatives and improved portfolio mix along with the impact of an increase in interest rates. Additionally, our term funding costs rose by 3 basis points tied to the higher rates and more term debt issuance. The strong performance over the past year, in spite of much lower long rates and a flatter yield curve, is a testament to how effectively we are executing on our optimization strategies.","Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 5.8% and a 200 basis points gradual rise scenario compared with 6.8% as of June 30. We have reduced our asset sensitivity modestly and expect it continue to be at the low end of the 6% to 7% range given the likelihood of the pace of Fed tightening will be slower than past cycles.","Turning to non-interest income on slide nine, you can see we continued to make progress. On a reported basis due to the impact of notable items, we grew non-interest income 23% from third quarter 2015. Excluding this impact, non-interest income was up 4% year-over-year. Note that the prior-year quarter had $60 million in benefits from a branch-sale gain and the card accounting change.","Results were okay by another strong capital markets quarter where we continue to see nice traction in loan syndication as well as the impact of establishing our own broker\/dealer post RBS separation. We're also regaining ground in mortgage banking. This quarter's results reflect continued improvement in our conforming application mix as well as a decrease in pipeline turn times, all of which helped lead to higher loan sale gains and improved spreads on higher refinance volumes. You can also see continued improvement in service charges and fees with progress in both consumer and commercial, which were up 3% and 5%, respectively, with a benefit from higher volumes and improved pricing.","Our card fees were down year-over-year due to the card reward accounting change. Trust and investment services fees were down slightly. Investment sales were up 14% year-over-year, in line with higher FC count. But as we continue to focus our wealth management efforts on achieving a better mix of transaction and fee-based recurring revenue, our commission revenue is lighter. Other income increased $73 million, almost entirely due to the impact of the TDR Transaction pre-tax gain.","Let's take a closer look at expenses on slide 10. GAAP non-interest expense increased $40 million or 5% linked quarter, including $36 million of notable items largely in salaries and benefits and outside services. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense increased $4 million, roughly flat with the previous quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense were down by $11 million. 2Q 2016 included higher payroll taxes and benefits associated with incentive payments. In addition, we brought our head count down by 200, driven by our TOP efficiency initiatives.","Offsetting the reductions in salaries and benefit, our outside services expense was up from relatively low second quarter levels, largely related to higher technology outsourcing and consumer loan product origination costs. As expected, we also saw some more modest increases in equipment and software amortization, given our infrastructure investments as well as a $4 million increase in FDIC insurance costs. In effect, the puts and takes offset each other and we were left with a cost of the FDIC increase.","On a year-over-year basis, our non-interest expense increased $69 million or 9% driven by the notable items. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense was up 4%, salaries and benefits are up $17 million, largely related to growth initiatives as well as higher revenue related incentive costs.","Our head count is down by almost 200 year-over-year, which reflects our efficiency initiatives more than offset an increase in the Consumer Banking sales force, largely in mortgage and wealth. In third quarter 2016, we continue to make progress against our goals, enhancing the bank's efficiency, even as we continue to reinvest in the business to generate future growth. Our efficiency ratio of 63% improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year on an adjusted basis and 5% over the last two years, as we continue to consistently deliver positive operating leverage.","If we look at our balance sheet on page 11, average earning assets were up $8.7 billion year-over-year or 7%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth and retail loans were up 5% across multiple product lines. Average deposits increased 6%, reflecting our ability to grow lower cost core deposits. And you can see that our borrowed funds increased $2.4 billion, which reflects growth in long-term senior debt and long-term FHLD borrowings, which replace retail and short-term FHLD borrowings as we continue to strengthen our funding profile.","Let's move to page 12 where you can see that Consumer Banking contributed 7% loan growth year-over-year and improved yields 22 basis points. Loan growth was driven by education finance, mortgage and other unsecured retail. Consumer loan yields have increased each quarter this year, reflecting our team's initiatives to improve risk-adjusted returns and the benefit of higher interest rates.","On slide 13, you can see that Commercial Banking experienced another strong quarter. Commercial loans increased 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in Mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate and Franchise Finance. Our commercial team has improved loan yields by 25 basis points, which reflect an increase in LIBOR as well as the more attractive mix.","Slide 14, deposit costs were up 3 basis points linked quarter, driven by strong commercial deposit growth and rising short-term interest rates, and we are comfortable with this increase. We will continue to find opportunities to balance our desire to grow deposit with the need to defend our margins. On a year-over-year basis, deposit costs increased 2 basis points as our continued pricing discipline largely offset higher short-term rates.","Next, let's move over to slide 15 and cover credit. Overall credit quality remained broadly stable during the quarter despite a rise in commercial charge-offs and non-performing loans tied to energy and commodity-related borrowers. We feel good about our reserve levels in the energy portfolio, but expect to see some modest migration to charge-offs and NPL notwithstanding higher oil and gas prices.","The remainder of the commercial and retail portfolios continue to demonstrate broad stability and the outlook for credit performance in 4Q remains positive. The allowance to loans ratio of 1.18% was relatively stable with the prior quarter. Our allowance to NPL coverage decreased to 112%, given the bump in NPLs, which have already been incorporated into our reserves.","On slide 16, you can see that we continue to have strong capital and liquidity position. This quarter as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we purchased $250 million of shares from the market at an average cost of $22.60, returning $313 million to shareholders including dividend. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.3%, which reflects our efforts to bring our capital structure more in line with peers. As a reminder, our CCAR plan includes the ability to repurchase up to $690 million of shares during the CCAR horizon, so more to follow.","On slide 17, we provide an update on our key initiatives tied to our turnaround plan. We believe it's important to assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We're continuing to deliver [indiscernible] balance sheet growth across the platform.","In consumer, we continue to engage with customers across multiple channels and we are regaining momentum in mortgage and wealth, although we still have room to improve. In commercial, we are seeing a lift in capital markets, benefiting from the establishment of our broker\/dealer and this quarter we took steps to refocus our efforts in Asset Finance. All-in-all, good execution across these initiatives is driving our strong momentum.","On slide 18, our TOP programs continue to deliver important benefits. As a reminder, the company launched Tapping our Potential in 2013 with a companywide bottoms-up focus and we estimate it to continuing to harvest ideas to deliver improving revenue and expense trends every year.","These programs have been key to our continued momentum in operating leverage and enabled us to reduce staff in non-revenue areas and streamlined end-to-end processes, while ensuring that we continue to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the low rate environment.","With TOP II, we're nearing completion of the program with roughly $50 million in expense base as well as providing nearly $50 million in revenue benefits on an annualized basis for year-end 2016. We kicked off TOP III this summer and have already made good progress across all the initiatives.","In commercial, we completed the end-to-end portfolio management and processes work and are focused on leveraging data to improve customer retention. In consumer, we are particularly pleased with our unsecured lending initiatives and we're also digging in on the brand strategy, and we're ahead of plan on taxes, some of which you see this quarter. Bottom line, we are well on our way to delivering on the $90 million to $100 million we are targeting by the end of 2017.","Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on slide 19. We expect to continue to drive attractive balance sheet growth and are targeting average loan growth of roughly 1.5% to 2% over the third quarter. We also expect net interest margin to be relatively stable. We expect some continued improvement in LIBOR, along with a benefit from continued shift in asset mix and the benefit of pay-fixed swap runoff to drive these results.","On the fee income front, we expect puts and takes to result in a relatively stable trends from our adjusted third quarter base of $368 million. We expect capital markets to continue to post strong results while mortgage fees should be down somewhat from exceptional third quarter levels.","Additionally, we may generate some relatively modest securities gains to reposition the portfolio for next year. We plan to continue our discipline on expenses and expect a modest increase given seasonality. Overall, we remain committed to generating strong positive operating leverage, which has been the key to our improvement in EPS and ROTCE. We expect underlying credit to remain favorable, but expect to see a modest build in the quarter for loan growth. And finally, as we continue to grow loans and return capital to shareholders through both dividends and repurchases, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11.2%.","Overall, we're pleased that we remain broadly on track for our 2016 full year operating earnings guidance we provided back in January. A strong balance sheet growth and in performance, good expense discipline and favorable credit has more than offset lower than projected fee income and the lack of Fed funds hike. Overall, this is a reflection of strong execution and our mindset of continuous improvement.","So, with that, let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Saun","Well, thanks, Eric. Let me just close by acknowledging the good work that Eric has done during his 18 months with us at Citizens. This will be his last earnings call for us, but he'll work through mid-December, staying focused on the 2017 budget and contributing to our initiatives. We're pleased to welcome back former CFO, John Fawcett, from retirement, who step in as interim CFO and help through the year-end work. I'm very confident that we'll be able to attract a high quality permanent successor and Eric, I'm confident that you'll make a very positive impact over at State Street.","So, with that, Daniel, let's open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","Bruce Saun","Hi, there.","Ken Zerbe","I guess, a question on the net interest margin. Obviously, I heard you say that it benefited from the higher LIBOR this quarter. I think I heard your expectations with the LIBOR is going to continue to increase. So, from a planning perspective or forecast perspective, if LIBOR does start to tick lower for whatever reason, does that also implies there is a direct correlation to NIM or is there any way to lock-in those gains? Or because I think you also \u2013 or Eric may have also mentioned like reducing asset sensitivity, was that part of this? Just want to make sure I'm clear on if there's anything you can do to protect that NIM?","Eric Aboaf","Ken, it's Eric. I think the NIM for fourth quarter we expect to be relatively stable. I think LIBOR will clearly be in a tight range. It may float up a little bit in anticipation of the Fed rate rise. But I think there is little movement that we expect beyond that that I think you or others should be concerned about.","I think what we have is we consider the fourth quarter guidance that we gave is we might get a little bit of uptick from the frontend LIBOR, which helps reprice our \u2013 with the pricing on our commercial loan book, right. We have some old swaps rolling off, so that will be a tailwind. And against that, we just have the backend long-term rates continuing to flow through the securities and the fixed rate product portfolio. And so, net-net, there's kind of offset between those, and so we expect a roughly flattish fourth quarter.","Bruce Saun","Yeah. I would add the other positive tailwind is our efforts to just keep shifting the mix towards better risk-adjusted return portfolio. So, we're not really that sensitive to LIBOR. Ken, I feel pretty confident in that outlook for the fourth quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. That's pretty clear. Okay. So it's just sensible even without LIBOR expectations changing, okay. And then the other question I had just maybe more of a broader question on the TOP III expenses. Obviously, you took some cost this quarter. I am aware that your expense guidance includes the underlying TOP III cost, but just maybe help us get a sense like what does it cost to implement, say, the TOP III program ex the one-timers this quarter?","Eric Aboaf","Ken, I think the way I would describe it is, there are really two types of costs that we incur as we prepare for expense efficiency work, right. The first is that we do a lot of legwork both internally and with some amount of external consulting support to determine what kind of opportunities that we have in which areas of businesses and functions and which processes and which parts of our business. And so, there is some kind of preparatory work and you saw that come through, and I think we called that out in the expenses, the higher expense in this quarter, which cost about $6 million, right. In addition, once we do that preparatory work, we need to take severance and reserve effectively for the anticipated head count actions. And then, as those actions take place, those costs bang up against the reserve and you won't see the impacts of that in the forward period.","So, bottom line is you'll see most of the expense preparation and severance this quarter, that's what we've called out. We don't expect that to be significant going forward, but you'll start to see the benefit build over the coming months, as we actually effectuate some of those head count actions in particular, which will benefit starting in the fourth quarter and more and more into the coming year.","Bruce Saun","Yeah. I would just add to that, Ken, if you look at slide 18 where we detailed the TOP III program and break it out into revenues, expenses and taxes, you've got pretty much those costs associated with the bottom two with expenses and the tax work already reflected. On the revenue initiatives, the one that we'll have some costs that go with that is the unsecured lending initiatives. So, as we seek to build that portfolio, we'll have some marketing costs that go with that. But that will just flow into the run rate, and those benefits that we're showing are net benefits. So, I think to Eric's point, we've reflected most of those costs at this point.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bruce Saun","Hi.","John Pancari","On the margin, just a couple of quick things there. Kind of back to the yields question around loans. Barring any incremental move on LIBOR and barring any move by the Fed, generally what is your expectation for the trend in underlying loan yields? Is it still up because of the tailwind on swaps, on the roll-off, or is the downside pressure still there as new money yields are coming in below portfolio yield? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","John, it's Eric. Let me give you the color. I think we expect loan yields to continue to inch upwards. The biggest driver of that has been, over the last couple of quarters, our mix shift in particular in consumer. And earlier in the year, it was the uptick in LIBOR, which helped the commercial loan yield.","So, as we think about fourth quarter, right, we think we can continue to drive that mix shift, which is worth a couple basis points of yield on our book. And then we'll just have to see whether LIBOR floats up or not. I think all you have to consider is that as we grow the balance sheet, we also incur some deposit cost and, at this rate of growth, those inch up a little bit as well. We're, obviously, actively managing that. But between the two of those effects, I think we expect to be roughly constant into the fourth quarter.","John Pancari","Okay. Yeah, thank you, Eric. And that does dovetail right into my related question on that was the deposit costs, they did inch up this quarter. And again, is that \u2013 that's just given the overall growth and the fact that you don't have a ton of extra room there on your loan to deposit ratio?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. I think the way I would describe that is that if you're growing deposits at 3%, 4% at market rates, which many other banks are doing, then you don't expect much growth in deposit cost because it's kind of BAU going forward. I think we are growing our balance sheet at closer to 7% on the loan side. We need to fund that with deposits. We found \u2013 we've made a conscious choice to increase deposit balances on the commercial side. We found that there are lower costs there than retail in aggregate and on the margin.","And so what you'll find this quarter, for example, we added north of $2.5 billion of deposits quarter-on-quarter, even more year-on-year. When you're growing on a year-on-year basis of commercial deposits in 10% to 15% range, what ends up happening is you end up paying a little more on some of the new money that you're bringing in. Is it manageable? I think we've demonstrated that it is. But it will trickle through the deposit costs and we'll just continue to be careful as we bring in those funds.","John Pancari","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. You've clearly had quite a lot of growth in the other retail category and, I guess, some of that's down to things like the iPhone Upgrade product. Can you give us a sense of what you think the destination looks like in terms of mix? How much further do you shift towards that other retail category?","Bruce Saun","I'll start and then I'll ask Brad to augment. We think that this is a good important element of our mix shift that we were kind of underweight higher yielding portfolios in credit card and in personal unsecured. So we have really a two-pronged effort here. One is the partner financing, which we have with Apple, which may be able to be extended to other partners. And then, we have a direct unsecured effort largely in our footprint, where we think we can also \u2013 largely for our credit card consolidation offers get \u2013 offer good usable product to our customer. So those initiatives are helping to grow that. I think in the quarter we've grown that about $150 million, which is nice to see, and that's helping to adjust our overall yields favorably.","So, Brad, maybe you want to add to that?","Brad Conner","I think that's right, Bruce. And we think there's some opportunity in the other partnership area. The other highlight that I would make in terms of sort of other consumer categories that's been helping fly up the margins on our loan portfolios and student lending, we'll continue to have a lot of good progress there. Our education refi product, there's a lot of demand. Third quarter product because that's seasonally high period for loan demand. So, I think good opportunity in both the student loan space and in the other unsecured space.","Bruce Saun","Yeah.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then, I guess, at the other end of the spectrum on shifting around the loan mix, the aircraft leasing portfolio that you placed into runoff mode. What was the background there? What was behind the decision to move that into the runoff category?","Bruce Saun","Yeah. Maybe I'll start and, Don, you can augment that. But we took a hard look at the overall Asset Finance portfolio. And a lot of the business that we had on the books was sourced by RBS. They were the credit provider to large companies, investment-grade companies, and which was a cross-sell that was actually brought to Citizens as we were part of the same family. And when we stepped back and looked at the book, we said, we've got these large aircraft leases which are usually the sole product we have with those borrowers and we aren't going to really be relevant to those borrowers going forward. So they weren't penciling out from a hurdle rate standpoint and we decided and so on a B III basis, the returns were not very attractive. So we put those into runoff, we'll shrink that book and start to focus more on using leasing as a cross-sell into the middle market and into our Mid-corporate customer base. So, it's really an overall strategic shift and it's basically cleaning up some of the things that are a part of our legacy and our history.","But Don, you can maybe add.","Donald McCree","Bruce, I think that's right. And I think it's the last step in the cleanup as we become a public company. Asset Finance is something we've been looking at for the last year, year-and-a-half, and we're really targeting the business completely differently than we have been in the past. And I think it was the one business where we had a very significant mix of non-core Citizens franchise exposures, and this is a cleanup to move those away from the ongoing business.","Bruce Saun","You might, Don, just take the opportunity to talk about some of the other separation initiatives in commercial from RBS because we've made real progress this year in terms of setting up a broker\/dealer so we can offer underwriting on our own without RBS, and then also doing a great job of getting a new platform in, in global markets, so we can offer FX and risk management products on our own away from RBS.","Donald McCree","Yeah. And I think I talked about this at the conference about half-a-year ago, which is we were losing portions of our profitability in the commercial bank just because we were paying away good offer spread in the trading rooms and we were paying away portions of our fees on the capital markets side. So, actually completing the infrastructure growth across our dealing runs and also across the growth that you're seeing it come through in the results already and we're highly optimistic as we move forward.","So I'd say we're finished in terms of the investment putting away, save a couple of minor items, and we're operating fully independently. Right now, we should be able to capture the full profitability.","Bruce Saun","Great.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Bruce Saun","Hi.","Erika Najarian","I was hoping you could help us think through, if the Fed had raised rates in December, what the impact would be on first quarter net interest margin, based on how your balance sheet is positioned today?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, Erika. Let me start with that and I think you could go back for broad context as to how this affected us last year because if you remember it was a literally 11 months ago, right?","Erika Najarian","Yeah.","Eric Aboaf","And so, soon we'll be to another December month, where the Fed raise rates to 25 basis points and I think you saw some good performance starting into the first quarter. I think mechanically what happens is the Fed rates is raised and then what will tend to play through is that those rates flowed up on a LIBOR basis, the LIBOR rates then are tied to our commercial lending book, 85% of our commercial lending book reprice this. They tend to reprice in arrears, so there will be part of the book will be priced starting at January and other part in February. But we'll get a nice bump into the first quarter as a result.","I think what we've previously said is the value of 25 basis points at the front-end of the curve is worth about $65 million. The challenge is, and we've learned that the hard way, I'd say this past year is that as the backend of the curve moves up, down, sideways or twists, that can have some other effects, including some headwinds, and we obviously had good sized headwinds like other banks had on that this year.","So I think the question will obviously be, will the Fed raise rates, there's a lot of anticipation there, but there has been anticipation before. And then the question is, what will happen to the rest of the curve.","Bruce Saun","If my memory serves me, Erika, I think our sequential improvement in NIM from Q4 last year to Q1 was about 9 basis points and we attributed about half of that to the Fed bump and about the other half to our own initiatives in terms of asset mix and controlling deposit costs. So, just for reference sake.","Erika Najarian","That's good. Thank you. And just a follow-up to that. To your point, if the Fed raises rates, but there is no change in any other part of the curve, is there enough left on the balance sheet optimization initiatives that you could keep your net interest margin stable at that level for the rest of 2017?","Eric Aboaf","Erika, we're still going through our 2017 planning. As Bruce mentioned, we're spending a good bit of time here with Brad and Don and our Treasurer to do that, and we'll give more fulsome guidance in January when it comes to NIM. What I would say is that a boost in the frontend should be a positive, right, an uptick should help \u2013 help with an uptick to NIM. Our loan mix initiative should continue that Brad's been shepherding, so we expect that to be a positive.","The challenges on NIM will continue to be intense competition on the commercial side, which Don's team has been navigating through quite well. A little bit of a deposit cost will float up as well if LIBOR comes through and as we grow deposits a bit more quickly than the market. And then it will largely depend on what happens with the backend of the curve. Does the 10-year stay at where it is today, which is certainly a possibility, right, because it flowed back up to where it was \u2013 remember, where it was a year ago. It was quite nice when it was at the 2.20% level, not only 2%, but 2.20%. Where is it today where we are or does it move in another direction? I think that's the big open item that I think, to be honest, we'll see more of that develop through December and early January and that will help us give you some good guidance into 2017.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Thank you.","Eric Aboaf","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. If I can ask a question on credit, which has stayed very good for you guys and for everybody else. There's a couple of things kind of going on inside the provision. It looks like you still had some of the energy cleanup coming through and then \u2013 but also it looks you had high recoveries this quarter and a pretty sizeable commercial side release. And so, I'm just kind of wondering there's a lot of moving parts in there, could you help us understand the kind of magnitude of the delta and provision we could expect going forward and how that ties into the fact that you guys are still growing loans at a really great upper single-digit pace?","Bruce Saun","Look, I think the credit cost, if you look at it across the year has been relatively stable. So, there is some underlying shifts. We had a lower charge-off quarter. Last quarter, we kind of moved back to the levels we were at in the first quarter. We've had inside the \u2013 we've had loan growth, which is adding to the provision, so we've had back book cleanup in terms of credit quality, particularly on the consumer side, which has provided an offset to that. So, we've been tracking in a kind of mid-80%s to 90% range. And I think that's a reasonable expectation. We've guided here to very slightly increased provision in Q4 because of the anticipation that we're going to grow loans in the 1.5% to 2% range. But I don't see anything that's troubling or concerning at this point on the credit front.","Ken Usdin","And so, Bruce, as a follow-up, and it just seems like you still have some of that back book improvement that can carry forward as well, where you might be able to still fund the loan growth build with the cleanup on the home equity and some of the legacy stuff that you referred to?","Bruce Saun","Yeah. I think \u2013 and we've been reasonably surprised because just when we think that the covered is clean as can be, we still see some things break our way. So, again, to Eric's point, we haven't given yet guidance yet on 2017 and we will see whether \u2013 how long we can sustain that into 2017. But I think certainly into Q4 we think that we can have an offset to the loan growth.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Okay. And then just one quick one. As far as the loan growth is concerned, anything changing as far as what you're seeing in terms of the mix of new production and where you want to see the book continue to grow as you look ahead?","Bruce Saun","Well, I think that the shift that you're seeing is all intentional. So, over in the consumer side, we're seeing good growth in our education refinance product, and we're seeing purposeful growth in the personal unsecured side. We've seen I think some very good growth in mortgages, which is helping to offset a little bit of the pay-downs on the HELOC area. And then on the commercial side, we've had some very steady growers throughout the year that kind of larger end of our customer base, the Mid-corporate and Industry Verticals have been growing nicely. Our Franchise Finance business has been growing nicely and Commercial Real Estate has been having steady growth as well.","So, I don't think we'll see much change there in terms of the mix and the drivers of that growth, but we're fortunate that we've been able to consistently achieve good loan growth, which has outpaced our peers and we think we can continue that. I don't know, Brad or Don, if want to add to that?","Brad Conner","Not really. I think you covered it well. The only thing that I might add to that is the one area of our portfolio which is somewhat intentional that's not growing is the auto business. We're comfortable with the size, it's a very tight margin business right now, and we're sort of holding that a little flat and the growth is coming in the other areas.","Bruce Saun","Right. Don, anything?","Donald McCree","I think you've got it. I think the place we'd like to see a little stronger growth is our middle market, but it is just very sluggish loan demand in that sector and cleaning it up with other sectors.","Bruce Saun","Yeah. And then leasing, given the repositioning, that's likely going to be a...","Donald McCree","Flattish.","Bruce Saun","...stable portfolio as well.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Bruce Saun","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Eads with UBS.","David Eads","Hi. Good morning.","Bruce Saun","Hi, David.","David Eads","I know it's fairly early in the process, but I'm curious if you make comments and reactions to the potential changes to CCAR process, taking out the positive test and basically does that change the way you think about how you might \u2013 the pace initially bringing down capital ratios and getting more in line with your average?","Bruce Saun","Yeah. I'll start and Eric, I don't know, if you'd chime in. But look, we're pleased to see Governor Tarullo's remarks and an acknowledgement that banks under $250 billion in size don't have to go through some of the same rigor as the larger banks. I think there were a lot of \u2013 having said that, there were a lot of advances in terms of approach and risk management that we'll continue. And I think the supervisors would expect us to continue a fair amount of that. But being out of the drama of whether you have a qualitative pass or fail, as they might think in and of itself, it will just go back in the supervisory process.","I think our philosophy on gliding down that capital surplus has been found. We're a relatively new company separated from our parent, and so we're still demonstrating our capabilities as an independent bank. We have been in a fortunate position where I'd like to say we could have our cake and eat it too, so we've got very robust loan growth. We have very robust returns of capital to shareholders. And having that capital cushion behind us allows us to continue that, which is really helping to drive these very favorable results.","It's important that we get our ROE to higher level so that we can sustain that kind of an approach on a standalone basis once the cushion is gone. So we're really just calibrating how fast to glide that down with what the potential we see out in the marketplace to continue to execute our strategy.","Eric, any further remarks?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. I would just add, in the near term, the focus on putting capital to work in the right places and recycling it from other areas is kind of paramount now and that we can do and we control and I think you've seen evidence of that. I think you've seen how that has actually helped our ROTCE write-off. ROTCE has been driven by operating leverage, but also by this redeployment of capital. And over time, you've seen us slow down on our CET1 ratios, but we're not in a rush and we want to make sure that we run a safe and sound institution. But I think you have seen a trajectory there of about 50 basis points over the past year and that gives you at least some indication for the time being.","David Eads","All right. That's helpful. And then following up on the lease business and the Asset Finance, I noticed that on your strategic initiatives slide, that's still highlighted in yellow. But it sounds like the message is that you're done with carving out any portfolios and now it's just a function of growing the middle market, leasing franchise and kind of growing the revenue opportunities from here, is that correct?","Bruce Saun","Yeah. And so if you think about that portfolio, we had about $6 billion of assets broadly. We've moved about $1 billion of these aircraft leases into non-core and put them into runoff. We have another of our own low yielding book of leases that we're just going to manage down. So I think the steady state portfolio is going to be around low for us, $4 billion to $4.25 billion. And over time, the duration on that portfolio is about four years. We'll continue to turn that and target that towards our existing Citizens customer base. A lot of that was from us, from RBS and we need to actually integrate this into our offerings with our customers.","And so, I'd say we call it yellow because we're kind of at the last stage of the thought process to restructure it, and now we have to reorient the business and get the calling in place and the coverage bankers to really be understand the product and kind of have a targeted plan where we can expand the product into that customer base. But I think you should start to see that move towards green, now that we've really figured out what we want to do with it. Don, anything further?","Donald McCree","No. I think that's right. The only other comment I'd make is, one of the reasons we like the leasing business is it's a relatively quick engagement with our clients, particularly where we're dealing with prospects we can begin to do business with them much more quickly than we can, for example, with a revolving credit or a term loan, which tends to take six to 12 months to establish that relationship. So, we think it's a quick turn product, which allows to make some progress on our growth of the client base also.","Bruce Saun","Yeah. Good.","David Eads","All right. Thanks so much.","Bruce Saun","Okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. Thanks. Great job in moving from 6% ROTCE to 8% very quickly in two quarters. Bruce and Eric, I want to follow up a couple of things. Capital return, what is your thinking now about going above 100%, as you got pretty close this year in the CCAR 2016?","Bruce Saun","Well, we just answered some perspective on that. But again, we'll wait till we get to the next year. I think we've been on a reasonably good glide path in terms of high return to shareholder and also funding robust loan growth and we'll see. We'll see if there is opportunities, I guess, it's less of a litmus test and a barrier than it was in the past, but I think what we've been doing in terms of gliding that CET1 ratio down 50 basis points or 60 basis points a year for the last two years has served us well. And we certainly still have more room to go on that with that strategy, given that kind of the peer average is in the low 10%s and we're in the low 11%s at this point.","Vivek Juneja","Right. And where do you think, just based on 2016 now, where do you expect \u2013 if you could just remind us where do you think your B III fully phased in CET1 will end up by next June?","Bruce Saun","Well, I don't think we've guided that yet, Vivek. We have offered 11.2% as of the year-end. And if you look at the strategies that we've employed is we've been going down, let's call it, 50 basis points or 60 basis points. If you ran that out another six months and it's assumed more of the same, that would get you down to something like 10.9% or something, which would have a 10% handle instead of an 11% handle.","Vivek Juneja","All right, okay. A question on the Consumer Banking fee income side. If I look year-on-year, put aside mortgage banking, which is obviously up very nicely, with the volumes, cards, Consumer Banking fee income is still dull. Can you talk a little bit about what you need to do there to get that going in the direction you've been trying to?","Bruce Saun","I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.","Vivek Juneja","Consumer Banking fee income. When you look at the consumer segment and look at the noninterest income year-on-year?","Bruce Saun","Yeah. Look, I'll start and Brad, I want you to chime in. But part of this is the card accounting change, Vivek. So, I think you have to really \u2013 you better serve to focus on the individual line items, and where we've had some growth in service charges, we've had very strong growth in mortgage. Probably the one disappointing area to-date is on the wealth fee line. Having said that, we feel quite positive about what's happening in our wealth business, so we have a strong new leader for that business and we've had very consistent success now in growing our financial consulting force, we added another 11 this quarter.","We've revamped our product set and reoriented the customer targeting more towards mass affluent and affluent, and so we're really focused a bit more on fee-based products than traditional commission products. And that is reflecting a little bit of a drag because you make more money right upfront off your commission products and you build a book on your fee-based products. I'd say proof in the pudding here, our investment sales year-on-year were up 15% versus a year ago, so the sales effort is tracking to the growth in FCs and the better penetration of the customer base, but there is a mix change in the product, which is holding back revenues a little bit for the short term. But in the long run, it's a good thing. Brad?","Brad Conner","Yeah. Listen, on the wealth side, there's just not a lot more to add there. I think you said it exactly right. We feel very good about the underlying drivers. We were adding financial consultants, they are high producing financial consultants, and their sales were strong. As you said, it's just a matter of changing the mix. And then in the long run, that's a good thing. So I think we are little behind what we originally thought. I think we're building the right foundation for us to move forward.","The only other comment I'd make on the consumer fees is that the question sort of dismissed the growth that we've had in mortgage and, to some degree, like we saw everybody seeing strong mortgage refinance activity. But I don't want to quickly dismiss that because there is a really strong underwriting trend, we've said it for a few quarters that we had to slow down on our hiring because we had to get our operations where it needed to be. And we feel like we've accomplished that and we've had two really strong quarters of hiring mortgage loan officers. So we do believe even after the mortgage refinance slows a little bit that we'd be able to see pretty strong mortgage deals into the future. So, I think there's some good underlying trends in mortgage as well.","Bruce Saun","Yeah.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Brad, we'll have to hold you to that next couple of quarters. Thanks.","Bruce Saun","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jesus Bueno with Compass Point.","Manuel Bueno","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Quickly, obviously, it's a seasonally strong quarter for student, but looks like you had a \u2013 it looks like you had very good growth there. And you had an emphasis on your in-house product, but if you could just give us an update on how your organic originations were and also on the SoFi purchases for the quarter?","Bruce Saun","Yeah. Brad, do you want to take that? So, student \u2013 obviously, ed refi has been really the focus, but the seasonal in Q3. And then also the SoFi relationship where we're continuing our flow agreement with SoFi.","Brad Conner","Yeah. Actually really strong across all three dynamics. So, we talked about it earlier on, which is a really very strong seasonal quarter for in-school. So, we saw a nice pick-up in in-school activity. [indiscernible] it's just a product that it's a matter of continuing to inform consumers about the opportunity and it continues to show good growth and we think there is a lot of opportunities to continue to market that product. And there is a little bit more awareness in the marketplace around...","Bruce Saun","Interestingly, SoFi is helping [indiscernible] which has the halo effect for us.","Brad Conner","That's exactly right. And then, as you said, we did do another SoFi purchase in the third quarter and we continue our relationship with SoFi. So we continue to expect to see good growth in student into the future.","Eric Aboaf","It's Eric. I'd just add that the organic mix is almost 95% organic at this point. So what's happening is while we saw the flow [indiscernible] SoFi across the bank and it's quite high in consumer itself because we have purchases from past years that are starting to mature and roll off, those are just getting replenished with [indiscernible].","Brad Conner","Yeah. As an example, our SCUSA portfolio is really just replenishing runoff and we were 91% \u2013 our mix of originations was 91% organic, 9% purchase. So it's a strong organic mix.","Manuel Bueno","Excellent. Thanks for the color there. And just quickly on iUp program. You've had the program there now for a year. I know this quarter we only had a couple weeks of kind of the new iPhone launch sales. But, I guess, how credit-wise, how has that \u2013 now that you're a year in, how has that portfolio performed relative to your original expectations? And if you could possibly update us on the kind of breakout of the balances for this quarter and your expectations as we move into the fourth quarter, which is generally heavier drive on sales.","Bruce Saun","I guess, the credit experience has been as expected, so there's nothing noteworthy to report on there. In terms of the breakout, we are really not breaking that out. I think it's fine to just leave that as a category because ultimately we'll have potentially more partners. And then, our direct personal unsecured has very similar yield characteristics. So, we will report that as a group. I'd say, though, that we would expect that iPhone could be a real driver as we head into Q4 here that there should be some good momentum behind that. But there is also a momentum in our personal mailing campaign that we have underway as well. So, we see good momentum across both fronts.","Eric Aboaf","The category itself, all the unsecured was up about 30% in the quarter, so it's a good quarter.","Manuel Bueno","Okay. And if I could squeeze one more just on the tax rate. I appreciate the guidance for 4Q that you put in there. But in terms of what to expect kind of as we move into 2017, would you say this is closer to a run rate, tax rate that we should expect?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. It's Eric. Let me give you a little bit of perspective on tax rate. We started to work on taxes I think in an industrious way in the spring time and folded it into our TOP III initiatives and you're seeing some of the early returns on that. And I think we're doing what the other regional banks are doing. There is nothing special here. We're availing ourselves of Federal R&D tax credit, state investment tax credit. And so, what you saw this quarter was a little bit of a catch-up activity from the prior years.","I think going forward what you'll see is kind of the annual version of those tax credit programs, plus the standard tax benefit that comes from the LIHTC, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, we do a modest amount of wind farms and some other tax advantage investing. And we'll continue to do that.","So, I think we had a particularly strong quarter this time around. I think you saw that we guided to 31.5% for next quarter, so down now 150 basis points from that 33% area that we were running at. And if you think about it, it's just part of the benchmarking and review of how do you optimize the regional bank and improve ROTCE, right. Part of that is operating leverage, part of that is fee income growth, and part of that is operating with an attractive tax rate. And so it's part of that continued effort.","I think in terms of next year, we'll give a little more guidance in January as we pull together our plan, but I think clearly we're on a nice path here.","Bruce Saun","Yeah. We're on the trajectory that we want to have sustainable. So all those things Eric mentioned, getting our NIM back to the pack and getting our capital ratios back to the pack, getting our tax rates back to the pack, those things all contribute to getting our ROTCE where we want to take it.","Manuel Bueno","That's great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Bruce, you mentioned in the sales, the TDRs just over $300 billion. If I recall correctly and just over $880 billion or so at the end of the second quarter, should we expect additional sales of TDRs in the next couple of quarters?","Eric Aboaf","It's Eric. I think we \u2013 as you think about TDRs, we, like other banks, you go back over the historic portfolio, you do primarily a one-time review and you package a nice sized sale. And the bigger the sale, the better execution you tend to get. So I think this is more one-time than otherwise. It doesn't mean that a year or two from now, there may not be a little bit of follow-on, but I think, you think about those as small and just more as an episodic event or positive episodic event, but one on the left.","Gerard Cassidy","Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Sticking with the sales theme. Obviously, you moved some of these aircraft leases into runoff portfolio. In view of CIT's recent sale of their airline leasing \u2013 aircraft leasing business, would you guys considerer selling off that portfolio at some point in the future, or are you just going to leave it and runoff?","Bruce Saun","Yeah. It's a very different ball game. The CIT was commercial aircraft \u2013 with the commercial airliners and these are private planes for large companies, and they're pretty bespoken there in their one-off. So, I think what should just end up doing is you work d them through with lessees. So, I don't think this would lend itself to a transaction.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Appreciate the color.","Bruce Saun","Yeah.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Bruce Saun","Hi.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Just to follow up on the commercial loan growth. Obviously, again, a bit stronger than the industry, and some of it is the investments that you've made in some of the verticals and [indiscernible]. But just how sustainable do you think the above-average growth is? Because there seems to be some pricing issue at some places, less demand in some areas, and a number of folks seem to be pulling back for one reason or another or just having weaker growth.","Bruce Saun","Let me start and then Eric or Don, feel free to chime in. But I think if you look at maybe the last several quarters, going back 10, 12 quarters, we've had consistent levels of growth and we've largely been tracking the Fed HA data. So, we're growing consistent with the overall market and part of that has been getting back on offense, part of it has been hiring more coverage bankers and building out these Industry Verticals and bringing relationships to us, and just being very selective about where we're playing, building real power allies of strength, and then going out and taking on the business.","So, I'd say we feel that we're well situated to continue that strategy. We saw a bit of a seasonal slowdown in Q3. We are looking for a bit of a bounce back in Q4. I think there is a little bit of election uncertainty that's maybe holding some companies back, which might resolve itself, as we get through the quarter. But anyway, I'll stop there. Don, anything?","Donald McCree","I think you should expect to see us grow with the industry and we are getting some production out of people that we've hired over the last couple of years, as they've done and engage with the clients. I'd say the other thing is, it's deal-by-deal, company-by-company, and it's very aggressive out there, and we're being careful to balance credit, terms and conditions, pricing and loan growth. So, we manage it on a multi-variable equation obviously and we want to protect the NIM while also growing the loan business. So, it will be a balance as we go forward. I agree with, Bruce, what you said.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Bruce Saun","Kevin?","Ellen Taylor","Kevin?","Operator","Kevin Barker, your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Sorry. I was on mute. Good morning.","Ellen Taylor","Hi.","Kevin Barker","Auto net charge-offs increase was about 30% year-over-year to running about 69 basis points versus 50 basis points last year. It seems like there is a little acceleration in the charge-offs on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is there any particular trends you want to point to, was this related to the Santander portfolio or is this related to your overall organic...?","Eric Aboaf","Kevin, it's Eric. Just to start, I think we had an unusual low second quarter performance in auto. We had done some catch-up on some recoveries the way they \u2013 and repossessions the way they flow through. So, I think if you just look at the trends broadly over the five quarters that you have here, you got to adjust the second quarter 2016 upwards. I think, other than that, we've been running in kind of $20 million to $25 million of charge-offs per quarter. There's a little bit of seasoning going through the portfolio, right, because as we don't add net new loans, you don't have that natural drift down of the charge-off that offsets the seasoning of the backlog. So, you're just seeing a little bit of that. But I think it's well controlled. We feel like we're in a good place with auto. We'll obviously see the usual seasonality in fourth quarter, but I think it's a good shape.","Brad Conner","Yeah. I think you said it exactly right. It's a low seasonal quarter. In the second quarter, we saw a little bit of pickup from that. Of course, a year or so ago, we started to expand our credit parameters that's seasoning through the book. But overall, the credit trends are exactly as we would have expected them to be.","Bruce Saun","And SCUSA is performing as expected.","Brad Conner","SCUSA performing as expected. And you'll recall, we actually changed our credit parameters with SCUSA few quarters back and we're actually now beyond the peak of the SCUSA portfolio loss, so that's beginning to come down.","Bruce Saun","Yeah, good.","Kevin Barker","So the macro environment stays relatively benign from where it is right now. Where do you think the normalized credit losses will be on that auto portfolio on an annualized basis?","Bruce Saun","Roughly in the same range.","Brad Conner","Relatively in the range where we are.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. If you think about the charge-off rate that you see in the materials other than the low quarter is you see some prints in the 60 basis point range, 70 basis point range. I think that's where we expect it to level out, I'd say, in the 70 basis point range, more or less. And then we'll obviously have the quarterly seasonality because, remember, that's quite a factor in the auto business and we think [indiscernible] like through modest economic times as well.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then a quick follow-up on Jesus' comments about the tax rate over a long period of time. At what point do you expect to reach peer levels for your tax rate? How long do you expect that to take?","Eric Aboaf","That's a good question because I think tax is one of those things that you work on over time and you get better at and is something that we have every intention of doing. And as I've said, some of it is tax credit, sort of availing themselves of tax credit fits into very little bit state by state, but there's a Federal credit and then part of it just the tax advantage investments and there are three or four categories of those. There's low income tax credit, there is historic real estate commercial tax credit, there are some wind farms, all of which that we have begun to do some more of. We'll do those in line with what other banks do. We'll obviously keep an eye out and not do anything that's a little more on the edge because that's not the kind of bank that we are.","I think the question is, how much can you bring the tax rate down? I mean, you see where the peers are, they are in the high 20% range, but it takes time, and I think we're actually quite pleased with the performance so far. We were at 33% for a number of years when tax rate management wasn't a big important item under the RBS umbrella because of the Global Bank structure. Now that it is, you've seen us go from 33% to [indiscernible].","Bruce Saun","Our income is growing very quickly, so that income comes through at the marginal rate, and so you're also \u2013 some of your tax planning has to offset that higher levels of income. So.","Eric Aboaf","I think what we will do is in January we'll give a little more guidance as to what we expect in 2017 and obviously, some of what you've seen is a down payment on that, and we'll continue that. Hard to estimate long term, but I think you can estimate some improvements over time.","Bruce Saun","Okay. Thank you.","Kevin Barker","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Matthew Burnell","Thanks for taking my question Eric, maybe a question for you. The securities portfolio was up about 4% quarter-over-quarter. I presume that's mostly just being driven by deposit growth exceeding your loan growth, but can you confirm that there really hasn't been much of a change and how you are thinking about managing that portfolio?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. Matt, it's Eric. I think securities portfolio is in a good state right now, it's right-sized for this bank, it's primarily deposits funded, which is the way we like it. You saw us temp down a little bit on the asset sensitivity as we saw some nice rate levels in the late August, early September time period. And we'll continue to position a bit around the curve as that portfolio throws off some good income. I think we've got a very strong treasury team that's got the capability to manage that in a proper way. But I think it's properly sized for the bank. I think it's got a nice mix of MBS portfolio, it's got some swaps layered in, which provides some more clean duration, so that we also manage the convexity characteristics. And then I think over time, we've got some ability to do more with the portfolio as well.","Matthew Burnell","Okay. Thanks very much. And then just a question on the CFO search. Have you said how long you expect that to take? I realize there is no specific date, but do you have a sense as to how long you think that might take?","Bruce Saun","Well, obviously, we've begun. And my experience on these things is they take a few months to identify the right candidate and then list them and get them situated. But I think we'd be targeting to have the person in certainly by no later than the end of the first quarter.","Matthew Burnell","Great. Thank you very much.","Bruce Saun","Okay.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks, Matt.","Bruce Saun","Okay. I think that's it for the questions. And I'd like to thank everyone again for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest. All in all, we feel that we had a really terrific quarter that we're firing on all cylinders and feel good about our outlook. So, thanks again and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our call today. We'd like to thank you for your participation.

My name is Justin and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's event is being recorded.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks so much, Justin and good morning everyone. We really appreciate you joining us this morning. We'll start off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods reviewing our third quarter results. And then we're going to open up the call for questions. We're really pleased to have with us today Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, our Head of Commercial Banking.","I'd like to remind you all that in addition to our press release today, we posted a presentation and financial supplement on investor.citizensbank.com. And of course, our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which as you know are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from our expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings release material.","And now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks, Ellen. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong results, as our disciplined execution continues to drive strong momentum. The headline results show that we reached our key medium-term IPO target this quarter with a 10.1% ROTCE, a 59.4% efficiency ratio and a 1% ROA. This is notwithstanding a lower rate environment then was assumed back when the targets were set.","While these results mark good and consistent progress, we have more work to do to run the bank ever better and become a top performing bank. I believe that the same formula that has taken us this far can continue to propel us to even better results. We're being very disciplined in where and how we play in our capital allocation. We have a mindset of continuous improvement that allows us to self-fund our growth investments, while delivering superior operating leverage. We've added some great talent and built out many excellent capabilities.","And lastly and perhaps most importantly, we have focused on delivering a great customer experience in both the commercial and consumer segments. We've launched our TOP IV program and we continue to solidify and add initiatives. We pumped our target range by 5 million this quarter. We're putting a similar governance structure around our balance sheet optimization or \"BSO\" initiatives, which will be led by John Woods, our CFO.","Turning to specific highlights of the quarter, we had excellent year-over-year revenue growth and operating leverage. Year-on-year, adjusted revenue was up 10% versus 3% adjusted expense growth, delivering 7% positive operating leverage. NII was up 12%, as loans grew by 5.4% and the net interest margin improved by 21 basis points, with about half of that due to self-improvement and half due to raise.","Adjusted non-interest income was up 4% and that was really paced by strong growth in capital markets revenues. On a linked quarter basis, our underlying revenue growth was 2.5% against expense growth of 1% for 1.5% sequential operating leverage, which annualizes of course to 6%.","NII was 3.5% sequentially - grew 3.5%. That was paced by 1.5% spot loan growth and an 8 basis point rise in the NIM to 3.05%. Our average loan growth was a little lower at 0.4%, which reflects somewhat the sluggish and stretched conditions in the C&I space that we saw throughout a good chunk of the quarter, but we're cautiously optimistic of a pick-up in Q4 continuing on into 2018.","We continue to be highly focused on capital management. We returned $315 million to shareholders in Q1 or in Q3, I'm sorry. So overall, it was another strong quarter. We feel good about our positioning, the opportunities that we have in front of us and our ability to execute.","So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods to take you through the numbers in more detail. John?","John Woods","Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our third quarter financials, which start on slide four. We generated net income of $348 million and diluted EPS of $0.68 per share. Our reported net income was up 9% compared with the second quarter, driven by higher net interest income and lower credit related costs. Year-over-year, net income was up 17% and EPS was up 21%.","We also present our results on an adjusted or underlying basis in order to show a clear picture of the operating trends in our business. On this basis, net income for the third quarter was up 25%, EPS was up 31% and we delivered positive operating leverage of 7% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth of 10% and expense growth of 3%. Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 4% linked quarter, driven by loan growth, higher loan yields and benefit from pay accounts, partly offset by an expected increase in our funding cost.","Our net interest margin increased eight basis points linked quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. We will spend more time on the margin in a few minutes. On an underlying basis, non-interest income of $381 million was unchanged from second quarter and was up 4% year-over-year, while our efficiency ratio improved 95 basis points compared with the prior quarter and 390 basis points year-on-year excluding the notable item.","We delivered more than 50 basis point sequential quarter increase in ROTCE this quarter to 10.1%, achieving the IPO-based new interim target of 10%. This result was up over 200 basis points from the prior year quarter before the impact of the notable items. Our efficiency ratio of 59.4% for the third quarter also exceeded our medium term IPO target of 60%. We are very pleased with these strong results, which reflect continued execution against our strategic initiative and our commitment to focus on continuous improvement to drive further revenue growth, while maintaining operating expense discipline. Although, we have attained our ROTCE target, we are confident that we can do even more to drive further improvement. We are constantly seeking to run the bank better and leverage the potential of our franchise. There continues to be upside from leveraging the investment for the past several years, optimizing the balance sheet and focusing on continuous improvement in how we serve customers and maximize efficiency.","In a few minutes I will update you on the status of our TOP program, which will contribute further efficiencies and revenue opportunities, while funding investments to drive future growth.","Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on slide five and six, we continue to deliver attractive and disciplined balance sheet growth, which helped us drive a 4% linked quarter increase in NII for the quarter. We grew average loans and loans held for sale by 0.4% on a linked quarter basis and average retail loans were up 1.2%, offset by a small reduction in average commercial loans, largely reflecting the impact of the sale of $600 million of lower-return commercial loans in the second quarter.","Excluding the impact of the sale, average commercial banking loans and loans held for sale were up 1%. On a period-end basis total loans and loans held for sale were up 1.5% linked quarter and up 5% year-over-year. Average loans and loans held for sale were up 5.4% year-over-year, I'll provide some additional detail on the growth shortly, including the impact of our balance sheet optimization effort.","Net interest margin improved 8 basis points linked quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. This reflects a nice improvement in loan yields given the benefit of our balance sheet optimization effort, which included an ongoing mix shift towards higher return category and the rise in short rate.","The improvement in the margin, included a two basis point benefit from higher than expected commercial loan interest recovery. On a linked quarter basis consumer loan yields were up 11 basis points and commercial loan yields were up 25 basis points. An increase in funding cost partially offset the benefit of these higher loan yields. Deposit costs were higher by six basis points reflecting the rise in short rate and growth in the average commercial banking deposits.","Total average deposits increased by 2% from the prior quarter while period end deposits were down slightly given an elevated level of commercial deposits at the end of the second quarter. Our average LDR came in at 97.6%, which was consistent with our outlook. Total funding costs were up seven basis points, which reflects the full quarter impact of our $1.5 billion senior debt issuance in May.","Turning to fees on slide seven, on an underlying basis, non-interest income was stable linked quarter, as higher capital markets fees and service charges and fees were offset by lower mortgage fees and a reduction in foreign exchange and interest rate products. Capital Markets fees were a record for the quarter, and were up 47% year-over-year, showing continued momentum from the investments we've made in talent and broadening our capability, recording [ph] the strongest quarter given favorable capital markets, particularly in September.","We also saw an increase in M&A fees following our second quarter acquisition of Western Reserve, most remaining fee categories were relatively stable linked quarter. Year-over-year on an adjusted basis, non-interest income was up approximately 4% This reflects strong contribution from the capital markets business given our expanding capabilities and higher card fees, which was our higher purchase volume, along with the benefit of revised contract terms for core processing fee, which commenced in the first quarter of this year.","Mortgage banking fees were down as reductions in loans sale gains and spreads were partially offset by increase in servicing fees. Foreign exchange and interest rate products fees were also down, driven by a reduction in variable rate loan demand. Trust and investment sales were relatively stable as we continued to drive improvements in our mix of fee-based sale.","Turning to expenses on slide 8, on an underlying basis, expenses were up $9 million, largely reflecting higher salaries and employees benefits tied to revenue growth initiatives and higher outside services cost which reflect cost tied to our strategic growth initiatives, along with an increase in other expense, which included $4 million in expense associated with legacy home equity operational cost.","Year-on-year our adjusted expenses were up 3%. Salaries and benefits expense was higher, reflecting the impact of strategic hiring, merit increasing and higher revenue base incentive. We also saw an increase in outside services costs tied to our strategic growth initiative. We continue to remain highly disciplined on the expense front, as we identify opportunities to redeploy expense dollars part of lower value area in order to continue to self-fund our growth initiatives and enhanced capabilities to our customers.","On 3Q expenses include approximately $15 million for our strategic growth initiative, including our efforts to improve our retail customer experience, expand our wealth management business, broadening our capital market capabilities and bolster our M&A advisory business. We funded these franchise investments with about $14 million in efficiency savings realized through our TOP programs and operational transformation initiatives.","In short, we continue to seek opportunities to become more efficient which allows us to fund our growth initiatives and maintain strong operating leverage.","With that let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On slide 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. Overall, average loans and loans held for sale were up 0.4% on a linked quarter basis and 5.4% year-over-year, driven by growth in education, mortgage and unsecured retail on the consumer side and broad strength across commercial.","Commercial loan growth was muted by the impact of the sale of $596 million of lower return commercial loans and leases near the end of the second quarter, associated with our balance sheet optimization initiative. As I mentioned, NIM was up eight basis points in the quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. These results reflect further expansion of our loan yields given our balance sheet optimization efforts which contributed about half of the year-over-year increase, continued discipline on pricing and the benefit of higher rates.","We also benefited by about two basis points from higher than expected interest recoveries in commercial. Also we remain well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with assets sensitivities relatively unchanged at 5.4%.","On Page 10 and 11, we provide more detail on the loan growth in consumer and commercial. In consumer, we grew the portfolio 6% year-over-year, with continued expansion in the residential mortgages and education, which is largely tied to our refinance product, as well as continued strength in other unsecured retail loans, which continued to be driven by our product financing partnerships and our personal unsecured products.","We are also seeing ongoing benefits from our focus on enhancing our portfolio mix by driving growth in higher return categories. As you know, we have been slowing growth in auto and that should continue overtime. As a result of these efforts, in addition to higher rate, we've expanded consumer portfolio yield by 11 basis points in the quarter and 38 basis points year-over-year.","We also saw nice growth in commercial with average loan increasing 4% year-over-year, where we continue to execute well in commercial real estate, mid corporate and middle market, industry verticals, and franchise finance. This growth is muted somewhat of our efforts to reduce capital historically deployed against lower returning areas like select portions of the C&I book, where we aren't gaining in cross sell, and asset finance where we had originated big ticket leases given the overall RBS relationship. The overall goal is great returns and build strong relationships while still achieving good loan growth. The net results in Commercial reflected 25 basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a 75 basis point increase year-over-year.","On page 12, looking at the funding side, we saw a six basis points sequential quarter increase in our cost of deposits reflecting the impact of higher rates and growth and higher beta commercial deposits. We continue to find attractive balance sheet growth at accretive risk adjusted returns, which is driving NIM higher in spite of these rising deposit costs.","Our funding costs were up seven basis points sequentially which reflects the full quarter impact of our $1.5 billion senior debt issuance in the second quarter. Year-over-year our cost of funds were up 19 basis points reflecting the impact of higher rates along with greater long-term funding. This compares with overall asset yield expansion of 39 basis points. We expect a slower rate of increase in fourth quarter deposit costs given the timing of rate hike and the impact of some of our deposit strategy.","Next let's move to slide 13, and cover credit. Overall credit quality continues to be excellent reflecting the continued mix shift towards higher quality lower risks retail loans and a relatively overall clean position in the commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio decreased nine basis points versus the prior quarter to 85 basis points of loan this quarter while improving 20 basis points from the year ago quarter. The NPL coverage ratio improved to a 131% relative to 119% in the second quarter and 112% in the year ago quarter.","The net charge-off rate decreased to 24 basis points from 28 basis points in the second quarter with continuing favorable credit trends and results. Our commercial net charge-offs netted down to zero this quarter, reflecting an increase in recovery while retail net charge-offs were $4 million higher than the second quarter in part due to higher seasonality in auto.","Provision for credit losses of $72 million was $7 million above charge-offs which includes additional reserves for estimated hurricane losses. The reported provision was relatively stable compared to the second quarter and down $14 million versus a year ago reflecting the improvement in commercial due to recovery. Lastly as we continue to increase the mix of higher quality retail portfolios and our overall loan book, our allowance to total loans and leases ratio was relatively stable at 1.11%.","On slide 14, you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.1%. As part of our 2017 CCAR plan, this quarter we repurchased 6.5 million shares and returned over $350 million to shareholders including dividend. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.18 a share today and we have authority through CCAR to increase the quarterly dividend again to $0.22 per share in early 2018 subject to regulatory [ph] approval.","On slide 15, we showed a scorecard and how we are executing against our strategic initiatives. We are intensely focused on developing strong customer relationships and growing franchise in a profitable and sustainable way. In the consumer business, we are committed to becoming a trusted advisor to our customers through our clearer [ph] advice and product strategy. We continue to build out our mass affluent and affluent value propositions as these are key segments for us.","We are also investing in several projects that will reengineer critical services we provide to customers. This should result in the improved customer experience and greater efficiency. We continue to drive attractive loan growth across the network, which has been our education refinancing loan product and total partnership length and stronger credit which had attractive risk adjusted returns, as we optimize the balance sheet we have continue to reduce the auto portfolio in order to enhance return.","And while we continue to build scale and add capabilities highlighted by the launch of SpeciFi our new digital investment advisory platform, we also saw continued progress migrating sales mix towards fee based product which represented 41% of investment sales in the third quarter in 2017 compared to just 30% a year ago. We have increased our efforts to reposition and improve the returns in our mortgage business in the current environment. We trimmed our loan officer headcount by about 10% in the quarter in order to drive productivity and increase our focus on conforming loan mix. In addition, we are investing in a direct to consumer origination platform which we believe will provide a lower cost challenge to originate performing mortgages.","In Commercial, our expanded capabilities helped deliver another very strong quarter in capital markets as we continue to leverage the investments we've made including our enhanced bond underwriting platform and our recent acquisition of Western Reserve. Treasury solutions continues its steady progress with fee income growth of 7% year-over-year due to strong momentum in our commercial card program as purchased volume was up 35% year-over-year, driving a 31% increase in fees.","Our initiatives to deepen customer relationships are helping to drive continued balance sheet and customer growth with 5% average loan growth year-over-year reflecting strength in middle market, commercial real estate, corporate finance, franchise finance and mid-corporate. We're also starting to see the benefits of our geographic expansion initiatives with strong balance sheet and fee growth in those markets.","The TOP program had successfully delivered efficiencies that allowed us to self-fund investments to improve our platform and product offering. We have largely completed the actions needed for the TOP III program which launched in May 2016 and is expected to deliver run rate benefits of approximately $110 million by the end of this year.","Our TOP IV program is a further example of our commitment to continuous improvement and delivering value to our shareholders. As we work through our combination of initiatives to enhance revenues and drive efficiencies we are raising our target for the program by $5 million to a run rate pretax benefit of $95 million to a $110 million by late 2018.","On slide 16 you can see the steady and impressive progress we're making against financial target. As previously noted this quarter we hit our 10% post-IPO medium term ROTCE target. Since third quarter '13 our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 10.1%. Our efficiency ratio has improved by nine percentage point over that same timeframe from 68% to 59.4%, exceeding our medium term IPO target of 60%. And EPS continued on a very strong trajectory as well, up 160% in four years from $0.68 from $0.26 with a CAGR of 27%.","This rate of growth and improvement continues to outperform peers over the period as we have made efforts [ph] in terms of key performance measures. That said we still have opportunities for further improvement and we'll work hard to deliver that.","Now let's turn to our third quarter outlook on slide 17. We expect to produce linked quarter average loan growth of around 1% to 1.25%. We also expect net interest margin to remain broadly stable linked quarter. We are expecting non-interest income to be broadly stable given the record level of capital markets fees in Q3. We also expect to realize a modest TDR transaction gain in 4Q, which will be offset by costs associated with our strategic growth initiatives. We will treat those as notable items so you will be able to clearly see the operating trends in our business.","We expect expenses to be broadly stable in the fourth quarter, perhaps up a tad given seasonality. Additionally we expect provision expense to improve to the range of $80 million to $90 million, reflecting loan growth and a modest increase in commercial net charge-offs given the higher level of recoveries in the third quarter.","We expect the tax rate to tick up temporarily to around 34% for the fourth quarter as a result of an $8 million impact on the tax line tied to the launch of our historic tax credit investment program this year. The full year 2017 tax rate is expected to be about 31% on a reported basis and 32.25% on an underlying basis, excluding our 1Q '17 settlement.","We expect to manage our Step I ratio to around 10.9% with an expected average diluted share count of approximately $490 million to $495 million. And finally we expect the average LDR to be in the 97% to 98% range. With that let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay thanks John. And with that operator why don't we open up for some Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. I was wondering John if you can talk a little bit more about that balance sheet optimization side, and specifically how do you expect that to work through the asset yield side of the equation? What are the areas you'll continue to kind of move out of low return and how much can that help the overall asset yield going forward ex-rates?","John Woods","Yeah, thanks, Ken, good question. We're thinking that the key areas that we'll focus on would be in the consumer side, it could be even - I mentioned it before that auto is a low return business. We like our auto business. But we're moderating the portion of the balance sheet that auto will take up going forward. So you could see loan yields rising as a result of that.","On the commercial side, the areas that we're looking at, as you may have heard in my remarks include on an ongoing basis taking a look at the back book in C&I, which is a typical business as usual, kind of behavior. But we think that can add benefits to loan yields over time. As well as in asset finance. As we mentioned we have some legacy assets that were put on during [indiscernible] days in the larger ticket area. We've been moderating our exposure there. We'll also drive loan yields higher. So I think we've got a lot of benefit going forward in balance sheet optimization. So we're optimistic that, that will provide lift ex-rates in the future.","Bruce Van Saun","And Ken, it's Bruce, I'll just add to that. I think what we're really seeking to do is put a little more program discipline. I think we've been doing a good job of balance sheet optimization all along. But we're going to look for opportunities to shift the mix in consumer in particular and formalize that, and have targets in place. We'll look for pricing discipline across all portfolios John mentioned auto. But I think there is opportunities in elsewhere, in consumer and then in commercial in particular as we look at rollovers.","So we will have a program that allocates out responsibilities to specific individuals with targets that we monitor much the way we run the TOP program.","Ken Usdin","Great, thanks for that color Bruce. And just a second question, then how does that translate into earnings asset growth. I would presume that this assumes that out even as you deemphasize some and grow others that you'll still planned to net grow loans. And can you help us just triangulate how that translates between loan growth and turning into earning asset growth. This was the first quarter in a while where we saw flattening out on the earning asset growth side. Thanks guys.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. And there again I think the goal is to continue to achieve good levels, robust levels of earning asset growth going forward, while we're making those remixing decisions. But I think we've done that pretty well all along. I'd say the things that hit the numbers this quarter really was the aftermath of that late Q2 loan sale on commercial and then some.","I'd say the stretched conditions that we saw in commercial we're not really going to push on our rope here. If it's not there we'll be disciplined, but I think we saw in September things starting to pick up a bit. And I think the sentiment in Washington if we start to see the pro-growth agenda take place that can also create I think more loan demand which will ease some of the pressures that we're seeing on the commercial side. I might flip it over to Don for some color there.","Don McCree","Yeah I think that's exactly right. The other thing I'd mention is we did have a reasonably strong quarter in our bond businesses, which were reflected in a little bit of a reduction of our outstandings from utilization standpoint, particularly on the corporate businesses. So we picked up a little bit on the fee line while we saw a little bit of moderation in the loan growth.","Our pipelines look pretty strong right now and I would just echo what Bruce said around terms and conditions. It's very aggressive out there with everyone looking for loan growth. So if transactions are getting too stretched from a terms and conditions from a pricing standpoint, we'll probably stand back and let that go away. So that will be a moderating factor, but as we look deeper into the fourth quarter and into next year and begin to get some certainty around some policy coming out of Washington we think it could be a quite a good backdrop for continued expansion of the business.","And then the last thing I'd say as we are seeing a really good client growth in our expansion markets. So while terms and conditions are tough, we're adding clients and that should result in incremental demand as we go forward.","Bruce Van Saun","And I'd just add to that, I'll flip it to Brad too for some color. But the other thing I'd point out Ken is that we\u2019re very consistent on our consumer side loan growth. So we've been kind of in a 5.5%, 6% annualized growth rate every quarter which we saw again this past quarter. I think some of the reason we've been able to achieve that is we have unique spaces that we're playing, such as the education refinance market, such as personnel unsecured with our corporate partners. And so we expect to continue to see opportunities to build on that.","And so that can inure us from any little dips that we see in the overall consumer loan demands. So Brad maybe --.","Brad Conner","Yeah. Bruce I think you articulated it well. We've got a unique space in student and unsecured which is providing the runway for both of those to continue to grow. We've had good growth in mortgage lending and we believe that will continue. And really what we're talking about in auto really shouldn't change the trend line because we've already been pulling back in auto. In fact you saw that.","Ken Usdin","Yeah.","Brad Conner","Begin to reduce in and we've got out of this relationship a couple of quarter or last quarter or so. I think there is plenty of reason to believe that the trends that we've seen up until now can continue.","Ken Usdin","Yeah. Got it. Thanks very much.","Bruce Van Saun","Hey, Ken.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","John Pancari","Also on the balance sheet side, I just wanted to talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of deposit competition and is there pressure to implement pricing programs to bring in deposits? And also what do you see right now as to what your deposit beta is trending and what're you thinking could move?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, why don\u2019t I start and flip it to John. But you know I think the consumer side continues to be well behaved. And so I think we're continuing to see discipline hold throughout the market and the higher you get in the cycle you start to see the betas rise. But right now they are still quite low. On a commercial side obviously there is sophisticated companies there, as you particularly get up into the bigger size companies, they have treasurers and they're looking for - to participate as rates go up. They see the cost of their loans going up. So they want that cost on the funds that they're leaving with us to reflect the rate rise.","And so I think we've done a good job of continuing to grow there and rotate out some of the higher cost segments like financial institutions and government and try to get more organic growth coming from corporates. And then particular areas that we haven't really fished for deposits in like commercial real estate, we are launching some new products like escrow deposit. So I think overall, we're really pleased that we're tracking to our own models in terms of how things are going.","And the last thing I'll say is that we're also - even though we're paying up a little for these deposits, what we're doing with the funds in terms of the loan growth that we're funding is very attractive. So the areas that Brad just talked at Refi loans, the personal unsecured loans have very good yields. And so it continues to benefit us, these transactions at the margin, if you look at match funding of what's growing and the asset side what's growing on the deposit side, those were very accretive and they are accretive to our NIM and they are accretive to our ROTCE So with that why don't I pass it over to you John.","John Woods","Okay. Yes, just getting into the deposit beta part of it, so you asked about where we are on there? So on a cumulative basis through 3Q total deposit beta will be 17% and in quarter sequentially up 36% [ph] for the third quarter. We would see that coming down a bit in the fourth quarter, in part due to the fact the Fed going to take a quarter off and give here in the third quarter.","And also just give us some breathing room to allow the deposit initiative to really start to kick in. So on the consumer side, the investment that we're making in beta and analytics and really we're finding our promotional approach. And on the commercial side the investments that we're making in product offerings and targeting with respect to the segments that are more deposit rich. So that kind of optimization going on the deposit side, along with the where the macro coming out we will see the betas, in core betas come down there in 4Q.","John Pancari","Okay, John, thank you. That's helpful. Then separately on the credit side, I know you saw your order losses increase on a linked-quarter basis, and I know you pointed to seasonality there as well, but they are also up 14 basis points year-over-year. So can you just talk about what you're seeing there in terms of order losses and your outlook as we go forward? Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","Let me start perhaps and flip to you but, I would say on a linked-quarter there is partly seasonality. The other thing that we're seeing is a little bit of kick up related to our out of state, out of footprint state expansion initiatives that we commenced about two years ago. And I think there might have been a little adverse selection there in a couple of states. And so those linkages are having slightly higher loss rates in net earning [ph] is quite true. It's not anything that is significant. We have since when we decided that we're going to start to run down the size of the auto portfolio we've now exited in those states. And so it's limited to a fairly narrow period vintage wise but that's really I think the main thing that you're seeing there. Brad you want to add to that?","Brad Conner","You hit it. 2Q is seasonally low, that is the typical seasonally low period. So that explains the quarterly increase and to the point we've got very isolated, it was related to auto footprint 2016 vintages. We stopped those vintages right away. And the other thing I would just point out was we said for quite some time we've began to expand our credit from super prime to sort of mainstream prime. So we always expected a little bit of an increase and very much in line with what we expected and we have given some guidance on consumer losses a quarter plus ago.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, so not something that we're worried about. So tracking to what we expected.","Brad Conner","Tracking to what we expected exactly.","John Pancari","Okay and that auto footprint stuff, that should be - that adds to the [ph] year-over-year pressure?","Bruce Van Saun","I'm sorry you broke up there.","John Pancari","The year-over-year increase in auto losses that's mainly coming from the auto footprint stuff?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I think it's the two, it's the auto footprint plus the starting - when we've started to mixing more prime in with the super prime correct.","John Pancari","Got it, and the size of that auto footprint?","Bruce Van Saun","It's relatively small, and it's quite small on an overall basis. The vintage we're seeing the stress in we stopped originating in that, that's [Multiple Speakers] we spotted. So it'll be an immaterial piece of the portfolio.","John Pancari","Got it, okay, thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Klock of Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.","Brian Klock","Hey good morning gentlemen. So congratulations first on hitting the 10% return on common equity target. And then I'll start with the good momentum you guys have had in the commercial bank and with the sort of retooling there. A lot of your peers haven't posted positive C&I growth. So if you can talk about what you're seeing there, what's helping contribute to your better than peer growth in the commercial book?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, let me start and flip to Don, but I think there's a couple of things one is that we continued to add great coverage bankers as we've expanded geographically, brought in some really excellent bankers from some of our regional peers, to head up those efforts. And so as they build out their teams it's natural that we're going to gain market share, and as they bring some of their relationships over to citizens. We added a new Head of Healthcare industry vertical as well. So really part of it is just we're playing offence, we're trying to expand the overall customer base and that's allowing us to grow.","The other thing I'd say is that we've just focused on pockets where we do expect that there should be relatively more growth. So some of the mid-corporate bigger sized companies historically we were a little bit under scale there. We were focused more on the middle market. I think if you go back or maybe the four years I've been here, we've taken the middle market customer count from say 2000 to close to 2500 but the mid-corporate companies with revenues from $500 to $2.5 billion we've taken that from 450 to 750, and those tend to be bigger credits overall. So we've seen some nice growth there. So that's really I think reflective of the growth investments that we're making and then the focus that we have on particular industries and companies. Don?","Don McCree","I think that's right, the discipline around client planning and market planning is at a totally different level than it was a few years ago so that is presenting a little bit of a tailwind to us. And I think in addition to the bankers that we've hired, we vastly improved our product capability. So the relevance that we're going to market with across the trading rooms, across the capital markets, across M&A now it's resonating with the client. We're still a relatively mid-sized bank, but we have world class players in our sweet spot which is the middle market in the low end of the larger companies. We've just got great bankers out in front of these clients and it's terrific traction.","So we're very pleased with the progress we've made and as Bruce said, we've added probably 40 bankers in our expansion markets over the last quarter and half and they're from really strong local banks SunTrust and U.S. bank and JP Morgan and in the various markets and they bring clients with them and we're already winning business because of their relationships so it's very encouraging.","Brian Klock","And thanks for the color and just a follow-up on the consumer side, you mentioned earlier Bruce, the good growth from the investments you've made there and obviously the education book is growing pretty well, very strong, if maybe you can, you or Brad can kind of give us the break out in that education book of how much is come from your core refinance product the in-school and your relationship with SoFi.","Bruce Van Saun","I'll steer that directly to Brad.","Brad Conner","Yeah. So there was couple of events of that but if you - let me answer from the standpoint of originations in the third quarter. So the third quarter originations about 10% of our student originations came from purchasing SoFi loans, about 60% of our work came from the - 55% are so came from our own organic originations and then the remainder from are Ed Refi, yeah, I'm in the remainder from the in-school product. So it's about 90% of our block was - in the third quarter was organic originations.","Brian Klock","Perfect, thanks for your time guys.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","Ken Zerbe","In terms of - let's assume that the market - or we don't get the very hikes that the market expects, right, if we look at just simply the remixing of your assets into a higher yielding asset classes, but also so that I'm assuming a natural upward pricing and deposit, betas around deposit cost, can you get NIM expansion just from those two pieces without higher rates?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. I think enough for two Ken, but I think if you look at the year-on-year growth in the NIM of 21 basis points, about half of that was self-help, and then the other half was really due to rates, if rates didn't move higher I think you would have the less pressure on your deposit cost for sure. So I'm not sure you'd be getting the squeeze there, it would be the - what we saw when we were lower for longer, there is an opportunity cost of the asset sensitive position in no rate hikes, but there is general stability in that environment.","So it puts the onus back on us to keep remixing and being disciplined on pricing and some other things we've talked about earlier in the call around balance sheet optimization which I think can still help us get some NIM less, so John you want to add to that?","John Woods","Yeah. Well, said, I think the one way to think about is that we're still on a business ex perspective about, call it 15 basis points below the median of the normally situated [ph] peers. And so without rates moving, we feel like we're in the - we've made a lot of progress on balance sheet optimization. We feel like we can make a big dent in quality, just like we're doing on the profitability side, top of the house in ROTCE. We're going to be closing the gap on the NIM side as well. And that doesn't depend on rate, given what you heard Bruce, in terms of the mix shift alone drove about half of our benefits year-over-year.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Great. And just staying with the deposit side - sorry the funding side, I saw you used some cash to pay down a bit of FHLB this quarter. Are you done with most of sort of the restructuring of the deposit side, such that we are at a good point between wholesale borrowings and core deposits, or is there more to go?","John Woods","Yeah. I think we're [indiscernible], if you look at - I think we're in the neighborhood of 14 million [ph] or so of borrowings. That should be about stable going forward. We think about that in terms of generally wholesale borrowings funding portfolio. So we look at the whole balance sheet. We're in kind of at right spot. And so what we expect to see big changes in that going forward.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter, Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","Peter Winter","On the fee income side, the outlook for the fourth quarter is kind of stable. I'm just looking out in 2018, where you see some of the biggest opportunities on the fee income side? And then secondly any thought about fee income acquisitions to enhance some of that growth?","Bruce Van Saun","I'll start as usual and then maybe flip to John for some additional color. But I think the positioning we have on the commercial side is quite strong across everything we're doing. So our capital markets capability, the purchase of M&A capabilities with Western Reserve and integration and ability to start creating more leverage and more flow opportunities for them. And I think we have opportunities to just to continue to expand capabilities pushing to things like securitization and some other initiatives that we have.","So everything of the capital markets platform provided that the market conditions stay favorable, I think we can continue to see growth there. I do think on the global markets which is our FX and interest rate risk management platform that we are still scratching the surface. We used to be on RBS' platforms, we've migrated to our own platforms. We I think have a much broader capability in terms of product. And then also we've up tiered the quality of our team. So we have I think more intellectual capital and ability to show good ideas to our customer base.","So I'd see nice upside there. And then on our cash management business, we've also upscaled our capabilities. We're working through a replatforming of the business that will, I think, put us right up there with the top sized banks in terms of capabilities. And that will be implemented late in 2018. So I see some potential some momentum there. So I'm feeling good about what we've accomplished so far in commercial and I think we're positioned for further growth.","On the consumer side, it's been a little tougher slotting. One of the things we've invested heavily is our wealth management capability. We see really lots of potential there, untapped opportunity. And I think we're have the business positioned very well to start to gain further traction to have that show up in the numbers. I think at this point we're kind of expanding the relationships that we have inside the branch business, but we're moving more towards the mix of managed money as opposed to what we did historically, which was more transaction based sales and annuity type products.","I think that's great for customers and it's great for us in the long-term, but it creates a near term revenue headwind which the lines haven't really crossed yet. So we've been building up our managed money book. That's creating I think more of an annuity type revenue stream going forward, but that's resulted in the business being somewhat flattish over the past six quarters or so. I expect we'll start to see that breakout and we should see growth there in 2018. And then the mortgage business has been - we've done some very good things and putting a good foundation in place.","Our servicing and fulfillment capabilities are amongst the best rated by JD Powers consistently and that wasn't the case the couple of years ago. But we still have to, I think hone the model to get more conforming loan officers that are better integrated into the branches and build some additional capabilities direct to consumer potentially enter into the correspondent business. So there is more work to do there, but ultimately there will be revenue upside there as we get that right. So that's kind of a long winded answer. I don't know if there any additional color John that you want to add to that?","John Woods","I think you hit it. We're making investments across these four or five businesses, and I think that capital markets we have seen some breakout. But I don't think we call any of these businesses fully insured [ph], and so I think that's the forward-looking view on [indiscernible] going forward.","Bruce Van Saun","Anything from Don or --?","Don McCree","No, I think you've covered it.","Brad Conner","The only thing I would add is that I think on the mortgage side in terms of the opportunity to continue to grow speed, bring more scale, we talked about possibly getting into the corresponding business, maybe acquisition and then getting more scale and a very good servicing operation that we have is a real opportunity for us.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, great. And then the last part you said potentially more acquisitions, I think yeah. I think we will look to do smart bolt on acquisitions potentially in the areas that we just talked about, if it can get us farther down the track faster I like to say. So like with the M&A boutique, Western Reserve that we did in 2017 they took us from roughly six M&A bankers to 36 M&A bankers which given the size client base we have is where we need to be. We potentially still can scale up I think and serve our customers well. But if there is things we find in wealth or capital markets or the payments space that make sense to us, we're going to start having the periscope out and start to look at things.","But again I think there will be very digestible from a size standpoint. They won't knock us off our game in terms of capital return. And so I think they will just be things that we feel make sense. They're down the fairway, they fit and they can help address the need to get up that fee percentage and do more for our customer base.","Peter Winter","Great. Thanks a lot, great color. Thank you.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Vivek Juneja","Thanks. Hi Bruce, hi John. Question on your consumer loans, loans to - for financing iPhones and Vivint [ph] et cetera. Can you give some color on how that's doing, it seems like we could need to see growth there which - off those products, are you seeing more of it? And also some color on the credit performance you've seen since you've started this several quarters ago now.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I'll take that. And we're very pleased with the programs. Continue to go very well in both the Apple program and Vivint program are growing for us. They've been very good partners. We do have other similar type of retailers and merchants coming to us asking us to work with them on building programs for them. So we certainly think that there is upside. The credit performance has been very good and in line with our expectations and I'll just throw out a reminder that all the programs that we've entered into up until now have a degree of risk sharing. So that even makes the credit performance more stable on those programs. So all in all, we're very bullish on that as a business opportunity.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First, just a little clarification, on the NIM outlook the broadly stable, is the base for that the 3.05 or is the base 3.05 excluding the clash loan recovery, so 3.03?","Bruce Van Saun","That's the 3.05.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great, thanks. And then I remember back at the time of the IPO you had the midterm 10% ROTCE target. And then you've also had a longer term target and I think you had some charts pointing to something more in the 12% range for that. I guess the question will be you've got to the 10% this quarter, how long do you think long-term is now?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I think the 10% we've build those is our medium term IPO base targets. And I think what we have said all along is let us achieve those targets before we raise the bar. It feels great to work hard and execute well and hit those targets. And think we will as we work on our budget for next year and freshen our strategic plan, you could expect us at some point next year to give you some additional targets that would be higher than where we are today.","So I said in my opening remarks that I do think, what's gotten us this far, what's taken us from 4 to 10 is still pretty much the crux of how we want to operate the business. We want to be disciplined on expenses to try to find efficiencies. So we confirmed our growth and investments. We have a very strong capital position, so we can continue to grow the balance sheet and bring new customers to the bank. We're investing in the fee businesses and we should start to see increasing traction through deeper customer relationships.","So everything that's taken us from 4 to 10 should be able to continue to propel us higher as long as we stay really disciplined and execute really well. So stay tuned and we'll I think have a comparable set of targets that we would move higher and that will be sometime in 2018 we'll reveal that.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thanks very much.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But just on the tax rate, what should we think about for 2018? Obviously some noise in the fourth quarter that you've alluded to, but what's a good run-rate? I know there been some efforts at the top to lower that in general?","Bruce Van Saun","I would say I'll start and John, if you want to add color, but if you look at the underlying rate for the year take out the noise of some recoveries in Q1 and historical credit matter in Q4, we're about 32 in a quarter, there is a constant tension between the growth in net income that we have and then the planning that we can actually do to knock the rate down from what statutory rates are. So we will continue to work through that, and we'll give you guidance on that in January when we have our year-end call, and give our outlook for 2018.","But those are really the dynamics. We have income growth which comes through at a higher fully effective rate, and then we have to figure out plans like low income housing and other federal credit programs, that we invest and we continue to lock the rating around 32 which is where it is now. Obviously the wild card in all this is the corporate tax reform and we will be a big beneficiary of that staying at 32% rate. Clearly would increase our after tax cash flow and our EPS and ROTCE and all those measures by a significant amount.","So certainly I think there is broader benefits to the economy from getting a tax reform and tax cut package in place, but there is specific benefits to regional banks and to us in particular even our high tax rate. And that also may knock out some of the program. So right now I think the scuttlebutt is that low income housing would be continued, but many of the other programs around energy, around historical tax credits, the broad range will be up and they will be grandfathered but you won't be able to continue with some of those programs but there will really be less need to do those kind of investments if the rate is lower in the first place. So, John, anything to add on that?","John Woods","Yes, just to add that so our tax rate being in the neighborhood of 32%, the attention that we have indicated [ph]. I think part of reason for that is that we are under penetrated in tax advantaged investments and the text credit opportunities that many of our peers have availed themselves over many, many years. So we got started as a little bit latter and we are catching up and we will catch up overtime and continue to invest in those programs. So but you'll see that that offset our earnings growth being offset by a ramp on catching up to the pack in the tax exempt area.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. It's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Due to time constrains, we will turn the call back over to Mr. Van Saun at this time.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Actually we could go, if there is a few more people in the queue, we can take up two or three more, Justin.","Operator","Sure, we do have some questions here in queue for you. Next we'll go to line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thank you, well saved by the bell there. I want to ask you about when you look at the increase in your loan yields, 75 basis points increase or 75 basis points increase in the fed fund rate, so again almost a 100% beta on your asset side. Now some of that's related to just being asset sensitive and some that's related to the balance sheet optimization. But there is a strategic decision ahead of the company which is, when do you begin to think about neutralizing some of your asset sensitivity. So just wanted to get a feel for how you're thinking about and tackling that strategic decision that's in front of you?","Bruce Van Saun","All right, so what we've seen overtime is that we managed that, in let's just talk about the gradual rate rise scenario up 200. We've been in that 6% to 7% benefit position from that scenario. That's overtime come down to around 5.5% and it happens naturally just as rates start to rise - we start to roll down. I still think that, that positioning to stay asset sensitive, as we are in the early part of the rate list cycle is a sensible place to be, because we have a coil spring that releases, and every time the fed continues to move, and rates continue to go higher. And I don't think that cycle is through yet. So we'll stay asset sensitive, we'll glide down and that's how we are planning to manage it.","I think it's too early to go upon a big hedge and try to capture the additional income because I think you give up a fair amount of your upside. John, anything you want to add?","John Woods","No I think you hit it well, nothing I would add.","Marty Mosby","And then you mentioned your loan to deposit ratio is one of the things you're really guiding towards, is that because you feel like that is a constraint in liquidity or do you look at more the liquidity coverage ratio as the way you're managing liquidity on a tactical basis?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah I think you hit it there. I mean we started to build liquidity coverage ratio as basically how we look at those, and I think that's a much more sensitive measurement of what our liquid asset position is versus what deposit outflows could be in [indiscernible].","So it's a much more reliable measure and we have a strong LCR ratio. Year over year it's more of an output of that, but nevertheless it is a helpful measure to report and easy to calculate, it's right off the balance sheet. So we look at both, but the primary measure really is the LCR.","Marty Mosby","So no reason to think there's any constraints from a liquidity standpoint in the near term?","John Woods","Well, no. We manage all of our resources as if there are constrained, right I mean so capital liquidity is better up, and we balance our liquidity, our sources against our opportunities on the asset side. And so we're seeing nice flows on the deposit side. We have 2% growth in deposits this quarter which is high end of peers. So we're feeling pretty good about our ability to fund our growth going forward.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah and the LCR is well above the minimums. So feeling quite good about where the liquidity and funding position sits today.","Marty Mosby","Perfect thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. Could you talk about the credit performance that you're seeing within the student loan portfolio from the 10% originations from SOFI and the 55% organic and then also the in school product that you also mentioned?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah they're all performing extremely well. We monitor it very, very closely, as you would fully expect, we look at each and every little vintage, look at the emergence of the loss curves for each individual vintage, and each and every vintage of those portfolios is performing right in line with the expectation that we have, and in some cases better. So we don't see any stress in those portfolios.","Keep in mind that we play very much in the super prime space as it relates to those products. So we have average FICOs in the 780 range or above for all of our originations. So these are very high credit quality loans and we're improving the credit quality with our cash flow of the borrowers with the refi products. So they're performing extremely well.","Kevin Barker","Okay and then a quick follow up on some of the deposit conversation, are you seeing deposit betas accelerate in certain markets more than others, specifically in the Northeast versus some of your Midwest branches?","Bruce Van Saun","Deposit betas, is there is geographical disparity in that?","Brad Conner","There is a little bit I mean we certainly see some competition, some difference in competition and in terms of what are the lean rates for money markets and CD, there is a geographic mix to that. But beyond that no measurable difference then in betas by geography.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah so nothing large scale today, as Brad mentioned. Maybe a bit more traffic in the CD area where we're seeing it, seeing some great [indiscernible], but not as much in money market. So our cost of funds impact is limited.","Kevin Barker","Thank you.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay Justin, we probably have time for one more.","Operator","Certainly, our last question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS. Your line is now open.","David Eads","Hello, thanks for taking the question. Going back to the balance sheet, there was a - about a little over half a billion dollar increase in the other loans held for sale category. Just curious is that agency mortgages or is that some other sort of loan portfolio that's being positioned for sale? And I guess kind of on the mortgage side you're talking about repositioning that business. Should we expect the amount to be held on a balance sheet, the pace of growth on the balance sheet to slow, or is that really, okay you're going to try to keep [ph] now that you see business growing about the same pace and just accelerating the pace?","John Woods","I'll try to jump in on that and others can add in. So in the other - what's held for sale is mortgage stuff but it's also loans that were pending syndication. So you'll see both of that driving the held for sale category and so they are both drivers, and we had flow in both of those areas that would increase to the health of those numbers at the end of September in particular the syndication volume that is yet to be pulled down.","On the mortgage fronts, yeah, I mean I think we're looking to remix our off balance sheet leverage, if you will, and some non-conforming piece, but the non-conforming is still a good product for us. We're seeing good risk adjusted returns there, they drive customers in to the bank. Those customers are candidates for deposit products and maybe are actually existing customers of the bank that we're serving and they are also candidates for our other offerings. We are looking to drive both of those and the off balance sheet conforming piece won't come at the sacrifice of non-confirming piece.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay any color Brad or --?","Brad Conner","No, I think that John said it exactly right. We are looking to really just acceleration of the non-conforming piece.","David Eads","Right, thank you.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Well, why don't I just wrap up the call here by thanking you once again for dialing in today. We truly appreciate your interest. It's really gratifying to hit our milestones this quarter. We're going to continue to stay focused on the work in front of us, yet to come to build a great bank and to do even better. So thank you and have a great day.","Operator","That now concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5398":["Citizens Financial Group Inc.

And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I\u2019ll be your operator for today's one hour call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now, I'll turn the conference over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking time to join us this morning. We're going to kick things off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun. Eric Aboaf, will also be reviewing our third quarter results and then we'll open the call for questions. In the room today with us are also Brad Conner, Head of our Consumer Bank, and Don McCree, Head of our Commercial Bank.","I'd like to remind everyone that in addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation and financial supplement, and these materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. I need to remind you that during the call, we make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K we filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP, may be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement that are available on our website","And with that, I'll hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Thanks, Ellen, and good morning. It's a pleasure to have the chance to review our earnings release today. In addition to being joined by Eric, Brad, and Ellen on the call, as usual, I would like to extend a warm welcome to Don McCree, who is now heading our commercial business. I'd also like to publicly thank Steve Woods and Bob Rubino for the terrific job that they did in leading the commercial business on an interim basis.","So let me offer a few comments on the quarter before I hand it over to Eric to take you through some of the financial details. We're very pleased with our continued ability to drive positive operating leverage in a challenging environment. We're executing well on our strategic initiatives. We're delivering good loan and deposit growth, while investing in our fee-based businesses.","We continue to find efficiencies in our cost base that allow us to self fund investments that we're making growth, in technology, and in risk and compliance. Positive operating leverage was 4% revenue growth over 1% expense growth for 3% on a year-over-year basis. It was 1% over zero expense growth for 1% on a sequential quarter basis. This is driving our efficiency ratio and our profitability improvement.","We also are pleased with the efforts to arrest the NIM decline, quote unquote, as we grew our NIM by 4 basis points in Q3. We're focused on boosting asset yield through mix, risk appetite, and pricing adjustments, and on halting the growth in the cost of our deposit growth. Eric has been very intensely focused on this with our business heads and we're making good traction on that front.","A few other items to note. First off, our top two initiatives are on track. Second, our asset sensitivity continues to be stable with the second quarter. As we know, the Fed will eventually move rates, and in the meantime, we have profitability levers to pull. And thirdly, our balance sheet metrics all remain strong across capital, liquidity, funding, and credit.","A real highlight for us in the quarter is that we continue to attract great talent into leadership positions at the company. Besides Don, we've brought in new heads of wealth, mortgage and retail distribution over the past several weeks and we've added a distinguished Fed alumnus to our Board. This is an important byproduct of our separation from RBS and our journey to independence.","So with that, let me turn it over to Eric.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. Overall, I feel good about the progress we are making in delivering our growth and efficiency initiatives. We are actively managing the balance sheet to deliver attractively priced loan and deposit growth, and we continue to demonstrate strong expense discipline in the face with challenging industry landscape.","In my comments today, I'll refer to our third quarter earnings presentation, which you can find at citizensbank.com. Let's start on page 3, with our third quarter financials. On a reported basis, we generated GAAP net income of $220 million, which was up $30 million, or 16%, from the second quarter, and up $31 million, or 16%, from the third quarter 2014.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, up $0.05 from the second quarter and up $0.06 from third quarter 2014. Linked-quarter results reflect revenue growth and lower non-interest expense, driven by a $40 million decrease in restructuring charges and special items.","We also recorded $7 million in preferred dividends this quarter associated with our $250 million March issuance. Those dividends are accrued on a semi-annual basis. So we won't record a dividend again until the first quarter.","In the second quarter, we recorded the final restructuring charges and special items associated with our efficiency initiatives, separation from RBS, and Chicago divestiture. And page 4 outlines these items. For the remainder of the slides, I'll cover our reported results in this quarter compared with prior period adjusted results to highlight our core trend.","Turning to page 5, we posted solid operating results with net income of $220 million and EPS of $0.40. Net income increased $5 million, or 2% linked quarter, as the benefit of revenue growth and lower expense was partially offset by a higher tax rate.","Relative to the year ago quarter, net income was up 9% and EPS was up 11%, reflecting 4% revenue growth and relatively stable expenses. These results are a nice clean quarter, with little in the way of noise, no restructuring charges, and no unusual items.","We had a slight up tick in other income, offset by a slightly higher tax rate, but the P&L reflects our fundamentals. We continue to generate positive operating leverage on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis.","We grew revenue by 1% linked quarter on good growth and net interest income. And on a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue 4% with traction in both net interest and non-interest income, as we made progress on our growth initiatives. We continue to focus on managing costs, and this quarter, we held expenses flat as we build efficiency improvement, while also reinvesting in the business.","We continue to make measurable underlying progress against our goals of enhancing our efficiency. These efforts resulted in a 66% efficiency ratio in the quarter, down nearly a point from the second quarter and 2 points lower than prior year.","Credit costs also remained credit relatively stable on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Our return on tangible common equity remained relatively stable at 6.6%, up slightly over last year, as we paid our first semi-annual preferred dividend and had a slightly higher tax rate. Our tangible book value per share grew 2% to $24.52.","On slide 6, let's take a closer look at net interest income, which grew $16 million, or 2% linked quarter, driven by good loan growth, an additional day in the quarter, and a 4 basis point increase from the net interest margin.","Compared to the third quarter of 2014, net interest income grew $36 million, or 4% over the prior year, driven by an 8% in loan growth, partially offset by a slight decrease in the net interest margin due to continued pressure from the low rat environment.","Over the past 12 months, we grew earning assets by 5%, or $5.8 billion, reflecting good momentum in both commercial and consumer, as we continue to deleverage our enhanced lending platform, technology, product set, and strong capital position to serve our clients.","As you know, on page 7, we are really keenly focused on defending the margin in this extended low rate environment. In this quarter, we took additional steps to further enhance the efficiency of our balance sheet.","We reduced the size of our cash and short term investment portfolio, along with the associated collateralized borrowing that funded this position. This was worth 3 basis points.","We also have been focused on fine tuning the mix of our loan portfolio and ensuring that we are gathering deposits in a more cost-effective manner.","Consumer loan yields were up as we continued to grow attractive opportunities in student and auto. Underlying commercial yields picked up slightly. We remain highly focused on driving originations and select products that exhibit wider margins and stronger returns such as middle market and industry verticals.","We did see slightly higher deposit costs, given the impact of some second quarter promotional pricing. That said, we are encouraged that we been able to slow the up tick in cost through a better product mix, target marketing, and sharper pricing discipline.","We are continuing to maintain our asset sensitivity. We are at 7.1%, assuming a 200 basis point gradual rise in rates off the 12 month forward curve compared with last quarter at approximately 7.2%. This sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the current [ph] and the first 50 point move would generate significant benefit over a flat rate scenario.","On slide 8, non-interest income decreased $7 million linked quarter, as we saw good results in both capital markets and mortgage banking. In third quarter, we experienced an MSR valuation swing of $8 million and capital market fees declined in line with the overall market trends.","These declines were partially offset by growth in other income and service charges and fees, while card fees, trust and investment sales, and FX fees were all stable linked quarter.","The growth in other income included the impact of an $8 million gain that we recorded on the sale of two branch properties. The remainder of the growth in other merely reflects what normal puts and takes across the number of lines in this category. We also saw a $7 million decrease in securities gains this quarter compared to last quarter.","On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased $12 million as the benefit of higher other income, card, and trust and investment service fees was offset by decreases in mortgage banking fees, FX, and capital market fees.","Moving on to non-interest expense on slide 9. Given the prolonged low rate environment, it\u2019s particularly important that we do a good job on expenses. We remain committed to our goal of generating strong operating leverage by actively managing our expense base, while continuing to invest across the franchise to both enhance our products and distribution capabilities.","Third quarter expenses came in at $798 million, down slightly compared to the second quarter, reflecting lower costs across several categories. Year-over-year adjusted expense increased $9 million, or 1%, as lower salaries and benefits and amortization of software was more than offset by an increase in other expense, depreciation, and outside services.","Headcount decreased modestly during the quarter and remained relatively flat compared to the third quarter 2014, even though we added roughly 430 salespeople across our consumer and commercial growth initiatives.","As I mentioned earlier, we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 66%, which was down nearly 1 point from the second quarter and down 4 points from the prior year quarter, given the benefit a positive operating leverage.","We continue to stay focused on delivering our growth and efficiency initiatives, including the Top II programs to continue this favorable trend, while it's in its early days, Top II is on track.","Now turning to the consolidated average balance sheet on slide 10, because of the balance sheet repositioning that I mentioned earlier, our total earning assets of $123 billion were relatively stable with last quarter, as growth in commercial and retail loans was offset by a decrease in short-term investments.","Consumer loan growth reflected continued momentum in student, mortgage and auto loans, which was partially offset by a continued decline in home equity balances and the rundown of the non-core portfolio.","Commercial growth was driven by commercial real estate, franchise finance, and corporate finance. As I mentioned, we continue to refine our strategies to grow deposits any more cost effective way, and here we also continue to gain traction.","Average deposits in the third quarter increased $2.5 billion, or 2%, over the second quarter and were up $9.3 billion, or 10%, over the third quarter 2014.","On slide 11, consumer banking loans increased $863 million, or 2%, sequentially, driven by growth in student, mortgage and auto. Consumer loan yields increased 1 basis point, reflecting continued improvement in mix, as we focus on attractive opportunities in student and our own auto origination.","On slide 12, commercial loans increased $524 million, or 1%, linked quarter, driven by growth in commercial real estate, franchise finance, and corporate finance. We're being thoughtful about how we claim commercial, given strong competition and our effort to improve risk adjusted returns and yields, and our results also reflects some normal seasonality.","Slide 13 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs. Average interest-bearing deposits grew $2.1 billion, or 3%, linked quarter, with particular strength in money market. We were also making progress in growing DDA accounts.","While our deposit costs crept up again this quarter, the pace of growth slowed, as we began refining our retail promotional rate offerings to be more targeted than in the first few quarters following last year's Chicago divestiture. We also carefully - we calibrated some above market commercial deposit pricing. Compared to a year ago, average interest-bearing deposits increased $8.4 billion or 13%.","On slide 14, we've laid out the key initiatives that support the balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan, as well as our incremental top two initiatives and assessed progress during the quarter.","We are continuing to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these initiatives and our intensely addressing some of the challenges in mortgage and wealth. In asset finance, we need to shift our origination strategy, given RBS's retrenchment in the US, as they had been an important source of flow.","On slide 15, I'll hit the highlights on credit quality, which remained benign, with net charge-offs at $75 million and provision of $76 million. Asset quality remains very, very good.","Our NPLs were down $16 million, or 2% in aggregate in the quarter. Our allowance to loans remain relatively stable at 123 basis points, while our allowance to NPL ratio improved from 114% to 116%. We do not see any meaningful issues in our relatively modest sized energy portfolio.","Turning to slide 16, our capital position remains robust. This quarter's CET 1 ratio was 11.8%, which was well above our peers. We're above our LCR requirement and our LDR has been relatively consistent.","In August, we executed a $250 million subordinated debt issuance and repurchased shares from RBS, which on a pro-forma basis impacted our CET 1 ratio by 22 basis points, but had no impact on our total capital ratio.","Turning to slide 17, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter, but all in the context of the full year 2015 outlook that we've previously provided and that we broadly reaffirm today.","Compared to the third quarter of 2015, we expect to produce linked quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%, broadly consistent with recent quarterly level. We also expect net interest margin to remain stable with Q3.","We will continue to focus on improving asset yields and better managing the cost of deposits. We expect modest expense growth in Q4 due to technology projects coming on the stream, as well as seasonal factors.","We would expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain strong and favorable, but we would expect the provision to build in Q4.","Finally, we expect that our CET 1ratio will remain relatively unchanged from the Q3 11.8% and we will manage the LDR to around 97% to 98%.","With that, let me turn it back over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks, Eric. And I guess, in summary, we feel pleased with our performance this quarter. We have a good plan and we're executing well against that plan. So with that, why don't, Brad, we open up the line and take some Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Could you just talk about the approach to managing the balance sheet going forward with rates seemingly staying lower for longer? And even if we do get an increase, maybe it's just 1 or 2. You guys are obviously very asset-sensitive.","How do you think about maintaining that asset sensitivity versus maybe bringing it down a little bit to protect the NIM going forward?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Why don't I start, Eric, you can add to it. We've consciously maintained relatively stable asset sensitivity. We do think the Fed will move, and I'd like to refer to our position as a coiled spring that will release and deliver some meaningful net interest income benefit.","At this point, late in the zero cycle, zero phase, to go increase our asset duration meaningfully would potentially snatch the feat from the jaws of victory. So we will take some steps at the margin to recognize that the horizon is being pushed out and it's likely to be more gradual than initially we anticipated, the market anticipated, but I don't think we should change the position in a substantial way. Eric?","Eric Aboaf","Matt, I'd add the following. Our asset sensitivity is highly concentrated at the front end. 80% of it literally comes through in year one, 6% front-end in year two. So the opportunity cost isn't particularly large.","To close down our position, it's not as if we put on a five- or 10-year duration positions. We literally have to put on one and two year swaps, and if you think about what you can earn on that, it's actually quite small.","And so the payback, even based on current forward curves, and clearly they swing around, it's 3 to 4 times. So you're really in a position where we feel like there's some decent upside, even with these lower forecasted and slower forecasted rate increases once perhaps every six months. That's a better position, that's a position that we'd prefer to hold for the time being.","Matt O'Connor","Then just separate from the rate discussion, as we think about the balance sheet optimization that you made some good progress on this quarter, and obviously that helping the NIM, how much more of that is there to do from here?","It's obviously good if you can grow net increased income and keep the balance sheet stable, but how much more opportunity is there to, call it, re-mix, or as you mentioned, tweak some deposit pricing, how much more and how much does that play out in the NIM over time?","Eric Aboaf","What we have is we have an opportunity to continue to defend NIM with rates in a relatively flat scenario here. We've been -- for example, in the deposit side, we've been inching up our deposit costs about 2 basis points per quarter over the last three, four quarters.","We've been able to slow that down to 1 basis point and you can imagine, we're trying to slow it down even further. With Don and Brad's support, we found some good opportunities on the deposit side to do that.","On loans, the worker continues. It's primarily product mix in consumer, its tactical pricing and returns and some mix in commercial, a mix of product mix there in commercial and pricing acumen and intensity. That in a way helps us defend the back book roll off which continues.","So in a flat rate environment, we have an ability to keep NIM stable. We will try to tick it up a little bit, but we've got it stable, and for the time being, until we see some real rate rises, we have some confidence in being able to continue to deliver that.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I guess, first of all, I thought it was great that you guys were able to keep expenses down, given the further investment in the business.","Could you just give us an update, though, on where you stand with Top II going forward, or at this point?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, sure. So in Top II, as you recall, Ken, there were three major categories. One was expenses, one was pricing initiatives, and then one was the broader revenue initiatives. On the expense side, we're making excellent progress around the main two thrusts there.","One is what we call ops transformation, where we are stepping back and taking a look at how we're organized and making some changes, and kind of ultimately we're aiming for the hat trick, we like to call it.","We want to have a better customer experience, better risk, it controls, and of course efficiencies, and we're starting to see some of those efficiencies come through. They'll come through additionally in Q4 and have a full-year effect on 2016","We also have a greater effort to work through vendor contracts, and looking for opportunities to consolidate and get better pricing from vendors. That has been part of top two and that is also flowing through as we work through that initiative.","So we feel quite confident that we've already got that in motion. We are starting to see some of the benefits come through and it is on track. Pricing, similarly, a bunch of that is on the commercial side, cash management is one area.","We're rolling that out in waves and so you're going to start to see that flow through here in the second half of the year. Then will get a full-year effect of that in 2016, so we see that tracking to expectations in terms of client impacts and our ability to execute that program. On the third bucket of revenues, we have a couple of major thrusts there, which are in pilot phase. That's largely on the consumer side; there's a little bit on the commercial side there, as well.","So we've been running the pilot through Q3, we've expanded the pilots into Q4, and we're putting the infrastructure in place to do the full rollout early in 2016. Everything we've seen in those pilots is positive in terms of our ability to deliver the revenue potential on the full program. So, broadly speaking, I'd say, we feel good about the program taken as a whole.","Ken Zerbe","All right. That's great. Then just really quickly, on the iPhone financing, I know it's a small piece of your business, but any commentary on how that financing program has been going?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, look, I'll start, Brad, you can obviously put more depth and color to it, but I'd say we were very pleased. First off, that we were able to secure the partnership with such an iconic company like Apple, and they certainly have high expectations for their partners in terms of delivering an outstanding customer experience.","What we're most pleased about is we've certainly executed the program extremely well and have really satisfied Apple as a worthy partner and the customers are getting good experiences as they come in on to this program.","It is ramping about to expectations, so it's a relatively modest pilot in the stores at this point. It will move later to online, which will ramp it up to greater size, and then obviously, you get into the whole Christmas season, and through Thanksgiving to Christmas is a sprint.","So we do expected to see a fairly good level of ramping up in Q4, but we're very pleased with what has occurred to this point. Brad?","Brad Conner","Bruce, you did a very good job of covering it. Also it started very much in line with what we expected. It was nominal impact on the quarter, about $60 million in balances for the quarter, so it was a nominal impact on the quarter, but it is giving us confidence that it's a very viable program for us in the long run.","You said it well, we're pleased and Apple is pleased and the partnership is off to a very good start so there's strong potential for the program for the long run.","Ken Zerbe","Great. All right. Thank you very much.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay.","Operator","And our next will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. My first question is on the efficiency ratio. You clearly have made good progress year-over-year from 68% to 66%, and given that, like Matt said investors are much more of the mindset of lower for longer.","Could you take us to have much more improvement that could be in 2016 in this efficiency ratio if rates don't normalize?","Bruce Van Saun","I think the key to that is really just to stay focused on delivering positive operating leverage. Regardless of what happens to rates, we have a good capital position and an ability to grow loans, and if we do a good job on NIM, that will flow straight through and create a good continuing source of revenue momentum. We're investing in our fee-based businesses.","Some of the people that we put in place have to season and that should help our fee projections going forward, and we are going to continue to hire and continue to build those business, but we will be making a spread over who we put in place and what it costs us to put those people in place. So that should be contributive to positive operating leverage.","Then on the expense side, we've worked very hard to try to self-fund the investments we need to grow. So that means a continued effort to look at the zero base of expenses and go in and find places where we might be inefficient and pull -- extracted those expenses so that we can try to keep overall expenses as close to flat as possible.","We were able to achieve that to quarters in a row, which is really quite something when you consider the amount we are putting into technology and the amount were putting into playing offense in our growth initiatives and some of the demands on us from an overall risk and control and regulatory standpoint.","So we think it ultimately gets a little harder. We've called out in Q4 that we'll see a little bit of growth in expenses. Some of the technology depreciation and software amortization is going to come on stream in Q4.","But we're committed to really staying 100% focused on delivering the positive operating leverage because that ultimately drives the improvement in the efficiency ratio and it drives the improvement in our profitability and our ROTCE.","So as we go through our budget process into next year, every member of the management team has a real focus on that.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just a follow-up question for Eric. Given that you're compliant with the LCR, should we think about the size of the securities portfolio from here relative to your loan and deposit growth?","Eric Aboaf","The securities portfolio is right-sized to be honest. We run an LCR above the requirements but not way above purposefully. So we got a good-sized balance sheet. You saw that we compressed it a bit this past quarter as we took out some collateralized borrowings that we didn't think we were particularly valuable to have and in the LCR world you don't get credit for.","That had a small reduction effect on the portfolio, but the portfolio is properly sized. Over time, you'll see that we will use a mix of MBS and treasuries from that portfolio and then classic vanilla interest rate swaps to manage the duration.","So it's within the range, probably go up and down a bit here and there, but within the range for now.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Thank you so much for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vivek Junenja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Vivek Junenja","Hi, Eric. Hi, Bruce. A couple of questions. Can you update us on your plans on loan portfolio acquisitions, since that was something that you all had done more actively last year and even earlier this year?","Third quarter, it doesn't seem like you had anything material, but if you could just update us on that?","Bruce Van Saun","I'd say we always do you those portfolio acquisitions as a bridge to building out our own capabilities. The SCUSA arrangement was put in place before we had really rolled out our broader platform and our ability to really penetrate the prime sector of the market. And as we have been able to scale our own capabilities up, we've been scaling back on that SCUSA flow agreement.","We also opportunistically entered into an arrangement with SoFi on the student loan side. We like the overall marketplace and the product that they originate has characteristics of very high credit quality and good risk-adjusted returns like our own growth and so that allows us to accelerate our growth a little bit. That is a modest sized program. It's about $500 million over the course of the year.","Other than that, at this point, we don't have much going on or much that we are looking at. But we will continue to be opportunistic. As I said, we have a very good capital position and we're putting that capital to work through our own channels and building client relationships and building our book of relationships and customers that we can cross-sell into.","But again, if there are opportunities that come up, we will take a look. Brad, why don't I ask you for\u2026","Brad Conner","Yes. You did a great job. I was just going to add one point to this, which is we did step the SCUSA portfolio purchases down from second quarter to third quarter and you can expect, we expect one more step down in the fourth quarter.","So it will actually be a little bit smaller still in the fourth quarter, so we're continuing to step that down.","Vivek Junenja","Okay. And on the resi mortgage side?","Bruce Van Saun","When you look at the maps on the quarter, probably around 10% of the net loan growth was the net purchase volume, so it's quite a modest number, at this point.","Vivek Junenja","Okay, good. That means even resi mortgage, you are doing through your own originations now, more and more?","Bruce Van Saun","More and more, right.","Vivek Junenja","Yes. Okay. Brad, a question for you on mortgage. Can you give a little more color on what happened with mortgage banking? It seems like you had an MSR hedge loss. And how you're tracking on originations with all the hiring of the mortgage officers?","I know you've had a change in management you just announced a couple of days ago. So you can give us some more color on that?","Brad Conner","Sure. It hit in a couple of buckets. You mentioned the MSR change. We have a $6 million recapture on our MSR asset in second quarter. We had a $1.7 million impairment this quarter. So when you look at the mortgage fees, we had about an $8 million swing from quarter to quarter, so that was an impact and a step down on mortgage revenue.","We actually saw our application volume drop about 10% in the third quarter. Much of that was just market-based, that's pretty much consistent with the market. I would say, in terms of our hiring, if you look at our hiring, year-on-year, we are still progressing well.","It was relatively flat quarter for net hiring in the third quarter. Some of that is extreme competition in the marketplace so we're seeing a lot of a petition for good quality loan officers. We're attracting loan officers, but there is a little bit of a hand-to-hand combat happening out in the marketplace.","Then the other thing that impacted that was -- and of course, the whole industry dealt with this -- was a little bit of distraction with the [total resting] implementation, the trade implementation, which happened in early October.","It really did put a lot of strain on operations capacity for us and the industry, so we actually ended up from a loan officer hiring perspective, we were up net 1 in the third quarter.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. All right. And the good news underlying is that we continue to increase our market share.","Brad Conner","Right.","Bruce Van Saun","So as we're going to loan officers, our market share for each of the last three quarters has continued to pick up. The originations in the quarter were up on a sequential quarter basis, so notwithstanding that apps [ph] were down a little bit. The actual originations that came through were up.","On the Management change, we had a couple of our folks looking to retire at the end of the year who have been good soldiers for us, both on the wealth side and in mortgage. And we're fortunate that we are able to go out into the market and attract some real talent into the Organization.","Vivek Junenja","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. On the final exit of RBS from your shareholder structure, whenever that happens, could you talk about what impact that's going to have on you, operationally, either in terms of where you get more flexibility or where potentially there is a bit of dissynergy in that they have been helping you get some business?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Look I think the - frankly, at this point, there won't be much impact at all. Most of the overall impacts of them stepping down their ownership and shrinking their business activities across the globe and here in the US have largely played themselves out.","We did call out the asset finance area was one place where we were getting referrals from their overall credits book and their relationships, which we need to figure out, though, that will over time decay and he erode and we have to figure out how we're going to replace that.","We have some ideas on that, but we did color code that initiative to grow that business amber at the moment until we've sorted out, something that Don is very focused on. But more broadly, we also, in capital markets, have used their platform and jointly called in some areas and we had plans to ultimately migrate off their, for example, FX and derivatives platform, and go on to our own platform in Q1, which will actually increase our flexibility in terms of the products we offer and some of their versatility we will have in being able to face off against the market. So that's a little bit of upside actually that's coming.","Then with respect to RBS' overall risk oversight responsibility as a source of strength for Citizens, we've had generally good agreement and support from them as we've moved from playing defense to offense about any changes that we've looked to make in our risk appetite.","So I don't think there'd be any big change in terms of them stepping back from having those oversight responsibilities. I would say, largely, most of the impacts are baked into current results or our current forecasts.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. And then, switching topics, a little bit, the step-up in commercial yields this quarter, what was behind that? Was it mix or was it pricing improving?","Bruce Van Saun","Eric, why don't you take that and then flip it to Don for color?","Eric Aboaf","The core of that is some pricing discipline. We saw origination yields across commercial tick up almost 20 basis points. There tends to be volatility from quarter to quarter, but that was a larger than typical up tick, and if you dig deep, what we've been doing is working very tactically with our bankers and helping them with benchmark data on pricing so that they can price effectively on new business.","That's been quite productive, as well as about three months ago, four months ago, it would have been in the middle of the second quarter, we rolled out our updated returns calculator, which also gives them some real insight and tools.","So we've been helping there and that has begun to get some nice traction and we are starting to see the results of that. Obviously, there will be some volatility from quarter-to-quarter. But we're pleased with some of those early results.","Don McCree","Eric, that's exactly right and I feel that, that's fully embedded in the commercial bank division right now. I'd point to the fact that we are doing less low-margin business, which is moving the overall book slightly up.","And as Eric said, it will move a little bit quarter to quarter, but we feel like the discipline is fully embedded.","Geoffrey Elliott","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on the fee outlook. It's the one path that you guys don't talk about in the explicit guidance. Eric, I heard your point about some of the third-quarter items were certainly in line with market behavior.","Can you just give us an update on your outlook for fee growth trajectory and any changes versus prior expectations, if any?","Bruce Van Saun","I would just say, Ken, we did have a clause in our outlook statement about fees, at the time where we said we anticipate fee income growth. Typically, that is not part of the outlook, but anyway I would say in general the fourth quarter has some seasonality to it.","So when we look at some of the activities on the consumer side, we typically see a nice little seasonal updraft there. We had, on the commercial side a relatively quiet third quarter and there's often seasonality there, as well.","We typically engineer a few leasing transactions in the fourth quarter. So there is some optimism around our ability to move the chains both on the consumer side, as well as on the commercial side. Eric, you want to add to that?","Eric Aboaf","No, that covers it well.","Ken Usdin","Thank you, Bruce. Stand corrected. I see it on the deck. Second question, on CCAR, when you got your original approvals for the three years, it included the $250 million for next year.","I know we haven't even gotten scenarios yet for next year, but my question is just do you think you'll even be able to contemplate a different ask than that original $250 million or are we really talking about 2017 CCAR for a CCAR ask than that original $250 million you got for 2016?","Bruce Van Saun","I think, I should explain that a little bit, Ken. But that $250 million effectively was the tail of a multi-year agreement that we had worked out with the Fed around our desire to put a capital stack back in place that mirrored our peers. So ultimately, it was to $2.75 billion of buyback with a linked issuance of capital securities.","We have just simply run that out and we put that last remaining $250 million out into the next CCAR submission. That really is not an indication of what we think we'll do in the next CCAR submission.","We have to go through our - all sources and uses of capital and how fast do we think the balance sheet is going to grow and what do we want our dividend policy to be.","So we will - and then where do we want to land in terms of continuing to chip away at the high level of capital that we have, CET 1 capital relative to peers. So, we'll dialogue with the Fed about that and we'll go through the process and we'll make some determinations. But clearly, I don't think you should take away that, that $250 million is locked in stone\u2026","Ken Usdin","Okay. Then just one quick clarification then on that $250 million, was that $250 million just a year thing, meaning that was that $250 million, in fact, could that still even happen in the first half and not even be part of the 2016 program or is it distinctly part of the second half and beyond '16 program, whether you ask for more or not?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I'm not sure I completely follow, but I'll just try to explain. So in the four-quarter CCAR submission that we just had approval for, we've had two $250 million transactions, which we've already executed.","This $250 million was indicated to be in the next submission and early in the period for the next submission. We will certainly look to do that and then potentially something additional as we work through the plan for the next submission.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Perfect. Thank you, Bruce.","Operator","Our next question in line will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning, Bruce, good morning, Eric. Thanks for taking my question. My first question really relates to what looked like pretty stable balances in the commercial business, the C&I business, specifically, and pretty healthy growth in the commercial real estate portfolio.","Could you give us a little more insight as to what the trends are in both those portfolios, and if that's going to be a primary driver of your growth in the fourth quarter?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Matt, let me start, and then Don will weigh in, as well, to give you a little texture. You saw some average balance growth in C&I. In particular, you saw a little bit of small dip, EOP, on the C&I line. On the other side on the ledger, on the CRE, as you described, you had nice sequential growth of 6%, which was particularly healthy and robust.","There is some movements there. Originations have been, on commercial, and in C&I, in particular, have been pretty decent all year, including this past quarter, a little less activity on draws, which tends to sometimes be seasonal.","But it's a business where we continue to see some momentum, on the one hand, and on the other hand, it's intensely price competitive, and we're also being disciplined and careful about where and how we grow that.","Don McCree","Yes, I think, let me just add to that. That's exactly right. It's a tale of many cities. We're seeing really good growth in real estate, we're seeing really good growth in franchise finance, a little bit of weakness in our asset finance business, a little bit of weakness in our mid market business, the mid market business is entirely due to utilization.","A suspicion there, although we haven't fully proved out, is much of that has to do with commodity prices and general economic outlook in some of our mid market areas. We just think our clients are borrowing a little bit less money at this split second, and we also see that in the opposite indicator, which is growth in our deposits.","So we feel very good about where we are in terms of quality of intensity, quality of upgrades, of personnel developing pipelines, quality of calls in terms of corporate finance calls, as opposed to just lending calls. So all of the indicators we see in the franchise are excellent and we think we're setting the stage for continued growth in the business.","Matt Burnell","So Don, are you getting an elevated level of pay downs in the third quarter versus the second quarter, which we've heard from a couple of the other regional banks?","Don McCree","I haven't seen it necessarily in pay downs. We've seen it in utilization, so less draws under existing commitments. And it more than explains the entire total reduction in C&I loans so we are growing in underlying portfolios, but we are also building our pipelines and we don't see the overall commitment book decline.","Eric Aboaf","Pay downs were actually in line with the average for the last five quarters. Pay downs were actually a little lighter than in the second quarter, for that matter, so just on the utilization line this quarter, which tends to be jumpy.","We have utilization, quarter-over-quarter, you see swings in utilization of $300 million, $400 million, $500 million, and so obviously carefully working through it, but not particularly out of the ordinary.","Matt Burnell","Eric, my second question is for you, in terms of the cost of the long-term debt has come down quite dramatically. The balances have increased a bit over the past year. Is there much more you can do in terms of bringing the cost of your long-term debt down as part of your NIM planning?","Eric Aboaf","Long-term debt is, like you say, it's long-term, right. There's a limit to what one can really do. We have tended to issue floating or issue swap to floating, which gives us some flexibility, and obviously, we'll manage that in the scheme of our duration position.","From a perspective that we have is that over time, we have said that we'd add a little bit of senior debt to the stack just to be a little more balanced. That said, we'll do that carefully and modestly, given the rate environment.","But if there are some low points in the curve, it's also a nice time to pull a little bit of that down, put it on the balance sheet, and do it at a time before the rates pop up.","Matt Burnell","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Bruce, good morning, Eric. Can you share with us your thoughts about capital. You've touched on it already, but you guys obviously have capital levels, your common equity Tier 1 ratio is above the peers, as you pointed out.","What's your comfort level in where you think that could get to and what strategies would you use to, I'm assuming bring it down?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, we've done up to now, Gerard, is a combination of actually the conversion transactions, which in effect buybacks. We've had dividend policy set at 25% to 30% and we had an ability and a desire to really grow loans and grow the loan book and growth to that strong capital position.","I do think it is a bit of a loop here, as we put that excess capital to work, it helps drive revenues. It helps drive that positive operating leverage and it helps improve our returns. Then the more capital we can self-generate, then we can feel confident that we can meet all the requirements to run the business without having to have that cushion.","So the calibration in terms of the timing for removing some of that surplus really is linked to some degree to how quickly we can get our returns up so that we're self-sufficient and were not hamstrung when we see good opportunities to grow loans. We don't want to be drawing down that capital for position that's below us, so that to me is the timing.","It will be a combination, going forward, of probably faster than peer loan growth. Ultimately, when we're in a sustainable position to be able to do that, then we can look to increase the buybacks and bring that capital level back to where peers are.","There's no reason, at the end of the day, once we're through our turnaround period, that we should have a new guy premium, if you will, quote-unquote, and a higher capital level than peers.","There's nothing in the mix of our business, our risk appetite, our stress losses under CCAR, that would say there's a requirement for the medium-term or longer-term, to hold extra capital than peers. I do think we are just managing our way through this and using it as an advantage right now as we work to improve our overall performance.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. I agree with you about the new guy premium is not going to be needed. If we get to 2017, and I don't think the regulators will allow this in '16 CCAR. But if you all, the industry, not just Citizens, are given the opportunity to give back in excess of your estimated earnings in that CCAR.","Would you guys consider doing that, where you could really bring it down to get that ROE to a higher level?","Bruce Van Saun","I think, I'd fall back on my previous answer. So I don't know if I want to be pinned down to timing. We have got a lot of things over 2016 and 2017 that we have to see play out in terms of the path for the Fed and the path for our profitability improvement.","So I do think we'll certainly monitor the signals coming from the Fed and where the peer group looks likely to go, and over time, continue to try to narrow that differential.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Then finally, shifting gears, you guys mentioned that you had a deposit program in place with higher rates, which you have started to fade away going into the third quarter.","Are there any plans for 2016 for any deposit specials, where you look to grow the deposits through maybe higher rates or special products?","Eric Aboaf","It is Eric, Gerard. I think we take deposits, quarter-to-quarter from a tactical basis, right. What you've seen us do is fade a little bit of some of the more aggressive promotional campaigns we had been doing in consumer, as over the last couple of quarters, and with Brad's help and guidance of the team, also just being careful about being in line with peers as opposed to ahead, we been able to tamp down on the increases that we've seen.","We have even been doing better month after month after month here, even during third quarter. That's the kind of thing we expect to continue. I said something similar on the commercial side, where we've been repricing some old balances. That will continue. As rates rise, ideally rise next year, prevailing market rate, we will likely to what you'd expect, is typically lag.","We've disclosed our betas. The betas are -- there's much more of a lag in consumer than in commercial typically. What you will find us do is over and above that, there's a product question you asked, specifically is in consumer.","We continue to reevaluate the product set to make sure that it's designed to encourage checking account balances, those low interest rate balances, those DDA balances.","On commercial, one of the byproducts of growing the cash management business is it brings in DDA balances. So, that's where the initiatives, on one hand, that we've talked about for multiple quarters ties to some of the funding costs opportunities that we've seen.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","And our next question on the line comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","John Pancari","Just a quick question, back to the margin. I mean, it's good to see the pricing and the other yield initiatives that are benefiting the margin, and it sounds like that's sticky, and that the margin could hold at this level.","Could you talk about the risk that it could come at the cost of loan growth as you focus on these pricing opportunities and then what that could mean for annual growth for 2016 in the total loan balances?","Eric Aboaf","John, it is Eric. Let me start, right. I think the first part of the margin, the yield enhancements that we've seen, in particular, on loans, is around product mix. So as we grow student loans, even the Apple balances, the organic auto, those are actually accretive to our yields, so literally the benefit of growing higher yielding products has a benefit.","There is a similar area in commercial, as in commercial real estate, where we're becoming increasingly disciplined, for example, on our REIT business, and actually expanding other areas instead. So that mix effect is actually a natural way to defend the yields, if not to actually expand them.","The next piece then is actual apples-to-apples pricing on commercial loans. That's where you're in the trenches, and with -- Don and I are conscious that you push a little too much on price and volume can adjust, and what we're trying to do is carefully find what that elasticity is and where the appropriate point to price on so that you get both -- you get good yielding loans and volume. That's what we do daily. Do you want to add to that Don?","Don McCree","I'd agree with that, Eric. I think the important thing is we're really managing this on a client by client, loan by loan basis, with a lot of senior intention to it. So we're making smart decisions on where we went to play and where we don't want to play.","And I don't think our effort to be disciplined on pricing is going to have a particular effect on volume. I feel it's a competitive market out there and we're trying to stay at disciplined as we can, both on the credit side and on the pricing side, but we see lots of opportunity.","John Pancari","So given that, could this 1.5% linked quarter loan growth expectation carry through for 2016 and therefore we're looking at somewhere in the ballpark of 6% annually?","Bruce Van Saun","What we've said consistently this year is that we will give you our 2016 guidance in the January call. But what we've proven since we've been a public Company is we can shoot for something like that. We've been able to deliver it, but I really don't want to get drawn in on 2016 until January.","John Pancari","Okay, that's fine. Then one last question is on the ROTCE. As you acknowledged early in the call, it was relatively stable here around 6.6% or 6.7%. Can you just update us on your thoughts around the pace in the improvement in that ratio that you expect, barring any help from the Fed?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I think that's similar to your last question. We're very focused on delivering a positive operating leverage. We are, at the moment, building capital because we've made our share repurchases that are authorized under the CCAR, so you have a little bit of a headwind in the denominator.","But the flip side of that is you are growing your book value per share, which is also a positive. But what we start to -- we will have everything working for us again in the next CCAR cycle, if we're delivering the profitability growth and we can get the buyback, back into the equation on consistently quarterly basis, then hopefully we aren't building capital at the same clip.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thanks, Bruce.","Operator","And our last question will come from the line of David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Eads","Hi, good morning. Maybe just one last one from me. If you could talk a little bit about the capital markets line. You dipped a little bit from a really strong second quarter.","I was just curious how much of that is due to market factors versus seasonality and timing and just the general lumpiness of that business?","Eric Aboaf","I'll take that. I would point to just the volatility in the market in the third quarter. It was across high-grade, high-yield, and the syndicated lending market. It was just tremendously volatile and the market seized up really toward the back end of the summer and that was on top of what we usually see, which is a summer slowdown, in terms of the transactional business.","So, I do think it was a tough comparison with the second quarter, as you said, which was a very strong quarter. We're seeing reasonable activity as we move into the fourth quarter.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, as I indicated in an earlier answer today, that we typically see a seasonal pick-up in the capital markets area in Q4, and it looks like our pipelines would give some confidence to that statement.","David Eads","All right. Thanks for the color.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay.","Bruce Van Saun","All right. Well, that's all the questions that we have for today. So thank you for dialing in and joining us this morning. And again, we feel we have another good quarter, pleased with our performance, executing well. And feel quite confident about our future outlook. So thank you and have a good day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5400":["Citizens Financial Group Inc.

And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group\u2019s First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I\u2019ll be your operator on the call today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks Brad. Good morning everyone. We really appreciate you joining us. We know it's a busy day. We\u2019re going to kick things off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, Eric Aboaf reviewing our first quarter results and then we\u2019ll open the call for questions. We\u2019ve also got in the room with us today Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. I need to remind everyone that in addition to today\u2019s press release, we have also provided presentation and supplement, and those materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com.","And of course our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from those expectations in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K we filed today, and we also utilize non-GAAP financial measures, and provide information and reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings material.","And with that, I\u2019m going to hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks Ellen. Good morning everyone and thanks for dialing in. Q1 was another good quarter for Citizens. Let me briefly cover a few of the highlights. We were pleased that we continue to achieve good loan growth. We\u2019re bringing new customers into the Bank. We\u2019re doing a good job of delivering better risk adjusted loan yields and in managing our deposit costs. As a result, our net interest margin was up 9 basis points versus Q4 with half the benefit resulting from the Fed December rate hike and half coming from our own actions.","This strength in net interest income was partly offset by weakness in fee categories, which is partly the result of seasonality, partly market conditions, and partly some challenges in getting full traction on a couple of initiatives. That said, we\u2019re addressing the underlying challenges and we\u2019re hopeful that market conditions are improving as the year goes on. Our discipline around expenses remains excellent. We have a mindset of continuous improvement, and we recycle savings to fund investments from our growth initiatives.","I was pleased that our tangible book value per share grew by 2% sequentially to $25.21. And then we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.12 per share. Our CET 1 capital ratio remains very robust at 11.6%. Our credits metrics remained strong and stable. An increase in NPAs and reserves related to the SNC review of oil and gas loans was largely offset by improvements in retail loans, including a planned TDR sale that Eric will fill you in on in a minute.","We feel our oil and gas exposure is modest and it's well reserved. We continue to focus on delivering well for all our stakeholder groups, including customers, colleagues and communities. I continue to see good progress across the board. In addition, we are focused on improving our risk and regulatory capabilities, and feel we put forth a strong effort on our CCAR\/DFAST submission.","With that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through our financials in more detail. Eric?","Eric Aboaf","Thank you Bruce, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter we continue to make progress around our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We are managing the balance sheet to generate attractive loan and deposit growth and actively managing NIM. We continue to control costs and deliver strong operating leverage. And once again credit costs are well behaved as we navigate through the current economic environment. My comments this morning refer to our first quarter 2016 earnings presentation which you can find at citizensbank.com.","Let's start on Page 4, with our first quarter financial summary, where we provide our GAAP results of $223 million and $0.41 a share. On Page 5,on a linked quarter basis, GAAP net income of $223 million was flat to the fourth quarter on strong NII, seasonally light fees, flat expenses and stable provision. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, net income increased $8 million or 4% to diluted EPS growth of 5%, driven by positive operating leverage of 3%. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by $51 million or 4%. Net interest income of $904 million increased 8%, reflecting strong average loan growth. Non-interest income declined $17 million or 5%, as growth in service charges and fees were more than offset by lower mortgage banking fees and the impact of the card reward accounting change.","Year-over-year we continue to make measurable progress against our goal of enhancing our efficiency, while reinvesting in the franchise. Expenses were up only 1%. Our efficiency ratio of 66% improved 2% relative to the first quarter of last year. Provision was up $32 million on a year-over-year basis, but first quarter 2015 included the benefit of large commercial recoveries of $22 million.Importantly credit cost also remained stable linked quarter as commercial credit began to normalize and we saw improving trends in our retail book. Note that tangible book value per share is now $25.21, up 2% relative to year end 2015. ","Let's move on to Page 6. We saw a nice lift in net interest income this quarter, which was up $34 million or 4% from fourth quarter on the back of 9 basis points of NIM expansion. We continue to generate attractive average loan growth of 2% with strength in commercial, student and mortgages. On a year-over-year basis, net interest increased $68 million or 8% due to strong average loan growth of 7%. These results also reflect our improving net interest margin.","So as you can see on Page 7, our net interest margin increased 9 basis points linked quarter, as our loan yields expanded, given the benefit of the December Fed rate increase and we continue to shift our mix to higher yielding asset classes. We were also able to hold deposit costs flat notwithstanding the Fed rate increase on average across our businesses. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of a lower federal reserve stock dividend. The margin expansion this quarter came in a bit stronger than we had anticipated. While loan yields rose in sync with high LIBOR and Prime rate, our deposit cost remained low. ","Specifically, we consciously lowered pricing of consumer interest bearing deposits down 4 basis points as we saw good DDA growth. Commercial deposit cost did move up in response to the fed tightening quite a bit less than expected. Now we do expect deposits to creep up in the future and betas [ph] to normalize, we were quite pleased with the results we produced this quarter. We'll provide some more color on our NIM expectations for the second quarter shortly as we are also keeping a close watch on the long end of the yield curve.","Relative to the first quarter of 2015, net interest margin also expanded 9 basis points, benefited by improved loan yields and mix and a more efficient investment portfolio, partially offset by higher volume costs. We maintained a stable asset sensitive position, and ended the quarter at 6.9% compared with fourth quarter 2015 at approximately 6.1%.","On Slide 8, let's take a closer look at non-interest income. Our linked quarter results reflectboth the impact of normal seasonality and service charges in cardfees as well as some continued pressure from the market volatility, investment services, interest rate products and foreign exchange. This actually maps a rebound in our capital market fees. I need to remind you that our results also reflect a $7 million decrease in cards fee related to the rewards expense accounting change we discussed last quarter. Without this change, card fees would have been down $3 million linked quarter but up $5 million year-over-year or up 8%. On a year-over-year basis, we posted 7% growth in service charges and fees, driven by both continued household growth, as well as our treasury solutions pricing initiatives in both commercial and business banking.","Investment service fees were up year-over-year, notwithstanding the recent market volatility and we\u2019ve now seen two strong quarters of that FC [ph] hiring, which should help drive future growth. In mortgage banking, we continue to see higher applications quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, but the lower consuming mix and MSR valuations are impacting fee revenues. In the first quarter of 2015, our results benefited from higher gains on loan sales.","Turning to expenses on Slide 9, we\u2019re continuing to do a great job of self-funding our investment initiatives as expenses were stable linked quarter and up only 1% on an adjusted basis year-over-year. Linked quarter salaries and benefits were seasonally higher by $16 million as payroll taxes and incentives increased, while occupancy costswere slightly higher. We offset this increase by spending less on outside services as well as lower other expense, which included the impact of the cards reward accounting change. On a year-on-year basis, salaries and employee benefits were up, modestly reflecting continued investments in growth initiatives to help drive top line revenue, partially offset by our efficiency programs.","Let's jump over to Page 11. In consumer, we continue to grow balances at a nice pace, up 2% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year, driven by effective opportunities, predominantly in student mortgage. We\u2019re also seeing a nice uptick in our unsecured retail loans, which include the iPhone product. Consumer loan yields increased 11 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher prime rate as well as continued improvement in mix.","On Slide 12, commercial loan demand was strong this quarter. Commercial loans increased 3% linked quarter and 9% year-over-year as we continue to build momentum in more attractive return areas. On both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we generated growth across most of our target areas; commercial real-estate, corporate finance, franchise finance, mid-corporate and industry verticals.","Slide 13 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding cost. Average interest bearing deposits grew $613 million or 1% linked quarter with particular strength in checking and savings and money markets. Our deposit costs remain stable this quarter, reflecting disciplined balanced pricing actions in consumer banking as I mentioned earlier.","On Slide 14, I\u2019ll hit the highlights on credit quality metrics, which remain relatively stable with the fourth quarter in aggregate. Our NPLs were essentially flat at $1.1 billion notwithstanding a $210 million increase in oil and gas non-performing loans following the March make review and revised regulatory guidance related to multi-tiered structures. This increase was largely offset by improvement in retail from several items of roughly $100 million reduction in retail non-performing loans due in part to the TDR transaction I\u2019ll cover on the next page, a benefit from reclassifying a pool that [indiscernible] didn\u2019t make energy loans and a broad overall improvement in retail credit.","Provision expense in the quarter was stable at $91 million. During the quarter, we increased reserves on oil and gas portfolio by $30 million to $61 million, which included a $17 million overlay. On Slide 27 in the appendix we provide more detail on the oil and gas portfolio with reserves now at 6% for the more price sensitive portfolios. This reserve build was partially offset by a release of roughly 60 million reserves tied to moving the TDR portfolio to held for sale along with favorable trends in retail performance.Our allowance to loan ratio came in at 1.21% while our allowance to NPL ratio was 113%, both of which are relatively flat to the fourth quarter. Overall, we feel good about credit quality and reserving levels. So we will continue closely monitor the oil and gas portfolio.","On Slide 15, we provide more details on our TDR transaction. As we\u2019ve continued to focus on optimizing the balance sheet and generating more attractive returns on capital, we\u2019ve work to identify additional areas like portfolio sales and securitizations where we can drive benefits. During the first quarter, we identified a $373 million portfolio of consumer real-estate TDR loans that we plan to sell late in the second quarter or early third quarter. We transferred these loans to held for sale which lowered our NPL by $97 million.","Once the transaction closes, given current home values, we expect to realize a moderate gain as well as benefit on risk weighted assets and provide a partial offset to third quarter formulate increase in FDIC assessment cost. On a net basis, these assessment costs are expected to have a very modest impact on second half 2016 expenses and no impact on our previous full year guidance.","On Slide 16, you see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. You also see that we executed a sub-debt buyback of $125 million in March outside of the traditional CCAR process. On Slide 17 we\u2019ve laid out the key initiatives that support balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan, as well as incremental initiatives and assess progress during the quarter. We\u2019ll continue to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these initiatives, and are intensely addressing some of our challenges in mortgage while making solid progress in wealth and asset finance.","Turning to Slide 18, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter, but all in the context of the full year 2015 outlook that we previously provided and that we broadly reaffirm today. So compared to the first quarter of 2016 we expect to produce linked quarter loan growth of roughly 2%. We also expect net interest margin to be relatively stable, based on the curve as of March 2016, which reflects some pressure from the long end as I mentioned earlier. We are tightly depending [ph] the margin and believe there's more we can do organically to control our deposit cost and improve our loan yield. We still anticipate the Fed moving price this year, but we'll stay focused on what we can control. We do expect mid-single digit fee growth without any 2Q security gains. We expect modest expense growth in Q2 as efficiency initiatives provide a partial offset to continued investment spend. We would expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain largely stable with a modest increase in provision in 2Q driven by volume growth. And finally we expect to see our CET 1 ratio come in at 11.6% and we will manage the LDR to around 98%.","With that let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks Eric. In short, another solid quarter in executing against our turnaround plans. The key takeaways are shown on Slide 19. So with that Brad, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, [Operator Instructions] and we'll go to the line of David Eads with UBS.Please go ahead.","David Eads","Can we start on the fee side, and maybe on the mortgage hiring, you talked about, seems like the production is still a little bit strong on the jumbo side? Is there anything you guys are working to do to improve some of -- to broaden and improve conforming originations. ","Bruce Van Saun","Why don't I start and flip it over to Brad?One of the challenges we've had is that we put in a new system. I think we said on the last call around the time that the [indiscernible] came in and we had to originate TRID compliant loans, so that took some work ultimately to bed down that system and get back to good operational metrics. That has slowed down our net hiring both in Q4 and Q1. So we're treading water a bit, but we expect that now I think we've got that under control, and the operating metrics continue to improve.So we should now be able to move towards positive net recruiting throughout the rest of the year. Part of that effort is to really focus on markets and producers that can deliver a greater mix of conforming originations compared to what we've currently which is roughly been about 60% non-conforming and 40% conforming. So I think part of it is selection, part of it is market geographic focus, and then also having that operational excellence because those conforming oriented producers need to make sure that they can get their mortgages through the pipeline relatively quickly. So I'll turn it over to Brad.","Brad Conner","Bruce you said it extremely well. The only couple of things I would add to that is as you mentioned, we implemented our new loan originations system in conjunction with TRID. One of the additional challenges that that created for us in terms of conforming production as in order to get that system in, some of the product development work that we needed to do to get the right conforming and FAJ product in place, we had to put on hold. So we are working really hard to get some new products in that will be more attractive to conforming loan offers. And so I -- and Bruce you made the point exactly right, which is we did have some operational stress and operational challenges and I think that's a little more painful in terms of attracting conforming loan officers than the non-conforming loan officers. So we're working very, very hard and we really feel like we're turning the corner in terms of the operations. We did add capacity in terms of operations headcount. We had a good turn of the pipeline particularly in March, a good strong closing month in March. So we feel like we're turning the corner and maybe able to start hiring and getting the traction of the more conforming loan officers.","David Eads","Thanks, and then maybe, just a little on the increase in the dividend this quarter and I realize there's not a whole lot you can talk about the next PCAR, but if there's any color you could give on how that might influence -- how you guys think about the trade-offs between dividend and buyback going forward. ","Bruce Van Saun","Well I think we want to maintain a strong and healthy dividend that grows. And so this is a step in that direction. We'd like to be in a payout ratio of 25% to 30%. So taking care of the dividend is kind of job one. I think the next thing when we think about capital management, we want to make sure we're funding loan growth. So where we have attractive opportunities to grow the loan book, bring new customers into the bank, we want to make sure were doing that. And then we also want to be shareholder friendly and buyback our stocks with the most of most that we can do. I think we're in the kind of strong position at this point, given that the relatively high capital ratios to peers that we can do it all for the time being. So we are able to raise the dividend. We can fund reasonably aggressive loan growth and we can be I think reasonably aggressive at this point in time in terms of the buyback that we've been able to effect over the past couple of cycles and we'll wait and see what we're doing in this cycle. Eric do you want to add anything to that?","Eric Aboaf","I'll just add that last year we obviously had our first non-objectionablepass for CCAR. This year we were committed and gave as much work as we did a year ago. So we've kept up the internal pace of all the improvement and remediation and making sure that we're leading the pack as opposed to just barely there on the requirements. And I think that gives us some confidence to put in for an appropriate return of capital to the shareholder, while balancing the strength of the franchise. But as Bruce said, we have very, very strong capital ratios, top of the leaderboard and so that gives us some confidence.","Operator","And will go to the next question, that will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. ","Vivek Juneja","A couple of questions, thanks. On the dividend increase, Bruce, Eric, do you all have to -- it seems like this was a little off cycle. Did you have to go get a special approval from the board or from the Fed or can you walk through the process a little bit.","Bruce Van Saun","Go ahead, Eric","Eric Aboaf","Let me just take that. This was part of our annual CCAR app a year ago. We had paced it [ph], why? Because we wanted to pay dividend levels with income growth. you've seen us deliver on that income growth quarter after quarter after quarter, driven by the positive operating leverage and the performance of the franchise. This is a natural time during that plan to raise the dividend and given we deliver on the income; we had done the app a year ago. We and the board went ahead with that increase. We didn't need to have ask anything special from the regulators. The only place we did do that was on the sub-debt buyback which we did back in the February\/March time period, and I think as I mentioned in my opening comments, that was a special ask over and above the annual CCAR.","Vivek Juneja","I know that you can't tell me about CCAR. Can you talk a little bit about how you're feeling, given the very strong capital position you are still in? Either of you?","Bruce Van Saun","I think it's a little hard for us to comment at this point with the submission just filed. But I do think we continue to invest in our capital planning and management capabilities. I think we really keep upping our game. We know what we need to do to get strong in this area. So we feel good about the effort that we put forth and the progress that we are making. And on the quantitative side, as we said, we've got relatively strong capital ratios relative to peers. And so I think you would expect us to be kind of in sync with where we've been historically.","Vivek Juneja","One more, nice job on the NIM. Just, can you talk a little bit about efficiency ratio and anything that we should think about as we look out, in terms of where you're all expecting that to go?","Bruce Van Saun","Let me take it and Eric, I will flip to you. But we are targeting ultimately to bring that down around 60%. And the key to doing that is positive operating levels. So the holy grail here, if you will, the mantra is that we got to grow our revenues faster than our expenses. We've done that for a number of quarters in a row. You can see again, this quarter year-on-year basis, 3% positive operating leverage. If we keep doing that, that efficiency ratio is going to improve. It is 2% better than it was last year, and I think you can see those kind of moves provided we continue to execute our plan. Eric?","Eric Aboaf ","I'll just add that we're going to keep chipping away at this quarter after quarter, 200 basis points year, 0.5 point a quarter. You can do the math. The NII growth will help. Some of the seasonal rebound we expect from fees will help. And then we've got to be extremely disciplined on our expenses. You saw them up 1% year over year, flat sequentially. We've got to find a way to come in at the low-end of our expense guide and we've got to find a way to come in at a strong operating leverage and we have every intention to meter out and to carefully invest but only behind revenues, as opposed to the other way around.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","I just wanted to see if you can give us your updated thoughts on your ROE walk for the full year? What your updated expectations are in terms of what you're targeting for end of the year ROE and what are the main drivers there?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I think we gave very detailed guidance at the January call. And we left the ROTCE calculation to you. So I think what we've said today, as Eric went over the guidance is that we're broadly comfortable with that full-year guidance. I think there will be some puts and takes. There is a little bit of headwinds starting out of the gate in fee revenue, not just for us but for the whole industry, frankly. And we've got to try to make up ground there. If we end up a little light on the fees relative to that guidance, the places that we trying compensate, one would be trying to end up in the higher end of the range on net interest income, which I think we're off to a great start on net interest income. And to grind down on expenses a little bit which we're -- you can count on us to be thinking of ways to do that on a regular basis.","So of you average out those puts and takes, we think we are tracking to our expectations for the year. I think the credit outlook, notwithstanding some issues in the oil patch, we're still comfortable with that initial guidance we gave for the full year. So you can do the math on that. I do think that ROTCE will start to move higher as we deliver that positive operating leverage, as we get some bigger EPS jumps as the year goes along and as we start buying back our stock when we get to the next CCAR cycle. Eric, do you want to add to that?","Eric Aboaf","Let me just add that this is a marathon, not a sprint. We do it every quarter and trying to build on the last assessment about we've got to get the efficiency ratio improved quarter after quarter. And we think as we do that, and then manage the mix of the top line and expenses, we can make some headway on it. Clearly we want to get out of the 6%, the high 6% range to the high 7% and we will figure how to get to the next step. It's going to be quarter after quarter, inch by inch.","John Pancari ","And on that note is it fair to say that when looking at that full-year guidance, if you do achieve that, that you're in that 7% to 7.5% ROTCE range?","Bruce Van Saun","At this point there's -- you can do the modeling. I think that is what the modeling of the guidance suggests, that we gave back in January. And as we've said in the opening, we're broadly affirming that guidance and that includes the range that I think you just quoted.","John Pancari","Thanks, Eric, and one thing on energy. What do you include in the non-price sensitive portfolios for energy?","Eric Aboaf ","I think you've just got the standard downstream retail, that sort of thing. So I think if you -- we've been pretty standard with the others in the industry.","Bruce Van Saun","Midstream, downstream.","Eric Aboaf","Midstream, downstream and some of the integrated players.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Just a couple of NIM questions. Can you talk about much more, call it organic opportunity there is to drive NIM higher over time, whether it's the mix shift or managing liabilities like you benefit from those quarters? How much left is there of that?","Eric Aboaf ","I think it's a never ending battle with rates where they are today. We've got a really night nice lift from the Fed hike that came through on the yield side both in consumer and commercial. There's a little bit left of that because some of that came in in January, February for a couple of their portfolios, given how they're contractually repricing. So we have a little bit of a tailwind there. On the other side of the ledger, the long end is a lot lower than it was before. So that creates a bit of a headwind that we have to work through.","So given that, it means we have to keep being intensely focused on our deposit cost kind of management and we've got to build balances and do them in a disciplined way. I think commercial clients will always be asking for a little more rate because their loans were priced. So we've got to address that and we have to find a way to navigate that carefully.","And then I think on the loan yields mix side, I think that is an area of tailwind that we have confidence in to continue. So I think we said broadly stable into the second quarter, up or down a basis point or thereabouts. So kind of in that range. I think the second half of the year will kind of depend on where the Fed goes and also where market expectations are, where the back end of the curve bounces around to.","Matt O'Connor","And as we think about eventually further increases in Fed funds, at least hopefully; do you expect similar leverage to the next one or two increases? Like how do you think about how linear leverages this. So quarter, you got 4 or 5 basis points to benefit, it seems like, from the Fed? Is that a good starting point for the next 25 or do you start having pressure on the deposit rates?","Bruce Van Saun","When we gave you that guidance in January, the forward curve at the time presumed a -- I think it was June --","Eric Aboaf","Yes.","Bruce Van Saun","-- increase and then a December increase. Which still looks reasonable to us. And I'm not sure the market thinks that but I think the economic data and the kind of anecdotes we have from what's going on with our customers, would indicate that that would be a good course of action for the Fed to take. But when we gave you that guidance, we said there would be about a $35 million benefit this year from the June increase and $5 million ish benefit from the one in December, which only has a small impact on 2016 but obviously would benefit 2017. I think the -- there's still a good benefit from that, but I think as Eric's pointed out, you've had the curve flattened at the back end, which is something to contend with.","Eric Aboaf","I think the next increase will be nicely beneficial. Maybe not worth the $50 million a year that the first one was but something in that -- near that. What that would also do is put us in a position where you can't down shift as easily as we did, for example taking our deposit cost down. We took them down 4 basis points this quarter. That's not the kind of thing we can repeat two quarters in a row. But let me tell you, we are looking at every part of the pricing structure. Every way we acquire our clients and every way we manage that book and are trying to squeak out opportunities.","Brad Conner","Yes. If you look at our yields relative to the peers, now we've closed the gap almost all the way from. Where we used to have a fairly significant gap and where we still have a remaining gap is in our cost of funds. So we know we still have work to do there.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys give us some color -- your capital is so strong and laid out very well in your presentation relative to the minimum requirements. What do you think it would take for you to be able to give back more than 100% of earnings? Will the Fed actually have to come out and give all of you and your peers that can do it, actual guidance? Or is it you got to read the body language and then take a chance and -- I'm not suggesting you do that this year, but in the future take a chance and ask for more than 100% of earnings.","Eric Aboaf","I don't know, you certainly -- I don't think you want to go first. I would just say that we are comfortable with the glide path that we have been on. So when we were separated -- when the plan was announced to separate Citizens from RBS, the good news is that we started with an almost 14% CET 1 ratio.","And over the past 2.5-3 years, we have been gliding down to 11.6% through paying the dividends. And we did our conversion transactions which is effectively a buyback and then very strong loan growth in the 8% range. And I think that still feels good to us. We have just continued to glide this down. We're a relatively new company and I think our earnings are below where we'd would like them to be in the longer term. So we need to get our sources of capital up, but it's good that we have the capital strength behind us that we can continue to take advantage of that. And we can grow loans aggressively, we can put in reasonably aggressive asks in the CCAR process. And I don't really think it benefits us dramatically to think about going over 100 at this point.","Gerard Cassidy ","In terms of the ideal capital level, at some point, we presume Citizens and your peers will get there? In your view, what is the ideal Tier 1 common ratio that you think you can run the company at? I'm assuming the current level's too high.","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I would say if you look at peers, probably the peer average or median is around 10%-ish. And so most peers profess that they feel a little fat at 10% and they'd like to get to something between 9% and 10%. And I think from our standpoint, we're at 11.6%, and we must keep executing our plan, getting our earnings up, bringing that capital ratio down gradually.","I don't see any reason that we should be -- have that kind of new guide premium forever. There's nothing in our business model, or nothing in our stress test results that says that we need a premium relative to where the peer group goes. So I think it's really just as simple as you watch where the pack is going and we're trying to close in on the pack and ultimately we'll get there over time.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then, just finally, your loan to deposit ratio obviously is in the high 90s. Where do you target that? Are you comfortable where you are now or would you be comfortable going over 100% loan to deposits? What's your guy's view on your loan to deposit ratio?","Eric Aboaf","Gerard, its Eric. I think for the time being, we're quite comfortable with the 98%, 99% that we've been running at. It's a healthy way to run a regional bank. And we want to do it in a meat and potatoes way and just having the right set of deposits against loans is helpful. I think we tend to run a little more -- a little higher in LCRs, but that's because we have a larger retail deposit base. That gives us the confidence run closer to that 99% than the 90% that others are at. I think over time what you'll find is that the regulatory guidelines, whether it's LCR or an FFR, get baked in. And right now we are at that kind of 90% LCR requirement, and we're well over that. We've said we are well over the 100% level. Once the NCSFR comes of age, I think at that point we'll see if it makes sense to recalibrate a little bit. But for the time being we're quite comfortable at the level we are at.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe ","First question, it looks like student lending continues to grow really well. Are you guys seeing any noticeable increase in competition in the student lending market from other banks?","Bruce Van Saun","I will turn it over to Brad.","Brad Conner","Yes. I would say we are definitely seeing some competition in the refi loan space. So we haven't seen a lot of new players in the in-school space. We've seen players like SoFi and Darian and others in the refi area. But I would say at this point, margins are holding nicely. There is still good strong demand, so we feel good about the opportunity. But yes, there is some competition in the refi space.","Eric Aboaf","But it's not bad competition, right, because it creates awareness among borrowers. You see TV ads out there so we don't have to spend on the TV. But it allows us for direct marketing and online channels to close loans.","Bruce Van Saun","I think it's very good point, Eric. There's a lot more awareness among consumers about the ability to refinance student debt. I think you're absolutely right on that point.","Ken Zerbe","Does that level of competition or increase -- ultimately change the pace of growth in student lending in the next few quarters?","Brad Conner","Our view is, no. There is still an enormous opportunity in the marketplace in terms of consumers who are eligible for student loan refinancing, and so demand will remain strong for the foreseeable future.","Eric Aboaf","I think that the thing that we think about is as you maintain this growth rate, you come to, what's the theoretical asset allocation you want to that asset class. And so I think this is a juggernaut that can continue to grow on our balance sheet and then do we want to have options to move some of those assets off the balance sheet through sales or securitization. So I think it's a rich man's problem at this point.","Ken Zerbe","Fair enough. And Just the other question I have in terms of the capital markets business, can you just remind us how your business may differ from other banks? I know the first quarter is a very difficult quarter, but it looks like your capital markets revenue held up pretty well?","Bruce Van Saun","Don?","Don McCree","There's a lot of syndicated finance in our capital markets and a lot of bank content versus institutional content. So fourth quarter's obviously a tough quarter as the whole market basically shut down on the volatility of the high-yield market and the institutional market. We actually came through quite clean versus a lot of the competition, and we're able to take advantage of a few very attractive opportunities that were available in the first quarter. And that's really what drove the first-quarter revenue. As we move into the second quarter we see continued progress in that. The breadth of opportunity is growing and as we are getting a little bit of thaw in the broader capital markets, we're seeing transaction flow increasing. It will be a little market dependent around actually how we close all of those and where they fall over the next few quarters, but we are quite encouraged about the breadth of activity here.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, if you look at, historically, the second quarter has been a relatively strong quarter for capital markets fees, and I would say that at this point our pipeline is tracking with those historic builds for Q2.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","It seems like you obviously have a capital problem yet obviously need to grow revenue. You're attempting to do that. So why not look at potentially acquiring non-bank in order to accelerate the fee income growth and utilize your capital base?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, I think at this point what we're focused on is just the organic opportunities that we have right in front of us. So in our turnaround plan I think we can get good organic growth. And we have to demonstrate that we can build our capabilities and run the bank better, which I think we're doing. I do think, to your question though, there is a point where we will feel that it is appropriate to look for opportunities to deploy some of that excess capital into acquisitions. And I think fee-based businesses would be of interest. Having said that, I think you have to be careful there, because they typically are going to trade at premium valuations.","And a lot of times their businesses -- if they're a business like a wealth business or a capital markets business where the assets go out the elevator every night. So you need to be careful about how you structure those deals. I still think that's a bit down the road. I don't see us looking to do any acquisitions in 2016. But as we continue to improve how we are running, I think we'll start to look, potentially in 2017 or 2018.","Kevin Barker","Is that decision being made -- is that primarily because of regulatory constraints, or due to your own decision to shore up the core operations as they stand now?","Bruce Van Saun","I think it's our decision. But I do think you have to bring all of your stakeholders along when you start to move in that direction. I think shareholders want to see us running the bank better and we have said that there is a lot we can do in that regard. So they want to see us deliver against that before we start getting distracted with doing more. I think regulators as well, have seen us make progress on things like CCAR and moving to heightened standards and some of the other things where the bar is going up and you have to stay focused on that agenda as well. So I think you just need to demonstrate that you're running things well and I think all the stakeholders will say, yes, you have earned the right to go out and do some more. But I don't think we're quite at that point, at this point.","Kevin Barker","And then, on auto lending, you've pulled back from the market and reduced the amount of capital you allocated to auto done well with charge-offs and delinquency rates have increased significantly through 2015. Could you just give us a feel for what you're seeing in the market right now, and your expectations through 2016 and into 2017 regarding that market?","Bruce Van Saun","I will start and Brad and even Eric can chime in. But I think that we made conscious decisions to move into the prime lending space from super prime. So the increase in charge-offs tracks higher yields as well. So the returns in the business have gone up over this period. And I would say from Q4 to Q1, we have actually seen an improvement in terms of delinquencies and other measures around credit. So I think we've stayed very disciplined. So we've expanded our risk appetite a bit. We're disciplined in terms of terms and conditions and in terms of the different markets not playing in sub-prime. But we needed to do that because the reality was that in super prime, you couldn't make a good return on capital. So that's really what's behind that but I'll let Brad provide some color.","Brad Conner","Bruce, I think you said it extremely well. And to your point, 30-day delinquencies were down for us, 90-day delinquencies were down for us, charge-offs were down, the portfolios' performance are tracking right in line. We're made a conscious decision to grow our assets in other areas with a little bit higher risk adjusted returns, like student, like we talked about. But we are actually quite comfortable with where we're at right now in auto, and feel very good about our credit performance.","Eric Aboaf","What I've add is that tapping the brakes a little bit on our originations and slowing down growth gave us the opportunity to adjust pricing. Guidance that falls right to the bottom line. We might do that again at some point or this is a classic asset class. It doesn't have as high returns as you would like, it actually has good stable credit dynamics, but not as high returns as you would like. And we'll be looking at pricing, we will look at securitization, we'll look at all the things you can do to essentially optimize this more over time.","Bruce Van Saun","And you could expect that as a percentage of our total loan assets, this will decline over time as we seek other opportunities to deploy our capital into better risk adjusted return areas.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Jason Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jason Harris","Question on fees. So you I think affirmed the guidance this year for fee income growth in the 2% to 3% range. But if I look at the guidance for Q2 and the Q1 result, it looks like fees are trending down kind of low to mid-single digits for the first half. So I'm trying to understand where some of the improvement will come from in the back half.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, Eric, why don't you pick that one up.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, let me start. I think that the anchor on fees, as we said, was service charges, right? And that -- given that, that is 40% of our book. I think, as you just work the numbers though, just remember the original guidance of 5% to 7% was kind of the old accounting basis but card fees actually impacts the reported results by 2 to 3 percentage points. So keep that in mind as you compare and contrast. That said, I think the real uptakes need to come on the investment side. And I thought it was actually nice that we did. We were up 3% year-on-year notwithstanding the ugly markets we saw in January and February. You remember with those felt like.","Mortgages, as we shift to conforming activity and we talked through that earlier in the call, gives us a very natural lift. You could keep a pipeline coming and the originations coming, and if you could shift that mix by 5 percentage points or, at some point, 10 percentage points, that's very powerful. And so a number of initiatives underway to do that. That takes time, but that will come.","And then I think there is a question on capital markets and a strong second quarter and a good second half of economic activity. You saw the economic signs out there, are quite positive now. Sharp contrast to what everyone felt like in January and February. And so that one can certainly pick up. Every one of those has work to be done. But we feel like we need to keep finding ways to get there.","Brad Conner","Eric, if I can chime in very quickly, I think you hit it well. You mentioned it in your opening comments, we have had two very good recruiting quarters in a row with financial consultants. Difficult quarter, just because of the market volatility but we feel very good about the underlying trends both in hiring and sales results in investments. So I think we feel quite optimistic about the opportunity in wealth and investments. One other quick thing to highlight, first quarter is a seasonally low quarter for deposit fees. So that's something to consider as well.","Bruce Van Saun ","The other thing that I would just chime in -- it's Bruce again is in my earlier remarks I said there will probably be some puts and takes on the year. And we might end up a tad late on fees. We have to make up for it with better net interest income or better performance on expenses. So we broadly reaffirmed our overall guidance, but there will probably be some puts and takes. So don't forget that comment. And then In the second quarter, that guidance to mid-single digits, as Eric pointed out, that's assuming a zero securities gain and we typically have some securities gains. If you put the same kind of security gains we had in Q1, that would push that up into a high single digit number. So just wanted to make that point clear as well.","Jason Harris","If I could, just as a follow-up, drill down specifically into the card segment, which I know has been a key growth initiative for you. It looks like you saw nice improvement in the average yield in that portfolio this quarter. With was that primarily a function of the higher prime rate this quarter? Or did you also see some improved revolve rates? And also any commentary around penetration would be helpful as well.","Eric Aboaf","Let me hit the financials first, and then Brad will describe a little more of the business activity under the surface. The yields tend to do well in the first quarter, probably was exactly as you describe. Primary came up and so the book repriced and that gained a very nice lift. Probably you just had pay down activity on some of the book. You roll through some of the acquisition fees that you may have seen in the third and fourth quarter, and so you end up with more fully priced balances which gives you a second tick up. So those were the two on the financial side.","Brad Conner","I think you hit it well. We launched a new card product last year, as a much improved value proposition which has improved revolve rates and card activation and usage pretty significantly, but it's also given us the ability to move away from the promotional rate. So that's been an influencer as well.","Bruce Van Saun","Great. Brad, is there anyone else on the line? Do we have any more calls on queue?","Operator","Currently no further questions in queue.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, great. Well, thank you everybody for dialing in today. Really appreciate your interest and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference today. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5532":["Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Hey, thanks Brad, and happy new decade to everybody. We're really pleased to have you join us. ","First this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our results and our outlook and will reference our presentation which you can find at investors.citizensbank.com.

Thanks Ellen. And good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to announce another strong quarter today. In spite of continuing interest rate and yield curve headwinds we've been able to maintain stable revenue as strong results in our fee businesses and attractive loan growth have worked to offset pressure on our net interest margin. ","For the full year, we grew our earnings per share by 8%. And we hit most of our guidance for 2019. Even though the interest rate and yield curve environment turned out much different than we had assumed. We continue to demonstrate strong expense discipline, good performance on credit, and robust capital return. ","As we look back on 2019, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in building a great bank. We're gaining customers and market share in both commercial and consumer given our focus on being a trusted advisor and delivering an excellent customer experience. The investments we've made in technology are paying dividends, witness our success with Citizens Access, over 20 FinTech partnerships, and the rollout of several new core platforms. ","We've attracted great talent. We've built a collegial, customer focused culture, and we've developed strong leaders. The development of an exciting TOP 6 program, along with several big strategic initiatives designed to grow medium-term revenues, and renewed bigger around our balance sheet optimization efforts give us a great underpinning for success in 2020 and beyond. ","Looking out at 2020, we anticipate that we will have a moderately good economic backdrop. We anticipate loan and deposit growth relatively consistent with this year, which will offset the impact on NIM of the Fed's 2019 rate cuts. We see a stable to modest rise in NIM over the course of the year starting in Q1. ","Our fee growth should continue to outpace peers, given the investments we've made and our expanding customer base. And while we continue to make growth investments, we nonetheless are targeting a modest level of positive operating leverage. And credit should stay in good shape, though CECL introduces some new wrinkles that John will cover in a few minutes. ","So to summarize, we're pleased with our progress in 2019. And we're excited to start the New Year with all its hope and all its promise. Before I turn it over to our CFO, John Woods, I would like to note that this will be the last earnings call for our Vice Chairman of Consumer, Brad Connor.","Brad has been great partner and has done a terrific job in positioning our consumer bank for future success. And we wish him well in retirement. We were pleased to be able to promote from within to fill the leadership going forward, a sign up a strong talent, we've assembled as Citizens. ","With that over to you John.","John Woods","Great and thanks Bruce and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report solid results this quarter and a strong finish to the year. With record fee income, good expense discipline and steady execution against our strategic initiatives. We are well positioned for a successful 2020 given our consistent track record of disciplined execution. ","Let me kick off by covering important highlights of our underlying results covered on pages 5 through 7. For the full year our EPS was up 8% with PPNR up 6% despite a challenging yield curve backdrop. A key driver was fee income growth of 17% with the record results across each of our major fee income businesses as we continue to expand our capabilities organically and through disciplined strategic acquisitions. ","We also continue to maintain good underlying expense discipline. We leverage the benefits of our TOP program to fund investments that drive future revenue growth. For the quarter, EPS growth was up 1% year-over-year. This reflects relatively stable net interest income as 4% interest earning asset growth helped offset the impact of a decline in net interest margin.","We also generated record fee income in the fourth quarter of nearly $500 million up 16% year-over-year highlighted by continued strength in mortgage and wealth and record revenues in capital markets and FX and IRP. We continue to strengthen and diversify our business model and the results are evident.","We delivered strong deposit growth of 7% year-over-year with growth across all categories. Our spot LDR was 95% leaving us well positioned as we enter 2020. On a linked quarter basis net interest income was relatively stable with good loan growth in the quarter and decelerating pressure on margin.","Importantly, we continue to manage our deposit costs well, bringing interest bearing deposit costs down to 15 basis points during the quarter. We remain highly disciplined on expenses and continue to execute extremely well on our TOP program. We delivered pretax run rate benefits of about $125 million for TOP 5, which is above our initial list of estimates for the program.","And our transformational TOP 6 program is well underway, with a target of approximately $300 million to $325 million in pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of 2021. I'll spend a few minutes on that and some of our strategic revenue initiatives shortly. ","Overall credit quality remains strong across retail and commercial. And both the non-performing loan ratio and the allowance coverage ratio showed nice improvement linked quarter and year-over-year. We deliver royalty of 12.5% and tangible book value per share was up 12% year-over-year to $32.08. ","On page 8, net interest income was relatively stable linked quarter as a pickup in loan growth offset a 6 basis points decrease in net interest margin. This reflects the impact of lower rates and higher prepayments on asset yields partially offset by the benefit of improved asset mix and deposit pricing discipline.","On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was down 2%, as our loan growth of 3% helped to largely offset the impact of a 19 basis points decline in net interest margin to 3.06 given rates. On a positive note, we lowered funding costs by 7 basis points, reflecting the improved funding mix on deposit growth and the benefit of lower rates.","In the phase of the shifting rate environment and related balance sheet dynamics, we are actively managing our asset sensitivity, which remained broadly stable at around a 3% impact to a gradual 200 basis points rising rates with about 75% of this exposure tied to longer rates. ","Moving to fees on slide nine. Our fee based businesses continue to perform very well reflecting the significant progress we are making in strengthening and expanding our capabilities, which is helping to further diversify our revenue. This includes our mortgage banking and wealth management businesses on the consumer side, and capital and global markets in commercial. ","Noninterest income hit record levels at nearly $500 million for the quarter and was up 16% year-over-year, as our fee income ratio improved 3.5 points to 30%. Noninterest income was relatively stable linked quarter as record results in capital markets and foreign exchange and interest rate products offset lower mortgage banking revenue, which as expected declined from record third quarter levels. ","Capital market fees were up $27 million linked quarter as loan syndication fees were higher with strong volumes leading to a record number of lease up transactions, which increased 11% year-over-year. M&A advisory fees were also higher reflecting a strong contribution from Bowstring which we have early last year.","We also continue to gain traction in underwriting fees. Foreign exchange and interest rate product revenues also reached record levels and were up $14 million linked quarter driven by increased client activity as sentiment improved with these easing trade tensions, as well as a benefit from CDA.","Wealth management posted a solid performance with trusted investment services fees up 4% sequentially as market conditions improved. Mortgage banking fees were lower by $37 million from records third quarter levels, reflecting the impact of higher long term rates and seasonality on originations, which contributed to a $20 million reduction in production revenue. ","In addition, MSR valuation hedging results declined by $21 million from higher levels in the third quarter. Providing a partial offset for mortgage servicing fees up $4 million driven by growth in the servicing portfolio, which increased by 4% sequentially to over $98 billion, as well as by lower amortization expense","Turning to Page 10, non-interest expense was down $5 million or 1% linked quarter. Excluding the impact of the lease transaction in 3Q '19 non-interest expense was relatively stable and demonstrates our ongoing efforts to improve efficiency. We continue to utilize savings from our TOP program to reinvest in the revenue generating opportunities.","Salary and employee benefits were down 1% reflecting the impact of our efficiency programs, as well as lower incentive compensation. Outside services expense was up 7% sequentially, largely reflecting the impact of higher retail loan origination activity and seasonality. Year-over-year our non-interest expense was up 5% or 4% before the impact of acquisitions, reflecting our funding of growth oriented investments.","Let's move on to Page 11 and discuss core loan trends. Average loans were up 1.5% linked quarter with a modest drag from balance sheet optimization initiatives as we moved $1.1 billion of non-relationship mortgage loans to held for sale late in the quarter. Average loans were up 1.8% before the impact of this loan sale activity.","On a linked quarter basis, commercial loans were up 1% as we continue to execute well against our geographic, product and client focused expansion strategies, partially offset by plan reductions and commercial leasing. Retail loans were up 1.7% linked quarter and up 2.4% before the impact of the loan sales activity given growth in mortgage, education and merchant partnerships.","Year-over-year average loans were up 3% and adjusting for the impact of loan sales activity were up 4%, with 3% growth in commercial, and 5% growth in retail. Overall period-end loans were up 1% linked quarter providing some momentum for first quarter loan growth.","Moving to page 12, we saw nice deposit growth of 1.4% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year as we've benefited from investments we've made over the past several years to expand and enhance our capabilities. Our DDA growth was 3% on a linked quarter basis and relatively stable year-over-year which compares favorably to industry trends.","Additionally, our Citizens Access digital platform, which reached $5.8 billion in deposits at the end of the quarter continues to contribute to our funding diversification and the optimization of our deposit base. Given the rate environment, we continue to aggressively execute our deposit playbook to manage down our deposit costs across all channels, reducing CD rates, retail money market promo rates, and taking down the savings rate in our digital bank.","We've also been reducing rates for commercial clients where it makes sense. As a result, our total deposit costs were well controlled, down 12 basis points linked quarter, a nice improvement from the 5 basis point decrease last quarter. This includes the benefit of interest-bearing deposit costs which were down 15 basis points linked quarter.","Next, let's move to page 13 and cover credit, which continues to look quite good overall across retail and commercial. Non-performing loans decreased 5% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year and the NPL ratio of 59 basis points improved 4 basis points linked quarter and 7 basis points year-over-year.","Net charge-offs came in at 41 basis points in the quarter, up modestly linked quarter reflecting seasonally higher losses in auto and expected seasoning in other retail, partially offset by modestly lower commercial losses. Provision for credit losses of $110 million was up from the prior quarter, largely driven by continued seasoning in retail growth portfolios.","Our allowance to loans coverage ratio remained relatively stable, ending the quarter at 105 basis points, while our NPL coverage ratio improved to 178%, up from 171% linked quarter, and 162% versus a year ago. On page 14, we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions, ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10%, which compares well with peers.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 10.9 million shares of common stock and including common dividends returned $558 million to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased a total of 34 million shares, and including common dividends returned $1.84 billion to shareholders up 23% from 2018. Going forward, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of about 35% to 40%.","Let's move to page 15 and discuss CECL. On the slide, we have provided some high level information about our methodology and the key macroeconomic variables that are drivers of the outcomes. We still expect the day one impact of CECL on our reserves will be an increase in the 30% to 35% range, which represents about 22 to 25 basis points of CET1 on a fully phased in basis, or approximately a 5 to 6 basis points impact starting in 2020.","This range considers the current economic outlook and mix and credit characteristics of the portfolio. Ultimately, the amount of the initial impact will reflect our view of the macroeconomic outlook and some fine tuning of our reserve models. So we plan to provide you with a final number when we issue our 10-K in February.","Our estimated day 2 impact results in 2020 provision expansion the range of $475 million to $575 million with expected charge offs in the $475 million to $525 million range. Let me note that under CECL, quarterly volatility of provision could be potentially higher due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast and the mix of loan growth and run off.","On page 16, I want to highlight a few exciting things that are happening across our bank. First, Forbes ranked us second among financial institutions, and 16th overall on their 2019 List of America's Best Employers for New Graduates. We are really proud of that because it shows that we are doing a good job of developing young talent, and it's a reflection of all the exciting things we are doing as we build a top performing bank.","We also announced the second year of our leadership level national partnership with Feeding America to combat hunger. And this is just one of the important things we do to help people in the communities we serve.","Since our last call, we have now launched an exciting new merchant partnership program with Microsoft for the Xbox All Access Program, which is distributed through Amazon. We are really excited about this program and our opportunity to partner with great merchants to help build deep and lasting relationships with their customers.","We are also hitting on all cylinders with the work we've done to expand our fee businesses and build out our capabilities. We have virtually completed the integration of our Franklin American Mortgage acquisitions, which again saw very strong results this quarter with strong originations and improved year-over-year sales margins.","And in the commercial business, we are very happy with our progress moving up the syndication league table coming in at number three for middle market and increasing our number of league lead transactions.","We've also been enhancing our capital and global markets capabilities, building our M&A advisory business and client hedging capabilities. And both of these businesses saw record results this quarter. Also, in our treasury solutions business this quarter, we completed the client migration to accessOPTIMA, our best in class cash management platform. ","On page 17, let me provide you with an update on the progress we're making in our expectations for the TOP 6 program. The TOP program have been instrumental in driving efficiencies that allow us to self-funded investments and continue to deliver future growth. Overall, we expect to deliver $300 million to $325 million in pretax run rate benefits by year end 2021 with about $175 million to $225 million of that coming by year-end 2020.","Our TOP 6 program consists of two parts. The first being the transformational program, which is designed to transform how we operate and deliver for our customers and colleagues. I'll give you a few examples of what we're doing. We aim to deliver a more customer centric, efficient and agile environment and modernizing our IT practices and our cross organization operating model.","This IT work will further modernize our infrastructure and platforms and transform our technology delivery approach. We are accelerating migration to the cloud, utilizing data and artificial intelligence more ambitiously, and digitizing end to end processes.","We're converting ourselves to an agile company over the next 12 to 18 months. This will make a huge difference in terms of the speed to market for everything we do, and will significantly enhance our ability to innovate, adapt and deliver for customers.","The second part of the TOP 6 program is the more traditional improvement program similar to those that we successfully executed over the last five years. On the efficiency side, we are accelerating our retail network transformation, modernizing our branches and rationalizing our footprint to better serve and advise customers. We are looking at ways to simplify our organizational and improve the way our back office operations support the business and work more efficiently.","Cost to implement the program are estimated to increase or approximately $75 million over the course of the year but we will look for strategies to offset these notable items as we've done in the past. Importantly, the benefits of TOP 6 will help to mitigate the impact of the rate environment and ensure we maintain our commitment to delivering operating leverage and improving our efficiency and the way we run the bank. ","Moving to page 18. We expect to utilize some savings from the TOP program to fund the strategic revenue opportunities we are going after. For example, we are looking to significantly expand digital strategies across the bank to reach more customers. We plan to expand the products that offered from Citizens Access to further extend our national reach beyond our branch footprint.","Our first wave of additional products should launch by late this year. We're also planning to launch a new commercial customer digital offering. We envision developing a simple integrated self-service and fully digital platform to serve small businesses and lower middle market customers with tools to help them run their businesses better and enable frictionless deposit and lending capabilities.","Another example is our effort to leverage the success we've had with our merchant banks partnerships to enhance the payment experience at point of sale, while helping customers responsibly make larger ticket purchases. Taken together, these revenue opportunities would require roughly $40 million investment in 2020, about 70% of which would be in CapEx. If executed well, the investment should really benefit our medium term revenue growth and provide about a 1% boost to ROTCE by 2024.","Moving to page 19. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about the coming year and the opportunity we have to continue building a top performing bank that delivers for all stakeholders. The capabilities we have built and that have delivered success from the IPO [indiscernible] give us the confidence that we can sustain our progress into the future.","We have a strong customer focused culture and an experienced Board and Management team. We have a proven ability to execute and a commitment to excellence that will propel us going forward. Additionally, we have demonstrated strong execution on our enterprise initiatives such as our TOP programs, which are quite differentiating and demonstrate the mindset of continuous improvement. ","We also have made good progress on balance sheet optimization. As we have developed initiatives for both sides of the balance sheet to further build capabilities and optimize our position. We also continue to make important investments in our futures. We're thinking about the long term making good decisions about how to prioritize where we spend money, and balancing that with the need to deliver progress near term.","As we look out into the medium term, we remain committed to our ROTCE target of 14% to 16% with details in the appendix. Clearly we've had to contend with a change rate environment, so it's taking longer, but we remain confident in our ability to deliver given a reasonable environment.","On page 20, we review our 2019 performance against the guidance we provided at the start of the year. And despite a pretty dramatic shift in the rate environment from the beginning of the year, we executed well across our targets and delivered overall in the bottom line.","Keys to this overall performance we're delivering strong fee revenue, reflecting our initiatives to expand fee based capabilities, delivering solid loan growth in areas with attractive risk adjusted return profiles, and maintaining strong expense discipline and stable credit quality, all while returning significant capital to shareholders.","Now turning to our outlook for 2020 on page 21. We expect modest NII growth of around 1% to 2% as the benefit of 3% to 4% loan growth is partially offset by the impact of lower rates relative to a year ago. Given our current expectation for the Fed to remain on hold through the end of the year, we expect net interest margin to be down in line with 2019 results as pressure on loan yields is partially offset by improvements in deposit pricing.","We expect to continue to leverage our more diversified business model and enhanced capabilities to deliver noninterest income growth in the range of 4% to 5.5%. We also will target modest positive operating leverage in the 50 basis points range and a stable efficiency ratio by maintaining good expense discipline, while continuing to make important investments to drive future revenue growth.","We expect underlying credit quality to remain well controlled, and we currently expect provision expense under CECL to be in the range of $475 million to $575 million, with charge off in the range of $475 million to $525 million. We expect our CET1 to end the year in the 9.75% to 10% range with a dividend payout ratio towards the upper end of our 35% to 40% target.","Let me note that this outlook does not include notable items. We expect those costs to be in the range of approximately $75 million over the course of the year. ","Our outlook for the first quarter on page 22 reflects historical seasonality of first quarter revenues and expenses. We are expecting net interest income to be up slightly as loan growth and a stable to slightly up net interest margin are partially offset by a $10 million impact from day count.","The fee income outlook for the quarter reflects seasonal trends, resulting in a mid-single digit increase from strong fourth quarter levels. That said, pipelines and our fee businesses look good early in the quarter.","Noninterest expense is expected to be up in the low single digits largely given seasonal payroll tax and compensation impacts. The provision is expected to be modestly higher in the $115 million to $120 million range. Finally, we expect the tax rate to remain stable around the 22% level and for the CET1 ratio to end the first quarter at around 10%. ","To sum up on page 24, our results this quarter demonstrate our continued strong performance as we execute against our strategic initiatives, grow customers and revenues, carefully manage our expense base, deploy new technologies and improve how we run the bank.","Now, let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, thank you, John. Brad and operator, let's open it up to Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question here will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. ","Bruce Van Saun","Good morning. ","Matt O'Connor","The revenue outlook seems a little bit better than expected and better than some peers. Obviously fees is a big component of that. Could you just elaborate a bit on the drivers of fees in a very good fourth quarter and cap markets mortgage rates FX, but talk about the kind of drivers on a full year basis and why they're confident in that high fee revenue growth? Thank you. ","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. I'll let talk of John and I'll pass to you. But you know, Matt, I think it's been a journey here on investing in our fee businesses and building out our capabilities. And we have a growing customer base, we're growing households on the consumer side, it's up the number of accounts and clients we service on the commercial side. ","So making that all kind of work in harmony. So that those expanded capabilities can get delivered as we become a trusted advisor and provide advice to our customers. We're really starting to see the fruits of that. So you can see that hit and accelerate as we go through 2019 and I think as we look into '20. There's more juice in the lemon, so to speak, to squeeze on that. ","So with that overview, why don't I give it to John and then maybe Don and Brad, you could comment on each of your businesses.","John Woods","Yes, I think that's well said, Bruce. I'd say the outlets for 2020. If you start looking forward, you see our expected strengths in both businesses and Don and Brad will comment. But capital markets for example is an area of ongoing strength. We've been making investments and capabilities there. ","We -- I think there's a balance and this is a little bit of a theme of organic investments being combined with the synergies from small bolt-on acquisitions that we've done over the last couple of years. And that's evidence in the M&A advisory space within cap markets going forward. ","We've made lots of organic investments in the global market space and we've had some record results here recently, I think two quarters in a row in IRP. On the consumer side, I'd say that mortgage and wealth are the two areas that I would point to. Solid expected underpinning and mortgage going forward given that helps to diversify some of our food businesses.","And then in wealth, the ongoing integration of product sales and the synergies there combined with the investments in the FA advisory space on the RSA advisors were up 4% over the year. And as that the full year effect of that as you get into 2020, and the productivity that you expect in that salesforce looks good, along with maybe a more constructive mid to long-term rate environment for which will help to relieve some of the pressure on some of the transaction revenues we had in the wealth space looking forward.","So all-in, we feel pretty good about the outlook for 2020 on fees.","Bruce Van Saun ","Don, you want to go?","Don McCree","Yes. Now, I just amplify a little bit. I think John and Bruce covered a lot of it. But the other thing that I focus on is share gains. We are -- as John said, moving up the league tables nicely and all the relatively league tables which says, even in a market that was a little bit quiet, like the syndicated loan market to a large part of the year we captured more than our share when we're right up there with the big money centers at this point in that sector.","Second thing I just point to is diversification. We've really diversified out our fee stream. So if you looked back three or four years ago, it was really a syndicated loan story on the capital market side. We've built a couple nice equity partnerships. We've built a high yield business out. And when different markets are accelerating, we're able to generate revenues.","And the third thing is we've just hired a lot of extremely strong people on the origination and corporate finance side. And I think we're pitching really well in the marketplace. And we're winning more than our fair share of business. So I feel very good about where the business stands. ","And as John said, I sit here today our pipelines look a lot better today than they did a year ago. So we're entering the year quite strongly. ","Bruce Van Saun ","Great. And Brad?","Brad Conner","Yeah, I think you both did a nice job of teeing it up. Just a couple of things to add. I agree completely with what John said on the wealth side. I think we have a significant opportunity to leverage the Clarfeld acquisition in 2020.","We had good progress in 2019, but a lot of that effort was around the integration work and building the right foundation. I think we're really ready to leverage and launch that platform in 2020. And feel really good about where we stand in the integration of the capability. We now have the sort of the high network and ultrahigh network business.","And on the mortgage side, certainly we may see the reify activity come down just a little bit in 2020. But we really think we can overcome that with significant opportunity in our third party businesses. We've been investing -- the one of the things that Franklin American gave us was a diversified origination platform.","We now have wholesale correspondent and retail capabilities. And we've been making significant investments in all of those businesses around making the experience better, investing in digital capabilities. And we really believe that we're ready to launch those capabilities particularly on the wholesale and correspondent side. So I feel very optimistic on the mortgage front. ","Bruce Van Saun ","Great.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. A lot of color. Thank you. ","Bruce Van Saun ","Thanks. Next question? ","Operator","Ken Usdin, your line is open, with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Hey, guys. On the loan growth side. It looks really good especially even on commercials in light of the industry numbers that obviously don't look anywhere near as good. And I know you talked about balance sheet optimization continuing underneath.","I just wondering just how much do you see still in the uptake of your recent adds and your vertical expansions? And what are you just seeing on the customer demand side underneath that to continue to propel especially on the C&I side? Thanks. ","John Woods","Yeah. So why don't I take that? I think it's a tricky environment out there. Just because competition is really heavy. And there's not a lot of huge demand for new money. Now, with the trade first phase behind us, I'm sensing already a little bit of more optimism in the client base, but it's way too early to really see it translate into the numbers.","I will say that our pipelines -- our originations and in our pipeline for originations were as strong as they had ever been last year. They were offset by a lot of pay downs. So you saw a lot of working capital efficiency in the form of borrowers and you saw quite a bit of refinancing into the public markets and in the institutional market. So there's lots of puts and takes in terms of loan growth. ","What we are benefiting from is our geographic expansions. We moved into the southeast, last year we moved into Texas and California. So we are adding new clients and that is generating an element of our loan growth. I would say our core middle market has been relatively flattish and we expect it to stay relatively flattish.","So, as we kind of go through day to day, it's really picking and choosing our spots, making sure we contain credit quality, making sure we actually earn adequate returns on the capital we're deploying. But we actually like the volume that we're seeing. So I think our projection for this year is like low single digit loan growth. ","I will say that if you look at in the underlying numbers, we had a quite a strong CRE [ph] growth last year that was due to several large transactions at the end of the year, which were purpose built transactions for large corporates, which popped our numbers a little bit and made our CRE growth look a little higher than we had expected it to be when we're sitting here midyear. ","Bruce Van Saun","But very safe\u2026","Ken Usdin","We like to business, yeah.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Great. And then one question on deposits. It is nice to see also Citizens Access still growing even with the change in the rate environment. Can you just talk about deposit pricing? And just what happens now that we get to a point where rates are more stable?","John Woods","Yeah, I'll go ahead and jump in there. And I'd say this way. I mean, I think they're, we've seen really strong deposit growth. I should hasten to add that we're really proud of not only Citizens Access but also all of the organic work that's going on in the businesses to drive DDA and other low cost deposits.","I think that's been an area of real benefit for us over the last several quarters and that continues. So that's very helpful. In terms of the earnings deposit costs down by 15 basis points this quarter. You just really starting to see the impacts of those rate cuts being and it takes a little bit of a lag to see that kick in.","I would say that, we would expect to see continuing prices for deposit pricing come down as you look into the first half of 2020. As you get out into later in 2020. You could see some of that to dissipate. But we still see pricing opportunities as you look, across not only our branch footprint but also with respect to online pricing as you head into the early part of 2020.","Ken Usdin","Alright, thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll go down to the next question in the queue will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. [Operator Instructions]. We do have him back here and his line is open. ","Peter Winter","Okay, sorry about that. Consumer loan growth was particularly strong this quarter and the consumer overall is pretty strong. Would you expect consumer loan growth to kind of lead the growth in 2020?","Bruce Van Saun","I am sorry could you repeat the question? It's consumer loan growth has been relatively strong in the second half of the year, do we expect strong long growth as we go into 2020?","John Woods","Yes. I'll go and start off on that. And others can add color. But I'd say it this way more broadly. We feel pretty good about the balanced profile of our loan growth into 2020 on both the commercial and consumer retail side of things. And I think that's been a strength of ours and more recently, which we were under weighed in the commercial side.","And, I think that that'll help us as, as we across varying environments. With respect to consumer specifically. Within consumer again, diversification is a good story there. We see some strength in the resi side in the past, and we see that continuing into 2020.","But from a balance sheet optimization standpoint, we see some of those portfolios that we really liked from a risk return standpoint, such as education, and some of our merchant businesses really helping to drive some uptake over the next year as well.","And I should hasten to add that that helps balance exposure from the CECL standpoint also. So it just looks to be relatively good momentum on both sides of the ledger there. And I'll stop there and see if Brad wants to add. ","Brad Conner","Yes, I -- what I would add there. Yes, I think before you started, John, which is it's well balanced and we're seeing relatively strong demand across almost all the asset classes. And when you look at the fourth quarter, we had good demand on the home lending side or all the education refinance product was strong, we're seeing really good momentum on the merchant side.","We've talked about this a couple of times already, but the consumer just appears to be strong and we're just seeing the demand. I mean, we've talked about running down our auto book, which we have done intentionally that even there we're seeing that become a little bit more attractive asset class as you're starting to see margins widen out a little bit.","So overall, just good, strong. ","Bruce Van Saun","It's Bruce. And I would flag ed refi and the merchant partnerships has be specifically shining stars as we head into 2020 or we would expect to see growth. And it's very attractive from a risk adjusted return standpoint.","We have made investments in our card business. So I think we'll see some growth in card as well. In mortgage we are -- and I note the sale that we've just announced that we're going to try to call thin relationship mortgages and recycle that capital.","So we've done some of that with auto, do some of that in mortgage. We're still fighting the trends in HELOC. So we still have a little bit of drag there. So there's a few things that are going to be working against this, but I think on a net basis will still have solid outlook for consumer loan growth in 2020.","Peter Winter","Got it. That's very helpful. The 2020 margin outlook of stable to slightly up versus fourth quarter. I guess it's assuming no rate cuts in 2020. And the question is, what if the Fed does cut rates and just where some of the puts and takes to the margin outlook? ","John Woods","Yes, I'll go ahead and cover that. I'd say, as you mentioned, the outlook for NIM is to be up slightly given a couple of things. I mean, I think we're seeing, some stabilization on the loan front. I mean, we've had a lot of pressure on loan yields, as the industry has. And we see that stabilizing in the first quarter. ","And nevertheless, we still think, as I mentioned earlier, that we'll see some benefit from deposit costs declining. That along with the issue of day count, when you go from 4Q to 1Q all of that would lead to uplift in the first quarter with respect to NIM. And we think that that can hold and possibly even, kind of show some opportunities for improvement thereafter within 2020.","Now, with that said to the extent that there's a rate cut, I mean, we still are assets sensitive positively. So therefore that sensitivity is around 3%, as I mentioned in my remarks. And so we would have, some negative impact to that and we tend to manage that through some of the hedging that we've done, and what have you. ","Bruce Van Saun","And I would just add Peter that the markets are not looking for any further reductions for some time. And I think all of the public commentary by Fed officials is that, they've eased and created looser conditions, monetary conditions, and they want to wait and see how that affects the economy in the data.","So, I think we're in the clear for a reasonable period of time before we really have to worry about whether there needs to be further reductions. I personally think that, if the economy picks up some steam here because of some of those easings and because some of the macro overhangs like trade tension and what's going to happen with Brexit as those things have eased, to me there's probably more of a upside breakout bias here the downside as we look in 2020, all things considered.","And so our feeling is that the next move might be up if we're at these very tight unemployment levels and inflation is starting to trickle up. You could see a scenario where the Fed pauses and stays on hold for a long time, but then ultimately feels the need to do some retracement up. ","John Woods","Yes, I was just going to add one other point. With respect to a few quarters ago, we shifted our asset sensitivity to the longer end in an environment, where we think a steepening as we have a bias towards steepening of the curve as well. And so that that to me is an important [indiscernible] to any environment. ","Bruce Van Saun","I think historically, when you've seen the Fed go on pause, the 2s to 10s spread has deepened, usually in the range of 50 basis points. And so we're still roughly at half of that and certainly that would create a little kick here to NII. ","Peter Winter","That's great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question here will come from the line of Scott Siefers. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the call. I think I just wanted to ask a follow up on some of the digital offerings on Citizen Access. So as you get more time under your belt, and the volume continues to grow, what are you finding about the elasticity or price sensitivity of that customers as time marches on? ","John Woods","I'm just -- I'll kick off there. I mean, I think we've seen is the betas in that in that space are pretty typical, something in the neighborhood of 60% to 70% on the way up. We've been able to retrace that as rates have come down.","I think more broadly, though, as we mentioned before, this has been a home run for us in terms of diversifying our funding sources and the pricing of it actually has been accretive to our NIM. With respect to being much better able to optimize our pricing, our promotional approaches to focusing on deposit primacy etcetera within the branch footprint.","So going forward, we feel like there's pretty good pricing power there. But the whole point of that platform is more of a strategic deepening, with a customer segment that we find really attractive. And as we mentioned in some of our remarks, we plan to add to that platform, later this year and we're excited about broadening our approach to that customer segment. ","Brad Conner","Extremely well said I think we've learned that they just behave the way we would have hoped on the way up. And yeah, there is a sentiment that customers -- to the customer experience that we're providing. And we're finding that they're quite sticky when we raise rates as rates -- or excuse me lower rates as come down. So yeah, we feel quite good about it. ","Bruce Van Saun ","Yeah. And I was going to add that as well, Brad that I think we spent a lot of time designing the experience and making it really terrific for folks. And so as long as we're paying competitive rates I think there is no reason really for them to switch. And then if we can come along with these rollout of additional products and have even deeper relationships that makes it even more tricky as time goes by.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then maybe John, if you could expand upon a couple of your comments regarding rate sensitivity? I know you guys have taken some efforts over the last few quarters, to moderate the level of access sensitivity to where you are now.","I guess I'm curious for any updated thoughts on what the endgame would be foreign service stable rate environment. Do we want to neutralize the sensitivity or maintain some modest level of asset sensitivity? How are you thinking about that dynamic? ","John Woods","Yeah. I mean think as you heard earlier, I mean we have a bias that the Fed is likely on hold here and kind of bias towards the fact that there's some steepening potential in the yield curve that particularly given the recent events on trade and other factors in the macro.","So all of that said I think a low to moderate asset sensitivity position is a more durable expectation going forward. As I mentioned earlier, we shift some of our asset sensitivity out to the longer. And so now we're call it in the 75% range of our 3% sensitivity is really tied to longer rates. And so a little bit less volatility with respect to the moves on the short end. So we think that's the appropriate positioning. And I think that'll serve us well to manage the NAI issues going forward. ","Bruce Van Saun ","And one thing, Scott is that we are constantly running simulations and calibrating what the markets expectations are, and making adjustments to those hedges on a regular basis. So we feel good about quality of analytics and the people we have running those analytics. And you have to start with a view as John said, and then you tell your position there. But we're constantly looking at well what if we're wrong and what if this happens that we covered off different scenarios. So we feel good about the capabilities we have there?","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Thank you guys very much.","Operator","And next we'll go to Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. So the company has outperformed those results in outlook. And again it's clearly reflected in the stock price performance. I thought it was interesting that you've reiterated once again your medium term ROTCE of 14% to 16%. Consensus are both '20 and '21 has ROTCE in the low 12.","And I'm wondering Bruce, and john, if you could help us with the walk in terms of getting from to your medium term of 14% from the 12.8. In other words what is consensus missing in that they don't have even approaching that range over the next two years. ","Bruce Van Saun ","Yeah. Well, let me start John, and then you can pick up. But one thing Erika that we like to highlight in the release is the fact that with the change in rates, we've had an increase in the value of our securities portfolio, which is a good thing when it comes to book value per share. But it raises your overall equity.","And so the impact of that was 85 basis points from where we ended up Q4 to where we were Q4 of 2018. So one of the things that could really help propel us back towards the 14%, which we had briefly touched in Q4 of '18 would be a steepening in the curve. And I don't think, analyst consensus -- I don't think people really go and model that and carry it through to what the impact could be on OCI. ","So there's that element that I would just kind of lead off with and say if we got in a rate environment where the curve started to step in and the economy stayed strong next year, that would certainly help propel us higher.","I think beyond that, then it's really boils down to continuing to deliver that positive operating leverage. And in a way, I would say, if you think about 2020, we're still going through a period of transition to deal with the impacts of the Fed moves in 2019.","And they'll have an impact as you can see in the guidance. And so you won't have as much operating leverage as you've had in the past, you'll have to fight the tape a little bit on NIM. So earnings per share growth won't be as much as it's been historically.","But to me 2020 is a really, really important year, because we have teed up some very significant efforts. We have TOP 6 and that positions us really well for the future in terms of how we deliver technology and serve customers and run the bank more efficiently. ","And with that, we have identified some really great opportunities we think that we can build on capabilities we have and really start to invest in these three strategic initiatives, which are outlined in the deck. Which I think we're duly cautious on how long it's going to take to build those businesses and scale those businesses.","And we say that you look out in the medium term, and there's a 1% boost to our ROTCE coming from those initiatives. And we'll work really hard to do everything we can to try to accelerate that. So, I think 2021, if we execute well through 2020 I think there's a fair amount of upside to, if you're in a constructive environment.","And we've pulled through the TOP program. We've got some [indiscernible] behind these strategic initiatives that we could set up ourselves very well to get back to something where there's more operating leverage and a more rigorous rate of EPS from.","So anyway, I'll stop there and John, you can add to that. ","John Woods","Yes. I know that's well said. I'd say just Erica in terms of puts and takes on that. I mean, I think when we look out into the future. We see opportunities for ROTCE expansion in a number of areas, just a couple. Certainly in the NII states, the way that we're -- way that we're growing the balance sheet and how we're going to use balance sheet optimization with more momentum there, frankly, to really drive ROTCE uptake. I think, is a real opportunity. ","You heard about TOP. I think our TOP program, I think is differentiating. It's driving ROTCE improvement. We're going to invest some of that in the strategic initiatives, which will also be, as we mentioned, possibly a point of ROTCE over the medium term. And Bruce mentioned, the denominator, OCI and capital related items that will be a tailwind. ","I mean, I think all of those things, we have a good line of sight too. There are some takes to that, right? I mean, I think credit, although still quite good and strong. I mean, it's -- the things of -- you can see credit getting not exactly fully normalizing, but credit not being quite as perfect as it was a year or two ago.","And the rate environment is also a little bit of a headwind to full of building. So all those things together give us a lot of confidence in that statement.","Erika Najarian","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for the additional color on CECL, that's helpful. I wanted to ask about your CECL outlook and maybe this is going into the weeds a little bit for an earnings call. But, John, if I pick the midpoint of your true up range 30 to 35.","I get to an ACL ratio, not an ALLL ratio, but an ACL ratio of about 144 bps. And if I forecast that out next year using your provision and your charge off guidance plus your loan growth. It implies that that ratio is kind of flat to down-ish a little bit over the course of the year, which suggests your net new loan growth has lost content that is similar to maybe even slightly lower than what your back book is. ","So I guess my question is am I thinking about that right. Because it does seem counterintuitive a little bit to me that you're growing -- and part of story is that you're growing in the higher margin segments, especially on the retail side, which presumably should have a bit higher loss content over the life of the loan than your back book.","And I guess should we be thinking that your ACL or your ALLL ratio everyone to think about it. Overtime under CECL if that balance sheet optimization continues actually migrates upwards. So I guess, I'm just trying to think about the provisioning guidance relative to charge-offs and sort of net new loan growth in the loss content of that under CECL.","John Woods","Yeah, Saul thanks for that. I'll add a couple of points. First, as we have mentioned, we know, we're still working with finalizing our models. And this is all new to the industry, but we spent a lot of time on it, and have some thoughts that we can share. I will add more thoughts and talk about this further in future calls.","But just to comment on your point, I think what you have to do is be reminded of two important thoughts. One is as we mentioned before, we have a pretty diversified loan growth outlook. So when you think about those loan categories that have lower CECL content, which is the commercial space and call it mortgage.","And if you look at -- what our expectation is that commercial and mortgage are pretty big part of what we're doing from a dollar perspective, because those are big portfolios, and they're growing at good rates. So that drives a lot of dollar loan growth.","Whereas the other portfolios that we're growing from a DSO standpoint that we're excited about, which is on the education and merchant front are higher percentage growth, but they're not, they're off of smaller basis. So when you look at the dollars, you're pretty well balanced from an outlook into 2020 from a CECL standpoint, between those loans that maybe have a higher CECL loan loss content, versus those that have a lower CECL loss content.","All that said, charge-offs unaffected. So that's maybe something you can think about when you're looking for that outlook.","Saul Martinez","Okay. No, that's helpful. So it basically -- because the much bigger dollar value on C&I and mortgage which you may have a lower loss content that sort of balances out and it really doesn't change your ALLL ratio going forward. Is that sort of the thought?","John Woods","You got it.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And then just changing gears a little bit on deposit costs and the outlook there in your NII guidance. So far, I think your deposit costs are down since the second quarter about 21 bps on 75 basis points of cuts, so already about the 28% beta.","What's kind of baked into your guidance for sort of the beta on the downside, because you're assuming the Fed funds rate stays where it's at? How much more in deposit cost reductions? What's the sort of through the cycle beta that you're assuming?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I mean, I don't know if betas are quite as useful in a period where you think the Fed's going to be on hold, right? I mean, when you look at the in-period betas, you know, as the Fed doesn't, which is our expectation that Fed is on hold, but nevertheless, we expect deposit costs to decline in the first quarter, then you're going to have an infinite beta.","So, I'm not sure the in-periods makes sense but in terms of the cumulative beta, I think we're getting up towards 40% and maybe able to drive that higher in terms of what since the down cycle began, in the second quarter if you use that as the base 2Q of 2019.","So yeah, I mean, I think that, as I mentioned...","Bruce Van Saun","The other point we made earlier time is the farther away you get from the Fed pause then the less opportunity there is. So we're still going to see some of that in Q1 and then that'll start to head as we get through the year, next year.","John Woods","Exactly, I'd say, 1H 2020, we still see opportunities to continue to cause deposit pricing to come down. And then you know the ongoing -- throughout the rest of the year there's still balance sheet optimization activities to even consider whether there are some opportunities thereafter, but it does dissipate as Bruce mentioned. So that's really the thinking.","The other thing I would just add is that, you know, there's a front book back book dynamic on CDs for our term deposits that are rolling over that has been positive, certainly over the last half of 2019. And then we expect that to be a positive dynamic as you get throughout most, if not all of 2020.","Saul Martinez","No, that's helpful. And you know the 40% just to be clear that, that's on the 75 basis points and my question is more just on the 75 basis points that's been cut already. How to think about the deposit cost relative to that? I guess the 40% is on that 75 basis points, right?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah.","John Woods","Yes, it is. It's cumulative on that. We worked to that and all those other things that we just talked about what it would influence that into 2020.","Saul Martinez","Got it, thank you. ","John Woods","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Brian Foran","Hi, most of my questions been asked. But one that comes up sometimes is merchant partnerships, obviously been very successful and a really good initiative for you. One concern sometimes investors bring up is what if the merchant decides to move the relationship. So, can you talk to how you make the relationship sticky? ","Things you do add value beyond just providing loan any contractual provisions you have, anything like that for someone who might be worried about when you're partner is moving overtime?","John Woods","It's great question. And we do get quite a bit. Listen, I hate to be too motherhood and apple pie, but the way to make him the stickiest is to provide great customer experiences. I mean, at the end of the day, what we're doing is we're helping our merchant partners sell more product. And we think we've done that in a very big way.","With all the partners we've had we've been even lost track three or four years now with Apple and we feel like we have just a tremendous relationship with them and that we provide a very unique customer experience. That has been the entree for us opening up with other partners.","We do look at other things that we can do to deepen the relationships, providing data back to those partners and so forth. But at the end of the day, it really comes down to just providing a unique and a very exceptional customer experience. I think our partners would say that we do that well. ","Brian Foran","Thank you. That was it for me.","Operator","And we'll go to the next line to just a moment here John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi, John. ","John Pancari","Just on the expense side, just a couple of quick things there. On the comp expense, you had a good link quarter decline in comp expense, despite the strength that you saw in the capital markets and FX and other fee areas. So could you just talk a little bit about what helped drive that?","John Woods","Yes, I would just mention that even though we've talked a lot about TOP 6, really TOP 5 from a more traditional standpoint has been kicking in as you get into the later part of the year. And we out with numbers that were smaller than the 125 that we're communicating today. So we've been able to upsize those benefits with respect to TOP 5.","And we tend to use those programs to fund investments we would like to make but also to maintain profitability and maintain our trajectory that we'd like to like to see in terms of going forward. ","Bruce Van Saun","As count came down, just below 18,000. So after 5 I think we've been up in the high and continue to look for efficiencies.","John Woods","Okay, got it. And then more broadly on expenses. If the operating environment does get tougher than you think, on the top line for next year whether it's rates or growth or what not. Can you just talk about your flexibility on the expense side?","John Woods","Yes. I'm going to say a few things on that. I would say we have a relatively big strategic agenda in 2020 that those are we consider them to be critical to maintaining our balance of focusing on the short term and the long term. And that's our outlook. That said, if something were to be missed if there were some stress that was starting to be introduced into the system, there's a significant amount of discretionary investments that we could moderate.","Bruce Van Saun","Slow down and pace something. ","John Woods","Yes, exactly. And so that's something that we keep an eye on and that's something that we're in detail focused on a month-to-month, quarter to quarter basis, what our investment capacity is, and that we would modify that capacity if things were to deteriorate.","John Pancari","Okay, got it. And then my last one is just on CECL. Can you just discuss a little bit if CECL and itself in the day two impact has influenced your willingness to or your appetite to grow in any of the consumer areas where you've been growing? Thanks. ","John Woods","Yes. I mean, I think it's not the number one issue. I mean I think we're trying to serve our customers, we're trying to invest in the markets that where we'd like to play. And we have a very diversified consumer and commercial lending platform, such that as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the way CECL impacts some portfolios, much worse than maybe some others tends to be mitigated through that diversification.","So a, we really focus on providing, that capability and it's something we will think about. I mean, it is an additional capital charge to some portfolios, and we'll just make it part of our balance sheet optimization activities going forward. ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I would say, John at the end of the day, it's the economic system that we're concerned about, and so we don't want to withdraw capital because of accounting issue. But having said that, where we will look at the new accounting framework and if there's tweaks that we need to make to certain product offerings that could end up with a better capital treatment we'll do that.","But I'd say fundamentally we're going to continue to follow the economics.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. Thanks Bruce, thanks, John.","Operator","And next we'll go to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Two questions. The first one, in the press release you had mentioned that you have several portfolio actions that are expected to boost NIM and ROTCE or that those are under consideration. Are those already included in your financial targets for 2020, or these are part of your TOP program or are these in addition to what you've already announced? ","Bruce Van Saun ","These Ken would be incremental. So, I'd say we're running hard with our balance sheet optimization and we're constantly trying to develop new ideas and approaches and say in an environment where it's hard to make huge progress in the near term on ROTCE for the industry. ","There are certain things we could do to reposition part of the balance sheet that could create some upward momentum there. So stay tuned on that. We're not making any promises that we want to socialize the idea that we're looking at some things. And obviously we try to do them in a capital efficient and capital neutral way. So that's kind of the trick of it.","Ken Zerbe","And would these be considered more sort of incremental, like maybe 10 basis points in ROTCE or something more material?","Bruce Van Saun ","Too early to tell. Too early to tell. I don't think it would be massive, but -- if they were doing, they should have some visible impact. But I'm not going to say there will be massive by any stretch.","Ken Zerbe","Understood. Okay. And then my second question, just in terms of your CET1 targets, obviously, it looks like your medium term targets match largely your 2020 targets. I mean is it fair to assume that once we get right into 2020 and certainly into 2021 the capital return becomes a much smaller piece of your overall sort of ROE or how you think about -- the capital return could be a lot lower than what it was in years past.","I mean, obviously I know you're doing a lot to bring that your CET1 ratio by 40-50 basis points per year. And it seems at this point it's going to be a function of your ROE rather than excess capital return. ","Bruce Van Saun ","Yeah. I would say, we're still looking to be friendly to shareholders in terms of our capital return, but increasingly, we're going to look to the organic growth and where we're allocating our capital to drive earnings performance. And so I do think more will come from the numerator and getting to that with the exception potentially of the OCI impact from a steeper curve.","But, we'll still love to I think prioritize organic growth and having a strong dividend payout ratio. And if we have capital after that will return it to shareholders. But I still think that can still be a pretty good payout ratio going forward. It just won't have the same kick and tailwind that it's had as we've been on the glide path for the last four or five years.","Ken Zerbe","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Bruce. Good morning, John. John, can you share with us -- you've had success growing your portfolio in the new markets that you pointed to earlier. Can you share with us what kind of industries that you're seeing this growth in the commercial loan book? And then second, what are some of the strategies you're using to win these new business? ","John Woods","So a couple things just to refresh people's memory. As we went into the new markets we articulated a strategy that we wanted to bank larger more financially flexible company. So it is not a middle market strategy. Because I'm very worried about smaller companies and adverse selection. So the credit underpinning is midsized companies.","The real driver of the growth is -- and I wouldn't say it's any one industry, it's pretty much across the board. But what we've done in each of the markets is hired people that have been long standing senior participants with clients in those markets. And they're bringing clients with them because of their relationships.","And as we interview and as we talk to the teams, we are very focused on who can actually individually move clients from bank to bank. And then if you think about disruptions that are going on in the industry per se, there's a lot of clients that are looking around for other banks to work with them.","So I'd say it's; one, who we are hire; two, it's the intensity with which we're covering these markets; and three, it's a broad based industry stat strategy, there's a fair amount of activity in the southeast, which is driving a lot of it because we're longer there in terms of presence on the ground. Texas is beginning to come in a little bit.","It's not an energy strategy, we have an energy team already we have for years. And California is very early days. And the other thing we've done is we've upgraded in the Midwest and brought a new head of the Midwest and because we haven't been satisfied with the progress we've made in those markets.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then circling back, Bruce, on capital or capital return I should say, obviously, you guys had a nice increase in the dividend today and looks like it's about $1.56 annualized now, which is about I guess, between 35% and 40% of 2020 earnings estimates.","Is that the long-term kind of dividend payout ratio, we should think about 35% to 40%. Would you consider similar to some of your peers that are now talking about 40% to 50% dividend payout ratios over the longer term? ","Bruce Van Saun","Look, I think it's important to have a good yield on a bank stock, and so I have a good dividend payout ratio. So, we've always aspired to do that, when we took the company public, and I think we're getting it up to around 40.","And for now, I think that's a good level to be at. We still have significant organic growth opportunities and we want to make sure we're balanced in terms of how much we pay out and how much we retain to support growth. So, that's where I would see it for now. ","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you.","Bruce Van Saun","Thank you. I think we have -- we're going out of this year, so maybe we have time Brad for one last question. ","Operator","Sure. Thank you and now come from Brian Clark [ph] with Keefe Bruyette. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. Thanks for, letting me squeeze in. I just have a follow-up on CECL. John, I guess when you think about 30% to 35% impact on a day one gross up to the ACL, what's the impact on the commercial that's embedded in that? So is there a decline in the commercial ACL? ","John Woods","Yes, I mean, broadly, we're not really going out line by line here. But sure, there's a there's a reasonably large decline on the commercial side. I think that's true for most portfolios you see out there, given the way we handle incurred loss, typically versus where CECL would articulated. And then that's offset by some of the portfolios that are maybe more longer duration on the consumer side.","Unidentified Analyst","So would it be similar to while you're saying that some of your other peers have broken out commercial versus consumer impact on day one, so we will be something similar to them?","John Woods","Yeah. I don't focus on that numbers. But I mean, I would say I think that shouldn't be come as a surprise that that's really CECL. When you think about lifetime losses, you have, if you have long duration loans, you're going to end up with a higher charge for the longer duration stuff on the consumer side and then less on the commercial side. ","And back to the balance. I mean, I think overall, we're not seeing a lot of big change in our outlook in 2020, in part because a lot of this stuff has been diversified across our broad lending base. And so, that's really I think one of the messages you could take away. ","Bruce Van Saun","And I think, Brian, if you look at the industry and what analysts expected based on composition of portfolios, and they had us kind of pegged in this range. I don't think there's any big surprises as the folks who have more consumer loans have a higher bump to the reserve and ones who have less obviously or lower. So, I think it's playing out probably the way most of the analysts and investors thought it would.","Unidentified Analyst","Appreciate the time guys, thanks. ","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Sure. Well, I'm going to thank everybody for dialling in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and continued support. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude the conference for today. Thanks for your participation with us in AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

My name is Brad, and I'll be your operator on today's call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen A. Taylor","Thanks so much, Brad, and hello everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on our call today. Our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and our Interim CFO, John Fawcett will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results and then we will open up the call for questions. We're also real proud to have here in the room with us today Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking.","I'd like to remind you all that in addition to today's press release we have also provided presentation and financial supplement and these materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. And we provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K we filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide important information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and in our earnings material.","And with that, I will hand it over to you Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Great. Thanks Ellen and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We are pleased to repeat another quarter of strong and improving results and a great finish to a year of significant progress and good execution. We continue to run the bank better every day, we are taking good care of our customers, and we enter 2017 with some nice momentum. ","The highlights of the quarter from my perspective was the continued delivery of good top line growth with 11% year-on-year revenue growth and robust positive operating leverage at 6% while for the full year revenue growth was 8% and the operating leverage was 4.2% on an adjusted basis. The commitment to positive operating leverage has powered improvement in our key metrics. Our ROTCE hit 8.4% in Q4 and our efficiency ratio improved to 62%. We continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives and we're making progress on our customer, colleague and community stakeholder objectives doing better for all of these key stakeholders. We also announced an increase in our Q1 dividend of 17% or $0.02 to $0.14 and we repurchased 180 million in common shares during Q4.","As we look at 2017 we expect our agenda to be largely consistent with 2016. We have a great playbook and we're going to continue to execute against that playbook. We're hopeful that the macroeconomic environment may deliver some tailwinds but we will stay focused on execution and what we can control.","I'm going to turn it over to John Fawcett, our interim CFO to review fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. I\u2019ll then come back to discuss the outlook for 2017. First I'd like to personally thank John for shelving his vacation plans to step back in and cover the CFO duties for a couple of months as we transition CFOs. It's very much appreciated by me and by your colleagues John and it's great to have you back with us during this period.","John Fawcett ","Thanks Bruce and good morning everyone. Since Bruce hit the highlights let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck with some color on our financial results. On slide 6 on a GAAP basis we generated net income available to common stock holders of $282 million and EPS of $0.55 per share which was up 31% year-over-year driven by strong revenue growth of $131 million or 11% year-over-year.","Our net interest margin increased 13 basis points while the efficiency ratio improved 3.5% from the fourth quarter of 2015 to 62%. On slide 7 we present the results on an adjusted basis. As a reminder third quarter results included $19 million of after-tax notable items that benefited our EPS by $0.04 in the third quarter. We grew EPS on an adjusted basis by 6% linked quarter and 31% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The strong focus on operating leverage delivered revenue growth of 11% year-over-year with expenses up just 5%. We improve the efficiency ratio by over 1% versus the prior quarter and 3.5% year-over-year.","Our results also reflect $180 million in share repurchases. On slide 10 and 11, you can see the continued benefit of our efforts to grow our balance sheet and expand our net interest margin. We grew average loans 2% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year reflecting growth across commercial and in mortgage unsecured retail and student on the consumer side. Net interest margin was up 6 basis points in the quarter and 13 basis points year-over-year reflecting improved loan yields partially offset by higher deposit costs.","We've got a nice job of improving our loan yields given our balance sheet optimization efforts, a loan with greater discipline on pricing. We also benefited from higher LIBOR during the quarter as the market anticipated the tightening by the Fed. On the funding side we held our cost flat to linked quarter despite a 1 basis point increase in deposit costs as we benefited from the runoff of paid fixed swaps. On a year-over-year basis deposit cost were up slightly and net borrowing costs relatively flat. We remain well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with asset sensitivity to a gradual rise in rates at 5.9% as of quarter end. ","Next on slide 12 we cover non-interest income which on an adjusted basis was up $9 million in the quarter. Service charges and fees were slightly up and mortgage banking fees were up $3 million reflecting improved mortgage servicing rights valuation, partially offset by lower sales gains. Security gains were $3 million tied to portfolio adjustments. FX and letter of credit fees improved $2 million largely reflecting increased customer hedging activity given U.S. dollar volatility. Capital markets fees were strong and in line with record 3Q 2016 levels given continued good loan syndication activity.","Let's take a closer look at expenses on slide 13. On an adjusted basis non-interest expense was up $16 million linked quarter reflecting higher vendor contract license and maintenance costs, outside services tied to consumer loan origination and servicing, and an increase in fraud legal and regulatory costs. Salaries and employee benefits expense remained stable on an adjusted basis as higher revenue based incentives were largely offset by a reduction in benefits.","Our headcount is down 75 year-over-year reflecting the impact of our efficiency initiatives which more than offset sales force and strategic hiring. We grew loans 8% annualized with nice performance in both consumer and commercial during the fourth quarter which you can see in more detail on pages 15 and 16. In consumer growth was led by continued expansion in residential mortgages, student and other unsecured retail loans which was driven by our partnership with Apple and our new personal unsecured product. We have recently announced a new partnership with Vivint, a major security alarm company and expect to announce another program soon. ","We continue to do a nice job of re-pointing our growth to higher return categories as the yields in consumer expanded 5 basis points in the quarter. We also saw a nice growth in commercial where we continued to execute well in mid-corporate and industry verticals and commercial real estate, which helped to offset the effect of $1.2 billion in loans and leases transferred to non-core. U.S. was up 11 basis points reflecting higher short-term LIBOR rates.","Next let's move over to slide 18 and cover credit. Overall credit quality continued to improve reflecting our focus on growing high quality, lower risk retail loans compared with growth in the larger company segment of our commercial book which tends to be higher credit quality. Our non-performing loan ratio improved to 97 basis points of loans from 105 driven by a reduction in consumer real estate secured. The net charge off rate increased to 39 basis points. Our commercial net charge offs decreased $3 million from last quarter while retail net charge offs increased $24 million driven by lower recoveries in home equity from relatively high third quarter levels.","We also saw a $7 million increase in the auto portfolio related to a one time methodology change. Provision for credit losses of $102 million increased $16 million driven by a $14 million reduction in recoveries of prior period charge offs from relatively high third quarter levels. As we continue to grow at a higher quality retail portfolios and one of our non-core portfolio our allowance to loans and leases ratio has moved down modestly to 1.15%.","On slide 19 you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital liquidity positions. This quarter as part of our 2016 CCAR Plan we have repurchased $180 million in stock at an average price of $28.71 and returned $241 million to shareholders including dividends. As Bruce mentioned we announced a 17% increase in the dividend. We ended the quarter with a common equity Tier One ratio of 11.2%. As a reminder our CCAR capital plan targets, the repurchase of up to $260 million dollars in shares throughout the first half of 2017.","On slide 20 we show our progress against our strategic initiatives. We believe it's important to assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. Importantly we continued to drive attractive loan growth across a number of areas. We have considerably made good progress over the past few quarters in mortgage ending the year with 538 loan officers ahead of our target. We fine tune our auto programs to enhance returns and we've seen really strong growth in our education refinance loan product which has attractive risk adjusted returns.","In wealth we've had some near term revenue headwinds as our sales mix is shifting towards more fee based business. But we have continued to add FCs and overall transaction volumes are up. Overall we are pleased with our results in commercial this year and we expect to continue to build on this strength. We launched our broker dealer this year which allows us to expand our capabilities and deepen relationships with existing customers. We've experienced strong growth in our mid corporate and industry verticals with particular success in healthcare and technology. We look for continued growth in our capital and global markets business given our strong loan syndication capabilities and enhanced interest rate product offerings.","Moving on to slide 21, the Top programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to sell fund investments to improve our platforms and product offerings. In 2016 our Top 2 program delivered $105 million in annual pretax benefits across our revenue and expense initiatives. Our Top 3 program launched in mid 2016 is on track to deliver $100 million to $115 million in 2017 benefits. We will keep working towards delivering greater benefits given our mindset of continuous improvement.","Slide 22 can be read at your leisure. Suffice it to say that we made good progress across consumer and commercial in terms of customer experience, market share, and product capabilities. On slide 23, you can see the steady progress we're making against our stated financial targets. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity of 8.43% improved 168 basis points year-over-year. Also our adjusted efficiency ratio improved 113 basis points linked quarter and 358 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and now stands at 62%. And EPS continues on a nice trajectory. ","And with that let me turn it back to Bruce, thanks. ","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks John. On slide 24 we identify the key to a successful 2017. Achieving good loan and deposit growth, expanding the NIM, progress on our fee businesses, strong expense discipline, and further capital normalization are key objectives very similar to 2016. ","On slide 25 we detail the ambitious guidance that we gave last January for 2016 on the left side of the page and on the right side we show what we actually achieved. The good news here is that notwithstanding an adverse interest rate and GDP backdrop, we hit just about all of our targets. Very proud of the 4.2% positive operating leverage which is near best in peer group. Only miss was on fee growth which is taking somewhat longer than expected but, we feel we are on the right track.","On slide 26 and 27 we detail our guidance for 2017. Quite similar you\u2019ll see to 2016 with good top line growth, 3% to 5% positive operating leverage target, further efficiency ratio improvement, and capital normalization. A few points of color, first slightly slower loan growth in commercial given higher rates which is offset by higher securities portfolio growth. So, overall earning asset growth about the same. Strong NIM improvement largely due to yield curve benefit that\u2019ll be slightly less self-help benefit then in 2016. The provision continues to gradually normalize largely due to reserve bill tied to loan growth. Credit quality is expected to remain very strong, and LDR is projected at 98%, CET1 ratio at 10.7 to 10.9 with solid growth in our dividends.","Slide 28 provides some additional color on the NIM. We expect continued good discipline on how and where we play in the loan book and in raising deposits cost effectively. The rate curve as of December 31st delivers a benefit of slightly over a 100 million to 2017 NIM assuming two hikes in 2017 and continued steepness in the yield curve. This obviously will move around on us. So we'll see how things will actually play out.","On slide 29 you can see the NII walk, top of the page is 2016 bottom of the page is the 2017 target. We expect slightly lower earning asset growth and slightly lower NIM expansion as deposit betas and borrowing costs rise but overall a very strong 8% to 9% growth outlook for 2017.","On slide 30, we show the same format for expenses. The story again is very consistent from 2016 to 2017. Underlying expense growth of around 5% which includes merit and inflation increases as well as business growth spend supporting our strategic initiatives. This is partially offset by top efficiency initiatives of almost 2% bringing the net expense growth to around 3% to 3.5%.","On slide 31, we provide our guidance for Q1 relative to Q4. This is typically a seasonally softer quarter for us given several factors including day count, seasonal activity levels, and the FICA taxes associated with incentive compensation. We also pay our preferred stock dividends in Q1 and Q3 of each year. That said we feel good about the year-on-year comparison relative to 2016.","So to sum up on slide 32 we feel that we've delivered strong results in Q4 and for the full year of 2016. We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2017 and we will look to drive even more top program benefits. We also feel our balance sheet and capital and our credit position remained rock solid. So there's also lots of good stuff in the appendix in the supplemental materials which you can review at your convenience. ","So with that operator Brad, we're ready to open up for some Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. ","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. ","Bruce Van Saun","Hi. ","Matt O'Connor","If I could just follow up on the loan growth, obviously you guys have had very strong loan growth and still solid outlook, a little bit less now than you've seen and you mentioned less commercial loan growth given higher rates. Maybe you can just elaborate on that and in the consumer side as we think about the drivers of growth there and maybe less drag from home equity, just walk us through what you think on the consumer side?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes sure, I'll start and then Don and Brad can chime in with some color. But I think we really hit the ball out of the park with loan growth this year and pleased with what we were able to accomplish on both sides on commercial and consumer. I think a fair amount of the activity that you've seen on the commercial side has been companies that are taking advantage of lower rates doing some refinancing, doing some recaps, taking out dividends and doing -- putting some leverage back into their companies. And you've seen commercial real estate very, very robust and so I think as rates move up a little bit you'll see a little less of that activity. Although I do think if you see that the growth come through that the market is expecting that hopefully is made up with loan demand that really is in support of a faster growing real economy. ","So we'll wait and see how that plays out. I think we're just marking it down a little bit. But having said that I think we have the same coverage force out there taking market share, winning on the battlefield with good ideas. So we'll continue to follow that playbook and then maybe we'll see some upside there. ","On the consumer side I think there's also some rates impact that we would anticipate particularly around the mortgage areas or mortgage refi product. Obviously the opportunities there will be somewhat limited. Our hope is that with the bigger sales force that we've assembled that we can certainly make up for some of that and that the purchase market will stay strong during the year. We should also see a little bit of a shift towards more conforming products which also could crimp the mortgage growth on the balance sheet a little bit. But I think that's probably the main impact of the higher rates on the consumer side. There might be a little impact on Ed refi market but I still think many of the borrowers who are refinancing will still see it worthwhile to do that. ","And then I think on a personal unsecured product generally people are coming off of very high cost revolving credit card debt into something quite a bit less from an interest rate standpoint. So I think that will be very modest if any impacts on that. So in general I think we will be looking to follow the playbook that we followed this year and should see very strong growth in the same areas that we saw this year. But we're being I think just appropriately a little cautious given the higher rates. I don't know guys, Don. ","Donald H. McCree","No, I think mark down is the right word. And we saw a little bit of deceleration on the commercial side as we got to the back end of the year for exactly the reasons that we have cited. We're hopeful if the economy starts to take off that that we will see good loan demand but we're just not seeing it in the pipelines yet. The other thing that\u2019s happening in some portions the portfolio is we're getting a little disintermediation as people hit the capital markets with the expectation that rates are going to go up. That's helping our fee lines a little bit so capturing\u2026 ","Bruce Van Saun","Pipelines for fees Don.","Donald H. McCree","Pipeline for fees, so we're seeing a toggle between NII and the fee line a little bit, I think you characterized it correctly. ","Brad L. Conner","Bruce, I think you cover it very well and the consumer side. The only thing I would add to it is we probably will see slowing growth in auto because we\u2019re intentionally taping the brakes on auto. So and we've talked about this in previous quarters which is the pressure continues to be there in terms of the margin returns on that business. So that the growth we\u2019re getting in the other asset classes in a little bit better risk adjusted returns were intentionally going back on the growth in auto. Okay.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, that\u2019s good color. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question will come from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning guys. Obviously a pretty good margin performance this quarter and the outlook with of course benefit from high rates just curious Bruce what are you guys thinking about deposit cost as we sort of lean into a higher rate environment, I guess, the only thing that might be a little different about you guys as you start with a higher loan to deposit ratio but I am just curious what your overall thoughts are -- what you're seeing and what you would anticipate going forward?","Bruce Van Saun","I\u2019ll start off and anybody here can chime in again but I think we have done a very good job of getting better at raising deposits costs effectively. And so one of the things that we -- as we were in the shrink mode in RBS is we've pretty much shooed away deposits on the commercial side and they were higher cost. And we I think on the consumer side had a fair amount of term and time which we had moved back out as well. So as we've kind of been growing the balance sheet, we've kind of I'd say growing our loan book at about 2X of our peers. We have to grow deposits 2X our peers given the relatively high LDR after the Chicago region sale. ","It's been really important that we get that muscle back in terms of going out to commercial with strategies to raise deposits, to have balance in the industries that we're banking so that we have the chance and the opportunity to get some cash rich companies to put deposits with us. And on the consumer side to actually get much better at segmenting the customer base and making very targeted offers to different segments of the base that are appealing and just being sharper and not just posting one rate that everybody benefits from and then your whole back book re-prices. ","So I think we've done we've made real strides in that regard. And so if you look at the overall borrowing costs this year. They're pretty flat deposit costs that inched up a little bit but you know I think on the other borrowing costs we did some retirement of higher costs sub debt and replaced it with senior debt in term FHLB borrowings. And so, I think we've done a pretty good job of managing the cost of borrowings overall. That game plan has to continue so, again if we're looking to grow loans at a good clip in 2017 we have to keep staying really sharp on the strategies, we have to grow those deposits cost effectively, and I think we can do that. So anyway, John, Don, Brad any color on that.","John Fawcett","I think in the short time I've been here and since the first time we did the road show with the public offering it's always been very clear that we're going to fund loan growth with customer deposits from the time that I have been back it's very obvious that there are dedicated programs and disciplines in place to make sure that continues to happen. I think it happened this year with 9% loan growth. That was a steep hill to climb and I think it was achieved in my sense is in the first quarter. We are doing just as well and deposit gathering is job won, so feels good.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect, I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay Scott.","Operator","And the next question will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. You mentioned earlier that there's slightly going to be a toggle between fee growth this year versus NII and I am wondering if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of your confidence in hitting that 3% to 5% non-interest income growth target for the year and sort of what line should we look forward to in terms of more contribution for this year?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. So I say one of the things you can look at there Erika is in the in the Q4 results. We were up 4% on a year-on-year basis. So I think as the year has gone on we see some very strong performance on the commercial side capital markets as we've grown the overall relationships of the bank. We have more swings with the bat and we have really good capabilities in capital markets particularly our loan syndications area. And we're adding additional capabilities over time. So that is broadening out things like the bond to economics that we can now get with our broker dealer in place. So I feel very good about that. ","I think our -- what we call global markets, the interest rate and FX risk management products, we've separated from RBS and we have put our own platform in place and it allows us to do a lot more frankly than we could when we had to back to back everything with RBS. So I think we're poised and positioned to continue growing there and we've been helped out a little bit by the environment with the volatility after Brexit and after the administration change in Washington. And hopefully I don't wish a lot of volatility on 2017 but I think we can anticipate some so that also feels pretty good. ","And also the cash management side we've got some great product capabilities, we keep working to strengthen our core capabilities but things around our card products and payables are all very strong and have nice growth associated with them. So I think we're doing very well on the commercial side. The challenge has been more on the consumer side and there I think the -- it's -- we are seeing some good momentum in mortgage and the hiring, I think gives us confidence that we can put up some good numbers again in 2017. ","Wealth we've had the hiring but we've had a mixed shift towards more fee based product sales which is great I think for the long-term but in the short-term it's replacing transaction oriented sales. And it hurts your revenues in the near-term. So we've had a little headwind on that. I think the lines cross at some point and again with the bigger sales force we should be able to see some growth in wealth next year. And I think just generally in service charges on deposit accounts we will continue to see some modest levels of growth if we keep that in the low single-digit range that helps because that is such a big category overall. So those are the areas that I would see and I think you can see a little bit of progress there on the Q4 year-over-year numbers.","Erika Najarian","Got it and my second question is speaking of volatility, if we do get some form of regulatory relief this year or next year, specifically as it relates to the definition of SIRI, a domestic SIRI in United States, how would you approach capital returns differently if at all and what is your view on the potential trajectory of regulatory related expenses over the next year or two?","John Fawcett","Sure, I think we have to wait and see how things play out. Our life pass down in terms of managing our capital position to peer levels has been I think well thought out and well telegraphed and so we've been coming down 40 or 50 basis points a year. We've pretty much been able to have our cake and eat it too, that we are funding very robust loan growth at almost 100% returns of capital to shareholders. And what we're trying to do obviously is get the ROTCE up to levels that are self-sustaining so we can do that in balance as opposed to meeting the draw down on that surplus capital account. I'm comfortable with that. I don't think that the being de-designated as a SIRI as the level goes up to 250. Obviously we will see what the peers are doing and whether they move down. We certainly are trying to move towards the peer so there might be some potential there. But I feel quite comfortable with the strategy that we've laid out and that we're executing against.","With respect to cost there could be potentially a little bit of a dividend there depending on whether you can do things I guess with a little less exactitude and the robustness that goes into the current requirements. I think a lot of the whole process is very worthwhile and we'll continue to do that. So I think there might be a small dividend but I wouldn't put it as something that really should move estimates to a material degree.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, couple of things. Tax rate, Bruce you\u2019ll give an outlook of 32% I know in Top 3 that\u2019s one that you're working on, given that does that 32% in corporate debt benefit and if so why no change from 2016 to 2017?","Bruce Van Saun","Well we're growing income as you can see so, this year we grew our net income around 20% and we have again some very robust if you look at the midrange of the guidance you have very robust net income growth again. And so if the statutory rate stays high where it is for 2017 which I think most people anticipate, some of the credit program investments that we're making, the low income housing, or the wind farms and things like that you're doing those things just to kind of keep the rates where it is with the growth in income. So we'll keep looking for opportunities. I think the big event on the horizon would be corporate tax reform because clearly if something gets done this year and it's effective in 2018 with our tax rate at 32%, we could have a real meaningful benefit overall to the bottom line and to EPS and the growth fee. So we'll keep our eye on that. We'll keep working on this but, anyway I think that's probably reasonable guidance given the strong net income performance that we anticipate.","Vivek Juneja","Different question, capital account, you obviously had a nice jump in 2016 CCAR. At what point can we start to think about accelerating that to over 100% capital return?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah well I think I just answered that in the last question. And we'll keep our eye on kind of where the peer group is going from an absolute level and where we think the requests of our couple banks that went over 100 in this last cycle but broadly speaking we like our derived path as we're still improving our growth fee in demonstrating that we are running the bank better and better. I think that gives us more confidence just to keep bringing it down but I think we\u2019ll take that under advisement and see what's happening with the peers.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, thanks, sorry I missed that one, just lots of earnings today. ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I got you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Burnell","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Bruce I just want to dive into a couple of the comments that you've already made. One is on slide 20 with sort of the where you stand relative to most of your efforts across the bank to drive better performance. I guess I'm just curious in terms of the commercial of the mid-market businesses that signaled as being not quite fully where you wanted to be. Given the position of the bank as being a mid market bank, what do you need to do to fully color in that slide I guess for lack of a better phrase in 2017?","Bruce Van Saun","I'm going to start and John obviously can offer his thoughts on this. But I think that what we've seen in the middle market is --- and really that just for definitional purposes that companies with revenues up to about 500 million. So call it 25 million to 500 million that those companies have not grown much over the over the past few years. They've been cautious, they haven't been quite the level of loan demand that we're seeing with bigger companies. We've had some very nice growth in what we call mid corporate which is companies from 500 million to 2.5 billion. And so I think one of the things that we're hopeful of is that and we're hearing this from these investors is that with the change in administration and focus more on growth that maybe the animal spirits kick in and we see more loan demand coming from that sector. ","I do think we've done a good job of strengthening the client relationships we have in middle market. We're seeing some modest growth in market share. We've closed the back door and so we -- I think we're doing a good job of keeping clients happy and in the house. And we're doing a good job of getting a bigger share of wallet and being able to offer some of our capital markets and risk management products. So there are some things that we like but there's also I think a backdrop that that part of the market hasn't been seeing robust growth. So, John why don\u2019t you take it from there. ","John Fawcett","Yes, so I think that's exactly right. It's been all about loan demand in the middle market and I think particularly the regulatory environment over the last several years has been very constraining in terms of mid market companies just engaging in any kind of expansion or M&A activity. We have had very strong fee growth and very strong deposit growth in our middle market business. And I think as Bruce said, as we turn into 2017 we begin to get some expansion in the economy. The early indicators coming out of the management teams and the Boards of the middle market companies is much more bullish in terms of where they want to take their businesses. One of the results of the slack on demand in the middle market has been incredible in terms of competition and very, very, very tough pricing environment. ","So we've been disciplined in terms of where we do want to play and we've seen a little bit of a downward calibration of loan growth because of that. The other thing we're doing and I think people may have seen it is we've hired a team down in the Southeast to expand our business. Geographically it will be aimed slightly higher than the middle market at the outset because we're focused on credit quality as we move into a new region. But we are anticipating significant client account growth as we go into 2017 and the years beyond. So we are more optimistic than we were this time last year in terms of the environment that we are operating in and we are confident that our products and services are resonating well with our clients. ","Matthew Burnell","Okay, and then for the second question I am just curious, you mentioned the higher rates potentially affecting demand on the commercial side for loan growth, looking on the consumer side presumably the consumer would be a little bit less affected by a 25 or 50 basis point increase in rates over the next year or so. But at what level of rates do you think consumers might begin to rethink the incremental dollar of debt that they put on to their balance sheet are we ways away from that or perhaps not so much?","Brad L. Conner","This is Brad. I think that really depends on the asset class is the answer. I think you're close to that point in mortgage because there's been a lot of momentum taken out of the mortgage refi market over the last year or so. So you are probably close to that point in mortgage. I think there's quite a bit of runway left on the education refi loan now. Certainly there will tranches to that. Most of what we refinanced in education loans were refi people out of fixed rate loans. So you kind of look at tranche over that but there's an enormous untapped market. So I think we're still quite a ways away from taking a significant piece of the market away. But those are really the two areas with mortgage refinance and student refinance where we see we might see some dampening as rates rise. ","Bruce Van Saun","And I would also add to that, that in terms of credit card debt, I would say that is more a function of how people -- what people's outlook is than actually sensitivity to the interest rates there. So if in fact people feel that we have a little bit higher growth rate to look forward to for the next couple of years, that unemployment is at low levels and will continue to fall then I think the confidence of individuals to go out and buy things and sometimes finance on revolving debt is higher notwithstanding if the overall cost of debt is moving around. ","Brad L. Conner","I completely agree with Bruce and by the way I would say that same thing holds true in the small business space. So we have seen very limited demand for small business loans over the last year mainly from a confidence perspective and if that comes back they are probably less sensitive to interest rate and we might see some loan demand that comes from this improved confidence. ","Matthew Burnell","Thanks for the color.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari","Good morning","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","John Pancari","I am sorry if I missed the comment on this at all earlier in the call but when it comes to the tax reform that could be coming under the Trump regime can you just give us your thoughts on how much you think could ultimately accrete to the bottom line at Citizens whether it be through any tax benefit or tax advantage investments that go away or if you're going to spend any of that potential benefit? Thanks. ","Bruce Van Saun","I think most of it falls through actually John, we're operating with the Federal rate of 35 and if you got to something like 25 or 20 that would be a meaningful benefit to I think the whole regional banking group since we're all hovered around maybe 28 to 32 as our tax rate. There's little global allocation of resources that we have going on. So what we're left with is really investing in Federal tax credit programs or State tax planning and it really doesn't move the needle down that far from the Federal rates. So the big benefit is to get that Federal rate lower and I don't think the Federal credit programs since they're generally seen to promote investing in something's that are socially good such as alternative energy or low income housing. I'm not sure they're going to be negatively impacted but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out.","John Pancari","Okay, got it, thanks Bruce and related to that though, I feel like a broken record asking this on lot of these calls but it's important to get your take. Do you think that in that benefit that you do expect to accrete to the bottom line ends up getting competed away by the industry at all?","Bruce Van Saun","I don't know I mean John I\u2019ll ask your view on this but I have seen some folks say that if you went into a credit relationship for example with a corporate you would try to get an after tax rate of return. If the tax rate goes down then you can offer the credit at lower spreads. I don't think that's the way the world works because I think the credit right now is offered very thin in terms of returns and the only way you can justify extending the credit is by having an overall broader relationship where you\u2019re getting a cash management or you're getting to participate in their capital market needs or other needs. And so I think the industry would hopefully hold their discipline there and say gosh, this is good. We're going to see an overall improvement on the return on these relationships. John?","John Fawcett","I think that's exactly right and as we compete on the credit side every day we're competing in the public market the non-bank and other banks and as Bruce said I think pricing is very thin in terms of where margins hit today. So I don't think you\u2019re going to see any kind of tax effective change in the returns we generated.","John Pancari","Got it, thank you. If I could just ask one more I know you commented on your deposit pricing and your efforts around that, can you just remind us what has been the data that you've seen so far from the recent Fed hike and then your expectation how that could play out if we see incremental hikes this year?","Bruce Van Saun","And we've had extremely low betas which you would expect early on with particularly the December 15th hike. They were close to zero. I think hike that just occurred is probably maybe 15% to 20%. It is probably a little lower on the consumer side and a little more than that on the commercial side but kind of blending out to those levels. And I think you'll see a very gradual retracement up towards a beta that kind of overall is probably 55% to 60% as you go back to a normalized natural rate. But I think you'll still see if there's a June hike beta that maybe 30 or 35 or something like that and just kind of inching your way back towards that kind of through the rate hike cycle overall level.","John Pancari","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zerbe","Hey, thanks, good morning. You guys had actually some pretty good growth in commercial real estate just wondered, are you able to tell that you're actually seeing a benefit from some of the increased regulatory scrutiny on some of the smaller weaker SIRI lenders I mean is that a factor in driving your SIRI growth or is it just not really relevant for you?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I don't think that's palpable and I'll let Don throw some color here. But I think as I said before when we were owned by RBS we really stopped doing new lending and started to run our book down. And then as we embarked on our journey to independence we said boy, we're way underweight where peers are in commercial real estate and we turned the shop closed sign to shop open. We turned it around and went back to many of our long standing relationships and said hey, we're playing again and we want to develop the relationship and we're here to stay. And so a lot of this growth that we've experienced has been on the back of both strong growth in the market but then also regaining some of that lost market share. ","So I say that's really why we've been able to come in kind of mid to high teens for two years in a row. When I look out the next year I think we will probably be closer to 10% at those levels but we still think that there's interesting projects to do. The money might be a little more circumspect with the higher rates but we still see good fundamental demand and we've rebuilt those relationships with developers and added some new ones to boot. So Don you\u2026 ","Donald H. McCree","Like I said the only thing I will add to it is we have hired some key people which we've been able to build the franchise again. I think and the other thing I'd say is we have maintained a really high level of discipline about what we would do in terms of pricing structures. So we've actually seen returns in the real estate business creep up as we've grown. So we've been very disciplined in terms of what we've been targeting. And I would say that the only thing with the margin in terms of competitive environment we stay pretty consistent through the year and we grew our book pretty straight line through the year. We saw some people kind of pull away a little bit from the market as they filled up their real estate baskets towards the end of the year. So we might have benefited slightly at the margin at the end of the year. But as Bruce said it's really about reinvigorating the franchise, doing some key hires, and then being consistent in the marketplace.","Kenneth Zerbe","Alright, perfect, thank you very much.","Operator","And the next question will come from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffrey. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Good morning, you guys mentioned that you had a couple rate hikes in your outlook for NIM going forward but you also made a mention that you assume the continued steepness of the yield curve, are your assuming that the yield curve stays where it is or it continues to steepen from current levels?","Bruce Van Saun","Well if you look at the guidance page that we showed, we showed that kind of ten year in a 250 to 275 range. So, I think there would likely be a parallel shift if we have a mid-year hike. But it could just be kind of stay where it is. But that's kind of NIM here. We break out on one of the slides what the impact is of having the curve move up so that the ten years in a 240 to 250 range and we would anticipate that it's likely to stay there and then potentially drift up. So we didn't see that happen in 2016. We actually saw, ten year plummet all the way down to 150 to 160 which created some real headwinds. But at this point with the ten years where it is and the curve where it is, one of the nice things we have going on is that as mortgage cash flow comes in off the securities portfolio we're putting it back out at rates that are either neutral or slightly accretive to what's coming off the books. And so that's a real help. So, that is baked into our forecast and let's hope that that's what we see. ","Kevin Barker","And then also on the auto portfolio I understand net charge offs were up roughly 27 basis points on a year-over-year basis and you mentioned about 70 basis points was normalized last quarter. Do you have a new view on a normalized level given the changes in your methodology on assessing auto credit?","Bruce Van Saun","You are talking about the new charge off rate. Charge off rate yes, should be in the low 50's would be our expectation. I don't -- I think we had this one time change in terms of how we were accounting for the repossessions which is now behind us and I think we are anticipating stability in the auto charge off rate going forward. ","Ellen A. Taylor","Yeah, Kevin I will just add, if you look at our NPLs as a forward indicator of sort of charge off levels going forward, we think they're at normalized level this quarter. ","Kevin Barker","So absent the methodology change where would the charge off level come in? ","Ellen A. Taylor","In auto that would have been roughly -- to our total charge. ","Bruce Van Saun","Are you talking auto Kevin\u2026","Kevin Barker","In auto portfolio in particular. ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes auto, yeah I think to this quarter it would have been in the neighborhood of 10 to 12 basis points for auto.","Kevin Barker","Okay.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Eads with UBS.","David Eads","Hi, good morning. I think you talked about expanding some of these consumer lending programs, the dividends and I think you're going to announce another one obviously the other one seems to be going pretty well. Can you just give a little more color on kind of the trajectory for that, whether it continues growing at where some of the levels where it is growing now and how large you kind of like that portfolio to total kind of secured consumer portfolio to get?","Bruce Van Saun","I\u2019ll start and pass to Brad but I think we've had a two pronged strategy here. So one is the partnership model where we're aligning ourselves with partners and helping them offer the installment credit to their customers. So Apple driven are two of the examples of that and had very nice growth with the Apple balances and I think they're -- they feel that we're doing a good job in terms of the customer experience. So that's been a great relationship and we've kind of wedded the whistle here and said there's another one coming soon. So you will just pay attention but we have another one in the works, but that's one factor. ","The other factor has been on just the personal unsecured direct product that we're offering through the branches and direct mail largely to the footprint and it's targeting folks who have high revolving debt balances who can have a debt consolidation opportunity into a personal unsecured loan that offers a more attractive interest rate. And we've seen really good take up on that and I think again there we\u2019re being very selective, one of the things that's consistent across these programs is a very strong credit discipline trying to keep the FICA scores well ahead of 750.","And so I think the risk adjusted returns look pretty good for both sides of the equation. But they're still running room so I think you'll see similar growth to what we've seen this year again next year. We're not bumping up against any limits. One of the things that we have that we wish we didn't have is a relatively smallish credit card portfolio. So when you look at that straight unsecured this is another way to play that game and to get in that game and do it in a way that is more accretive more quickly than if we were trying to build up the card book. So Brad\u2026 ","Brad L. Conner","Bruce I think you covered it extremely well. I think we would expect new growth rates to be somewhere in the range of what we've seen in the last few quarters. The organic demand for the Apple like programs continues to be there when I say organic we have retailers coming to us wanting to talk about the program. We do expect to add another program very soon and I would say there's a pipeline building of people that are interested. So the opportunity is there, we're being incredibly disciplined to just monitor the overall credit results. So far they look great. It is a very high prime customer base that we're dealing with so continued good opportunity.","David Eads","Alright, great Then maybe one quick follow up, on deposit beta, looking at the NII outlooks supplied on slide 29 where you have your loan yield and then a higher deposit cost is about half of that, is that implying that you have kind of baked in something like a 50% deposit beta in the NII outlooks slide and could that be conservative or how do those dynamics play out?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I think that there could be some conservatism built into that. I think it's not just the deposit beta there is also the fact that we're growing the loan and deposit base 2X versus client. So it's hard to kind of discern is it just from the yield curve impact versus the fact that we are growing deposits a bit faster than peers. But I think that's what's in that and the good news there is that the NIM should still expand in a fairly robust fashion","David Eads","Thanks for the color. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks, good morning. Hey, Bruce with the really good progress you're now you're making on ROE and your medium term goal of 10%. Given your expectation for rate hikes to happen just wondering if you could give us any color in terms of do you have a line of sight now on when you think 10% is doable now that we're kind of getting in ear shot of it?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I've been fairly consistent that I'm not -- I don't want to get pinned on this because there's been a lot of anticipation of rate hikes or yield curve movement that hasn't happened. But I guess just as background if you look at the trajectory we are on, we've added about 4% over three years to the ROTCE with very little of any rate benefit. And year-on-year the ROTCE was up to eight four in the fourth quarter and that's up 1.7% from where it was in the fourth quarter of 2015. And we've had really no rate hike benefit in that. So it's clearly possible that we're in striking distance of the 10% ROTCE if we continue to execute well and we get some hikes that help provide a little bit of tailwind. But again I'm not going to put a line in the sand and chase it. I just think if we keep doing what we're doing, we keep executing well the ROTCE is moving in the right direction and we'll get there hopefully reasonably soon.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, and then second question just on credit which just continues to be really good and I know I heard the comments about expecting some normalization but where at all would you even see normalization. It seems like you could still have it done with the way that the underlying trends are going where would you even expect any changes to be happening underneath on the credit side? ","Bruce Van Saun","I would, the normalization to me is probably more in the provision line than it is in charge offs. So we saw a little bit of movement in the commercial side this year from basically nothing to maybe 10 basis points that cannot move into a 10 to 15 basis point level in 2017 sure. But I still think it's -- we don't see any big migrations or anything but you've been living on the good side of life for a long time so you should expect I think a little move higher. On the consumer side we've basically had less good assets from a credit quality standpoint like our non-core and service by others running off. And we are replacing it with really high prime and super prime Ed refi and some of this unsecured which I think is helping to also improve the overall credit quality on the consumer side. ","But we had at those kind of clean ups have occurred and those run down have occurred, we've benefited from that in terms of having offset to the normal provision bill that you would expect as you're growing the loan book the way we are growing the loan books. So when we give our outlook for next year I think there might be a little bit of that -- less of that back book clean up effect that means that you could see more of a reserve build. But I really don't see tremendous movement at all in the charge off rates.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, thanks a lot. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of I have Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. ","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. On the partnerships that adding Apple being one but I know there are a few offers, what are you watching there to make sure that you don't run into credit issues down the line, what are the kind of early indicators that you can focus on to make sure if you do one of those partnerships and it doesn't work out, you pay it back pretty quickly?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I think the answer to that is the traditional credit measures metrics, right. So, the first is through the door of credit quality so we were at that income ratio, the FICO score through the credit metrics which look extraordinary and then we are incredibly diligent around looking at the early loss emergence curves. So, what these early stage delinquencies look like if any we have the early loss emergence curves look like, we can get a feel for the loss emergence current versus what we priced for then in three to four months of the origination and I would say we just feel very good about that up until this point in time. We've got over a year under our belt now with the Apple program. So we are starting to get a really good feel for how these things, how these things mature and develop over time and they are relatively short term assets. So you get a pretty good feel really on. ","John Fawcett","Yeah and I would just add some color that it seems hard that you can achieve this. But we're achieving it. It's almost what I would refer to as the hat trick for two years. But we are you know focused on improving our asset yields, improving the risk adjusted returns on these portfolios, and actually seeing if our stress losses picture can improve and we've actually achieved that. And it's partly because we've run off some of the higher risk stuff and we\u2019re replacing it with better quality stuff. And so that\u2019s been really impactful on the consumer side to be able to achieve that.","Brad L. Conner","Just one more thing to add to Bruce our standard model calls for risks sharing with our partner as well so there's a vested interest in our partner in and through the quality which is a big factor in these programs. ","Geoffrey Elliott","And just to follow up on that, there is only one Apple and there are lots of banks out there. So when you're competing for this sort of partnership, what is it that sets you apart, there must be something that you are doing different or better or pitching better that means they want to partner with you rather than somebody else so...?","Bruce Van Saun","On the -- I think this sounds very basic but I know it\u2019s true which is being able to provide extraordinary customer experience. Apple in particular of all the partners that we are working with and expecting this to be a value add program and expect us to be able to provide a customer service level that's consistent with the brand and that their own expectation and I think we've been able to do that. We are getting very good feedback from our partners that we are doing that well and I think that's the key. And obviously understanding the credit risk as well. ","John Fawcett","I think it how we do business, how we look to partner in line with the customer objectives has been good. And I think we\u2019re of the size that we can -- these are very big important relations to us and so we put a lot into making sure that we're doing a good job.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.

Also joining us on this call today is Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Banking.","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that in addition to today\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve also provided a presentation and financial supplement. And these materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. I need to remind you that during the call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplements.","Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, may also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","And with that I\u2019ll hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Well, thanks, Ellen. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by offering a tip of the cap to John Fawcett who retires at the end of the month after serving us well for many years. And I welcome to Eric Aboaf, our new CFO who joined us for his first earnings call after being here for two and half weeks. Good news is Eric is quick study and I don't think will miss a beat.","Turning to the quarter, we are off to a good start. I'd highlight the following. So we had solid financial results. We had a successful CCAR submission. We've recruited some terrific top team members. Eric is CFO and Don McCree, formerly of JPMorgan as our new Head of Commercial. We supported the successful follow on offering of RBS own stock, RBS' ownership is now down to 40.8%. And we are navigating through the challenges posed by the environment, and we are executing well against our strategic turnaround initiatives. So all in all as I said a good start. ","While we have a ways to go on a number of fronts to get the bank operating better, I am pleased overall with the steady and consistent progress that we are making. Our people are working hard, they are taking good care of our customers and they are executing well on our plans. I'll let Eric cover the financials in detail but I would offer first a few high level comments. ","First off, we are pleased that we delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. This is the key to delivering improved results and we are committed to that. We are doing a good job of intelligently growing our balance sheet, though in a sustained low rate environment, it has been a challenge to keep our NIM broadly flat. In order to do that, we are very focused on adjusting our business mix and risk appetite modestly over time to raise our asset yields. In the first quarter, we saw a strong loan growth in commercial, in prime auto, in mortgages and in student lending particularly with our new refi product. ","We expect favorable trends here to continue over the course of the year. We've continued to benefit from favorable credit costs; we are doing a good job of shifting expenses to more productive uses, keeping overall levels broadly flat. Our investments in getting our fee based businesses to scale are advancing steadily. That said the benefits from these initiatives will play out gradually over time. ","Mortgage and cash management made good progress in the first quarter, while wealth had a little bit of tougher time. Lastly, I'd highlight that our balance sheet remains strong. We completed a $250 million buyback early in the second quarter and we have the capital and funding strategies in place to continue to grow loans at a good clip.","With that let me turn it over to Eric.","Eric Aboaf ","Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. I am excited to join Bruce and Citizens' team to help deliver on the strategy and plan that have been laid out over the last few months. Citizens is fortunate to operate in attractive and growing markets, where it can play an important role in serving both consumer and commercial client. Of course execution is what really matters in banking. And my focus will be to help drive the business initiatives that will help accomplish our goals. ","Throughout my remarks, I'll refer to the slides in our investor presentation that you can find on our website. To begin let me take you through our first quarter financial on Page 3, which demonstrate a solid start to 2015. Our first quarter GAAP net income of $209 million was up $12 million, or 6% from the fourth quarter. And up $43 million, or $26% from the first quarter of 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $0.38, up $0.02 from the fourth quarter and $0.08 higher than first quarter of 2014. This was driven by our effort to drive revenue growth while actively managing expenses as well as by the continued favorable credit environment.","Page 4 summarizes restructuring and other special items for this quarter associated with productivity initiatives that we launched as well as the separation cost from RBS. We recorded $10 million pretax charges this quarter. And while this came in lower than we originally expected. That really just reflects a bit of shift in timing out of the first quarter and into the second quarter. We still expect the same level of restructuring expense for the first half at $45 million to $50 million in total. ","I'll focus the rest of my comments this morning on the adjusted results, which exclude the impact of these items. Turning to Page 5, we posted strong operating results with net income of $215 million and EPS of $0.39, both of which were stable link quarter and up 30% from the previous year. I am going to cover number of items highlighted on this slide throughout my presentation. But let me mention three important themes. First, revenue was relatively stable linked quarter in-spite of the expected seasonal weakness. And they were up year-over-year as we more than replaced the foregone revenues from the Chicago branch sold last year. Second, expenses were flattish demonstrating the company's discipline as we drove efficiency saving while also reinvesting in a business. And third, credit was benign and was further benefited by a large recovery this quarter. ","We continue to make strives towards our goal with 10% return on tangible common equity as we generated a strong return on an adjusted basis of 6.7%, which was up nicely from the prior year. On Slide 6, we dive a little deeper into the results for the quarter. On a headline basis, we grew net interest income $28 million, or 3% over the prior year. But that was muted by the Chicago divesture which impacted NII by $30 million. So an underlying basis we grew NII by 5% which was driven by attractive earnings asset growth with improving mix and our continued efforts to defend the margin despite the impact on a low rate environment on our asset sensitive balance sheet. ","Over the course of the year we also grew earnings asset by 8%, or nearly $9 billion driven by strong performance in both consumer and commercial as we continue to better leverage our capital position and reenergize organic growth. Compared to the fourth quarter, net interest income was down as the impact of two fewer days and slightly higher funding cost was partially offset by continued loan growth and reduction in paid fixed swap cost. ","Our net interest margin this quarter held up relatively well particularly given the decrease in rate from year end. We saw a three basis point debt to 2.77% in comparison to the fourth quarter on a reported basis. As John Fawcett mentioned on last quarter's call, the fourth quarter margin include a two basis points of non-recurring items. We held loan yields flat on a linked quarter basis through a combination of pricing and mix which I will describe in more detail later. We've defended the margin recently well given the rates are below where we had expected them to be. In our outlook statement, we indicate that this defending the NIM objective will continue until we see rates rise hopefully soon.","We did see a full quarter impact to prior borrowing cost so we continue to diverse by our funding base across multiple deposit category than client segment and added a full quarter of senior debt cost given that our issuance came in late in December. We continue to maintain a highly asset sensitive interest rate position, the impact of an actual rise in rate is consistent in the last quarter at approximately 7% in the first year. This is driven primarily by the short end of the curve. During the quarter, we modestly extended the duration on the securities portfolio as we sold 15 year agency pass through to purchase 20 year agency similar to our late third quarter transaction. Even with this trade, the average duration of the securities portfolio fell to 3.1 year at the end of March, down from 3.5 years at year end given the prepayment impact of the drop in long rates. This duration expansion trade resulted in a modest gain of $8 million. ","On Slide 7, we will cover noninterest income which is an important area of focus for us as we are determined to shift our revenue profile over time. We generated $8 million increase linked quarter in noninterest income which was driven by gains related to the sales conforming mortgages and the previously mentioned repositioning of our securities portfolio, which offset the seasonally lower results and other service charges and fee categories. ","Year-over-year noninterest income decreased $11 million from the first quarter of 2014. So this reflected the drag from the Chicago divesture of $12 million in fee income. We also posted a $17 million reduction in securities gain, so on an underlying basis we generated noninterest income growth of approximately 5%, with particular momentum in mortgage banking service charges and capital market. ","Let me take you through each of the fee areas and describe what we are seeing on a year-over-year basis and how our initiatives are gaining some traction. The largest area is service charges where we are seeing approximately 2% year-over-year increase in charges and fees once we have done for the Chicago sale as our new checking product helps drive increase account and household growth. Card fees were relatively stable after accounting for Chicago but we are in the midst of some new card launches that we expect to help drive usage through a more attractive rewards program. Trust and investment services fees was somewhat muted but we continue to grow license bankers and add to our wealth advisors as part of our initiatives. On the mortgage banking front we generated $33 million revenue this quarter including a $10 million gain on sales of conforming mortgage which were previously held in portfolio. Outside of the gain, we were pleased with our mortgage results. We generated nearly 60% underlying increase in our mortgage banking revenue from first quarter of last year as origination volumes were up 87%. We also continue to gain market share. ","In capital markets, our continued efforts to build out the platform and enhance our loan syndication efforts are paying dividend as we grew fees in this category by 22%. And similarly FX and interest rate products which are often tied to new loans and loans syndications were 5% year-over-year. ","Moving on to noninterest expense on Slide 8. We are intensely focused on driving continued improvement in the efficiency of franchise. Our goal is to generate strong operating leverage by actively managing our expense base while continuing to invest across the franchise to enhance both our distribution and product capabilities, as well as fund our important regulatory work. Our adjusted operating expenses of $800 million this quarter reflected seasonally higher payroll taxes and increased incentive expense which drove salary and employee benefits up from the fourth quarter. We also saw a decline in outside services which were down from elevated fourth quarter level and included benefit from our efficiency initiatives. Year-over-year, adjusted expense was down slightly due to the $21 million Chicago impact, a variety of other expense initiatives that impacted multiple areas, occupancy, equipment, outside services and so forth, offset by active investment in a number of revenue focused initiatives. ","So net-net on a year-over-year basis we kept our operating expenses flat despite increased investments to grow our sales force and invest in products and technology. We achieve an adjusted efficiency ratio of 68% which was relatively stable with first quarter of 2014, but improved from the same period last year. Obviously, this will continue to be an area of focus for us. ","Now turning to the consolidated average balance sheet on Slide 9. Our total earnings assets of $121.3 billion were up 2% from last quarter and 8% from the first quarter of 2014, driven by the benefit of our growth initiatives. In consumer, we generated strong growth in auto, mortgage and student over the prior year. Commercial growth has been broad based with virtually all of our businesses posting solid growth. And the profit continues to grow with average deposits in the first quarter increasing by $800 million, or 1% over the fourth quarter. Over the last year organic deposit growth was worth approximately $9.3 billion or 11%, more than offsetting the impact of the Chicago divesture which was worth $5.2 billion. As one of my first areas of focus as CFO, I plan to dig into loan, deposits and the NIM equation. On first look, we are managing this well but I want to say we can do even better. ","On Page 10, compared to the previous quarter, consumer banking loan increased nearly $900 million, or 2% as we continue to ramp our own organic origination in auto, mortgage and student. The growth in mortgage is net of the conforming portfolio sale which I mentioned earlier. We also continue to focus on improving the underlying mix of the consumer portfolio in order to boost yields and offset the impact of low rate. ","This quarter we continued to be satisfied with the good growth in our auto business as we've been able to drive both balance and yield upward in our organic book. As a result, we've decided to target SCUSA volume at about $1.5 billion for 2015. We believe that strong demand for our student loan refinance product and our own auto origination will offset the lower purchases. We also made a tuck-in student loan portfolio acquisition in Q1 for the effective yield and return characteristic. ","On Slide 11, commercial loan increased by $1.3 billion, or 3% sequentially on strength in industry vertical, middle market, mid corporate and commercial real estate not withstanding continued aggressive competition. Yield cut down a few bits and is obviously an area where we are trying to balance pricing fees and returns. Slide 12 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding cost. We grew the combination of checking, savings and money market balances which comprise the bottom two categories by approximately 10% this year or $5.5 billion despite the impact of the Chicago divesture. We supplemented this growth with some term deposits as well as a mix of FHLB and senior debt to further diversify our funding sources. ","On Slide 13, you can see that our credit quality continues to be strong with net charge-off at $4 million. Our provision expense came in lower this quarter at $58 million. This includes $15 million recovery from a single large commercial real estate credit. But even outside that we continue to see relatively lower levels of gross charge-offs across rest of the book despite continued loan growth. We also continue to benefit from the run-off in the non-core book. This was down nearly$200 million in the quarter to a balance of $1.9 billion. ","Turning to Slide 14, our capital position remains robust. This quarter we began reporting on our Basel III basis this part of the new regulatory capital rules for bank our size with the CET1 ratio of 12.2% which is well above our regional peers. We are above our LCR requirement and our LDR have been relatively consistent. Post the quarter end in early April, we executed a $250 million preferred issuance and repurchase shares from RBS which on a pro forma basis would impact our CET1 ratio by 23 bip.","On Slide 15, we summarize many of our accomplishments and reemphasize our objective of becoming a top performing regional bank. On Slide 16, we played out the key initiatives in our turnaround plan and have progressed during the quarter. And what the outlook holds for the remainder of 2015. We feel the program remains broadly on track. Heightened watch areas continued to be the initiatives where we are hiring in significant numbers or growing market share. We will continue to monitor and report on this for you and we can obviously discuss the more in detail during the Q&A. ","On Page 17, we summarize some of our key financial target and our progress year-over-year. Our end 2016 target are predicated on a rising rate. That said we continue to develop additional revenue and expense initiatives to help offset any lag that may occur. We may have more color on this by next quarter's call. ","Now turning to Slide 20, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter. But all in the context for the full year outlook that we previously provided. We expect to have linked quarter loan growth that is consistent with the prior two quarters. So 1.5% to 2% with a net interest margin that remains relatively stable from this quarter, so we expect to see continued pressure from low rate, visible needs to defend against. We would expect to generate positive operating leverage of a seasonally weak first quarter thereby improving our efficiency ratio. We expect credit to continue to be strong overall but don't expect to see the same level of commercial recovery that we saw this quarter. So provision expense should return to prior quarter level which is roughly a quarter of low end of our annual guidance range. ","We are nearing completion of our restructuring and separation activities. So in the second quarter we plan to record $35 million to $40 million in restructuring expense as we do things like rebrand the charter one franchise. And finally we expect that our CET1 ratio will remain relatively unchanged on a pro forma level of around 12% and we will hold the LDR at around 98% to 99%.","So with that let me turn it back over to Bruce. ","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Thank you, Eric. So in short a solid start to the year. With that Brad, why don't we open it up for some Q&A? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question on line will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Hi, thank you. I guess first question just in terms of student lending. We've seen a number of banks exit this business due to various reasons. And I know you guys are aggressively pushing into student lending. What is the difference? What makes you guys comfortable with the quality of student lending versus presumably the reason why people, other banks are trying to get out of the business. Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","Well, maybe I'll start and then Brad you can amplify my comments. But fundamentally you have to understand the difference in the private market and overall government backed market. And so a lot of the noise about whether this is a poorly underwritten credit really relates to the government side. The private side has been I think had good risk adjusted return characteristics. For some of the big players people like Chase it just may not be a big enough pond to play in since the government has 93% of the market and the private side only had 7%. For someone like our self the fact that some of the big folks are exiting creates more running room for us. I think we have very good technology. We have a good footprint with good university system in our footprint. We've been very innovative in terms of designing products that really work for customers and benefit customers. Our Ad refi loan is the latest example of that where a student borrower can refinance both government and private loan kind of unique product offering out there in the market place which is taking the market by storm. So when we look at the credit quality, the yield we get related to the risk we are taking, we like it a lot. It also potentially brings in fresh customers to us here demographic is aging that if you can get someone who has now a job and has a good credit score and can consolidate their debt and save themselves money on average our loan save about $150 a month. So the people who refinance that person can grow with us and bring over their checking accounts and as they go through their life phases, they can borrow money on a mortgage and accumulate assets and we can manage their wealth as it grow. So all-in-all we think it fits our strategy quite well. Why don't I turn it over to Brad? ","Brad Conner","Yes. Bruce, I think you said it extremely well. And the only thing I would probably add is there is -- we've seen a big untapped need in the market place. So you talked about it I think our refinance product really hits the need in the market place as a lot of other folks have exited. That need was out there and we don't really think like a traditional student loan product. These are borrowers who are out of school. They are in their early 30s. The profile of the customer that we are getting in sort of the 785 FICO score, someone in their early 30. They have established themselves so they are really great customer for the bank. And just very few people playing in the space, very attractive customers, and very attractive returns. So just a good market place opportunity.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Now that's great and helpful. Second question just on expenses. Looks like very well controlled expenses versus our expectations. When we look at $800 million extra restructuring, is that -- because presumably I am trying to think how sustainable that Bruce because presumably you are going to have less on the salary side just going for -- seasonality, but do you expect to rebound some of the other line items or is $800 million minus the seasonality is kind of good starting point for second quarter. ","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I think what you will ultimately see is -- there is a benefit obviously from the seasonality. But then we are also making offensive investments in some of the areas we are trying to build origination capability. So we are still adding commercial lenders, we are still adding mortgage loan officers, wealth advisors and so our broad guidance for the year was that we are going to try to keep expenses as close to flat as possible. We are trying to have that as a quarterly and annual objective. And that's what we are working hard to accomplish. So I like to think of it is study that zero base take out constantly look for ways to take out expenses that you are not making a good return on those expense dollars. And use that to in turn fund the things that are going to allow you to filled up to your scale in the fee businesses and play offense.","Operator","And our next question will come from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bruce, could you give just a little more color on sort of your -- the outlook slide that you provided. I guess specifically in terms of maybe the comments related to wealth management where you are seeing challenges there. You mentioned in the slide that hiring maybe is a little bit slower than you had originally thought. And I guess I am also curious about your middle market outlook as well. You mentioned that business is exceptionally competitive. We've heard that from other banks. Is there anyway that you guys can sort of breakthrough that competitive environment or is it just sort of hand-to-hand combat? ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, sure. Both good areas to focus on. I would guess firstly on wealth and Brad can augment my comments again. But we have effectively a pyramid distribution strategy to match the pyramid of consumers that we have in the bank. So we have tier called licensed bankers kind of at the bottom that handles the mass. Then we have another tier called premier bankers who have full licensing to sell multiple products. Then we have tier dedicated financial consultants who simply sell the wealth products with full licensing and then we have the very tipi top of the pyramid is our private banking office. And in three of those tiers we I think made decent progress in the first quarter. So we hired up, we probably grew license bankers about 10%, we grew premier bankers around 10% and we grew private banking team at tipi top from 9 to 12. So we are making some traction. The place that we really did not make traction at all in Q1 was financial consultant. So we had roughly 300 financial consultants and we ended with roughly 300 consultants at the end of the period. So it is kind of quarter where you win some you lose some. And that's I think just a sign that this is attractive area for all banks and market participants. It is not just banks. It is insurance company, it is independent broker dealers and so actually pulling those people in can be tough. We've had good success on year-over-year basis I think we are up 10% in the FCs account but I would just flag that this quarter, it seems like competitive conditions have tightened a bit at that layer of the pyramid. So we are still -- I think our strategy make sense. I think the lead generation coming from the branches is good and improving. So we still have good hopes and ambition for that business. But you are not always going to fire and go four for all on four cylinders. Do you want to add anything, Brad? ","Brad Conner","Yes, Bruce. Another well said, another job well said. The only thing I would add is so part of that question was so how do you breakthrough. It has been hand-to-hand combat with the financial consultants and as you said we didn't really make a lot of progress. But the one opportunity for us to breakthrough is for us the license banker program is really a brand new program. So we are less than a year at the end of licensed banker program. And while we had difficult time getting net growth out of the financial consultants just from pointing from the outside, the view that license banker program can become a very attractive feeder program for our financial consultant as it gets more seasoned. So I think that is the opportunity going forward is that we transition --","Bruce Van Saun","You can grow from within instead of pulling in","Brad Conner","Which we have in our hand the opportunity until we build the license banker program. So I think that's the one. ","Bruce Van Saun","And I just on add the license banker program we are probably somewhere around 370 today trying to get to 600. So we are maybe 65% of the way through getting that up to scale. Second point on the middle market. That is a very attractive area for commercial banks to play in. Often you can really -- it is a small -- either small syndicate or you are the sole banking relationship and so you get a fair amount of cross sale that goes with those relationships. And so what we've tried to do is focus more on account acquisition there is a huge number of middle market companies in our footprint. And I think we probably, we've been building up coverage offices, we haven't had pure kind of what we call BDO a real sales oriented calling program. And so we are putting that in place. We are hiring up about 15 people to actually pursue more new account acquisition. And then we are also making sure we are running surveillance on existing back book customers where they might have a high interest rate, might be susceptible to refinancing with us or away from us and I am trying to make sure that we have the back door closed as well. We are seeing some signs of progress on both elements of that. I think the overall originations were up in Q1. The pipeline looks good for Q2. So again I think we are shading that one Amber just because under kind of the rules of the road for kind of this color coding. If we are trying to gain market share in an area that's one that you just have to monitor more carefully but I am actually pleased with some of the steps that we've taken to combat some of the competitive forces and we are starting to show progress from those steps. ","Matt Burnell","That's great color. Thank you very much and then just quickie for Eric. Eric you mentioned higher yield in both auto and student. How much of the higher yield was due to I guess an acquisition or maybe multiple portfolio acquisitions you have made in the first quarter, in those businesses? What can we expect for those yields going forward? ","Eric Aboaf ","Matt, good question. What is attractive about this franchise from my perspective is we have a very effective ability to drive origination through our organic channels like as you kind of highlight whether it is auto, whether student, and it gives us an ability to actually drive those a little more quickly and actually offset some of the natural compression that we get from some of the longer duration product like mortgages which invariably have yield compression. So when we are seeing is really a mix effect here that is boosting the yield. We've got mortgage yields in the portfolio roughly down about 20 basis points year-over-year for example. And we have auto on the other hand up about 30 basis points. We have student up a good bit as well. And so what we are seeing is ability to kind of average up the yield and kind of defends the NIM as we have described. ","Bruce Van Saun","Brad, you want to add that I mean. ","Brad Conner","Yes. I have little bit to add. And really most of the improvement in NIM is coming for the organic origination. So we have talked about this quite a bit in auto. We've gone to a more main stream prime credit spectrum as opposed to just link and super prime and what that's done is driven our origination yields are up significantly over the organic portfolio. And in student what happen is as we originate more organic production like the education refinance product, our historic student loan portfolio had some felt loan and things like that and that help to drive it up. ","Bruce Van Saun","And the other thing Brad too, in auto we've now got much more sophisticated platform with many more pricing sale. I think we've gone from 160,000 or something like ridiculous multiple so we are able to actually price very precisely for the risk that we are taking and get little more yield out of that. So, Matt, the short answer to that really organic. We had SCUSA as a kind of jump start to get fastens in the prime but our organic book is migrating very quickly to the places we want to see it. ","Eric Aboaf ","Matt, it is Eric. The other thing that we are -- we become more intense on doing is actually tracking the organic and the acquisition mix of growth right. Because it is important that we can drive that organically our own tool processes, sales force and so forth and so if you kind of step back and look at the mix, the mix of organic growth this quarter, this quarter it was about 60:40 right. That's offer good bid from where it might have been two, three, four quarters ago. And we kind of like that mix because it gives us a little more control on the credit, a little more control yield. And I think is a kind of more reliable engine of growth for us. ","Operator","And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I was wondering if you can elaborate on in terms of the comments of working on some additional revenue and expense efforts to help offset the low rate environment. I have realized you just told us that you will give us more details in 2Q but any just big picture or comments that you can elaborate on that? ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, sure. So big picture, those initiatives I would say fall into three buckets. There is some additional expense initiative that we can take more around kind of the organizational design. There are some pricing initiatives in areas where we have complex price structure for example like cash management. And then there are some overall revenue initiatives that really focus on maximizing our distribution channels and retention of our best customers. Whereas our first broad program, we call that Top 1 was a number of -- a vast number of relatively modest initiatives with a few big ones thrown in. The Top 2 if we are going to call this, this new initiative Top 2 is just kind of up to maybe a dozen larger initiatives that are more complex and take more time to basically figure out and design and then project manage. We part some of these initiatives when we went through the first program just to get the first program off the ground and start to get the benefits flowing in. And so now we've gone back and we are doing the work to develop these other ideas. And so there are fewer but bigger impact ideas. For example on the expense side of equation, we are looking at what we are calling ops transformation which is kind of looking at the Ryman reasons of how we are organized to see if we can gain some efficiencies. We also think there is more opportunity in kind of vendor consolidation and vendor management which was part of Top 1 but I think there is more bites to the apple on that one. On the revenue side, I mentioned that looking at how to keep your best customers in the bank and then also how to cross sell better using all your channels fully. We've engaged some consultants who have been in another shops in our peers and had some success and I think there is no reason why some of those programs can't be very effective here as well. So that would be some of the color, Matt. But as it was on the road show when people wish I had all the answers and all the details. I didn't -- I think we are making progress and getting a clear picture on these things. But we don't really have the full details to go into today. ","Matt O'Connor","And then the comment about the balance sheet being managed well on loans, NIM and deposits. But there might be more to do. Does that fall into one of these three buckets or is that an additional call it side project? ","Bruce Van Saun","I think that just be a good management. I think one of the things that having Eric here now given his background as Global Treasurer of Citi, he certainly understands balance sheet quite well. And so having a fresh set of eyes is to how we are going about our deposit raising strategies, how are we pricing our assets and looking at the risk appetite in a business mix, is there more that we can do kind of squeeze out NIM improvements. I think that's good first thing for Eric to sink his teeth into. ","Matt O'Connor","Okay. That something that we can look for more detail in 2Q as well.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Probably, yes. ","Operator","And our next question will come from Beck Nanja [ph] JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Beck Nanja","Hi. Couple of questions, Bruce and Eric. If you look at your -- on the consumer side, you have been -- Bruce, you were talking about turning that around. We've seen some consumer growth there in the deposit side. Can you elaborate on which markets you are seeing more success? ","Bruce Van Saun","Geographically or --","Beck Nanja","Yes, geographically, yes.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Look I think we are pretty strong, pretty evenly distributed in terms of our success. I would say in the first quarter the North East was probably hit the hardest with some of the weather concerns. I don't want to use the weather as an excuse but I think factoring into that seasonality we probably lost two or three productive days in the branches and kind of the New England region. And not so much in the Mid Atlantic and in the Mid West. New England was hit pretty hard but we do a very comprehensive evaluation of the entire, all the branches in the system and looking at in the footprint, and we force rank and see how things are doing and I think we have -- there is no kind of big variances from the mean. I think the New England and Mid Atlantic and the kind of upper Mid West regions that we have are all kind of pretty tightly punched. I don't know Brad if you want to add anything.","Brad Conner","No. You said exactly right, Bruce. I mean little bit of slowness in New England from the weather but other than that no real trends geographically that stand now, yes. ","Beck Nanja","And Bruce shifting to commercial deposits. They were down a little bit this quarter. You had shown some nice progress last quarter. Can you just comment on what's going on there? ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. And Eric you can add to this. But I think that's just really seasonality. So we brought in some deposits at year end and some of that went out there is tax payments, and if you look at kind of the period end we saw that pickup again by the end of March. So that will move a round a little bit. But I feel very confident that we are developing good strategies to grow the commercial deposits. If you look at our LDR and the commercial side, we are probably up in the mid 180s which one we look at our peers they are probably 140 to 160. I think partly that's just result of -- we didn't need the funding because we were shrinking the balance sheet for years. And so we had, I like to say go back in the gym and get some muscle back in terms of having good deposit raising strategies and a good focus and a good game plan to do that. And you can see that year-over-year growth in commercials been extremely good. So we brought the LDR and this is a one point, it was like 230, so we are down to the mid 180s and I think we can keep growing and raising deposit cost effectively, building up the cash management business is a key element of that. We brought in talent; we spent a lot of money on technology. I think we are under punching our weight in terms of market share there. So that's a critical plank in the overall program. Eric, do you want to add to that?","Eric Aboaf ","Yes. I think the commercial deposit opportunity is one that continues to be significant for us right. We are up in deposit from the commercial side 26% year-over-year largely because we never really try to grow deposit there. Right the bank, they thought they have been deposit on the consumer side. We made commercial loans that actually in a way create quite a bit opportunity. A lot of which you saw over the last year. And what we continue to do is now go down the next level of detail which is what industry segment in which geographies or either a little more credit needy and so we can try middle market or which of them are more cash rich or which of them have both, right. And that's the kind of second and third level analytic that we can put to it. I think the good news is we have a very strong sales force and banker force out there who knows their customers extremely well. And we've been able to channel that energy and one of the things I will be doing more of it just focusing which segment, which sub segment which industry verticals and continue to find more opportunities out there. ","Beck Nanja","One last thing if I may, completely different topic. Restructuring charges. You all said pushed out a little more to the second quarter. Should that mean we see -- those that will be driven by -- for the head count -- should that mean we see little bigger pick up in cost savings in Q2 and later. ","Bruce Van Saun","Well, some of the costs that are coming in Q2 are really around rebranding. Last stages of separation cost from RBS, the Charter One science coming down and the Citizens unified brand around Citizens. So I don't think there is any direct link to the expense forecast although what I would say is that we are working on the forward view of trying to keep expenses as slight as possible. So there is a constant stream of initiatives and efficiency initiatives that's taking place. And then to Ken's first question, there is reinvestment going back in the growth areas. So I think we are -- we still have a very positive view towards expense management, the rest of this year and the one wild card I think that are some of those extra levers that we talked about. If we can get ops transformation geared up that could create some additional benefits to the equation as well as the vendor initiatives that we are taking. So stay tuned.","Operator","And our next question will come from Scott Cyphers from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead ","Scott Cyphers","Good morning, everybody. Bruce, I was wondering if you could spend just a moment talking about kind of the differentiation between growth that's coming from just the underlying organic growth within the franchise and the internal building you guys have done versus the loan you are purchasing. I only ask just because one of the -- I guess one of the criticism I hear and you guys periodically how much of the growth comes from purchase loan but if the underlying growth is stronger, does that do anything to you need or reliance on purchased growth as you got over the next year or so? ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I mean that's kind of legend out there. I don't quite understand it because from the get go when we laid our plan we said that we would use loan purchases kind of in the beginning of our turnaround plan to use capacity we had on our balance sheet until we were able to build up our own capabilities. In which case we would get the origination to the levels that made sense within our strategy. And so if you look at I think where we were last year to where we are now in the current quarter, we had probably three quarters of the overall and slightly more, exactly close to the 80% of our loan growth was organic. And I think it was 22% or 23% was purchase. So the purchases that we are doing now really the SCUSA agreement are one. We purchased $2 billion in auto last year. We said in the prepared remarks that we are going to target that at $1.5 billion this year because we are seeing I think really good growth in organic auto as dealers increasingly accept us to handle the full credit spectrum including prime customer. So SCUSA was always viewed as a bridge until we were in that position. And so we are seeing the fruits of our investment there. And then also in student, we are a bit surprised to be upside about the take up on this refi product. And so we have I think we outperformed our expectations in terms of student growth as well. And occasionally there will be some portfolios that we can buy like we did a tuck-in one in Q1. But even with that tuck-in we still were predominantly organic. And I think over time you will see as we move into 2016. There is an open question as to how much SCUSA will need. But I don't really us needing to do much anywhere else. ","Eric Aboaf ","And Scott, Eric. Just to put that in context right. So we are at 75% or 80% organic today right quarter-over-quarter if you go a year ago it would have been 60:40, right, so we are kind of continuing move in that direction and that's part of our objective. ","Scott Cyphers","Okay, that's perfect. I appreciate that. And again switch gear just for a second, I don't want to jumping on too much on the sort of your cost initiatives or anything you might have more detail on later but Bruce can you just talk for a second about the balance between funding say additional cost savings versus kind of hitting the target that you got for the most visible of the 10% return on tangible comment, , I think I just mathematically there are ways you could cut costs pretty quickly and still be comfortable to get towards your target but if it was more measured based and like you kind of put things at risk. How do you sort of way that balances as you look at things?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I think in explaining our plan one of the things that we did initially was we benched ourselves in terms of measures to assets to scale. So if you look at our expense load to deposits or to assets, we are actually quite good relative to peers. And I think we are at the bottom at the first quartile. And if you look at revenue productivity relative on the same measure, we got revenue also. So we were making enough income of the balance sheet. Our fee businesses were not at scale. So hypothesis coming in when I came across was we think we have the right level of expenses but we probably aren't spending those expenses where we need to. So let's go attack that. That was the basis for the $200 million. And then let's self fund the investments that we need to get more originators so we can drive more asset growth. And fee businesses is like mortgage, like wealth, like capital markets, up to a scale level so that we could bring the cash register on fee opportunities that go with the size of our loan book and a size of our branch infrastructure et cetera. So that's the real objective here is to get the revenues growing at a faster clip to grow into the potential of the franchise while keeping expenses very muted. I don't think there is a different strategy; alternate of saying could you just start whacking the expense base down. And that's a way to propel yourself to the 10%. I don't think there is enough in that to actually do it. And even if you could do it, it wouldn't put in a sustainable position where you really maximizing the benefit of the franchise. So that's kind of how we set it up. And I still think that holds. Having said that we will be very vigilant and constantly looking for ways of continuous improvement. How can we be more effective and how we serve our customers and more efficient and how we do that at the same time. And that's the mindset that we are trying to instill within the company. ","Operator","And our next question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello there. And a couple of questions on capital. Firstly on just to clarify on the share repurchase that you announced after CCAR. You told us about the $500 million through the end of 2015. But you didn't say anything about the first two quarters of next year which fall into the same CCAR horizon. So can you -- let us know if there is a possibility of repurchasing more shares. I know if you have to wait until --","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. No. We have been approved for was $500 million and what we have said is that we want to do that front loaded. So we did as part as front loaded just you can't buying back on April 1, the first $250 million. And I think in the Q3, we are planning to do kind of the next $250 million very early in July. That basically leaves us no dry powder until the next CCAR cycle. And so we have -- our dividend in place, we have asset growth in place but over this period that we were approved to do the $500 million, we will do that $500 million quickly. ","Geoffrey Elliott","And then following up on that you mentioned in the presentation the time of the IPO $500 million to buyback in 2015, $250 million in 2016. Given that the capital ratios look pretty strong in the stress scenario of CCAR and that you now being through that exercise successfully. I mean is there any possibility of getting more aggressive on than the $250 million in 2016. ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I guess what I would say to that is the last $250 million was really part of what we refer to as our conversion transaction. So when originally we had converted all of the capital securities to equity and now we are trying to put the leverage back in the capital structure. And the number we were targeting was $2.75 billion. With this $500 million that just been approved we've had -- that will be $2.5 billion. So that leaves $250 million. We didn't say that was all we would do. That was just kind of the tail of the overall transaction for the conversion transactions. We've targeted an 11% set one ratio by the end of 2016. And we will just have to see kind of what kind of asset growth opportunities we have. We will have to see is 11% still an appropriate number. Is there an opportunity to basically move that down if our peers are lower than that number which they are today? So there are a number of things that would come into play when we consider the next CCAR submission in terms of what we want to do in total. So I would just simply say that the $250 million is kind of lock because it completes the program. And then what else we do is depended on the future circumstances. ","Operator","And our next question in queue comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. ","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Bruce, I jumped on late so I apologize if you have addressed this but in the success that you are having in the student loan program, is it more coming from that new product for the student loans for parents or is it more coming directly from the student loans to the student?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I would say the parent launch just was very recent so there is really nothing to reflect at this point. It is the refi product has been very, very strong. So I think we are first to market on that product. And it has been take --had a very good market reception. And then there is a traditional what we call our true fit product which was the student loan for students who are going to college. And that is a seasonal product that tends to be taken down not in the first quarter. So when you look at the mix of what happened in the first quarter is really the lift in this refi product is providing the impetus. And if you then forecast out Q2 would be similar. We have a very big pipeline on that refi product as we look into Q2. ","Brad Conner","And then Q3 will be a little more balanced with the true-fit because that will be the seasonal piece. ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Exactly right. ","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And on the refi product, what kind of yield are you earning from the refi student loan product?","Brad Conner","Right now the yields are in the mid five. ","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And in terms of 10 year fixed or --","Brad Conner","Yes. We actually offer multiple terms and it is about 60% fixed, 40% in variable but we do offer various terms on the product and --","Bruce Van Saun","And the FICO scores are quite high. They are over 780-ish [ph], correct. Very, very high quality. ","Gerard Cassidy","Yes, no. I agree the student loans are for banks, it is totally different than the government of course. Moving over the automobile. Obviously, you guys have had some real good growth here as well. What the $13.2 billion of outstanding I think end of March, what percentage would you define as sub prime or lower FICO score loans? ","Bruce Van Saun","Very, very little. I mean I would say none. I don't know if you could say anything on but technically none but it is certainly less than 3% or something. We are not intending to play in sub prime. We historically played in super prime. We are migrating into prime but that's still very good credit quality paper. ","Gerard Cassidy","Sure. And the paper they are buying for SCUSA is prime; they are not sub prime paper? ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. The average FICO score and that's probably 710, 715, somewhere in that ballpark. ","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And just finally you mentioned about growing your license bankers to 600 in total. I think you are in the low 300 today. What kind of timeframe do you have to get there?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, we are actually closer to 360, 370 but we intend to get there by the end of 2016. So all the goal post in terms of getting mortgage loan officers from 350 to 700, licensed bankers from 300 to 600. Those are all targeted to deliver by the end of 2016.","Gerard Cassidy","And I guess just one follow up on that. When you are looking for the -- it sound so much licensed bankers but the wealth management area, you mentioned it is a challenge to try to find people. What is it in turn, is it a compensation challenge or is it just more people don't want to leave the established company they are with. What are you finding to be the biggest challenge to bring people in?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I think again going -- I don't know if you heard me talk about the tier strategies but it is probably easier at the lower tier because you are presenting opportunities and training for people in many cases. When you get into the FCs, a lot of those people have a comfort zone kind of where they are. And we don't want just compete on price the way some of the independent broker dealers do. So someone who moves has to move their clients with them and there will be some leakage from that. And they have to weigh that versus if they come to your branches how good is the lead generation and the opportunity to build their book with us. And so that's the calibration that goes through when people decide whether they are going to move or not. ","Operator","And our next question comes from David Eaves with UBS.","David Eaves","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on the question here on the advisors. Can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of competition and availability for the mortgage officers?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure, Brad, you want to take that? ","Brad Conner","Yes. I would say we've had good success hiring and you have seen your net -- we've been net growing and we had good success hiring, I would say one of the things that we-- that has happened as we have seen a little bit higher attrition rate of our loan officers than we had expected. But overall we are having good success hiring. It is competitive market place out there; application volume has been really strong for the first quarter. So we've got nice pipeline building. And again it is like lot of the other sales job family, it is just lot of competition in the market place for good talented people.","Bruce Van Saun","I think what we are successful in bringing in people overall given that we are playing offence, so we try to build the business. We have I think an ability to warehouse, we are taking jumbo mortgages on to our books. We have a fairly broad product capability, so we can do the things that folks find attractive to serve customers well. And so and we've attracted some strong sales leadership into the house. So I think those things are going well for us. And we just have to get better as Brad said in making sure that when people come they can get their production right up to the levels and they can be effective on platform and we can keep him here. So we had a little issue with attrition but I think overall we are heading in the right direction. We are kind of getting close to the kind of 450 mark and we started at 350. And we are on our way to 700. We got-- we did 42 in Q4, 29 this quarter. You kind of -- if you math outwear we need to be, we got be kind of reproducing these quarters on a consistent basis. We got be putting in 35 to 40 people per quarter for the next seven quarters to get that 700 mark. ","David Eaves","Great. And then maybe if you could just touch a little bit on the -- what you are kind of saying in the commercial real estate area? It is obviously an area where he had a lot of other folks seeing really intense competition on pricing terms and do you guys have pretty good growth there. So I was just curious what you guys are seeing there?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I think it is always fairly competitive market. We hadn't played in a while as part of our RBS and so we've just kind of put some oxygen back in the system with some higher limits and some real targeted strategies where we wanted to grow. And I think we focused more on the high end project so institutional investors who are well known, that's one area the high end office market. We've also done a good job looking after REIT and so that may not be the highest yielding portfolio but the credit quality is very good. And the cross sale for other products and services is high. And I think we have to also look at where other opportunities to play where we can pick up a better yield because we simply stay fully at that end of the market, we won't make the kind of overall yield on our commercial real estate. That something that we are looking at gradually building that up and building up a little bucket of higher yielding stuff that we still think is very safe from a credit standpoint. So that's what we are focused on. ","Operator","And move to on Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning. Just two quick ones. First of all, prior comments on future uses of capital and your comments also about now the organic loan growth kind of taking over for the initial acquired. I am just wondering where portfolio acquisition akin to the one you did in the fourth quarter of the energy book, would be also part of that future capital consideration. ","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Ken, that was really a one off that energy book was just a clean up of RBS and Citizens separating and I think that activity should have always been in Citizens, a reserve based lending business is more of bank business and investment bank business. But RBS was there first and so as they reconsider their strategy and now they are focused, they said look this you always wanted this, this should your so we move that across. I don't really think we will do any loan acquisitions on the commercial side because we've been growing that 8% to 10% organically for a consistent period of time, four, five years. And we are on that trajectory again this year. So I wouldn't see it there. On the consumer side, we've used whole loan purchases last year before we were able to start building up our mortgage loan officers. We've also use the SCUSA as a bridge till we build up our own bigger auto capabilities in prime. And occasionally we will see a student book that we like. We bought I think $50 million one in last year. We maybe bought a $201 million in this first quarter but we also sold some we try to get rid some of the FELP exposure that we have. So net-net I think we are adding -- we haven't added any real loans net in student from a purchase standpoint. So we will be opportunistic. I think one of the things we found in a low spread environment is when we enter into these flow agreement for people who want to use a balance sheet, there is not enough vig in it to pay the servicing fees away and then also for us to make a good return. So I think again we are migrating towards having the capabilities to pro loans at the pace we want organically. ","Ken Usdin","Understood. And my second one just on consumer service charges. Proportion of revenue is relatively high for you guys versus others. I am just wondering if there is anything we need to be considering as far as the future either on ordering or CAPB et cetera as far as growth potential or future drags in that part of business? Thanks. ","Bruce Van Saun","I think we've made all of the policy changes that put a square on the side of the regulators. And good business practice. We've also made certain adjustments to kind of over drafting for small items under $5 that we don't think it is right that our customer should pay overdraft fee on that. So all of those changes are in the run rate. So the only thing that really in the comps you looked that on service charges in the first quarter last year we had Chicago in the number. So it doesn't look like we grown but we actually have grown the service charges 2% on an underlying basis. And then in Q4 going to Q1, you just have seasonality and we would expect to see that recover in Q2 quite nicely. ","Operator","And due to time constraint, we will turn the call back over to Van Saun at this time.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Well, thanks everybody for dialing in today. Again, I think we are continuing to execute well against all of our initiatives and feel that we delivered another solid quarter and we look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will made available for replay after 11 O'clock today and running till Friday, May 22 at midnight.

My name is Brad and I will be your operator today. Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Hey, thanks so much Brad, and happy Friday everybody. We\u2019re really pleased to have you all join us. First off this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our results and our outlook and they will reference the earnings presentation which you can find at investors.citizensbank.com, then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. In the ring with us today are Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking and they will be able to provide some additional color.","So now for some quick housekeeping, our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and you should review the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the expectations on page two of the presentation and in our 2018 Form 10-K. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures, so it\u2019s important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and to utilize the information about these measures and the reconciliation to GAAP in the appendix.","And with that, Bruce, it\u2019s all yours.","Bruce Van Saun","Alright, thanks Ellen. And good morning everyone, thanks for joining our call today. We\u2019re pleased to announce another strong quarter. In spite of interest rate yield curved headwinds we grew our revenue 5% versus a year ago and 1% versus last quarter. ","Our earnings per share was up 5% versus a year ago and up 2% sequentially. The key to these results were strong performance in our mortgage business, continued good expense decline and robust capital return. ","We progressed well on our efforts around TOP 6 and on some of the strategic investment initiatives that we outlined last quarter. We continue to actively manage the balance sheet through our BSO program and we\u2019ve maintained our loan-to-deposit ratio of around 94%. ","We\u2019ve managed deposit costs down aggressively in the quarter with interest-bearing deposit costs down 6 basis points versus last quarter and we expect the deposit betas to tick up as we see further rate cuts. ","Our credit metrics remain strong overall and both consumer and commercial are in really good shape. Our view is that the economy is holding up reasonably well, but growth has slowed somewhat versus a year ago. While we don\u2019t see a recession on the horizon anytime soon, we are being duly cautious in selective areas on new loan originations.","So overall, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve executed well year-to-date and we feel we are positioned to close out the year with a good fourth quarter. Our formula for 2020 will remain consistent, namely grow our balance sheet prudently, deftly manage our NIM, continue to invest in our fee businesses and reap the returns, carefully manage the expense base by finding fresh efficiencies and then self-funding new initiatives, stay disciplined on credit and actively manage our capital base. ","We celebrated an important milestone during the quarter, the 5th Anniversary of our IPO on September 24. It\u2019s been quite a journey. She\u2019s made much progress in building a great bank and we are now delivering better and better for customers, colleagues, communities, shareholders and regulators.","We know there is more work to do and we are energized by the challenge. I\u2019m confident that our track record of strong and disciplined execution will continue and will differentiate us from our peers, and there\u2019s no reason the next five years can\u2019t be even better than the last five. ","With that, let me stop and turn it over to our CFO, John Woods.","John Woods","Great, thanks Bruce. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to report a strong quarter with record fee income, good expense discipline and continued execution against our strategic initiative. Let me kick off by covering important highlights of our underlying results on page four.","On a year-to-date basis our EPS is up 11%, and for the quarter we delivered EPS growth of 5% year-on-year with PPNR up 2%. This reflects relatively stable net interest income at 3% loan growth helped offset the impact of the decline in net interest margin to 3.12% given rate and yield curve. ","We delivered record fee income of nearly $500 million, up 19% year-over-year illustrating a diversity of our business model. Commercial and consumer loan growth were each up 3% year-over-year as we seek attractive variance to deploy capital and grow our customer base. ","Strong deposit growth is faced by continuing momentum in Citizens Access, which grew to $5.6 billion by quarter end. Our spot LDR was 94.5%, providing us with funding flexibility as we head into the end of the year. ","Given the environment, we remain highly focused in our spend discipline and continuing to execute extremely well on our TOP programs. We now expect to realize a per tax run-rate benefit for our TOP 5 programs in the range of $105 million to $115 million by the end of the year, which is a $10 million increase over our prior estimates. ","Overall credit quality remains strong with a stable non-performing loan ratio of 57 basis points and an allowance-to-loans ratio of 107 basis points. On an underlying basis the effective tax rate is 22.3% as the reported rate of 20.5% includes a $10 million tax benefit associated with an operational restructuring. We delivered underlying ROTCE of 12.6% and tangible book value per share was up 14% year-on-year to $31.48. ","This quarter, there was some noise in several line items due to an aircraft lease restructuring in a non-core portfolio. This was trigged by a client merger and reflects our continuing efforts to accelerate the run-down of the non-core lease portfolio. ","This reduced PPNR by about $3 million, with an increased expense of $10 million and a $7 million increase in fees. Charge-offs and provision were $5 million higher due to this transaction. Before the impact of this restructuring, we delivered positive operating leverage of 40 basis points in linked quarter basis and an efficiency ratio of 57.8%.","On page six, net interest income was relatively stable year-over-year despite the impact of the challenging rate environment. Loan growth of 3% helped largely to offset the impact of a 10 basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.12% given the rate backdrop. ","Contributing to the decline in NIM was a 3 basis point impact year-over-year from higher premium amortization tied to significantly lower long term rates. This was partially offset by the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields, given the continued mix shift for better-returning assets and modestly higher short-term rates.","On a linked quarter basis the margin decreased 9 basis points, including a 3 basis point impact on premium amortization. So on a positive note, we managed deposits well with a 6 basis point decrease in interest-bearing deposit costs.","Given the challenging rate environment, we have continued to actively manage our asset sensitivity which came in at 2.7% to a gradual 200 basis point rising rate versus 2.9% in the prior quarter. Year-over-year our asset sensitivity has come down which was driven by an addition of approximately $7 billion of net receive fixed swap over the past four quarters, including a net $2 billion forward sliding position we had at this quarter, as well as evolving expectations for balance sheet mix. ","As you look at the effect of our hedging activities over the last year, both our balance sheet mix changes had the effective of shifting our sensitivity to the long end of the curve, with about 20% to 25% of our exposure now five and six months and shorter.","Our current outlook has an additional rate cut in October, however we expect to see a lower level of wind compression in the fourth quarter reflecting further declines of interest-bearing deposit costs, broadly stable premium amortization, and the benefit of our hedges. These factors along with an expected resumption of loan growth should help support net interest income in the fourth quarter. ","Moving to fees on slide seven, as I mentioned, our fee-based businesses delivered record results this quarter with fee income hitting 30% of revenue. Non-interest income was up 7% on a linked-quarter basis and up 19% year-over-year, driven by strong results in mortgage banking, card fees and foreign exchange and interest rate products. ","Service charges and fees were up $2 million, or 2% linked-quarter reflecting seasonality and card fees were up 5% sequentially driven by seasonally higher volumes. Our acquisition of Franklin is playing out as we hoped, and serves as a nice hedge against the backdrop in lower rates. ","Mortgage banking fees were up $55 million, as the origination business led the way with production revenue up $31 million on higher volumes and improved gain-on-sale margins. Overall mortgage servicing revenue increased $24 million, given favorable MSR hedging results and our larger servicing portfolio. ","Capital markets fees came in at $39 million this quarter, which represents the lowest level since first quarter of 2018, in the face of overall market weakness. Even so, we improved our market share and positioning. ","Syndication fees were down linked quarter, reflecting the impact of a significant slowing in middle-market activity and seasonality, while bond-underwriting fees were higher as fixed income markets picked up later in the quarter. ","We are entering the fourth quarter with a strong overall capital markets pipeline, which includes the impact of several deals that were pushed out from third quarter to the fourth quarter. Wealth fees were 6% lower linked-quarter from record second quarter levels, as investment sales were impacted by volatile market conditions. ","In FX and interest rate products we executed exceptionally well despite challenging conditions, delivering near record level fees in line with second quarter in what is typically a seasonally slower quarter. ","We are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made diversifying our fee revenue by broadening capabilities, executing well on strategic initiatives and integrating key acquisitions to build scale in mortgage, expand our M&A business, and enhance our wealth capabilities. And as we look forward, the investments we have been making across the platform over the past five years should continue to gain traction, as we seek to do more for our customers and be their trusted advisor. ","Turning to page, eight. Underlying non-interest expense was up $10 million linked-quarter, reflecting the impact of the lease transaction. Excluding this impact, expenses were flat, illustrating our strong commitment to expense discipline as we continue to deliver efficiencies from our TOP programs. We continue to recycle cost savings from TOP into revenue-generating opportunities. ","Salaries and employee benefits remained relatively stable, and equipment and software expense was up 3%, given our ongoing technology efforts. Compared to the prior year, underlying non-interest expense before the impact of acquisitions, and the lease restructuring was up 3% as we efficiently managed our costs, while investing for growth. ","Let\u2019s move on to page 9 and discuss the balance sheet. Average loans were relatively stable linked-quarter largely reflecting the impact of second quarter loan sales, as well as relatively high repayments and lower line utilization in commercial. ","Year-over-year average loans were up 3%, driven by growth in both commercial and retail with some modest headwinds from asset dispositions. Adjusting for the impact of loan sales in the first half, loan growth was 4% year-over-year. ","Commercial loans were up 4% year-over-year with strength in C&I and were down slightly linked-quarter due to relatively high repayments and the impact of lower line utilization, as well as planned reductions in commercial leases. On the retail side, loans were up 3% year-over-year and 1% linked-quarter, given growth in mortgage, education refinance and our merchant finance partnerships. ","Regarding the lease restructuring this quarter, I should mention that we have done a nice job running down the non-core leasing portfolio and the total non-core book, which are both down about 30% year-on-year while the overall credit quality of the book continues to improve. Overall, period-end loans were up 1% linked quarter, providing momentum for fourth quarter loan growth. ","Moving to page 10, we saw nice deposit growth of 1% linked-quarter and 6% year-over-year. We continue to benefit from our Citizens Access digital platform, which has contributed nicely to our funding diversification and the optimization of our deposit levels and costs. At the end of the quarter, we reached $5.6 billion in Citizens Access deposits. ","Given the rate environment, we have been aggressively executing our deposit playbook to manage down our deposit costs across all channels, reducing CD rates, retail money market promo rates, and taking down the savings rate in our direct bank. We\u2019ve also been reducing rates for some commercial clients where they come. ","As a result, our total deposit costs were well controlled, down 5 basis points linked-quarter, a nice improvement from the 3 basis point increase last quarter. Interest-bearing deposits were down 6 basis points linked-quarter. ","Next, let\u2019s move to page 11, and cover credit, which continues to look quite good overall. This reflects an improving risk profile in retail and I\u2019m relatively stable risk profile at favorable levels in commercial. ","Net charge-offs came in at 38 basis points in the quarter, up modestly from relatively low second quarter levels. Net charge-offs were up $27 million year-over-year with a $16 million increase in commercial, largely driven by a small number of uncorrelated losses, as the broader portfolio risk profile remained relatively stable. ","Retail net charge-offs increased $8 million, reflecting expected seasoning in our growth portfolios. Provision for credit losses of $101 million was up from prior quarter and prior year levels reflecting the higher charge-off. The non-performing loan ratio of 67 basis points was relatively stable linked-quarter and improved 6 basis points year-over-year. ","Non-performing loans decreased 5% year-over-year, driven by improvements in retail. On a linked quarter basis, non-performing loans increased 3%, driven by an increase in commercial primarily tied to a small number of loans, while we saw improvements in retail driven by home equity and education. ","Our allowance to loans coverage ratio remained relatively stable, ending the quarter at 107 basis points. The NPL coverage ratio was also stable linked quarter at 159 basis points. On page 12, we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions, ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.3%, which compares well with peers and gives us excellent financial flexibility. ","During third quarter, we repurchased 14.1 million shares of common stock and including dividends we returned $662 million to shareholders, up 25% year-over-year. Going forward, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40%, and our planned glide path to reduce our CET1 ratio remains on track. ","Let\u2019s move to page 13 and discuss CECL. We expect that the day-one impact for CECL on a pro forma basis will be about a 30% to 35% increase in the existing reserve, which was about $1.3 million at the end of the quarter. From a capital perspective, this represents about 22 basis to 25 basis points of CET1 on a fully phased in basis, or approximately 5 basis to 6 basis points in year one. This range considers the current economic outlook and mix and credit characteristics of the portfolio. ","In addition a key factor is the impact of longer duration loans such as education, home equity, auto and residential mortgages that tend to attract a higher level of reserves. At the same time, the commercial portfolio is generally shorter duration and so is expected to require less reserves than it does today. Ultimately, the impact of the initial impact will reflect both the portfolio mix and the macroeconomic outlook when we get to the end of the year. ","On page 14, I want to highlight a few exciting things that are happening across our Bank. First, we ranked Number 4 in the 2019 J.D. Power U.S. Home Mortgage Satisfaction survey. Since last year, we moved up six positions in that survey, which is a real testament to the hard work our mortgage colleagues have done to integrate Franklin American, while relentlessly focusing on our customers. ","We are also very excited to announce that we\u2019ve just entered into a new Consumer Banking partnership with an iconic technology company to be announced shortly. We will provide more details around the launch of this program, which is later this quarter, but this is another great example of our commitment to innovation and strong focus on the customer experience. ","In commercial, we are really progressing well with the client migration to accessOptima, our best-in-class cash management platform. About half of our clients are on the platform and we expect the transition to be complete by the end of the year. ","And in addition to TOP 5, which I mentioned earlier, substantial work is under way on our TOP 6 program, which is targeting a pre-tax run rate benefit of about $300 million to $325 million by the end of 2021.","Our outlook for the fourth quarter is on page 15, and it reflects continued disposition for both our top and bottom line results. Our current view is that we expect an additional rate cut in October, and as a result, we expect net interest income to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter, as loan growth should offset further but less net NIM contraction due to rates. ","Our outlook for loan growth reflects stronger period-end trends, coupled with healthy pipelines driven by our geographic, product and client focused expansion strategies. Also, we expect a moderation of third quarter commercial pay-down and utilization trends, as well as continued growth in mortgage, student and other retail. ","We are expecting non-interest income to be down modestly from the record level last quarter. Strength in capital market revenues should largely offset a decline from record mortgage fees. Given our continued focus on expense discipline, we expect non-interest expense to be flat to slightly down. ","Additionally, we expect provision expense to increase by about $10 million, and finally we expect to end the year with a CET1 ratio of approximately 10.1%. ","To sum up on page 17, our results this quarter demonstrate our continuing strong performance, as we execute against our strategic initiatives, grow customers and revenues, carefully manage our expense base, deploy new technologies and improve how we run the bank. ","Now, let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, thanks John. Operator Brad, let\u2019s open it up for some Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll go to the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. First of all, great job on reducing your interest-bearing deposit costs this quarter. We\u2019ve heard from other banks that deposit competition is still really aggressive. Bruce, I know you mentioned that you expect your deposit betas to increase next quarter, does that imply that some of that deposit competition might be easing?","John Woods","Yeah, I\u2019ll go ahead and start off. I think it's a number of factors. I mean, when you have a rate cut like we had in September, it was just a natural operational lag, if you will, and we talked in previous calls, that there is a deposit lag that maybe, call it three months to six months. And so as you, as we get further away from that September cut, the impact of that cut gets pushed through operationally and you going to see deposit betas increase from 3Q into 4Q, and therefore, we expect interest-bearing deposit costs to actually decline by a larger amount than they did this quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, great. And then just my second question is in terms of your energy exposure. We had three other banks that I cover announce higher energy charge-offs this quarter. And I know you guys didn\u2019t mention it at all, which is certainly a positive. But can you just address what you\u2019re seeing from a credit perspective in your energy portfolio? ","John Woods","Yeah, so Ken [Inaudible]. We\u2019ve actually been working through our energy exposure for little over a year now. Our NPLs are way down, they are down about 25% of our total NPL to 9%. So we structured and worked through a lot of them. Our overall portfolio is down and I think one of the things that we have in our portfolio, I don't know about other banks, but have a very low service of other field services and that's a lot of the distress. It looks like it's happening in the oil sectors. So we tend to be \u2013 the RDL structures are good midstream structures and we are pretty comfortable we don't see any incremental distress in the portfolio, although it is a bit of a distress.","Ken Zerbe","Alright, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we can move to the next question with John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","John Woods","Hi, good morning.","John Pancari","I wanted to see if you can give a little bit more color on the commercial credit front. I know your commercial non-performers were up 25% linked quarter and you noted in the release that it's a small number of uncorrelated credit. So just wanted to see if you can give us a little bit more detail on the industry, on maybe the sizes and the types of loans as well. Thanks.","DonMcCree","Yeah, I'll take that one. So we did have a couple of charge-offs in the quarter. One of the real estate divisions which is a regional mall was at a small net charge-off to basically position ourselves and hopefully exit out of that credit with the sale of the restructuring in the near future. ","Our non-pro forma move was making one credit which is in the automotive linked sector, which we've been working through, as well as we don't think there is a significant charge-off there when we took a non-performer, and that non-performing is restructuring. We were able to do that a year ago. There is a significant amount of used capital for wallets now. We can all pay back the credit than we thought it was to take a non-performer given the cash flow dynamics of the Company.","Bruce Van Saun","I would add with what Don mentioned on that first credit, we're close to having that one resolved, which would allow NPAs to fall back down in Q4.","Don McCree","I think more generally, I think as John said, we feel good about the general trends in the portfolio. We feel like we're identifying any issues earlier. We're aggressively addressing them and we are trying to move them off the portfolio. We certainly think there's future risk. So we try to move through anything that portfolio we think will have any significant...","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, be proactive. Good model.","John Pancari","Okay, got it, got it. And then Bruce, you indicated in your remarks that you're being cautious, prudently cautious in certain lending areas. What type of areas are they and what do you see that's making you get more cautious? Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I can throw that one to Don as well, but I'll kick off here, but I think in general there\u2019s some very competitive conditions in certain parts of the market, particularly middle market. We have a lot of non-bank competition there and so we're competing where we want to hold up our relationships with our customers, but we're not being aggressive to try to grow the book there and take on a tough spread situations or tough term situation, so that's one. ","I think in certain areas like restaurants, we're certainly actually taking a posture toward reducing exposure and not adding exposure, and I think we're also being proactive there and we have some good momentum there. ","So I'd just say it's around the edges of being disciplined and then seeking out areas of growth, our specialty verticals. We get some better spreads there, we're moving upmarket and competing effectively in mid-corporate. So we think we'll see some growth there and I think we did indicate that we will see a return to overall loan growth in Q4 and also in commercial in Q4, so our pipelines look quite good. ","We have seen in Q3 elevated pay downs, refinancings, lower line utilization. So even though we had a pretty strong quarter in terms of originations, we are fighting against that a little bit, but I think in Q4 we would expect to see less of that and we're continuing to see a nice pipeline. ","Don, you can add.","Don McCree","Yeah, I'll just give you a little more sense to that. Kind of a year ago we were seeing about two-thirds of our origination, they were basically one-to-one this quarter. So we really got hurt on the new originations side from pay down. ","I think it was a combination of things going on. I think particularly in the middle market in general, we see people deleverage in anticipation for uncertainties in the next year. So they are not putting on some more debt. There\u2019s not as many special dividend deals going on, there\u2019s not as many relief in capital or buy back I assume in the core of our portfolio, and that is obviously people just saying, we are going to take the utilization down.","Our keen sense is some sense of that moderating, so now we've got some of our loan growth going forward. As Bruce mentioned, some of the challenging portfolios are restaurant portfolio, down by about 50%, but we are working with the fee and we are working that down. We are purposely letting our leasing portfolio down and focusing on our core. We've been working our multi-family real estate portfolio down, so there's a lot of things that we're actually trying to adjust from a portfolio standpoint, but it\u2019s the lagging the numbers on a net basis.","And then, as you've heard John talk about, we are actively involved in the BSO and where we don't see adequate returns over the next say two years to three years. Our disposals we have, we'll consider moving them off the balance sheet. So I think the new business feels good in areas that we've actually grown from a regional standpoint, from an industry specialty standpoint, it feels good, and it's just there's a load of investment going on in terms of the overall book-to-business we are trying to run. And just that I know, it is very competitive, people tell us, people search for loans that are out there and we [inaudible] on both the terms and conditions at a pricing standpoint, so we can make payments in the future as well.","John Pancari","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And we'll go to the next question in queue coming from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe John, first question that's for you. I'm hoping you can just put a little bit of a finer point on the fee guide for the fourth quarter, including some of the expected drivers. You mentioned capital markets in the pipeline there, but I guess I'm just curious, given that, I guess a pretty substantial MSR benefit, so right off the bat it could be kind of a $25 million hole or up to a $25 million hole. Just curious if you can talk a little bit more detail about the puts and takes please?","John Woods","Yes, sure I'll start off and others can add. I mean I think the main point here is that, as we mentioned that capital markets pipelines were quite strong. When you look at 3Q, that was a little bit more of a down quarter at $39 million. When we see the outlook in to 4Q, we have some deals push out of 3Q into 4Q; we had a very soft syndication quarter in 3Q that looks to be firming up into the fourth quarter. ","M&A advisory was an area that was flattish from 2Q to 3Q and we look to see that being meaningful and significantly up in the fourth quarter. So I'd say that when we tend to look at this in the early part of July, we looked at our pipelines and how that would play out in 3Q and now we're looking at the pipeline in early October here, and it bodes well for a really nice rebound in capital markets.","I should also mention that service charges in card, you know which had a nice quarter in 3Q looked to be up a bit further. And trust, I mean I think there were seeing choppy market conditions that impacted trust and investment services and I think you'll see that our expectations are that that will improve going into the fourth quarter too. So it's a couple of different levers that will all tend to have an impact into 4Q that largely offset as we said, the mortgage decline.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect, thank you. And then a broader question just on rate sensitivity. You pulled back a little bit of the asset sensitivity this quarter as well. I'm wondering if you could just comment on whether there's a sort of an end goal as to where you want the company's rate positioning to be? I mean obviously it's kind of tough given all the volatility in rates, but just what the broader long-term thinking on rate sensitivity is at this point.","John Woods","Yeah, I mean I think you've seen us pick our asset sensitivities down over the last year and I think that we've been prudent on that front. As you know, a commercial bank has a natural asset sensitive profile, and the derivatives and other techniques to frankly dampen that profile. So I think you would see us in a low-to-moderate asset sensitive position over time, maybe converging toward neutral as we see, as we get toward the end of the even cycle if you will and so I think we're getting pretty close to a stable place. ","We do like and have the view that we are at historically low long-term interest rates. We changed our sensitivity from a majority exposure to the short end of the curve. Over the last year to now the majority of that exposure is the long end of the curve. So we have a view over time that long end of the curve will arrive and we've executed our hedging activities with that in mind, and with a general sense that we should take some asset sensitivity off the table and that's just on the net interest income line. ","As you know, mortgage provides a very nice overall revenue lift then its rates declined by a lot, which is what happened in the third quarter. So it's not just our derivatives and not just our sensitivity on it, net interest income. We look at how we try to preserve revenues overall and you saw the power of that diversification in the third quarter.","Scott Siefers","Perfect! Alright, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","And next in queue we've got Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Brian Foran","Hi, good morning. I wonder if just conceptually on net interest margin once the Fed stops, you know I guess we're yet to decide when that is, but let's say it's mid 2020 the Fed stops seizing, you know there is one school of thought that the banks could actually get a little bit of a bounce back in margin because of the deposit re-pricing lag you mentioned and that will catch up. And then there is another worry that, well the assets don't all re-price immediately and you're still going to have that kind of rollover of fixed rate assets to lower rates. ","I guess as you think about it, not getting into the basis points of what the actual margin is going to be, but just conceptually, when the Fed stops, is your bias kind of a roughly stable margin for up on the deposit re-pricing or still some pressure on the asset yield rollover?","John Woods","Yeah, I mean I'd say a couple of things. I mean, I think you mentioned the deposit lag and I think that provides a tailwind. Once you get three to six months, that's helpful. ","I think it matters where loan rates are. As I mentioned earlier, if the Fed gets to the end of the dealing cycle, and we end up with a deposit yield curve, I think you could see some positive impacts in net interest margin over the, call it two, three, four, five quarters out into 2020, and so that's an important aspect. I mean, I think that front book, back book dynamic, given the fact that we are roughly split 50\/50 with a fixed loan portfolio and a floating loan portfolio, you're right, that when rates fall, we get the immediate impact on the floating part of the portfolio. But the fixed part provides that buffer. ","And if we can see some lift on the long end, you could see stabilizing to rising NIMs as you get three months to six months beyond a Fed moving cycle. So I think you'll see some stabilization here over the next quarter or two, and with those dynamics I mentioned, possibly even some luck when you get toward the end of 2020.","Bruce Van Saun","The other thing I would add also is that if we get a little more loan growth, which we expect in the fourth quarter and to be able to sustain that in 2020, that facilitates more BSO actions in terms of kind of the loan side of the balance sheet, and so hopefully that will kick in and then be accretive to our NIM as we go through 2020.","Brian Foran","Thank you. One small one and I don't want to jump into the weeds, but on page 20 of the supplement, I've had a few people ask about this negative $48 million in the provision for unfunded lending commitments. Can you just talk through, was that a lease or was it more like a transfer because a loan drove down? What drove that negative $48 million provision for unfunded lending?","John Woods","Yeah, for the question and looking at our supplement.","Brian Foran","I didn't look at it. Someone else pointed it out to me.","John Woods","So yeah, it is exactly as you mentioned. We had an unfunded loan where over time we built the reserves on the unfunded part of the reserve in the ACL if you will, but all of the provisioning reserves happened while it was unfunded and then once it is fully reserved, it's funded and then got transferred and needed to get transferred over to the [inaudible] overall, that is the law really the driver was a transfer of an unfunded fully reserved loan that...","Bruce Van Saun","Exactly it was a backup letter of credit.","John Woods","Yeah. ","Bruce Van Saun","Ultimately drew down and we moved it over.","John Woods","Yeah, I think they released them, because they moved the analysis there as well.","Brian Foran","Great! Thank you, Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure.","Operator","And we'll go to the next question in queue that will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi, good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Fees were obviously strong this quarter and you gave some pretty good granularity on your thoughts on the fourth quarter, but just looking out more medium term, can you talk about the magnitude of fee growth you think you can generate and some of the drivers. I mean obviously it's incrementally important from here given the pressures on the interest income and I'm trying to maybe quantify the growth that you expect against some of the drivers. Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I think Matt, I'll start. Of course John can pick up, but when I think about where we've been and how we've grown through time, we've pretty much been growing commercial fees probably high-single digits, keeping pace with reasonably robust loan growth over that period. And that's reflective of the investments that we've made in building out the platform, hiring some great bankers, standing up our own global markets FX and interest rate business, investments in the cash management business, acquisitions of M&A shops and I think we're really just gaining traction and reaping the benefits of those investments. So I would expect to see continued good growth on the commercial side. Q3 was a little bit of an air pocket. We think, Q4 is going to be a bounce back quarter.","On the consumer side, we've had a harder time growing. I think we addressed some of those issues. We've been investing organically and building out the sales force and coverage folks in wealth and in mortgage, but I think the acquisitions that we've done, particularly mortgage, looks very timely in light of being able to catch the refi wave. But I think there's a lot we can really do with that business. So it's really scratching the surface of its potential in terms of building out more tools for the correspondent and wholesale customers that we have. ","So I think we can grow our market share there very nicely and then get better penetration into our branch channels as we continue to add those out. So even though we came off a high with the refi wave, I think that will continue some through Q4 and early into the first half of 2020. But there is other levers to continue to, I think gain market share in the mortgage business. And then, while we now address the high end of the pyramid with thoughts of -- and we're looking frankly to do more in terms of acquisitions to further that growth on the wealth side. ","So you know if we average the commercial and then the slower growth on consumer, I think in the rearview mirror, we probably were in the mid-single digits range and certainly would think that, that's a goal we could set going forward when we think out a number of years to at least be able to continue to do that.","Matt O\u2019Connor","That was helpful. Can you just elaborate on the type of course, maybe the size of wealth deals that you'd be open to? I think you did relatively modest.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I think all of these deals we've described is bolt-ons and I think what we really need to make sure of is it has a good strategic fit that the company has a great culture that's going to mesh well with us, and that we can get attractive financial terms. And I think if you buy smaller, you can get a little better handle on all of those things. If you buy bigger, it's a little harder to achieve those three objectives. So I would think you'll still consider these deals smart, but more in the bolt-on category. So you'd probably need to do several to continue to scale up our business.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we can go to the next line in queue. It will come from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","Saul Martinez","So wanted to \u2013 I know you've addressed this to a certain degree, and I know there's a lot of volatility and then price and seasonality in this, but can you just give a little bit more color on how we should think about what a more normalized run rate is for mortgage income, assuming the long end of the curve stays where it's at. ","You had I think $80 million of production revenue which is very strong, the MSR valuation gain. As we think about that going forward, how should we think about the sort of the moving parts there and what it could trend to not only in the fourth quarter, but just beyond that?","John Woods","Yeah, thanks for the questions, it\u2019s John here. I'd say when you break that down into three P&Ls right, and we talk about production and servicing and then the MSR valuation net of the economic hedge right, so when you go across each of the three, going forward, I think you could see production being \u2013you know production P&L basically coming down a bit in the fourth quarter, but I would call it higher than where it was in the second quarter. We had a good quarter in the second quarter here, phenomenal quarter in the third quarter. ","So I think maybe coming off those high, but kind of stabilizing at higher level than what we've seen in the past in production, we're really excited about that. Very strong production, really strong margins, which is important to how we generate those revenues and just a growing integration of the Franklin platform. So that's how I see that part of the P&L.","I'd say a similar comment on the operating servicing part of the P&L, where they were having a routine with UPB that is -- that was previously being sold by this platform before we acquired it. So our servicing UPB is growing nicely, as well as the servicing fees and employees that they're recognizing on that P&L. So that P&L is stabilizing and rising and we're completing the full integration and insourcing of the servicing platform from -- Franklin was using its in-house\u2019s touch back on to bring it in-house, which will give us more control over data and direct access to the customer, so we're excited about that.","And then the last one, of course is the MSR valuation net of economic hedge. During the quarter when we see large swings in this past quarter, we were positioned to benefit if mortgage spreads were to widen out. When we get to extremes, we tend to moderate positions and assume that they will hover there over time and it did. That's something that I think you could see more of in the future. ","And we thought it will jump around a lot, but I think we've demonstrated a really solid job of managing the -- what we've got is otherwise a volatile asset for the last four quarters that we had this big platform, going into the fifth. We've managed that really well with flat to up a bias on the MSR net of economic hedge on.","Bruce Van Saun","And Brad, you might just want to add a little bit some of the innovation and the new technologies that we're delivering in the mortgage business, because I think it's quite exciting what's actually taking place.","Brad Conner","I was actually just going to do that. Just one thing I'll also chime in with John. I think you hit it spot on and one thing to keep in mind, the industry is quite full of capacity right now, and that gives us great optimism around margin maintaining for a period of time. ","So the signs are good from a margin perspective. But the point Bruce that you made, we've invested heavily in our digital capabilities in the mortgage business, and so we put a new digital front end onto our origination platform.","This past quarter along where somewhere the older applications come through, the front-end digital platform, which gives us efficiency opportunities for one, but also gives us more opportunity to build a direct-to-consumer -- the direct-to-consumer side of the business. ","We also invested in digital capabilities on the back end of the business with our digital and mobile servicing application. We're seeing a lot of our customer\u2019s transition over to using that digital platform on the back end, so a lot of good things happening other than just a rate environment. I mean I think the integration as you said has gone extremely well and we're starting to reap the rewards of investments that we made and the digital capabilities in the service slate.","Saul Martinez","That\u2019s great. Thank you, that's great color. If I could switch gears and also ask a question on reserving and on CECL specifically. I mean the day one impact is not a big deal from a capital standpoint. How do we think John about the day two impact of CECL, because a lot of your growth, if you look at the balance growth over the last year, a relatively large portion of it is coming from education, it is coming from other retail lending that tends to either have longer tenures or higher loss content than others, and obviously has a higher provisioning load as you originate those loans. How do we think about the loan loss provisioning outlook in light of that loan growth and mix shift into 2020?","John Woods","Yeah. I mean I think so we just you know kind of come out with our first real quantitative outlook for where this adopting standard will affect us in early January. So I mean I would say a couple of things, but also caveat that we have more work to do and we're continuing our parallel runs and completing all the validation of our models.","So with all of that said, I think there are two big forces that you have to think about. One is, with all of those portfolios that are longer duration, we have we have a big back book and the way -- the dynamic that we're dealing with is the fact that we're being asked to reserve over the entire life of the entire back book for those longer duration loans in early January. ","And so going forward, if our models are reasonably accurate and reflect the future, which is a big question for all banks, then really the provisioning for that entire back book is really behind us and is really already up on the balance sheet.","Saul Martinez","Yeah.","John Woods","So what your left with us is the other side of the ledger, which is the front book and the front book originations that you have to basically put through P&L, all of the reserve that will likely run. ","So I think for portfolio by portfolio, the gearing of ratios if you will, the benefit of the fact that the back book is no longer being provisioned, which would otherwise have been provisioned in an incurred loss model under the existing standards is now going to be already handled and probably closer to zero against the magnitude of the front book. ","And I think the answer with respect to whether that's positive, negative or neutral is varied by portfolio and that's going to play itself out.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, and what I would say just to add to that is that we're working through our three-year strat plan that we finished in July. So you kind of overlay portfolio by portfolio what the interplay between those dynamics that John described, back book, front book and then how does that play out from an accounting standpoint over say the next three years. ","There may be certain product twists that we're offering a longer duration version of a loan and they may not make as much sense. We might tweak something, but I would say that at the end of the day the economics are the economics and the your accounting something we have to contend with. ","So we\u2019ll get on top of it and then obviously when we do our guidance in January in the next call, we'll be able to take you through that in some more detail, but we're working at it, we're analyzing it and I think we feel broadly fine about it.","Saul Martinez","Got it, alright. That's very helpful, thank you very much.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah.","Operator","And next in the queue we will go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Bruce and John.","John Woods","Hi.","Bruce Van Saun","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Bruce, you touched on growing the fee revenue and I wanted to zero in on the capital markets business since you guys have had good success in expanding that business and I understand the second quarter if I read the press release correctly was a record level, third quarter came down a bit. ","So two questions; one, you mentioned the pipeline is very strong going into the fourth quarter. Can you compare that pipeline to prior quarters, is it higher or lower? And then second, what will it take for you guys to bring this business up to maybe a $70 million a quarter run rate? Is it hiring more people or expanding geographies, how can you grow into that level?","Bruce Van Saun","I'll let Don take that.","Don McCree","I think about \u2013 you know, I'll talk about a combination of new lines for the commercial bank activity. So we saw FX and interest rates in that commodity hedging activities for clients mostly running at incredibly strong levels for the last couple of quarters. So that was a little volatile this quarter; they hurt us on capital market side, benefited us on the interest rate and currency side, and we're seeing that continue. ","On the capital market side we generally play in the middle market and middle market leverage finance space. And what happened this quarter was that market was laid out a year-on-year and effectively the market was all closed for the last six weeks in the middle of the summer as that changed this interest rate faster. We saw a great lift in September, on the back of an opening for the bond markets and we saw high-yield activities through exponential.","So that all being said, I think that we've got the pieces in place to allow us to take advantage of the opportunities, who let themselves a really big growth area over the next quarter or two in M&A as the acquisitions begin to kick in. So we've been running a cover between core today \u2013 attacked the core in terms of M&A fees. Those should go up significantly this quarter and the pipelines look very, very strong. ","So our strategy is to get that feel on or even hire a couple of fold. One is, our new business you start high-yield selling trading activity this quarter, which should allow us to take larger positions in high-yield underwriting, plus those transactions would double or triple. So that is not the high-yield side of the business.","We've been building credibility in our loan syndication leverage financing capability over four years and we're seeing larger transactions and more transactions as we build comparable and a reputation for execution with our clients and our investor base. And we're seeing this general activity growing in the fourth quarter. Whether that continues in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, it's a little early to say, but I think there is upside on all of those key elements. ","The other thing we are trying to do is lower our buybacks. So as we said time, at the time of the IPO, we do need to \u2013 in the mid-quarter and new vertical sectors and we've got very strong corporate finance industry advisory themes. So the way we are engaging with our clients, I will report to you saying four, five years ago, it was very much around provisioning credit, and now it's about advice and that we could transition a complex financing and it's only in the last couple of years, we've had [inaudible]. ","I think as you\u2019ll have seen any time in my career and we're just in a lot of very interesting conversations with our client base. So that should give us a good momentum.","Bruce Van Saun","I would just add to that, Gerard. You know we have knocked on the door of $60 million a quarter before. I hate to put my neck on the line, but I think this fourth quarter shapes up potentially to be a record \u2013 a new record quarter for us in capital markets, so we're not that far away on that $70 million a quarter. ","I don't think we really need to hire more people or acquire another M&A boutique. To get to that kind of a level it would require I think that the markets are healthy and open over the next year, and then some of the investments that we've made, a new approach to how we cover, all of that would have to continue to progress and come to fruition. But there is not, there's is not a lot of incremental investments that we need to make in order to continue to drive higher revenues in this business.","John Woods","And further to that point Gerard, just to the question earlier about pipelines, our pipelines in early October are up across the board, whether you are looking at the combination of syndications and bond underwriting or FX, IRP and M&A in particular, they're all up since early July when we look into early October, just to close that out.","Gerard Cassidy","Great! Thank you for the color. And Bruce, since the BBT SunTrust merger, many investors and myself all thought more deals were going to be announced; obviously nothing\u2019s happened. But when you look at the BBT stock, it's outperformed the General Bank indexes. So it looks like the market is supporting that type of transaction. Is that something citizens could ever consider in the future?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I think the stock answer to that is we're going to always consider anything that benefits our shareholders, but I would say whether that deal proves to be a good one depends on the quality of the execution and so you've had \u2013 and I've been part of a big MOE, Bank in New York and Mellon. And the spreadsheets, when you announced the deals always look great and then it comes down to did you make the right personnel decisions, did you get the cultures to mesh and fundamentally execute well, so we'll see if that happens. ","I think for us right now, we're very focused on continuing to run the Bank better and we're in a period of very rapid change in terms of customer expectations, new technologies and we're very focused on being on the front foot with our TOP 6 program, some of our strategic investments. I think we can carve a path that's really exciting and fulfilling for our stakeholders by really staying focused on our own current agenda. ","One of the risks of getting involved in larger transactions is it can be distracting and take your eye off the ball in a period where you really have to be all over the current agenda. So I mean, those are few thoughts Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","No, I appreciate your candor. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","John Woods","Hi.","Erika Najarian","I just had one follow-up question. It's really what sort of what Brian Foran was asking earlier. So as I think about what's unique to Citizens as we look out over the next few quarters. You know obviously you've done a lot of work in terms of driving your business momentum upward and accelerating it and second, you do have high deposit costs. ","So as we think about beyond the fourth quarter, right, and you're still feeling good about loan growth, you are still feeling good about the economy. And based on the forward curve, should we think that the worst-case scenario for NII next year could be stable? I'm trying Ellen.","John Woods","I mean, I think \u2013 Erika, its John. I mean, I think \u2013 if you take in for January, it will be \u2013 we'll come out with relatively specific expectations for what 2020 will be on NII. But I think you have the broad contours, the direction, correct. I mean we expect -- when you think about where our loan growth has been year-over-year, in the neighborhood at that 4% range, which is a percent or two above GDP. ","So next year, we want to aspire to continue to grow the platform at levels that are similar to that or better and that for us, all of the work that we're doing on the net interest margin side of things, I mean, we did have as you know maybe some betas that we're \u2013 when we were in a tightening cycle we had some deposit costs rises that were higher, but that's starting to retrace itself here and you'll see high deposit betas rising in the fourth quarter and continuing to reflect the fact that we've done an amazing amount of work on the deposit beta.","Bruce Van Saun","Frankly, we've been outperforming now through the trust cycle on the deposit side.","John Woods","Yeah, so in the second quarter we did and then we outperformed in the third quarter we did and I think you can almost consider a trajectory there that we expect a same paper we did in the fourth quarter. They're going to have a meaningful improvement in the interest-bearing deposit cost decline. So we're excited about that. So I think the key levers will cause that kind of stabilization that you're talking about, but stay tuned. We tend to try to\u2026","Bruce Van Saun","Now, we did for January 1, a good try there. Catch you on to open up a little bit.","Erika Najarian","Yeah. I understand the timing is odd, but it just sounds like if you're relatively stable next quarter with pressure from October, not the underlying pressure from what's happened so far, so quickly, with only taking your deposit costs down the way you did, it seems like \u2013 stable seems like a potential for. Just I guess I'm not asking you to confirm that, but that's just how I was looking at that, so I appreciate the color. That wasn't actually a question. I'm going to take myself off the queue now.","Bruce Van Saun","We want to hear other questions. Do you have any questions?","Erika Najarian","Alright, thanks for that.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Sure.","Operator","And next we'll go to line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks guys, good morning. Hey, just a follow-up on the overall balance sheet. You guys have shown really good deposit growth in the money market accounts and then the non-interest bearing, and obviously we're starting to see the term deposits come down against that and Citizens Access kind of flattening out. ","Can you just talk us through just that mix and how you expect just overall balance sheet to traject from here, especially as loans look to be still growing and securities have kind of flattened out just given where that rate dynamic is? So I guess just talk about the earning asset base and the mix within and how you'd expect that to go forward. Thanks guys.","John Woods","Yeah, I mean I think \u2013 so overall you're seeing the fact that we continue to year-over-year we're growing deposits at 6% and loans a bit less than that. So you look at the LDR ratio around 94.5% in the third quarter, that's down reasonably. So were they going to do it \u2013 might have did or so about a year-and-a-half ago, a year or year-and-half ago. ","So I think the balance sheet strength is quite good, really solid liquidity position as we head into the end of the year. Deposit growth has remained I think greater than loan growth. That gives us optionality in terms of how we execute our playbook in terms of deposit pricing and that's part of how we've been able to drive deposit costs down. You saw all the good work that we've been doing in terms of generating deposits. ","On the loan side, we gave you that color about the fact that year-over-year our trends during that 4% range or so, that's something we will aspire to accomplish over time, but deposit costs will continue to fully fund loan growth, and I think that's I mean...","Bruce Van Saun","I think one piece of color I would add Ken is that we're quite pleased that we've been able to grow our demand accounts and outperform relative to peers. Brad, you might want to add some color on that, but really the focus on the mass affluent customer and some of the investments we've made in customer experience and customer journey, we're gathering them, targeting them, getting them in the door, using data analytics and then they stay and so retention is up there and that's really fueling that growth in demand accounts.","Brad Conner","Yeah, I think you've nailed it Bruce. I think we've talked quarter-on-quarter about our investment in analytics and that has given us the ability to really target the right customers, improve the value proposition, which we've done that with a focus on the mass affluent client, which has deepened our relationship with them and that we're getting them active quicker than we were in the past, and we're improving our attrition and our net promoter score are showing that there are much more satisfied customers and we really think that's what's fueling the growth in non-interest bearing deposits.","Ken Usdin","Understood, thanks for that. And one follow-up on the securities book. So the securities book, you mentioned that the premium amortization was a 3 basis point hit to the net interest margin. I'm just wondering at this point, where you able to reinvest cash flows at versus the back book, if we could try to isolate for what's happening aside from the premium then? Thank you.","John Woods","Yeah, I mean I think on the front book, back book trends here, I mean you've got reinvestments in the third quarter. I'll then call it $250 million or thereabouts and you still have a positive front book, back book and securities that run off within the neighborhood of $220 million , $223 million or so. So I think you are feeling \u2013 it's like the hint against this backdrop. We've done a reasonably good job of holding our cash and investing and deploying that cash at point during the point in the quarter where they go a little higher.","Yeah, I mean it's hard to do that all the time, but we have a couple of quarters given we've been holding our powder a bit until some of the big declines in rates moderate and then we put all the cash to work. So like I said, we still got a positive, call it 25 basis points or so of front book, back book on the securities portfolio.","Ken Usdin","And one quick one just on the premium then. If rates stay flat, does that 3 basis point headwind just go away, meaning it goes to zero as an increment if you expect, if you realize it on like a realized basis and is there any lag to the premium that we continue to roll forward just because of where rates have gone to? Thanks.","John Woods","Yeah, I think you've hit it, there's a couple of factors. I mean I think our outlook, that is going to be relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, such that the drag of 3 basis points this quarter was because there was an increase from 2Q to 3Q. Our current outlook with, outlook for rates etc. is that that will be flattish from 3Q to 4Q, so therefore no longer a rise. And then over time, you know maybe that can moderate again back to 2020, we'll get back to you on that later, but that'll be flattish from 3Q to 4Q.","Ken Usdin","Understood, thank you.","John Woods","Okay.","Operator","The next question in queue will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Thanks. As you guys get ready to implement the TOP 6 initiative, are there any thoughts, maybe that you'd be willing to delay investments or maybe accelerate some of the plan cost savings just to ensure you generate positive operating leverage going forward?","Bruce Van Saun","Well first off, we're trying to get this thing off the ground and we have a number of work streams, basically seven or eight work streams with individual leaders, and as soon as they are good to go and launch, we're already moving ahead. So we've given the green light on two of those work streams already, and we'll have more that will launch in the fourth quarter. ","Both of the TOP program is accretive right away. So we want to get those things going quickly. The places where we would be in turn reinvesting the NextGen tech is one of the big work streams. That has probably the most value of any work stream for the bank in terms of how we're running the bank and how they can deliver for customers. But it is somewhat reliant, it doesn't generate immediate savings. It requires some investment and then the savings come later. But as long as the rest of the streams are moving ahead, then our disposition is we've got to move on that; it's really, really critical.","When we announced the TOP 6 program, we also talked about some strategic investments that we were assessing and prepared to make and those include further expansion of services access, our digital bank or our point-of-sale merchant finance platform or new ways to cover small business customers and lower-middle market customers with more digital and data applied and so we're working through those. ","I think we have an ability to gauge those based on how fast the savings come through on the other streams and then also the overall macro environment next year and so we do have this commitment that we've held fast to, since the IPO of trying to deliver positive operating leverage, and that's probably the lever that we have, would be to gauge some of those investments. But our objective, our hope is that we can move on those, because I think they're really exciting and I think they really will drive medium-term revenue growth for us.","Peter Winter","Great! That's really helpful. Because I guess when I look at the medium-term profitability targets that you've laid out, obviously the rate environment is much different than when you originally gave that and so I'm assuming you're still expecting to see then continued improvement in the profitability in terms of the efficiency and ROTCE?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I mean that's the only way to really get it, is you're going to have to drive the operating leverage. One of the things to keep your eye on is, if some of these trade tensions and concerns that are holding back the economy a little bit abate, that obviously is going to be a tailwind into next year and that could also result in the long-end of the curve moving back higher. ","That's actually been a bit of a crusher when you look at ROTCE, because year-on-year growth in OCI related to the growth in the value of the securities portfolio actually has flipped 75 basis points of ROTCE. So if you had the long end new back, you can actually throw that right back on to the equation. So there's a number of factors there, but yes, commitment to operating leverage key in terms of continuing to drive forward and reach those ROTCE goals.","Peter Winter","That's great. Thanks Bruce.","Operator","And will go to our next question in queue that will come from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks, and that\u2019s a good question to follow that last question. When you look at banks, there's so many intricate details that we've spent all this time talking about, but really investing in it comes down to three different metrics. One is, return on tangible common equity, the other is dividend yield, and third is basically, how can you -- how fast can you grow tangible value. So while your ROTCE has been under pressure, one statistic that everyone then talked about was your growth and tangible book value was 14% over the last year, which is the counter of that.","So when you look at those three metrics, let's say assuming we don't have a credit event or a credit downturn, how do you see those three metrics moving forward over the next, let's call it, 12 months to 24 months given the environment that we have? Do you see progress on those metrics or where we're at right now is very positive. I think the valuation reflects some deterioration in those metrics, so just wanted to get your take on that.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah, I mean obviously the objective is to be driving the ROTCE and driving the tangible book value per share higher, and if we execute well and the environment stays okay or improves, I think we will certainly be able to do that. If we do that, the stock should reflect positively, so our dividend yield would go down, which wouldn't be a bad thing. Ultimately we are still committed to raising our payout ratio and getting to a 35% to 40% dividend payout ratio, but the yield obviously is a function of the stock price.","Marty Mosby","And then, John, I want to dive into a very \u2013 so from a big picture to a very minutia type of question. Given that what we're seeing is consumer allowances are going up precipitously on the sea-saw and commercials are going down, while that day one impact is the negative for those who have more consumer. ","What I'm trying to get at is, as we go into the day two through 200, if the consumer because it's less lumpy and the commercial is getting impacted because of how low we are in the cycle right now and their losses tend to come in in big pieces, is the consumer possibly going to be less volatile over a cycle versus commercial when you have big pieces coming in and out, having to adjust those factors when you go through those economic cycles?","John Woods","Yeah. We're still I would say developing our intuition about this new standard and how the models will work. I think there are a series of factors that impact both sides. I think just the prevailing market conditions and expectations of how you're reasonable in support of the projections will revert over time, I think that has meaningful impact on both portfolios to tell you the truth. ","It's one of the reasons I believe we've all been scratching our heads about why this standard is necessary. It is going to be very difficult to compare across institutions for a period of time, and it's going to be a lot more difficult to frankly anticipate where P&L impact will go over time.","All of that said, as you heard earlier, economics are still something that we \u2013 something that we have to keep our eye on that ball and we'll deal with the capital impact as necessary. But I don't know that I'm ready to say that one of the two portfolios is going to be less volatile. I think it's possible that either of the portfolio could contribute to significant volatility in any given period and stay tuned to the continuing disclosures that we'll do on this in January, as we finish out frankly our parallel loan and their model validations, which are happening here as we speak in the fourth quarter.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","John Woods","Sure.","Bruce Van Saun","Alright, Ellen?","Ellen Taylor","Yeah, I think -- operator?","Operator","Yep, no further questions at this time.","A - Bruce Van Saun","All rightie, very good. Well, thanks everyone for dialing in today. We always appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day!","Operator","Thank you and that does conclude the conference today.

My name is John, and I will be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks so much, John. Good morning to you all. We're really pleased to have you join us. We've got a lot of great material to cover in our presentation, which you can find at investors.citizensbank.com. First, this morning our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will walk through our results and our outlook and then we'll be happy to take questions. Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are here also to help us with that effort.","I need to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and you should review the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the expectations on page two of the presentation and our 2018 Form 10-K. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our earnings materials.","And with that, Bruce, you've got the floor.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to announce another strong quarter today. We navigated reasonably well through a dramatic change in the rate environment. Our fee businesses have really come on strong, as we've integrated well our recent acquisitions and were able to do more for our customers. And our expense discipline continues to be excellent.","We continue to find efficiencies that lead to simpler processes and better customer experiences, while also creating the wherewithal for funding new growth initiatives. We're also very focused on being good stewards of our shareholder capital, both in terms of loan growth and capital returns to shareholders. Our year-over-year loan growth was 4% with a lot going on inside that number. We are allocating capital to grow portfolios that offer good risk adjusted returns and attractive cross-sell, while extracting capital through loan sales and runoff as part of balance sheet optimization.","We are passing on commercial deals in the market where we don't like the risk, the terms or the pricing. Our deposit growth has been faster than loan growth at 7%, which has the benefit of bringing our loan-to-deposit ratio down to 94%. Citizens Access has been key to this as they reached $5.4 billion in deposits by quarter-end. This lower LDR gives us increased flexibility on funding strategy, which will be highly beneficial in the current uncertain rate environment. We recently announced a 25% increase in our buyback capacity to $1.275 billion, and today we announced a $0.04 dividend increase to $0.36 per share with dividends now up 33% from the year ago quarter.","I'm excited by the work we've done in developing a significant TOP 6 Program and also in some of the strategy work around investment opportunities to drive medium-term revenue growth. I will let John take you through the details on our slides. But to me these programs are well designed and should deliver real benefits if executed well. We want to be innovative, nimble and flexible in how we operate. We want to up our game even further in how we deliver for customers and we want to break through on some new revenue pools, all very exciting and differentiating versus peers.","Our strong first half performance with EPS up 14%, reflects our disciplined operating mindset and capability, as we had to grind out results in a tougher environment than expected coming into the year, particularly around the extreme movement in rates. I think we're well positioned for the second half with strong fees and expense discipline poised to offset rate pressure in NII and credit still in very good shape. We will continue to focus on disciplined execution. You can count on that.","So let me stop there and I'll turn it over to our CFO, John Woods.","John Woods","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with good fee income growth, strong expense discipline and consistent execution against our strategic initiatives. Let me kick off by covering important highlights of our underlying results.","On page 4, we delivered EPS growth of 9% year-on-year with PPNR up 7%. Despite a challenging rate backdrop, we delivered net interest income growth of 4% year-on-year. Loan growth was 4% and net interest margin was stable at around 3.21%. We also continued to drive momentum in fee income with 19% growth year-on-year 6% ex-acquisitions highlighted by record results in Mortgage, Wealth, Capital Markets, and card fee.","Our disciplined focus on growing the top line and controlling expenses drove positive operating leverage of around 1% to build the impact of our recent acquisitions. Commercial Banking loan growth was 7% and Consumer Banking loan growth was 3%, as we continue to find attractive areas to deploying capital and grow our customer base. Strong deposit growth was paced by continued momentum in Citizens Access. Our spot LDR improved to 94.2%, providing us with funding flexibility as we head into the back half of the year.","Overall credit quality remains excellent with a stable nonperforming loans ratio of 66 basis points and an allowance-to-loans ratio of 1.05%. We delivered underlying ROTCE of 12.9% and tangible book value per share was up 12% year-on-year and up 4% linked quarter to $30.88. We finished the quarter with a strong 10.5% CET1 ratio.","On page 6 net interest income was up 1% linked quarter as asset growth and the benefit of day count was partially offset by a four basis point decrease in NIM given rate impact. Importantly, we have taken significant steps to reposition the balance sheet profile in a lower rate environment. During the quarter, we opportunistically used hedges to reduce our asset sensitivity from 4.2% to 2.9%. We shifted the vast majority of our sensitivity from the short end to the long end of the curve with 75% of it tied to rates longer than six months and about 25% coming from the short end of the curve.","This action was the most recent step in a program that began in the third quarter of 2018 to moderate our asset sensitivity overall. This was driven in part by increasing our net receive-fixed swap position over 50% from around $9 billion in the third quarter 2018 to $14 billion in the second quarter 2019.","Moving to fees on slide 7. As I mentioned, we delivered strong execution in our fee-based businesses, highlighted by record results in Mortgage, Wealth and Capital Markets, as we continue to build out our capabilities and deepen client relationships. Noninterest income was up 8% on a linked quarter basis and up 19% year-over-year. Before the impact of acquisitions, noninterest income was up 3% linked quarter and up 6% year-over-year.","In commercial, Capital Markets fees were up 19% year-on-year and up 6% linked quarter. Despite the slower market conditions, our businesses continued to perform extremely well, paced by a record number of deals in loan syndications, which were up 73% linked quarter. FX and interest rate product revenues were relatively stable with record first quarter level, despite the backdrop of uncertainty because many clients delay hedging. On the consumer side of the house, wealth fees were up 13% linked quarter, driven by higher sales volumes and an increase in managed money balances.","Card fees were also a record for the quarter, up 8% sequentially, driven by higher purchase volumes, including seasonal benefits. In mortgage banking, we saw a nice move down in the quarter, up $19 million or 44% linked quarter, driven by an $18 million increase in production revenue, reflecting seasonally higher originations and a pickup in refi activity. Servicing revenue was broadly stable given the benefit of hedging. In addition, we continued to grow the servicing portfolio which is now over $90 billion.","Turning to page 8. Underlying noninterest expense was up 1% linked quarter reflecting strong cost discipline in the benefit of our TOP Program initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits were relatively stable as seasonal reductions in payroll taxes and 401(k) matching costs were largely offset by higher revenue-based incentives, consistent with the strong fee revenue trends in the quarter, the result is a $3million severance charge. Outside services increased 7% linked quarter on an underlying basis, reflecting our continued investments in technology as well as cost related to higher consumer loan and deposit origination volumes.","Let's move on to page 9 and discuss the balance sheet. You can see, we continued to grow in commercial with a focus on our geographic and Industry Verticals expansion strategy. In Commercial Real Estate, we are selectively seeing attractive risk-adjusted return opportunity with growth tied to high-quality projects, largely in office and multifamily.","On the retail side, we also continued to drive growth in attractive risk-adjusted return categories like education refinance and unsecured including our merchant partnerships. Overall, loans were relatively stable linked quarter and up 5% year-over-year. These results reflect the planned runoff in auto, noncore and leasing as well as some modest headwinds from greater-than-expected asset dispositions tied to our balance sheet optimization initiatives.","Loan growth was 0.4% adjusted for the impact of 1Q, 2019 and 2Q, 2019 loan sales, with commercial up 0.8% and consumer up 0.3%. Going forward, we will continue to elevate loan sales as part of our balance sheet -- evaluate loan sales as part of our balance sheet optimization initiative.","Moving to page 10. We're doing a nice job of growing deposits, which were up 2% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year with stable results in DDA. We continue to benefit from our Citizens Access digital platform which has contributed nicely to our funding diversification and the optimization of our deposit levels and costs. At the end of the quarter, we reached $5.4 billion in Citizens Access deposits.","Our total deposit costs were well controlled despite strong growth, up three basis points linked quarter, a significant improvement from the 16 basis point increase last quarter. This reflected proactive approach to deposit pricing as we have been aggressively managing our deposit costs. We reduced CD rates and money market rates in our branch footprint as well as taken down the savings and CD rates in our digital bank.","Year-over-year, our loan yields expanded 37 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and the impact of our BSO initiative. Our total cost of funds was up 33 basis points, reflecting a shift towards a more balanced mix of long-term and short-term funding and higher interest rates.","Next, let's move to page 11 and cover credit which continues to look quite good, reflecting growth in high-quality retail loans and an improved risk profile in our commercial portfolio. The net charge-off rate of 36 basis points was up modestly linked quarter from relatively low level and included a $9 million increase in commercial charge-offs. This was largely driven by a couple of idiosyncratic losses as the broader portfolio looks very good with continued improvement in risk ratings and a continued lower trend in criticized and classified loans, which were down 4% linked quarter and 19% year-over-year.","Provision for credit losses of $97 million was up from prior quarter and prior levels reflecting a higher charge-off. Our allowance-to-loans-coverage ratio remained relatively stable ending the quarter at 1.05%. The NPL coverage ratio was relatively stable at 159%, as we saw improvement in NPLs and runoff in the noncore portfolio.","On page 12, we've maintained our strong capital and liquidity position ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.5% which compares well with peers and gives us excellent financial flexibility. As you know, we recently announced a new share repurchase authorization under our 2019 capital plan of up to $1.275 billion and this represents a 25% increase over last year's authorization. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.36 a share, which reflects a 33% increase from a year ago and we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40%. Our planned glide path to reduce our CET1 ratio remains on track.","On page 13, I want to highlight a few exciting things that are happening across our bank. First, we are extremely proud to have been ranked number three of the topic 40 banks in the country for our reputation among consumers in the 2019 American Banker Reputation Institute survey. Note that, we moved up 12 positions, the largest move of any bank which is a real testament to what our colleagues do every day to help our customers reach their potential.","Next, we've launched a suite of digital tools that transform the end-to-end mortgage customer experience and help us operate more efficiently. In commercial, we are pleased to introduce accessOPTIMA, our best-in-class cash management platform that is now available to new clients. We are migrating current clients to the platform over Q2 to Q4.","Let's move on to page 14. The Tapping Our Potential or TOP programs have been instrumental in driving efficiencies that allow us to self-fund investments and continue to deliver future growth. We have executed very well on the TOP five initiatives which are expected to deliver $95 million to $105 million pretax by the end of 2019. We are now pleased to share some of the early details of our TOP six program which will consist of two parts. The first being the transformational program, which is designed to transform how we operate and deliver for customers and colleagues.","We aim to deliver a more customer-centric, efficient and agile environment by modernizing our cross-organizational operating model and IT practices by accelerating migration to the cloud, by more ambitiously utilizing data and artificial intelligence and by digitizing end-to-end processes. The second part will consist of a more traditional TOP improvement program similar to those that we have successfully executed over the last five years.","Importantly, the benefits of the program will help to mitigate the headwinds from interest rate, maintain our commitment to delivering operating leverage and improving our efficiency and ROTCE. We also expect to utilize some savings to fund the net P&L investments of up to $50 million over 2020 and 2021 for potential strategic revenue opportunity such as, significantly expanding digital strategies across the company to reach more customers, reinventing the payment experience at point of sale and launching new commercial customer digital offering. We are developing detailed plans for each and will keep you posted as we make progress. These investments should really benefit our medium-term revenue growth over 2022 to 2025 if executed well.","On page 15, we provide additional details around the focus of the TOP program, including early days financial targets. We are targeting run rate savings from the transformational program of $100 million to $125 million by year-end 2020 and savings of $200 million to $225 million by year-end 2021. The traditional program is expected to deliver $75 million to $100 million by year-end 2020 and over $100 million by the end of 2021. The combined total is $300 million to $325 million in run rate benefits by the end of 2021.","Note at the bottom of the page, the TOP six is expected to create the capacity to absorb some of the startup cost for the strategic revenue initiatives. We've some meaningful ideas, so we'll have to think the level of investing with the near-term external environment. We also point out that there will be one-time cost associated with that program though the payback is highly favorable. Note, also that we do not expect to announce a TOP seven next July because we will leave TOP six open and add to it as we go over the next two years.","Our outlook for the third quarter is on page 16 and it reflects continued disposition position for both our top and bottom line results. We expect net interest income to be broadly stable in Q3 as modest loan growth should offset the NIM contraction due to rates.","We are expecting noninterest income to be up modestly similar to the trend we saw in the third quarter last year. Given our continued focus on expenses discipline, we expect noninterest expense to be broadly stable. Additionally we expect provision expense to be the range of $100 million to $105 million.","And finally, we expect our CET1 ratio to be broadly stable. Regarding our full year outlook, notwithstanding, the meaningful change in yield curve environment, which now factors in a rate cut in July and September, we expect our full year performance will track broadly in line with our January full year guidance but there will be puts and takes with lower net interest income offset by better fee income and expense performance with provision at the low end of the guidance range.","To sum up on page 17, our results this quarter demonstrate our continuing strong performance as we execute against our strategic initiatives, grow customers and revenues, carefully manage our expense base, deploy new technologies and improve how we run the bank.","And now, let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Thank you, John. Operator why don't we open up for some Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thanks, Mr. Van Saun. And ladies and gentlemen, we're ready for the Q&A portion. [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","Matt O\u2019Connor","So the way to stop attrition, I think it's a lot bigger than most have expected and obviously it covers a couple of years or a little bit of a longer period, but it's still much bigger I think than what it's been in the past and maybe what was expected. Can you help frame, how much of that actually falls to the bottom line as opposed to like offset say core expense growth or inflationary growth? I guess the question is yeah we see these numbers, we can make the adjustments on the one-time investments, the one-time costs, how much of that actually boosts the pre-tax earnings versus helps offset some of the other dynamic such as rates as you mentioned and the core expense growth?","Bruce Van Saun","I think Matt what you've have seen historically from us as a commitment to driving positive operating leverage. And so the TOP programs do a number of things for us, they gives us that differential because they are oriented both towards finding efficiencies and helping expense line, but also finding additional revenue sources and helping the top line.","So we would expect -- that's the principle commitment we have here. We keep running the bank better, we keep serving the customers better and we have a commitment to continue to drive operating leverage, which will improve our ROTCE and efficiency ratio going forward.","It's a little hard. We're not giving next year guidance on this call. We don't give guidance till January. So until we see how the rate trajectory moves between now and the end of the year, I think it's a little premature to make the call on that.","Matt O\u2019Connor","So would it be your hope that even in a tougher prolonged rate environment that the TOP initiatives are meaningful enough to get you that positive operating leverage even with the rate headwind as we think out medium-term?","Bruce Van Saun","That would be the goal for sure, yeah.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vinings Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Good morning, thanks. I was going to ask you with the acceleration of the share repurchase, last year you frontloaded a lot of your share repurchase activities. Are you thinking -- how is the timing of this year's plan, is it going to be even or a little bit more in 2019?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, I'll start John you can go fine. Last year we did frontload a bit. We want to still have firepower in every quarter. But certainly we think that the stock is at suppressed valuations, so it's a good time to buy some more stocks. So you'll see us buying stocks in Q3 and Q4 at amounts that'll be more than you'll see in Q1 and Q2 of next year.","John Woods","Yeah, I think that covers it.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And then you've done a great job of getting these fee businesses built-out. How you see -- what have been the reasons for your success when others have had a hard time being able to do this? And then how do you see that going forward? What are still areas that you still think that you're going to be able to reap some of the benefits of what you've been investing in?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. We can -- it takes a village to answer this one. So I'll go around the table, but let me start. And I'd say on the commercial side, what we focused on is broadening our capabilities and then also expanding our coverage force, and then working as a team to bring thoughtful solutions and value-added declines. And so that's really gained a lot of traction. You can see it across the board we have more products to offer to customers, more services to offer. And I think we're doing a great job across the board in whether it's the capital markets, whether it's M&A, whether if it's FX and interest rate hedging, we're hitting record levels of fees every quarter. We're winning jump balls against the megabanks we have some really great capabilities. And I'll let Don add to that.","Then on the consumer side, it's been a long effort to try to get our mortgage business and our wealth business in particular position for growth. I think we're seeing that now. We had -- certainly Franklin had a great quarter and our underlying retail LO business had a great quarter. So I think mortgage now is better positioned than certainly it has been. There's still work to do in that business, but we feel good about the outlook.","And then also on the wealth business, we've scaled it up. We're penetrating our customer relations with I think a very good segment strategy in matching our product and offerings to the needs of the different segments that we're serving.","We did do acquisition of Clarfeld to attack the very high-end or ultra high net worth client that is being integrated very effectively. We have a lot of flow going in there. So I think across the board, we feel good about the fee outlook. We think it's sustainable. And we're passing the baton if you will in a period where there will be some pressure on NII given rates I think we can pick up the slack both with stronger free performance and continued good discipline on expense. And then I think credit is in a really good shape as well. So why don't we go around the table quickly, John anything to add?","John Woods","No. I think that covers it. I mean, I think there's a real emphasis around the organic investments coupled with the bolt-ons that we've done in wealth and mortgage have been quite powerful. And all the organic investments that have been made in the commercial side are starting to pay off.","What I'd also add is that not only do we have a diversifying effect across the fee businesses within commercial and consumer, but even within Commercial in the Cap Markets business, the things that we've done there to diversify across M&A advisory and loan syndications, where this quarter loan syndications were strong, last quarter M&A advisory and bonds were strong. So you can see that even just with in lines of business as well as across lines of business. So it's really pleasing to see that.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Don, you want to go next for Commercial?","Don McCree","Yes. Sure, I think it's been said. But I think the thing that I would emphasize is we've been on this path for 40 years. We've hired a lot of very talented people, we've added the two M&A acquisitions. And the way we're integrating the soft clients problems is really unique. And I have been in this business a very long time and I've never seen a team working together. So you couple the capabilities with very long relationships that we've had and we've got very high winning rates. You see this -- if you look at our week table results, you see it's rising virtually every week table into a very, very strong position. So I'll pick up on what John said, the thing that I like the most is the diversification, but there is one market is a little bit weak, we can sort of find it in another market and continue the momentum on the fee. So we feel good about where we are.","Bruce Van Saun","Great. And Brad lastly, but not least.","Brad Conner","Okay. I mean, I think it's similar to Don's in some ways. We've been building this capability for years now I'm talking about it. And when I look at the Wealth business certainly in the Clarfeld acquisition gives us new capability. But we've been building out our value proposition for -- we've talked a long time about -- we're heavily weighted on lenient customers in our customer base. And we rebuilt that value proposition, we believe in data and analytics to be much more personalized and targeted offers. I think that's paid the dividend. And then on the mortgage side, clearly Franklin American gives us unique capability. But we'd also been building digital capabilities. And I think we're getting to the point where our digital capabilities are like they were some of the best-in-class in the industry. Franklin American gave us much better diversification the origination channel. So I think just a lot of building the right pieces over time has gotten us to a good place.","Marty Mosby","Okay. Thank you.","Bruce Van Saun","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Brad Conner","Hi.","Bruce Van Saun","Hi.","Erika Najarian","Could I just ask and help with get -- having a clarification with how we should think about net interest margin behavior under the scenario of July and September rate cut? And also if we could get a little bit of color on how you're thinking about deposit strategy in terms of pricing as we face potential easing environment?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Let me start quick John and then -- so Erika, I think we feel quite good about how we were kind of anticipating what was happening in the market. We geared up with our TOP programs have start looking at expenses. But then also, we got right on the deposits pricing and we're very proactive in cutting deposit prices and optimizing across our different channels in the quarter. So I think of all the folks we've reported all the banks reported up to now, I think we have the lowest increase in interest rate deposit costs at three basis points of anyone who's reported.","So that feels quite good. I think the four basis point of contraction in NIM was also -- shows up very well versus peers and I think it's really reflective on the emphasis we had on the deposit side. I think going forward, we'll -- our guidance contemplates that there'll be two cuts and so we'll have to move through getting through this NIM contraction period, which we'll probably see some of the more that in Q3, but then I think will start to be stable and level out after that. John, you want to offer some more color?","John Woods","Yes. I think it's right. I mean, stabilization as you get towards the end of the year. I think the dynamic that we're seeing is a couple of folds. I mean, you have to deal with -- when we started on this whole tightening cycle and we saw deposit betas start out low and begin to build over time, the end period betas getting biased as you got into the end of last year. And I think it's our view that you'll see the -- a similar profile in reverse, where as you see the rate cuts come through, the benefit will start off a bit low as the deposit lag dissipates over time. And then, you'll see the deposit betas grow in sync and grow over time. If in fact, the easing cycle extends beyond just in insurance cut or two. So that's an important issue.","We also talked about pricing outside of just how your models work? How do you ahead of pricing? I think that we got ahead of somethings throughout the last several months of late first quarter into second quarter. In footprint, we were relatively early in sort of revising our commercial rates and revising our direct-mail campaigns. And then you see more -- even more visibly you see in sort of in Access platform where late first quarter, early second we came -- we pulled back on marketing and reduced our CD yields earlier in the quarter and then with these savings yields here in early July.","So I think all those actions that started late 1Q and into 2Q sort of showed up in what you heard from Bruce in terms of interest-bearing deposit costs being up only three basis points. I think more broadly, maybe just to even take a further step back and think about what's going on with NIM overall outside of deposits, we also, as you heard in my remarks, embarked upon a program in the third quarter of 2018 to significantly increase our net receive-fixed swap position. And we increased that by over 50% from around $9 billion to around $14 billion on a net basis, just dollar cost averaging over time.","And then we added to that position every quarter in the last three quarters. And that plus some other actions we took to shift out our exposure to asset sensitivity to the long end of the curve. So that now when the Fed does cut on the short end, we're actually more exposed to the long end of the curve than we are the short end of the curve for the first time in many, many years, which we think is a smart way to position as we head into these next two cuts.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And a follow-up to that is there -- there is a thesis that for bank that have accelerated their deposit cost on the way up like Citizens. There's a thesis that the net interest margin under the scenario of the forward curve, which includes three or four rate cuts between now and the end of 2020 that the net interest margin could bottom this year and potentially stabilize, if not increase on a quarterly basis in 2020, as deposit cost repricing becomes more robust. And I'm wondering, is that too optimistic of a thought process for 2020, just based on the mechanics that you have walked us through? Or is that possible for Citizens?","John Woods","Yes. I mean, I think if you heard earlier, we're going to hold off on 2020 guidance here. I mean, I think that as you stay within 2019 you heard earlier from Bruce, which is right that as you get into the end of the year, there's some stabilization that we expect to see in NIM, as that deposit lag from the last hike in December dissipates. And as the pricing liability really burns off, you'll see that the dynamic happen. And therefore, we do expect deposit beta -- the deposit beta for the second cut to be higher than the first, meaningfully higher and we'll see how that all plays out and what the rate environment looks like and how we're also building the competition for deposits are and how we're growing the balance sheet. All of those dynamics play into the overall NIM outlook.","And as you heard from us earlier we're looking to keep NII broadly stable into the third quarter as we're playing off loan growth against our net interest margin profile. So, I think that's how we--","Bruce Van Saun","I guess Erika to your point I'll just add that while that might create some relative performance benefits, we're still asset sensitive. So, I think we're better off if we just see a couple of cuts here and then the Fed kind of creates the stimulus to keep the expansion going and then they stop. That would be I think a preferable scenario from our standpoint.","Erika Najarian","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Good morning.","Peter Winter","You guys mentioned the outlook for the third quarter modest loan growth in the third quarter. I'm just wondering could you talk about the loan pipelines and overall customer sentiment right now.","John Woods","I'll just off and I think others will jump in. I mean I think that -- I think our pipelines are quite good. When you look at where you see them in July I'd basically call them strong and building. And I'd say that even when you look out into the third quarter on the commercial side I think we see nice growth and we're getting our expanding geographies and in our industry verticals.","On the consumer side of things we like the profile of education refi mortgage and unsecured. You we have to keep in mind we do still have an auto runoff and there is the industry dynamics of home equity runoff that you've got to keep in mind. So, that's maybe more flattish. But Commercial is looks good. It's particularly in a spot basis as you get into the third quarter.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I guess I would add to that that I think we're still confident in our outlook that we'll hit the loan guidance for the year. I think in the kind of second quarter and third quarter we'll focus really on managing through the transition in rates and getting deposit cost right and getting NIM right.","So, we've stepped up our BSO actions and we're doing a bit more trimming of loan portfolios during this quarter. We sold about $500 million of mortgages and on the last day of the first quarter we sold about $200 million of corporate loans. So, those are going to affect our averages kind of in the middle part of the year.","But as John said you see the pipeline's strong. And so I think we'll see a pickup particularly later in Q4 that will leave us well positioned to hit the loan growth targets we've set out for the year.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then just within loans could I ask about other retail? I've noticed that the growth rate has slowed and loan yields have come down quite a bit.","John Woods","Yes. I mean I think there's a mix shift in that in that there's a few components of that within other retail. You've got a variety of things going on. You've got the card business in there and that card business is target three-month LIBOR and three-month LIBORs come down.","There's also some other things that when we're in unsecured space that that would affect that in our Merchant Finance partnerships that would have an impact on that. So, yes, I think it's more mix than anything else and I wouldn't say that that's where we are...","Bruce Van Saun","The structure of how some of those partnerships work can be different based on the sharing agreements we have with the sponsors. And so that can also cause different OpEx. But there's no real pressures there. There's no real maybe there's a little tightening of risk appetite but nothing that dramatic.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thanks very much.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure.","Operator","Our next person is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning guys. Just talking about how the letter math came through in terms of your capital return ask and then to your points about where the shares have been can you talk to us about any changes in your view about that CET1 expected production and the pace of which and might you think differently in the future about just balancing RWA growth versus getting back more to shareholders via the buyback?","John Woods","Yes. I'll go ahead and start off. This is John. I mean I think the pace of our glide path is still untapped. I mean I do -- we do have the a little on track and have an expectation of getting to our 10.2% number at this point. And so it goes back to our -- a lot earlier from our expectations for the year that we talked about earlier.","And I do think that there's not a lot has changed on that front. I mean we still find good value in terms of the buyback as you heard from Bruce earlier just in terms of how that works. The -- and that gives us significant financial flexibility to support the investments we want to make in RWA growth as well as from time to time you've seen us do some bolt-on acquisitions. And so that allows us to keep all of that. That flexibility is nice to have as we get into 2020.","And you've also seen us be able to increase our return in the form of dividends as we're getting that back into 35% to 40% arena. Eventually as we get near our target, that will moderate and it'll get back into dividend return and supporting RWA with a decline in buyback eventually as you get closer to your target. But for this year, our trends are intact.","Bruce Van Saun","And I would just reiterate Ken as I've said in the past that our risk profile certainly at median or better in terms of more conservative in my view. So, there's no reason longer term that we need to have a capital position that's above the median in the peer group. Obviously, we'll take those decisions as we go in due course but just worth pointing that out once again.","So, I think we have flexibility to keep moving lower. I think it's been as John said really great to have a little bit of cushion there that we can kind of have our cake and eat it too. We can have good loan growth. We can do these bolt-on deals. We can give very nice payback to shareholders and capital returns. And so we still have a bit of room to run on that.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And a follow-up it's just how are you thinking about containing to remix in terms of the preferred stock which you're been doing over the last year? Still have some more room to do with rates where they are and we think that it's pretty advantageous to get more of that done. But just your thoughts on that would be great. Thanks.","John Woods","Yes. I mean I think that we're below peers in terms of our -- that bucket the 81 bucket as you know. And we've been serving that up a bit over time. I mean we could see something like that in the future. It's something we could if we take a look at.","And I think it's served us well to do it over time. I mean as we would've sold the entire bucket six months ago we would we might have gotten all of that off at a level that would not be quite as favorable as something we might do over -- in the near future.","So, yes, I mean you may see something like that in the future, but we keep an eye on that. And look at that, similar to our CET1 overall we look at that as a glide path over time.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. And there Ken, the caliber is on where \u2013 what's our return on equity and then what's the cost of the preferred stock. And so there are opportunities now to get that arbitrage now that we've got the ROE higher. We couldn't do it early days during the turnaround phase, but now we have the capacity to do that and substitute preferred stock for a further buyback. So certainly something that's on the radar that we need to look at.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","And the next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bruce Van Saun","Good morning.","John Pancari","On the \u2013 just want to get a little bit more clarity on the net interest income guidance or the \u2013 you reaffirmed your full year guidance. So, if you're now looking for two cuts, two Fed cuts by the end of the year but you're reaffirming your 5% to 6.5% guidance and you look for stable third quarter NII. Does that imply that you could be at the low end of that 5% to 6.5% full year 2019 NII guide?","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. John I think you might have misheard what we said. So, let me just clarify. So we broadly reaffirmed the full year guidance overall. So we feel that the guidance we gave back in January in terms of where net income and EPS would be which we still feel confident that we'll hit that which is good. And then we said that the kind of \u2013 there'll be puts and takes to deliver that. And so when we go through the major income statement categories, we'd be a bit to the left side of the goalpost, but still positive on net interest income. We would be to the right side of goalpost and outperforming on fees. We'd be to the left side of the goalpost on expenses and outperforming on expenses. And we'd be near the bottom of the goalpost on credit. So everything lines up very well. The good news is that, we found offsets to the unanticipated impacts from rates on NIM. So we called out that our loan volumes will likely be where they thought they'd be. The one kind of missing link in the equation is that NIM is going to be lower than on going in assumption when we started the year, and \u2013 but we'll make up for that in other ways.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. That's helpful Bruce. And then, separately on the efficiency outlook. I know, you had previously indicated a medium-term efficiency target of about 54%. How are you feeling about that now given the backdrop? Thanks.","Bruce Van Saun","I still think we're going to get there. So one of the advantages of this TOP 6 program is going to help drive the efficiency ratio improvement that we need to get our returns on without a tailwind from rates, or even just stable rates which we've actually moved to a declining in rates. It might take a little longer to get there, but we're still committed to hitting those targets.","John Pancari","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. John, you mentioned that you have less exposure now from the repositioning of the balance sheet to the short end of the curve and there's more asset sensitivity tied to the longer end of the curve. Can you share with us, if the long end of the curve goes up to two and three quarters percent by the spring of next year or at the end of this year, what kind of benefit would you see from that? And vice versa, if when they cut rates if the whole shift in yield curve comes down what would that do to your outlook?","John Woods","Yeah. So I'll just maybe take it at the overall level and you can break it down short and long. I mean, overall in the instance of call it a 25 basis point across the curve decline shift down parallel shift down, you would see something in the neighborhood a model call it $60-ish million impact on a full year. Quarterly that's about $15 million either on modeled outcomes, and you'd have to \u2013 a lot of outside-of-model things that would have an impact on that. But that's about what you would see it's about $15 million a quarter which is in the neighborhood of four basis points.","But that said, we almost never see those yield \u2013 history of parallel yields it shifts down. If the shift down is on the short end we have a much lower exposure, which is what we're expecting, right? We're expecting short-end cuts of it of one or two this year. I mean, we've modeled two. But in that case within that, and given quarter it's now just a couple of single digit millions of net interest income exposure, which is what the impact of shifting exposure of the curve is really done. So now we're right around 25% of that $15 million, it's sensitized into the short-end of the curve falling. So \u2013 and it's not exactly symmetrical, but directionally symmetrical on the up. Nothing is expecting that anytime soon, but that's how it was done.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just to confirm when you were saying the 25 basis point parallel shift and I agree with you we really don't see that. When you mentioned $15 million a quarter that's down correct?","John Woods","That's down yeah. So \u2013 ","Gerard Cassidy","Yeah. Okay, okay.","John Woods","Yeah. And I think that \u2013 and as a result, I mean, really what we've positioned ourselves to do here is that in a yield curve shape that there's a more upward sloping that's where we've positioned ourselves to benefit more today than we would have call it a year ago. A year ago all of our benefit is really \u2013 for most of our benefits it's focused on rates rising on the short end. About 70% or 75% of our sensitivity on the up was tied to the Fed raising rates. And so as we mentioned earlier in the third quarter of last year, we started to bring the overall level down. And in the early part of this year, we shifted all of the \u2013 most of the sensitivity out to the long end, so that \u2013 because of just kind of positioning for the end of the rising cycle, and frankly feeling like over time call it over the next year or so, or even into two years, we would expect the yield curve to steepen, and we think that's a appropriate way to position the balance sheet today versus where we were a year ago.","Bruce Van Saun","And just \u2013 Gerard, I just wanted to make sure you've heard that it's not $15 million in a quarter there is a \u2013 the next move down because of this positioning with the hedges, it was $4 million\u2026","John Woods","Correct.","Bruce Van Saun","\u2026rather than $15 million. So we've got out of ahead of it and we thought \u2013 I think and bought some insurance for the most of them.","John Woods","Exactly. And that's fallen by a-third. A year ago that we have been call it $12 million on a one move down and now it's $4 million. So we've cut by third our exposure to the Fed lowering rates which turned out to be a good way to sail into the second half of 2019.","Gerard Cassidy","Very helpful. And maybe, Don can answer this one. You guys touched on the new cash management treasury management products on the Commercial side, and I think you called it accessOPTIMA. Can you share with us \u2013 and you're gravitating existing customers into that product.","Can you share with us how challenging is it for a -- to get a new customer into this type of product treasury management, when they're already with a bank and have all their lines tied to that existing bank. So when you win a new customer is it easy or is it difficult to get them in on the treasury management side?","Don McCree","It's difficult, but it will get easier. So the more sophisticated a customer, the tougher it is to transition a big cash management portfolio. But as we're expanding our middle market and doing more of smaller-sized deals, it generally comes with the banking relationship. So if we add a new client, there's a good chance that we're going to get the -- keep the cash business along with that.","The tough thing has been our -- for our portal which was called the accessMONEY Manager, it was very substandard. So we didn't have an incredible market offering, which, with accessOPTIMA, we're as good as anybody else. And the early feedback from clients that we're migrating and we've migrated about 1,200 already, is very strong on the platform.","It's a platform which has got an underlying technology for the topical bottom line on it. So we will upgrade the platform constantly as they upgrade their technology. So we'll stay in sync with the rest of the industry. So it works on a number of different levels. And one of the things that shouldn't be lost on people is, the core cash business is just part of the cash management offering.","So if you look at our card business, which has been sailing over the last few years, it's growing at 20%, 25% a year, to your question, Gerard, that's an easier sale because for a lot of companies they don't have a card program already. So it's not a technology transfer, it's an additional newer way to integrate to pay those businesses.","And we've been doing quite well on that side. And that's been driving our, kind of, 2% to 3% growth in the overall cash management business. So we think that increases and we think OPTIMA helps. But it is difficult to transition a big cash management client.","Gerard Cassidy","Got it. And the 1,200 customers that you've already migrated, what percentage of that -- of your commercial book is that about?","Don McCree","That includes business banking, so it's probably about 15% of the overall client base.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. We're going to do it four waves between now and Thanksgiving, to get everybody else to the new platform, that's the plan.","Don McCree","It's a test and learn as we translate. So we'll fix it above as we go along. So it's been very little so far, but we certainly don't want to do a massive migration and have something that comes out of the woodwork. So this has been very well tested. We've been piloting it actually for six months already with some core clients sitting in our advisory board. So we're very confident in the quality we offer.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Hey, good morning. With the transformational part of the TOP program how is what you guys are doing with new cloud, AI, digital different from what you've already been doing on the tech side previously? And also, different from what other banks are also doing on the tech front?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I think there's really two elements to kind of the tech ecosystem in TOP 6. One is really around infrastructure and having the kind of back office infrastructure migrate to something that's cloud based. We've had some progress on that to date, but we're really going to accelerate that over the next couple of years.","The second big element is how we design and develop applications. And that's really migrating to an Agile approach with a bunch of teams that work across the business just add functions and technology to get to market faster with more nimble and flexible approach. We probably have 50 pods, as they're referred to in the trade, up in our Agile environment today. We're going to quadruple that over the next couple of years. So it's quite a significant change in terms of how we support and rollout new technologies.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Helpful. And then, in terms of the balance sheet optimization program, at this point, I know it's been going on for several years now, given where we are in the rate cycle, is the balance sheet optimization still having a meaningful or even a noticeable impact on kind of remixing and higher-yielding assets? Or at this point, is it more just a factor of your existing loan portfolio and the outlook for rates?","John Woods","Yes. It's still -- this is John, it's still a pretty -- a very big part of what we're doing here. And there's a lot of room left to run in that program. Where if you look at the asset side of the balance sheet or deposits, we are not where we would expect to be in the next couple of years. We have a target balance sheet expectation where the balance sheet optimization will continue to contribute over the medium term.","You'll see on the asset side of things across asset classes, we're still repositioning auto as an example in asset finance. Within asset classes, we continue to rotate and recycle capital and get better and better at where we allocate that scarce resource of liquidity and capital. So there's a lot left to go down on the asset side.","On the deposit side of things, there's also a lot of exciting things happening there. When we look at DDA as a percentage of total deposits, we're still below peers. And I think that that percentage doesn't fully reflect all the organic investments that have been getting made in Brad and Don's areas that have started to show up actually.","If you look at the last year, I think, we've outperformed DDA across the board in terms of percentage growth. And so, there's a lot more left to go there that we think is a big part of what we're doing as well as diversifying, call it, in the Commercial space in terms of our deposit sources.","So that program is alive and well, lots left to go. And in the current quarter, whether you look at it quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year, there's a positive contribution from BSO that's allowing us to -- that's a tailwind that is one of the things that we count on to help us in our NIM performance as we sail onto the headwinds of the rate environment.","Ken Zerbe","And is it possible to quantify some of the impacts? Meaning, if you just assumed a static balance sheet, but then you apply sort of the remix of where you are versus where you want to be, like, can you quantify the impact?","John Woods","Yes. And there are -- I mean, yes, I think, quarter-over-quarter our estimates are -- we're in kind of the mid-single digits of positive benefit in the second quarter of 2019 compared to second quarter of 2018. It's best to look at year-over-year, because there's a fair bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter. And that's right in line with what we try to do for any given year. It's right around that call it 4, 5 basis points and we did get that.","And I'm really -- its part of the story, it's not the entire story, but its part of the story when we look at our NIM performance this quarter being down 4 basis points compared with peers. You've got to give some of the credit to our BSO programs which are -- which we spent similar amount of time on compared with TOP. I mean, we do that on a very disciplined basis month-to-month, working with our entire businesses and it's continuing to pay dividends.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Thank you. ","Operator","And next we'll go to Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning guys. Couple of questions on my end. First on -- I just want to make sure I understand the NII guide for 3Q, because you've highlighted, I mean, the $20 million $15 million a quarter on a 25 basis points cut with only 25% being at the short end, so it's $4 million. And just assuming a July cut, you're only getting two months of that. So the impact seemingly of a July cut is pretty negligible on NII. If that's the case why are we assuming NII stable and not growing? Is the long end of the curve? On average it's going to be lower? It just -- it seems like this rate cut is not really going to impact 3Q I would think you would see NII growth if that were the case.","John Woods ","Yeah. There's a couple of things that are going on. You've got a -- certainly the impact of LIBOR is built into all of these. But you've got a 20 -- you've got an expectation of LIBOR being down around 25 basis points or so. But I mean, you've got these models' results, there's two things to keep in mind. And you've got the deposit lag that continues to have an impact, and as I mentioned earlier, the first cut that occurs in a easing cycle will have a lower deposit beta than let's say the next cut. And the numbers I was quoting to you earlier are averages over a year.","So in the first quarter of any kind of any reversal of direction on rates still have a lower benefit on deposit betas coming down, than you'll have eventually after the full effects of that cut burn in in future quarters. So that's the -- really the main issue is really how about the deposit lag flows in.","I'd say that you also have to keep in mind our front book, back book, which has been a tailwind for us and remains a tailwind back, but the magnitude and strength of that tailwind has come down a fair bit based upon where long rates are. And so when you look at long rates being down 25 basis points, 30 basis points in the quarter and continuing to the full impact of that has to be offset as well.","So I think three quarter could be seen as maybe a transitional quarter as we get through. What's going on with that first cut, which immediately impacts us on the asset side, there's 100% beta on all our floating assets that happens right out of the gate. But the deposit beta, our deposit betas are less than that and deposit lag in front book, back book. And all of that tends to really stabilize itself as you get into the fourth quarter.","Saul Martinez","That's helpful. And on that latter point on the asset beta, how do we -- you obviously, you've increased your fixed rate received positions over the last year and you've had balance sheet optimization. How do we think about loan yield betas, commercial loan yield betas, retail loan yield betas with a 25 basis point cut? Because even this quarter I think you've actually a basis point of yield expansion on Commercial even with LIBOR coming in. How much of that actually goes through given all the mixing, the hedging, how much of it actually goes -- will go through into your loan yield?","John Woods","Yeah. Maybe just top of the house, if you're good to talk about the fact that we are generally 50-50 in the loan portfolio, after you consider swaps, we're generally 50% floating, 50% fixed. And that was true in the first quarter, but after continuing our program of adding receive-fixed swaps, we're a little lower on that front. So you could basically say that our loan portfolio is down from 50% floating post-swap to 45% or so post-swap.","So therefore our -- back to the point that we're indicating, our overall asset sensitivity is falling in part due to the fact that our loan betas will likely be a little lower at a margin due to the hedging that we've done. And also due to even more importantly all the hedging impacts by shifting all of it out the curve.","So we've been positioning and all of that will flow through in loans and deposits. We've been positioning for exactly this kind of environment where the long end up is a more likely expectation of the tailwind that over time, over the next several years than counting on the short end to be up meaningfully, and I think we're very pleased with how we've positioned that. So that -- hopefully that helps.","Saul Martinez","Yeah. I'm sorry just one, you said 45% loan or interest-earning asset is floating?","John Woods","45% of the entire loan portfolio is tends to be sort of floating post the impact of swaps.","Saul Martinez","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.","John Woods","Versus 50% last quarter, and it was a little higher the quarter before because we've been adding\u2026","Bruce Van Saun","A year ago.","John Woods","\u2026because we've been adding the receive-fixed swaps over the last three quarters.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah.","Saul Martinez","Okay. All right. No, that's clear. Thank you.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Lana Chan","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on that last point on the swaps. Could you give us any details around the $14 billion of swaps the terms, the rates? And if any of them are forward starting?","John Woods","Yeah. And none of them are forward starting. I mean, the terms are basically -- our receive-fixed swap position is on a growth basis is around $20 billion. The reason I kept saying that is because that's offset by about $5 billion or $6 billion of pay-fixed swaps that we executed that are important to know. That's how we shifted our sensitivity out the curve as we executed some pay-fixed swaps at around 1.70% or so at the five-year mark, which cost -- which basically indicated that our sensitivity is now out of curve.","The growth of $20 billion on receives are basically in the neighborhood of two years of remaining maturity. And that's basically protecting against a potential easing cycle over the next call it two years, which is where those receive-fixed swaps protect. And then we're leasing that sensitivity, as you get out further in over the medium-term, where we think that it's more than likely that that will cover any easing cycles that might flow through.","Lana Chan","Okay. And sorry, the average receive rate is what on those swaps?","John Woods","It's probably closer to 2%, it's in the like call it 1.85% to 2% range. And we've been talking about averaging in over the last three quarters, so it's around that average.","Lana Chan","Okay. Thanks John.","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. ","Operator","And with\u2026","Bruce Van Saun","Yeah. It's all the questions?","Operator","Yeah. I'll turn over to you Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay.

My name is Kerry and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. Now I will turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks, Kerry. Good morning to you all. Thanks so much for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I know it's a really busy day, so just briefly our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and our CFO Eric Aboaf are going to provide some opening remarks and then we will open the call up for questions. Of course, also in the room with us today are Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, who is our Head of our Commercial Banking segment. I would like to remind you that in addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation and financial supplement and those materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com.","Of course, our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and we provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K which was filed this morning. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings release material.","And with that, I will hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks, Ellen and good morning, everyone. Thanks for dialing in today. We feel very good about the results that we announced today. We're executing our plan well and the financial results continue to show steady and notable progress, particularly given the environment. We delivered a completely clean $0.46 quarter with 15% year-on-year EPS growth, positive operating leverage of over 3% and a 70-basis-point improvement in ROTCE versus adjusted 2015. Our revenue growth of 7% was paced by loan growth of 7%.","Our NIM was relatively stable as are our credit costs. We continue to be very disciplined on expenses. We're delivering on efficiency initiatives that allow us to self-fund growth investments, particularly in our fee-based businesses. I call out the outline of our TOP III program in today's materials. Recall that our TOP programs. TOP means tapping our TOP programs derive from our mindset of continuous improvement. This program should deliver approximately $100 million in benefits next year which is similar to TOP II's impact on 2016. It is also worth commenting on the successful execution of our TDR sale which was announced earlier this week.","We expect a gain of approximately $70 million, a portion of which will be utilized to cover restructuring costs associated with TOP III. We were pleased that we came through the CCAR process well this year and we will pursue both strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital as we continue to normalize our CET1 and total capital ratios. Our colleagues are putting customers first and are doing a great job in executing our plans. I would like to recognize them for their excellent effort that continues to propel us forward.","With that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the details of the quarter.","Eric Aboaf","Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We delivered strong operating leverage, controlling costs through our expense initiatives and improving efficiency. Earnings were up nicely, both linked quarter and year-over-year along with our returns. Let's take a closer look at the details in our second quarter earnings presentation. On page 4, we provide our GAAP results which include net income of $243 million and EPS of $0.46 per share. Up 5% sequentially and $0.11 year-over-year, those second quarter 2015 results included $40 million of restructuring charges and special expense items. ","On page 5, you will find the highlights of our adjusted results. Our net income came in at $243 million, up 9% linked quarter on revenue growth of 4%, with increases in both NII and non-interest income. We grew fees 8% percent on a linked quarter basis driven by strong growth in capital markets and good volumes in mortgage banking and higher service charges. Expenses were up 2% reflecting higher operating expenses, as well as higher salaries and employee benefits. Provision for credit losses remained relatively stable as lower net charge-offs were more than offset by reserve build tied to loan growth. So on a linked quarter basis, EPS increased $0.05 or 12%. ","Compared to adjusted second quarter 2015 results, net income increased $28 million or 13% and earnings per share was up 15%. We grew revenue by $78 million or 7% with a 10% increase in net interest income as we grew loans 7%, improved loan yields and mix and held deposit costs stable. Non-interest income decreased $5 million from the second quarter of 2015 which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs now reflected as a contra-revenue item. Excluding this impact, non-interest income was up $2 million or 1% year-over-year.","Non-interest expense was up $26 million or 3% driven by salaries and employee benefits expense and a change in timing of our merit and bonus payments. On the credit side, our provision was up $13 million on a modest reserve build tied to loan growth. In second quarter 2016, we continued to make demonstrable progress against our goals enhancing our efficiencies while reinvesting in the franchise.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 65% improved 1% on a linked quarter basis and improved 2% relative to a year ago, as we saw the continuing benefits of TOP II. Additionally, we reduced our share count by 2%, positively impacting EPS. And finally, as of June 30, 2016, our tangible book value per share totaled $25.72, a 2% improvement on a linked quarter basis.","Let's move on to net interest income on page 6. We grew NII $19 million or 2% linked quarter as we continued to generate loan growth with improving yields and portfolio mix while holding deposit costs flat. This underlying momentum was offset by pressure from the long end of the curve that played out in higher premium amortization and continued lower reinvestment opportunities in the securities portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $83 million or 10% and the NIM expanded 12 basis points.","Now on page 7, our net interest margin which was down 2 basis points linked quarter, reflects higher loan yields and a better mix which were more than offset by the impact on our securities portfolio of a reduction in long term interest rates and higher borrowing costs associated with the issuance of senior debt. We continued to exercise good discipline with deposit costs which were flat for the quarter. Year-over-year, our NIM expanded 12 basis points reflecting improving retail and commercial loan yields and portfolio mix, along with the impact of the December Fed rate rise. We're pleased with the positive results of our loan pricing and mix initiatives and our taxable actions to hold deposit costs flat. Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 6.8% in a gradual rise scenario, relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2016.","Next up let's take a closer look at our non-interest income. We grew non-interest income $25 million or 8% from the first quarter with strength in nearly every category. We saw volume growth in service charges and fees [indiscernible] seasonally lower levels in the first quarter and also benefited from improved pricing. Card fees and investment services fees were up slightly, while mortgage banking fees increased $7 million as we improved our origination volume 42% with higher loan sale volumes and spread.","Capital market fees improved $13 million reflecting the continued broadening of our capabilities in cross-sell, as well as a strong increase in deal volume from lower first quarter 2016 levels. Securities gains were modest and down $5 million. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income declined $5 million or 1% from the second quarter of 2015 levels which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs as a contra revenue item. Excluding this item, underlying non-interest income was up $2 million or 1%. We drove improved pricing and volumes in service charges and fees which increased $11 million with improvement in both consumer and commercial. In wealth, we continued to add to our advisor head count which will propel higher revenues going forward, notwithstanding a shift to more fee-based product sales.","Mortgage banking fees decreased $5 million as the benefit of higher application volume and sale volume and spread was more than offset by reduction in the prior-year MSR valuation increase. Capital markets fees increased $5 million reflecting a record quarter and a continued broadening of our capabilities.","Turning to expenses on slide 9, we continue to manage our costs effectively while also redeploying cost saves prudently to invest in products, infrastructure and talent to support the long term growth of the franchise. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $16 million or 2%. Salaries and employee benefits were up $7 million linked quarter and $27 million year-over-year largely related to a change in the timing of merit increases and incentive payments which were paid in the first quarter last year. This led to higher payroll taxes and 401(a) matching contributions this quarter than we had last year.","Other expense was up $13 million from first quarter as we experienced higher regulatory fraud in insurance costs. Otherwise, we continue to make progress in controlling costs. You can see that headcount was down by 74 linked quarter and also down year-over-year. We continue to take actions to redeploy expense dollars out of less productive uses into areas that will drive future top line and bottom line benefits. If we look at our balance sheet on page 10, year-over-year average earning assets were up $6.3 billion or 5%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth and 5% retail loan growth. Average deposits increased $5.4 billion or 6% with strength in low cost core deposits.","Let's move to page 11 where Consumer Banking continues to make good progress in growing the loan portfolio while shifting the portfolio mix with more attractive opportunities. Loan growth was 7% year-over-year driven by student lending, particularly our refinancing product and mortgage lending. Consumer loan yields increased 4 basis points reflecting continued improvement in mix.","Next on slide 12, Commercial Banking delivered another strong showing. Commercial loans increased 5% linked quarter and 11% year-over-year with continued momentum in the more attractive return areas. On a year-over-year basis, we continued to generate growth across our targeted areas, corporate and industry verticals, commercial real estate, franchise finance and corporate finance. Commercial loan yields increased 5 basis points linked quarter and 24 basis points year-over-year which reflected higher rates, pricing discipline and improved mix.","Let's take a quick look at the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs on slide 13. This quarter continued to see the benefit from the strategies and tactics to fund continued loan growth in a more cost effective manner. Our focus in growing low cost core deposits helped drive a $1.7 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits, up 2% linked quarter with particular strength in checking. We held our deposit costs stable for a third consecutive quarter reflecting continued disciplined pricing strategies and tactics in Consumer Banking. We also continue to replace our wholesale funding mix to align more closely with peers and are reducing our reliance on short term borrowing and issuing senior debt.","Next let's cover credit. On slide 14, we saw broad-based improvement in our commercial and retail portfolios. Linked quarter NPLs were down $35 million, reflecting a $23 million improvement in Commercial largely tied to the oil and gas portfolio and a $12 million decrease in retail. Correspondingly, net charge-offs were down $18 million or 8 basis points to 25 basis points in loans. Provision expense in the quarter was relatively stable at $90 million as we built reserves by $25 million, largely tied to the continued loan growth. The allowance to loans ratio of 1.2% was stable with the prior quarter and our allowance NPL coverage increased to 119%. Overall, we're pleased with the continued favorable trend in our credit metrics and we expect credit costs to remain favorable this year.","On slide 15, you can see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. We had significant progress in our capital management this quarter as we received a non-objection to our capital plan which include strong loan growth, $690 million of share repurchases over the next four quarters and an ability to increase our dividend by 17% next year. We're very pleased with the results as it will enhance our returns to shareholders.","On slide 16, we have laid our key initiatives that support the balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan. As you know, we have augmented the plan with incremental initiatives and assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We're continuing to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these areas. Where we had challenges, like in mortgages, we're making good progress improving cycle times which improves the customer experience and allows us to resume growth in our sales force.","On slide 17, you can see tangible evidence that our strategic initiatives are bearing fruit. We continue to deliver positive operating leverage consistently ahead of our peers. We've been able to generate good revenue growth notwithstanding the modest economic growth and a lower for longer rate environment. Our disciplined approach to expense management reflects the importance of self-funding our growth initiatives by actively managing our expense base and driving efficiencies throughout the organization.","On slide 18, you can see that our biggest gap with peers has been revenue capture, particularly in our fee businesses which outlines the opportunity set that will allow us to enhance our returns for shareholders. We're addressing this opportunity through growth investments in our wealth management, capital markets, Treasury solution businesses, among others. Additionally, we're making progress towards improving our returns by addressing other drags on ROTCE, such as our excess capital position and a relatively high tax rate.","We have improved ROTCE by almost 3 percentage points inside of three years and we'll continue to focus on execution to drive further progress. As you look at slide 19, our top two initiatives have delivered well against our revenue and expense goals. In 2016, we were on track to realize $95 million to $100 million in total benefits from revenue initiatives and expense savings. We continue to foster a mindset of continuous improvement running the bank better every day.","On slide 20, we outline our plan to build and improve upon these efforts. Our TOP III initiative which is taking shape, places a greater emphasis on expenses. We're reducing our headcount in non-revenue areas and driving further efficiencies in the distribution network, as well as streamlining end-to-end loan processes. We're actively reaching out to customers to protect our share of wallet and conducting a thorough assessment of opportunities to improve our tax rate to align more closely with peers. We will leverage our success with previous TOP programs to help ensure that TOP III improves the bank's overall efficiency and effectiveness, while at the same time allowing us to self-fund investments and drive future growth.","Slide 21. Given our focus on efficiency in TOP III, we remain committed to continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. The rate scenario will move around based on events. Currently, the forward curve projects a low probability of a Fed rate increase during 2016 and 2017.","Additionally, the curve has flattened with the long end significantly lower. While this scenario lessens the prospect of a hoped for tailwind, we have been delivering strong operating, solid operating leverage, EPS growth and ROTCE improvement during the last two years with no net rate benefit as the one move in the Fed fund's rate has been more than offset by the impact of a flattening yield curve. In any case, it is starting to look like the rate reaction in the wake of Brexit may have been a bit overdone. But we will see. We believe the key is to focus on what we can control and to continue to execute on our plan to build a top performing bank that delivers well for all our stakeholders.","In the back half of 2016, initial TOP III savings will help to offset some costs that were unforeseen at the beginning of the year. These include higher FDIC assessment costs, higher separation costs from RBS related to new vendor contract, as well as a temporary increase in outsourcing costs. In 2017, our TOP III benefit will be deployed towards containing expense growth and generating positive operating leverage and EPS growth. This roughly $100 million impact will also help us self-fund the investments we need to drive top line growth, particularly in fees, while still showing strong discipline on expenses. In addition to the efforts we have outlined here, we're working additional efficiencies in areas like optimizing our branch network to reduce occupancy costs. Also note that we expect to utilize roughly 30% to 40% of the approximately $70 million TDR gain to fund costs associated with TOP III efficiencies and the continued optimization of the balance sheet.","Turning now to slide 22 and our recent CCAR submission DFAST outcome. We received a non-objection to the capital plan we submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. Our strong capital position permits strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital while maintaining a robust common equity Tier 1 ratio. We will continue to allocate our capital prudently given our need for higher earnings and ROTCE improvement. All-in, we have made great progress in improving the qualitative aspects of our framework.","On slide 23, we provide a high level outline of the TDR transaction. Earlier this week, we sold $310 million of troubled debt restructuring loans and we will look for a third quarter of 2016 gain of approximately $70 million on the sale through other income. Benefits of this transaction include an improvement in the bank's asset quality, the ability to improve risk adjusted returns, the reduction in our CCAR stress loss levels and a modest reduction in FDIC insurance expenses.","Let's turn to our third quarter outlook on slide 24. We expect to produce linked quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%. We also expect net interest margins to be down slightly given the current curve. With the curve at these levels, this poses some challenges, but we will tightly manage our deposit costs and continue to optimize our loan portfolio mix.","We're focused on what we can control and continue to investigate additional opportunities to optimize our balance sheet. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the third quarter as efficiency initiatives will offset continued investment spend. We expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain favorable which will lead to relatively stable provision in the third quarter.","And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to 11.3% given that we have resumed buying back stock and we will manage the LDR to around 99%. Note that this guidance does not reflect a gain on the TDR Transaction of approximate $70 million or any restructuring costs.","In summary, slide 25, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocators and enhancing our returns for shareholders. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making progress for all our stakeholders.","With that, let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay, thanks, Eric. A really strong quarter as we continue to run the bank better and better each and every day. With that, Kerry, can we open it up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. ","Matt O'Connor","Just following up on the outlook for the third quarter and I guess more broadly speaking as we think about net interest income dollars. Do you think you can still see some increase in the absolute amount of dollars as you think about the modest loan growth and the slight decline in NIM and the liquidity and securities book, when you put that all together do the revenue dollars go up from here?","Eric Aboaf","Matt, it is Eric. I think that's exactly what our outlook indicates. We're expecting solid loan growth. A little bit of potentially a slight decline in NIM, but a couple basis points, we will see. But we think the low growth will outrun that slight NIM compression in the third quarter and provide a good uptick in NII. I think we also see some tailwinds into the fourth quarter. We've got some old legacy swaps running off and so we actually see some flatness in NIM between third quarter and fourth quarter which when you add back in the loan growth, should help with a second NII uptick at the end of the year.","Matt O'Connor","Okay and then just separately on asset quality, the charge-off dollars came in a lot lower than I was looking for. It seemed like the auto book, after having some seasoning in recent quarters, you actually saw a good improvement there, but anything kind of unusual on the credit side or maybe what is just driving the drop in the charge-offs and specifically in auto it has been some negative industry headlines?","Eric Aboaf","Couple of factors there. I think you are right, auto has typically seasonally declined, but we also, I think, had a particularly strong recovery quarter in auto which was nice to see. That doesn't always repeat, but it was nice to see. I do think we saw some relatively systemic improvements in home equity generally and even a touch of mortgages as housing prices continued to float upwards. And we expect some of those improvements to stick in the coming quarters. And that will provide, I think, some real stability in the provision or maybe even a touch downwards. We will see.","Bruce Van Saun","I think the credit outlook stays very positive both on the consumer side and in commercial, away from energy. It's been pretty quiet. So we will continue to monitor the energy portfolio, but with the recent increase in energy prices, we're feeling okay about that.","Brad Conner","Bruce, just one more comment on the auto book. First of all, we did make some operational improvements that we think is having an impact, but then also we've talked a lot about the SCUSA book which has reached beyond the peak of its loss curve. So we're starting to see those SCUSA losses trimmed down at this point. Of course, our purchases are a little smaller there, so that's contributing, as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Erica Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","I just wanted to understand how we should think about the impact of the $73 million to $90 million of PP&R enhancements that you mentioned for your TOP III initiative. You touched upon 3% operating leverage growth or rather, operating leverage being achieved and I'm wondering whether or not TOP III is going to continue to accelerate this operating leverage or it will support this level of operating leverage going into 2017?","Bruce Van Saun","I think the good news here is that we've identified another roughly $100 million as we did last year. So to us we now got to go get it, but we have very well-formed plans as to how we're going to do that. And it's really money in the bank, is the way I think about it. So the first objective we have is to make sure that we're managing the expense rate of growth wisely and in line with the environment that we operate in. And underneath that, we want to make sure that we're using some of the benefits that we find to continue to invest in areas that are going to deliver medium term growth. ","So building up our fee-based businesses, for example and capturing that revenue opportunity. So it's really, I think we will get some immediate benefits in the second half of the year that will cover things like higher FDIC assessment. And then we will run that out next year when we do the budget process. We will see what kind of revenue environment we're in and we will manage the overall pace of expense growth based on that revenue environment while we're protecting the things we need to invest in for the future.","Erika Najarian","And my second question is on the ROT improvement from here. Clearly, excess capital, as you mentioned, is weighing on it. And, Bruce and, Eric, I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit of insight, in as much as you can, on how Citizens has improved in the DFAST and CCAR process in 2016 versus 2015 and whether as you look out into the future that gives you confidence, as well as some of the results of some of your peers, to continue to be aggressive in terms of your ASK.","Bruce Van Saun","I'll start and, Eric, you can chime in. But, look, I think in terms of the CCAR process, we're very pleased, obviously, that we have upped our game and we're making it through the qualitative side of it well. I think when you go back to think about how we were berthed from RBS one of the good things is we were berthed with a very high capital ratio which it has allowed us a lot of flexibility in terms of improving the bank and improving returns.","So we're kind of in a rich man's position now where we can have relatively strong loan growth, so we can use that capital position to grow the balance sheet, bring new customers into the bank and also at the same time we can have very strong distributions of capital back to shareholders. And that's been bringing the capital ratio down at around 50 basis points or so for the past two years, that strategy of having aggressive loan growth and strong returns to shareholders. I think we're calling out kind of a low 11% type ending point this year, down from maybe 11.8% when we started the year.","So, say, call it 60-basis-point reduction. And I think we could do that again, clearly, we have to go through the process, but the potential exists to do that again given that our peer capital ratios the median is probably around 10%. So we could do that maybe once, maybe twice again. But, obviously, we've got to keep running the bank better and we have to get our ROTCE up. We want to get to a sustainable position where sources of capital equal uses because eventually that excess that we have will dissipate. So that's how we think about it. Eric, maybe you can chime in.","Eric Aboaf","Yes. I think on CCAR what gives us the confidence there is that the investments we've made in the qualitative factors. There are seven major qualitative factors. We have reinvested and upped our game, as we've said and I think we feel like we really understand where the bar is. We know how to make sure we stay above the bar, if the bar flows up in either credit modeling or PP&R or controls or data.","Our view is we need to stay ahead and be ahead and we know what it takes to do that. I think what's also constructive in our CCAR results is if you look at the stress tests that are done. The credit stress that we see in our book and that the Fed sees in our book tends to be a little lighter than some of the other regional banks.","And so that higher quality of underwriting of credit and of mix, I think, bodes well for us because we have less, a slightly lower CCAR draw down on capital and that gives us some confidence that the payouts that we have put forward this year and what we might recommend next year make a lot of sense.","Operator","And our next question will go to the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill Partners. Your line is open. ","Scott Siefers","Eric, I was wondering if you could speak to some of the potential additional balance sheet optimization opportunities you might see? I feel like in many ways you guys have already done such a considerable amount, so just curious, your thoughts? And then just given the presumably more likely dynamic for lower for longer, any thought to altering the Company's rate sensitivity at all?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, fair question. I think the first thing I'd share with you is I think our initiatives in the businesses, whether I describe them as pricing or mix on the loan side continue to bear fruit. I think this quarter in particular you saw 2% uptick in yields, you saw it both in Consumer and Commercial. Some of that was the mix improvement that we continue to drive and I think we continue to do that. Some of it actually just came from outright targeting and we had some improvements in yields as we really gave benchmarking tools to our bankers in Commercial to make sure that they got the yields that we deserve. And some of it came from pricing in Consumer.","We actually wanted to slow down a little lending. One of the natural ways to do that is to take price up, you've got to do that carefully. But had about 15 basis points better origin pricing in auto on an apples-to-apples basis. So we think those initiatives will continue and we think there is potential to continue to drive those forward. And I think the same thing is true in deposits. We have to do both the tactics in deposits and we're also rolling out new product programs. We've got a great new product for [indiscernible] in deposits on the Consumer side and I think those kinds of initiatives will bear fruit.","I think more broadly on the balance sheet management and investment portfolio side, we're not uncomfortable with this level of asset sensitivity, though we do want to position around the curve. Post-Brexit you saw rates that 10-year at 1.35% and I'm sure the folks are clamoring why not just close down the asset sensitive position? Well, rates are at 1.6%, right, over the last day. And you'd say, hey, good treasurers and smart managers of a Treasury portfolio will look for rates in a range and choose how to position.","I think you've also seen mortgage basis widen out over the last couple months. The provides an opportunity because we earn money in Treasury both on the duration position and on the mortgage basis and we can adjust which one we emphasize which ones we deemphasize. And then I think you will continue to see us do work around optimizing the liability side of the balance sheet, right, with an upcoming sub-debt redemption that we've planned, that we have previously announced, $500 million. And I think actions like that should help and help offset some of the lower for longer headwinds.","Bruce Van Saun","I would just add to that when you think about where we're playing, what we're trying to do is be very, very disciplined in how and where we play, particularly on the Commercial side. And so we're kind of making sure that we can get good yield, so good risk adjusted returns. But more than that, also making sure that we're playing on the basis where we can take in deposits and we can get the fee cross-sell. And so that's one of the things that we're constantly looking at trying to rotate is if there is an area, for example, the leasing business that we have is a bit light on fees and light on deposits and it had been a referral business that we were really dependent on RBS for large ticket referrals.","We're refashioning that business into something that's more focused as a cross-sell product into middle market customers so we can make it part of this whole relationship. So that is some of the continuing work that is taking place.","Operator","And next we will go to the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ken Zerbe","So I thought slide 12 was actually really interesting, that you are getting meaningfully higher loan yields on Commercial. When we look out for the net interest margin into 2017, right, I know you mentioned, Bruce, I thought you said that fourth quarter is going to possibly remain stable given the swaps running off, but how should we think about margin into 2017? Just given where rates are now, is it fair to assume that we should see a couple basis points of additional pressure per quarter or are there other offsetting factors that make keep it a little more stable?","Bruce Van Saun","I think, Ken, it's a little early to call out any guidance on 2017, but if you look at the trends that we've had, the focus on shifting the mix, being disciplined on pricing, disciplined on deposit side has served us well. So we have, I think, probably when you think about any rate benefit this year, we had some lift from the initial Fed action in December and a lot of that is given back from the flattening of the curve as you go through the year and the thing that has propelled the NIM higher has been some of these self-help actions and this discipline we have had.","So when we think about 2017, that's what the game plan is to continue with that as we go into next year. It certainly would be helpful if the Fed starts to move again. It's interesting that right after Brexit it looked like that was completely off the table for a couple of years and now that markets are saying well maybe not so fast on that one. So, anyway, we can't control that, but we want continue to influence the things that we can control.","Ken Zerbe","And then just really quick, on commercial real estate, obviously, strong growth this quarter, given some of the discussion or debate around commercial real estate, competition, pricing terms, does that sort of seri competition change the way that you view growing seri near term?","Bruce Van Saun","I'll start with this and let Don pick up. I think partly the reason we have had the good growth in commercial real estate is, I like to say that we had the shop closed line on the storefront as part of RBS's downsizing of its commercial real estate exposure globally. And we've been able, as we've gone independent, just to turn that sign around, if you will and say store is open. And so the folks that we basically put and do business with for a while that we've now welcomed back and they are happy to have us back in the rotation giving us swings at the bat.","So I think we've had a good opportunity to kind of reestablish that we're in the game and we've taken advantage of that. Having said that, we have been very disciplined in terms of T&Cs and there is hot sectors of the market, if we think they are too hot, we just pull back from. But, anyway, Don, why don't you give some more color?","Don McCree","Yes, I think that's exactly right, Bruce. We've been going quite rapidly over the last couple years in real estate and we continue to see just huge opportunities in that market. As Bruce said, we're definitely being more selective in areas like multi-family and that's allowing us to get better terms, better pricing and continue to grow the book. But I think you'll see a growth slightly slower than it has in the past couple of years, but we're seeing interesting opportunities. And with some people pulling back, we're able to do transactions which are attractive to us and we're being very disciplined on it.","Operator","And our next question will go to the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jason Harbes","Just wanted to drill in a little bit on the fees. It looks like you had a record quarter in capital markets, so just wondering how sustainable that is and then within the context of the low-single-digit improvement that you expect in the third quarter which areas would you expect to see that improvement coming from?","Bruce Van Saun","Don, why don't you take the first part of that and then we'll go to Eric.","Don McCree","So we did have strong and broad performance in capital markets and in interest rates on the back of the Brexit event, so we feel very good about the ability to capture the opportunity which exists in our franchise which has been the strategy for the last couple of years to position for these opportunities. It's hard to see out long term in capital markets, but we feel like the capabilities are extremely strong and our pipelines are looking quite good for the third quarter. So we think it continues at least for the next quarter.","Bruce Van Saun","I would just add that is not just market. So the market, obviously, helps and the market had for kind of leverage credits in particular and the smaller deals had dried up in Q4 and for a good part [indiscernible] opened back up and that helps. But I think the bigger point here, as Don mentioned, is we've been broadening our capabilities and adding talent and we're in the position, really, to go out and gain market share, so that's been, I think, a key aspect to this.","Eric Aboaf","And then more broadly, Jason, on fee growth into the third quarter. I think we expect it to be reasonably broad base. Usually, there is a small tick up in service charges, just as volume slowed and household growth and business activity happens. Same in cars, third quarter typically a little stronger than second quarter. I think we expect continued building in the investments area. You saw $1 of sequential growth, we expect that to continue, potentially at a slightly higher pace.","I think foreign exchange, interest rate products, we will just have to see how the markets play out and capital markets in particular, whether we can sustain this pace or those come back a little bit. I think mortgages, we're seeing a bit of a refinance boom lately. You saw our applications up almost 40% quarter-over quarter. We expect some higher level of that given rate already in, the locks are coming through and that should bode well for mortgages. I think you'll see some broad-based improvement into the third quarter here as we look forward.","Operator","And our next will go to the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.","John Pancari","Back to expenses, I just want to see if you can help us a little bit with how this all comes together in terms of the efficiencies that you're targeting out of the remainder of the TOP II and then the TOP III. I guess, first, how can we think about the growth rate for 2016, that 2.5% to 3% range you had previously provided? And then, secondly, how can we think about the -- what the positive operating leverage goal means for your efficiency ratio? In other words, what's a way to think about where the efficiency could come out by the end of 2017 when you dial in the TOP III, particularly given that you're reinvesting a good portion of it? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","John, let me take that. On the expense growth, you saw we had an uptick primarily due to timing and merit increases this quarter. We expect expenses to be reasonably flat into third quarter and fourth quarter. And so, part of what will drive that is you don't have the 401(k) match and some of the payroll taxes coming through again in third quarter, offset by just the natural uptick as we hire loan officers or capital market specialists or some of our investment headcount that draws the revenue growth.","I think when it comes down to it, we had 1% up in expenses first quarter year-on-year, 3% up expenses second quarter year-on-year. We're at 2% first half growth rate and, obviously, we're trying to stick as close to that as we can, but it's hard work. I think what we want to do is make sure that we control expenses on one hand, we reinvest on the other and really balance that and that's what we've been trying to--","Bruce Van Saun","And I think the net result of all that is you can see the year-on-year numbers we're 6.5% top line growth and 3% expense growth in the quarter. That's pretty darn good. And so we're trying to make sure that we're growing the bank, growing the top line and then making those investments and keeping a big spread.","The result of that also and you mentioned efficiency ratio, is we've had year-on-year the efficiency ratio drop by 2% from 67% down to 65%. And if we can keep that up, if we can keep delivering that operating leverage and keep investing in the avenues to grow that top line, that will be terrific and that efficiency ratio should continue to move down to the low 60%'s. That's where we want to get it.","Eric Aboaf","And the pace that you get that out is you think about how you model, right. You get 3% operating leverage just on a year-over-year basis. Effectively creates 2 percentage points increase in efficiency on a year-over-year basis. So that's kind of the -- how it calibrates and so, obviously, focus on operating leverage will continue and try to match this pace as best we can.","John Pancari","And then, my follow-up is just around the solid commercial growth, I know you mentioned it's the mid-corporate as well as some of the verticals. I just want to get a little bit more specific color around what's driving it and how much it is really in the some of the sustainable areas versus anything that's transactional in nature and may not be as sustainable going into 2017? Thanks.","Don McCree","I think, obviously, we're focused on cross-sell which is partly transactional, but the franchise is growing nicely. We've targeted the verticals that we've we called out, we've targeted mid-corporate, we've targeted the franchise finance area and they're all experiencing double-digit growth in terms of loan growth. And as Bruce called out before, our process is very disciplined as we grow our client base. We're focused on growing loans but growing loans at an acceptable NIM, at acceptable terms and conditions and where we see reasonably near term cross-sell.","And there's plenty of opportunity out there as other banks adjust their books of business and particularly some of the larger banks back away from some of the clients that they been banking. And we have, I think, the more opportunity than we actually want to bank at this point and we're basically balancing our growth levels with our return levels and we're doing it pretty successfully. So I think it can continue at a healthy pace into the balance of this year and into next year.","Operator","And next we will go to the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Vivek Juneja","So, Bruce, Eric, could you remind us, ROTCE trajectory now? You had a nice quarter, you went above 7% and how should we -- what do you expect on that front?","Bruce Van Saun","I think we're continuing to make progress. It was nice to see the big jump this quarter and we want to keep propelling higher. You get, you cross over 7%, you get to the mid-7%'s and you're next goal is you want to get to 8%. But we're still focused on that 10%. We won't get there in the original timeline we thought, largely because of rates, but I think the goal is to just deliver that positive operating leverage, deliver solid EPS growth and the ROTCE will move up with that.","Vivek Juneja","Student loans, you had good growth there. The outlook on that, do you expect that to continue at this pace? Can you talk a little bit about that?","Bruce Van Saun","Brad?","Brad Conner","We feel optimistic about continued outlook for growth in student lending. Strong demand for the refi product. We will, obviously, see a little bit of a bump in student loan originations in third and fourth quarter when we hit the seasonal peak for in-school, but all signs point to continued strong demand in the refi area and we expect that momentum to continue.","Vivek Juneja","And you're still [indiscernible] with the same credit focus metrics that you're seeing on that, Brad?","Brad Conner","Yes. Very strong. All signs are very strong with the credit indicators on both sides, in-school and the refi product in student.","Eric Aboaf","And, Vivek, remember, it's a very high quality credit focus. We're talking about 750 on one of the portfolios, 780 on the other. We're talking about undergraduates to colleges that you and others and we all went to, MBA graduate degrees, doctors, lawyers, business degrees, that kind of thing. So it's a very high quality book and it is part of, I think, of the economy where we're really making a benefit for consumers. ","Actually, when we get fan letters, right, because we cut their payments by $135 a month which is a real benefit to them and we provide a real service and earn good return. So it's a real nice product for us and I think for the time being, for the next couple years we see it as attractive, attractive returns, not a lot of competition and whenever someone comes in we actually feel like that actually rings [indiscernible] to the market, as Brad said and we get even more--","Bruce Van Saun","Bring attractive new customers into the mix.","Eric Aboaf","Exactly.","Operator","And our next question will go to the line of David Eads with UBS. Your line is open.","David Eads","Maybe following up on some of the loan growth, comments you guys made. I'm just curious if you guys are seeing any changes in the dynamic or maybe opportunities related to some of the transactions that are in your footprint? It seems like there's a lot going on in your area. So, just curious what you're seeing on that front?","Don McCree","On the Commercial side, the market has been dominated so far, at least for the last 18 months by refinancing. And what we're waiting to see and what we hope to see with some economic growth is some new money financings and growth in borrowings by clients in our footprint and when I talk about that, I'm talking about our middle-market client base.","So if you look at our middle-market client base, underneath our loan growth, that has been relatively flat for about a year now. So we're holding our clients, but they are just not growing their demand for credit. So most of our growth has come in our verticals and in our national businesses and upside in the future could be economically driven loan growth within our middle market. But we're not seeing that right now.","David Eads","Sorry, I guess I was meaning the opportunities to get additional clients from dislocations at other competitors due to some of the M&A transactions going on.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, it is very competitive out there. We're seeing opportunities to bid new business. We have added some new clients. I think our client count from the beginning of the year is up about 100, ballpark. So it's not a massive addition of clients, but at the margin we're adding new clients. I think it takes a while for clients to switch. So some of the M&A that's been announced, while we may be talking to some of those opportunities, they're not going to switch their business overnight. It generally revolves around a maturity of a loan facility or something else going on with their coverage. And we haven't seen that materialize in size yet. But we're hopeful. We're actually talking to those clients about joining the Citizens family.","Brad Conner","Yes and that is certainly the same on the Consumer side. There's opportunity there for new customer acquisition and we're focusing on those areas in terms of some of our marketing efforts and even opportunities to hire great colleagues in those markets, we're focusing on that, as well. So definitely opportunity we've seen.","David Eads","And then, you guys called out the, somewhere around $25 million of reinvesting of the gains in 3Q for the implementing of TOP III. Are there going to be other implementation costs that come down over the next few quarters from that?","Bruce Van Saun","No, look, I think one of the things we're pleased by is that we've been able to generate the TOP improvement programs without a lot of restructuring. So without the need to burden capital with big charges. And we're self-funding this actually by creating the gain on the TDRs, if we need to use 20% to 30% of it which is $20 million to $30 million. I think that will pretty much cover it.","There is a more heavy expense element to TOP III, but there's also revenue ideas which really just require people investment or changes in processes. So there's no big investment that goes with that. And then the tax strategies we have are largely around tax credit programs which will throw off a little bit of headwind on the non-interest income line, but certainly benefit your tax line and give a net benefit. So, in any case, I think that's the extent of it. What we said we earmarked the gain, a portion of the gain to cover.","Operator","And our next question will go to the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, your line is open.","Kevin Barker","I noticed that auto loans increased by roughly $200 million this quarter despite the pullback on the SCUSA purchases. You mentioned some strength there, some of that might be seasonality and you also noted some better pricing on your auto loans. Could you just give additional color on what you're seeing there on why that's growing in particular?","Brad Conner","Yes. Actually, I want to be really clear. Went Eric talk about better pricing what he means by that is better yield and better margin for us, not more aggressive pricing. We made a conscious decision to slow our growth there and look for opportunities to improve spreads and margins and we've done that but the demand remains remained quite strong. So I would attribute most of it to demand in the marketplace. We're expecting to see that growth taper down a little bit, maybe be more flattish in the third quarter, but just very strong marketplace demand is what I would attribute it to.","Bruce Van Saun","At a portfolio level, just to refresh the thinking, is that we've basically and I like this pun, you tried to put the brakes on auto and keep it relatively flat and go for the margin. And then we're allocating more capital to areas like the ed refinance loan and student, some of our unsecured products like Apple IF program or some new pilots on unsecured lending. So we're focused on yield maximization and I think you can't always hit the nail on the head, you try to keep auto flat, but as Brad said, it's robust in the market and we're just playing in the prime and super prime spaces, we're not playing in sub-prime. But there's still good activity there and good loan demand there.","Kevin Barker","And then in regards to your -- the balance between organic growth and the loans that you're purchasing, where do you think you will stand by the end of 2016 on the percentage growth that you can see organically versus purchases?","Bruce Van Saun","We have been moving that, migrating that well over 80% now and I think the only -- we've got -- I guess the SCUSA is really net neutral or winding down on the charge level of purchases. And SoFi on the student loans is the only thing where we're really acquiring at this point. But it's a relatively modest portion of overall growth because we're seeing such good organic growth.","Brad Conner","We were 90%, on the Consumer side we were 90% organic and 10% purchase for the quarter. So it certainly coming from organic--","Bruce Van Saun","The bigger loan growth and they are 100% organic. So it's relatively modest at this point.","Eric Aboaf","And the trends are, as you would expect, it was 80% organic in first quarter, well into the 90% second quarter and we like it in that area.","Kevin Barker","And then just, housekeeping, what was the ending balance of the upgrade program with Apple?","Bruce Van Saun","It's over $350 million.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, $360 million ending, $350 million average.","Operator","And next we will go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Gerard Cassidy","You guys show up pretty low when you look at how you are addressing your expenses to average assets to a peer group. Fee revenue or non-interest income still is not as strong as some of your peers. Have you given some thought about making acquisitions in the fee revenue area, not necessarily the depository, but companies that could help you boost your fee revenue as a percentage of total revenue?","Bruce Van Saun","I think, Gerard, we have been very focused on just running the bank better and putting the right foundations in place to really capture the opportunity we see right in front of us in terms of organic growth. I think when we feel that we've got that right, we certainly have the capital capacity to go out and look at some bolt-on acquisitions that could accelerate the lift off in fee revenues, but I think that's still a bit of the ways into the future.","Gerard Cassidy","And then second, if rates don't really move much over the next 18 months, you're making progress in the consumer banking profitability, as evidenced by this quarter's return on tangible common equity breaking 7%. How long will it take you to get to that number, bringing it close to the 10%, if you don't get any rate relief in doing it for the consumer bank?","Bruce Van Saun","I guess we're not calling out the milestones beyond this year. We're just giving our -- focusing our guidance on this year. If you kind of can use almost the past as a projection for the future if you say, as Eric said in his prepared remarks, we've lifted the overall Company ROTCE over 3% or approximately 3%, in under three years. And we haven't had any rate benefit to do that and so the formula of putting our capital to work wisely, growing the balance sheet, getting the top line to move, building up the fee businesses and being very disciplined on expenses, that's the formula. We're going to keep going with that formula and hopefully it will continue to propel us higher.","Operator","And next we will go to the line of Jesus Bueno with Compass Point. Your line is now open.","Jesus Bueno","Very quickly on the share repurchase, obviously, a great result out of CCAR this year. Just in terms of the share repurchases and the pace of them throughout this cycle, last cycle you seem to front load them and, of course, here you are below tangible book. I guess, in terms of pace, do you have any guidance on that of what to expect there?","Bruce Van Saun","One thing I would say is, the reason we front loaded them last year was we were helping RBS exit their position. So we were buying their stock back and we were still issuing their stock to the market, so we had no buyback program to the market. And we got them out of the stock in October which left us basically with no buy capacity from October through June 30 of this year. The good news is, now that we have authorization to buy $690 million, we're not going to repeat that.","Obviously, we're going to try to spread that out so we have some buying capacity in the whole, each of the four quarters. But, clearly, when there's events, when the stock gets washed out, like it did, when the market goes to risk offload we will step up and buy more. That's what any prudent treasurer would be doing.","Jesus Bueno","And just going back to the loan purchases, could you break out, what were the originations on the refi product for student? And, I guess, separately, what were the SoFi purchases during the quarter?","Brad Conner","Yes I do. The refi originations were $340 million for the quarter and SoFi purchases were also about $300 million, I believe.","Jesus Bueno","I just have one more, just on the provision. I guess, based on the 3Q guidance, you are actually running even below your guidance that you had initially put up for the year, so I guess, so how do you feel about your original guidance? Do you think we could actually come in below that for the year on provision?","Bruce Van Saun","It's a little early to say. I would just say that we've been pleasantly surprised. We were pleasantly surprised last year and the credit metrics remain very solid. So we will see how it plays out. At this point, we're just guiding one quarter at a time and we're calling for provisions to be broadly stable, but the skew could be more to the positive new side than the negative at this point absent any unforeseen changes in the economy or any SCUD missiles that could always hit you at any time.","Jesus Bueno","Fair enough. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. I think we're at the top of the hour here. Actually, we ran over by five minutes or so. But, again, I want to thank everybody for dialing in today and listening to our presentation and asking good questions and have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I\u2019ll be your operator for today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks, Brad and good morning everybody. Thanks so much for being with us today. We\u2019re going to start the morning off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and our CFO, Eric Aboaf reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results and then we\u2019re going to open up the call for questions.","With us today are also Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Bank, and Don McCree, our Head of Commercial Bank. I\u2019d like to remind you all that in addition to the press release, we\u2019ve also provided a presentation and financial supplement, and you can find all those materials on our Web site at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course I need to remind you that during the call, we make some forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. And the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures may be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement that are available on our Web site.","And with that, I\u2019m going to hand it over to our CEO, Bruce Van Saun.","Bruce Van Saun","Well hi and good morning everyone, I appreciate you\u2019re dialing in. 2015 was the year of significant progress for Citizens. We completed our separation from RBS becoming fully independent in late October. Our financial progress was in line with expectations and guidance in spite of a lower rate environment than anticipated. We achieved good loan and deposit growth we delivered positive operating leverage and savings from our efficiency initiative kept expenses flat notwithstanding significant investments in growth areas and in technology.","We made strides in improving our product offerings and service quality and customer satisfaction is trending upwards. We hired some great talent including Eric and Don right here with me and we have some great new initiatives on the colleague front like leadership development and carrier mapping. Our risk management capabilities continue to strengthen, we have had a good result on CCAR and we\u2019re working hard to achieve the regulators tightened standards. And we continue to deliver enhanced technology capabilities including a new backup datacenter, a new mortgage platform and expanded online and mobile capabilities, so all-in-all, solid performance on all dimensions, backing well against our turnaround plan.","We ended the year with a good fourth quarter and we feel good about our trajectory as we had into 2016. In Q4, we achieved good loan growth, as well as good NII and fee growth. We had expected to do even better but the leverage credit markets became challenged during Q4 disrupting some of our capital markets pipeline. Hopefully that market will come back later in Q1. Expenses increased modestly given technology related spend and 6 million of costs largely associated with our growth and efficiency initiatives. Additionally, our credit provision grew by 15 million versus Q3 due to a reserve build. Earlier this year, we have seen back book improvements offset our reserve build tied to loan growth, but the back book is now so clean and we don\u2019t expect to see much of that continuing.","The balance sheet remains robust with excellent capital liquidity and funding position and strong ratios and metrics. For the full year, highlights include 13% adjusted EPS growth, positive operating leverage of 3%, 8% average loan growth and tangible book value per share growth of 5%. All of which I might add compare very favorably with peers.","So now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Eric to give a little more color on the financials. Eric?","Eric Aboaf","Thanks, Bruce and good morning everyone. Since Bruce hit some of the highlights I\u2019ll probably let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck for some color on Q4. On Slide 6 on an adjusted basis, we grew EPS by 5% in the quarter and 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. This included good operating leverage with revenues up 4% and expenses up by 2%. We improved the efficiency ratio 135 basis points year-over-year.","On Slide 9, you can see our NIM was up 1 basis point in the quarter. We\u2019ve done a good job in growing our loan yield by adjusting our mix and risk appetite and being disciplined on pricing. We were also -- we have got to bring interest bearing deposits costs down by 1 basis point this quarter this is a real progress as we sharpened our offerings and pricing strategies. We did lose 1 basis point given higher cash balances tied to some of the long-term funding we raised in the quarter and the effect of those borrowing costs.","Now on Slide 10, noninterest income was up 9 million in the quarter with momentum in both consumer and commercial service charges and fees driven by progress in our treasury solutions initiative and some seasonality. Capital markets fees were lower than expected given the fixed income market destruction during the quarter. Securities gains picked up a bit to offset this prolonged with lower other income. Recall that the third quarter included an $8 million brand scale gain.","Now on Slide 11, as expected, our adjusted expenses were up linked-quarter given an increase in technology expense. This was driven by the impact of our new back up datacenter coming online along with the implementation of various technology and operations initiatives to improve offerings and drive future revenue growth. Outside of this growth, we helped salaries and benefit cost flat. And we achieved good loan growth in both consumer and commercial during the fourth quarter, which you can see on Pages 13 and 14.","In consumer, growth was paced by continued expansion in mortgage and student and we also grew the other retail category, which includes our unsecured iPhone financed products which generated $220 million in balances by yearend. We continue to do a nice job of re-pointing our growth to the higher return category and the yield in consumer expanded accordingly 4 basis points in the quarter.","We also saw nice growth in commercial, where we grew commercial real estate loans as client relationships added earlier in the year have to align. We also continue to execute well in the corporate franchise finance and corporate finance, which helped mitigate some of the reductions in middle market as borrowers there continue to reduce line utilization. And in all our balance sheet measures on the next couple of pages, we have stronger than suggested results which you can see.","Next I'd like to take you to Slide 18. Here we show how Citizens performed against guidance we gave back in January of 2015. Overall, the results were largely in line, balance sheet growth targets were achieved and while revenue growth was a bit lower than expected largely due to first half and in compression, we were able to offset that with additional efforts on expenses and favorable credit.","On Slide 19, we saw a progress against our strategic initiative. Most of this is tracking well, but let me call out a few of the challenges and tell you what we are doing about them. In mortgage our new Head Chris Morris has a clear plan focused on our gaining operational excellence following our introduction of a new hedge fund so what is implied origination platforms in Q4 last year, which caused a slowdown in our throughput and impacted net recruited. We believe execution of this plan will position us for a stronger 2016 in hiring, retention and productivity.","In wealth, under the new leadership of John Bahnken we had a strong rebound in recruiting this quarter and we see good higher momentum as we enter 2016. We will continue to migrate forward some more fee-based models, and in asset finance we are repositioning this as a cost of products for our corporate customers in the light of a loss for the RBS customer referral. We saw some good progress in Q4. So all-in-all we posted solid results again in the quarter and for the year and we continue to make good progress against our strategic initiative, efficiency efforts and balance sheet repositioning. We are positioned well as we move into 2016.","Back to you, Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks Eric. I'd like to elevate a little starting on Slide 20, to focus on our goals in turning around Citizens. We aspire to be a top performing bank that delivers well for its stakeholders with serving customers well at the heart of our culture.","On Slide 21, we show some of the objectives we have within our plan. We made good progress in 2015, pretty much across the board well there is still more to do, we are a work in progress. On Slide 22, you can see the financial targets that we laid out and the steady progress we are making in improving our results. So with that as a backdrop let's shift to our outlook on 2016.","Slide 23, the markets are off to a rough start so far but our planning assumption is still for steady U.S. GDP growth, solid loan demand and say one to two more rate hikes coming in July and possibly December. To deliver strong performance, we have a few key objectives. We need to sustain robust loan growth and we need to keep NIM stable to trending up on an underlying basis. Rate hikes if they come will deliver additional benefit.","We need to drive our key initiatives and we need to deliver better fee growth. And we will need to keep finding ways to constrain expense growth given our plans and necessary investments in growth initiatives. As we do that well we will again deliver meaningful positive operating leverage. That will cover a normalization of provision and it will drive good growth in earnings. And of course we want to continue to work down our capital surplus through loan growth, a higher dividend and share repurchases.","So let's move on to Slide 25. And our guidance, Eric back to you.","Eric Aboaf","Here you can see fairly detailed ranges played out for all key balance sheet and income statement growth measure. A few key items I call out. Loan growth of 6% to 8% and II growth of 7% to 10% with NIM improvement of 6 to 12 bps, the forward curve assumes rate hike in July and December, which would help us get to the high and robust range if they occur. Fee growth of 5% to 7%, expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% as our efficiency measures provided a greater OpEx investment spending in 2015, well in 2016. Provision normalization to a $375 million to $425 million range, and CET 1 ratio of 11.2% to 11.5%, as an overall comment, we expect we could achieve a better level of revenue growth in 2016 than 2015, due to better performance on demand and on fees this will cover a slightly higher expense growth and a modest comp from 4Q provision levels.","We have laid out some useful details behind these growth rates on Slide 38 to 40 in the appendix too. Please take a look at your leisure on Slide 39 for example we detailed the impact to NII of the December 2015 rate hike which is worth 40 million to 50 million and the potential impact is too more in 2016 for the forward curve that we used at the time when we concluded our plan which would be worth 30 million to 40 million. The bulk of this additional benefit is from the July 2016 hike as well as minimal impact from the December '16 hike in the forthcoming year. If we don\u2019t get in more hikes we will have to pull harder on our other NII levers and to view expenses to find offsets.","Also note that the current dividend on the Fed stock decreases NII by 17 million and cost us $0.02 a share. We should also highlight that on Slide 41 there was an accounting change for cards reward that we make prospectively in 2016 which you will need to factor into your models. Our outlook for Q1 is shown on Slide 26, fairly straightforward overall to some typical seasonal impacts to consider.","So let me turn it back to Bruce to wrap-up.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay thanks Eric. So just in term of good plans to improve its performance, we are building things the right way to be sustainable for the long-term while being mindful of our need to show improvement in our financials in the near-term. We consider 2015 to have been a successful year on all fronts. And we will continue to stay focused on execution in 2016 in order to deliver another successful year.","So with that let\u2019s open up for some questions. Brad?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instruction] And we will go to line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Just starting because the energy is such an important topic, I know your energy portfolio is very small, but can you comment on any potential weakness or anything we have seen in that portfolio when you reserve build do you have last quarter?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I would say the portfolios that would be most impacted by change in price levels would be two, the reserve base lending portfolio and oilfield services portfolio. Their combined level of outstandings in those portfolios is about 700 million so it's not very big in the loan book it is over 100 billion. And I would say we have relatively good diversifications so there is good granularity in terms of the supply to those credits and there is a little bit of migration going into classified but it is nothing that we are seeing increase in NPAs or anything that we have really boost our reserve levels meaningfully at this point.","Ken Zerbe","Okay it is perfect. And then just another question on expenses, the expense guidance obviously this quarter had higher outside services fees and tax spending, is that the same main driver of expense growth going forward or does that come down and other areas kind of increase a little bit just trying understand the trajectory there?","Bruce Van Saun","There is a few moving parts there and I will let Eric augment my comments but, one of the same that we are doing is we are at engaging in an outsourcing effort for our infrastructure support with IBM and so you are seeing that line go up a bit and you see other expenses within offset and salaries benefits as can offset. So until that is fully migrated which should be complete by the end of the first quarter, there will be a little geography there. But in the long run that is designed to save us money that\u2019s part of our top initiative and I think the migration is going reasonably well. There is also a little bit of seasonality there in outside services to try and get some projects across the line, we have had a little bit of spike there. So I would say that was really the driver Ken. Eric I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything else?","Eric Aboaf","Yes I\u2019d just add that the equipment expenses probably as a result of some of the spending that we have done to drive some of the revenue growth that you have seen whether it's on mobile, whether it's on some of the other functionality in treasury solutions and cash management, as well as some of the infrastructure, so you got datacenter expenses come through. And those are right at this level maybe up a little more and that\u2019s part of why, we need to keep finding offsets overtime and why we have been very focused for example on headcount which is actually down this quarter and salaries and benefits generally.","Operator","And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Can you give us an update on maybe your near and longer term ROE targets?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, sure. So we are still putting that goalpost out there that the medium term target is 10%. I think we will continue to make progress towards that in 2016 we\u2019ve given you fairly comprehensive guidance and you can work through and see that there will be progress. The exit rate tends to be about 1% higher than the full year rate it is the earlier analysis that we had shown you, I think that still holds. So any way we\u2019re make meaningful progress in \u201916 and we\u2019ll wait and see how 2017 plays out before we give any firmer guidance on that.","Matt O'Connor","And then just separately what\u2019s the appetite for acquisitions as you think maybe the near-term and then if there is not interest in the near-term. What might be of interest longer term and what are you waiting for?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes sure. So I think right now we\u2019re still a work in progress as I said. So there is plenty of opportunity for us to run the bank better and capitalize on areas where we see good revenue growth potential organically. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on and I think it would be a mistake to get distracted and start running off and to do deals. So I wouldn\u2019t see us looking harder things in 2016. I think once the bank is running better and we\u2019ve achieved some of that potential organically then we could start to look at the possibility of some things, I think you\u2019d likely want to dip your toe in the water gradually before you went out did anything big. So maybe some bolt ons in some of our fee based activities or maybe some little feel ins in terms of smaller banks where we think it\u2019d fit nicely into our overall franchise. But I think that is still a ways out now.","Operator","And the next question will come from Joe Hsu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Joe Hsu","I just had a quick question related to the revenue guidance your NIM expectations for 2016 are up 6 to 12 basis points assuming two more rate hikes. Can you just talk about the revenue expectations and NII guidance if rates don\u2019t go higher from here?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I guess what you should do is look back to Page 39 in the slide deck, because it\u2019s laid out pretty explicitly there. And Eric I\u2019ll turn it over to you, but I would say that we\u2019re not that reliant on rate hikes in 2016. So when we finish the plan, we\u2019ve had used the forward curve which had one in July and one in December. The one in December doesn\u2019t really help \u201916 it\u2019s going to help \u201917. So if the one in July happens, it\u2019s good for us. If it doesn\u2019t happen we have a range there that we were counting on $30 million to $40 million of benefit and that\u2019s a manageable number, I mean that -- we\u2019ll have to pull the levers harder on either earning asset growth or you can see right there or loan mix and yields or go back and look at expenses. And so anyway, it would be a tailwind if it happens it puts us closer to the higher end of the range and makes it easier and maybe gives us 1% of it happens I have to make up that 1% somewhere else. Eric?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. What I had is the client just envisions the continuation of what he really saw last year with regard to loan growth right on average is there any asset growth. And then the stability we saw in NIM in the second half of the year. You actually saw that pick up a couple of basis points from 2Q to 3Q another basis points from 3Q to 4Q. And so the plan is pretty straight forward, we continue to grow loans, we continue to grow average earning assets and we holding NIM flattish to up a bit as we leg into some of that mix shift as you see us doing in particular on consumer.","And then what I\u2019d say this past December hike right. The one that was just short while ago literally a month ago actually gives us 3 to 5 basis points. Why because LIBOR pulled it up commercial loans have started to re-price already and that gives us a little bit of a tailwind. So we have confident that while there is good work to do, real work to do that to continue on the kind of the pricing efforts, the mix and management efforts and the discipline that the loan growth coupled with the NIM kind of guard rails that we\u2019re on plus a little bit of tailwind from that December hike, we should be able to continue to deliver good progress on NII growth in the coming year.","Bruce Van Saun","And you can see also Joe on the prior page we find of lay out, how we -- what our growth rates were in \u201915 compared to \u201914 and then what we\u2019re assuming in the \u201916 compared to \u201915 and literally there is no real spreadsheets in there. I think we have demonstrated that we haven\u2019t able to grow our earning assets as Eric said. We have in the second half of the year started to expand the NIM. And so we think, those are things that we can continue. And we had, when you strip out all noise in Chicago, we have had maybe 4% fee growth and we are thinking that we should be able to move that up pump that up to 5 to 7 given the investments that we\u2019ve been making in the product quality and service in our commercial offerings and for example cash management and capital markets in total markets and then over in consumer the additional salesforce that we are hiring in mortgage and wealth in particular. So anyway there is no moon chops here this is just really continuing to drive the execution that we've been so good at in 2015.","Joe Hsu","And then perhaps just turning to credit quality can we just talk about the increase in the commercial non performer this quarter and then perhaps more broadly, can you just talk about what you are seeing in terms of credit quality on both the commercial and the retail side. Just starting from variable levels here but can you just talk about your expectations about reserve those off from here particularly given your strong loan growth expectations?","Bruce Van Saun","Well let me start and then I'll go first to Don to talk about commercial matter and then Eric can chime in as well but our guidance range of 375 to 425 if you consider that we were at 91 in Q4 that would annualize to roughly 365 and what happened in Q4 is that we continued with a steady level of NCOs around 31 bps and then we started to build the provision type of loan growth and earlier in the year we had back book clean up so we were effectively having credits come through to offset that need to build the reserve and so it was less pronounced earlier in the year.","We think that has pretty much run its course so now what you would expect to see is very-very modest migration on the NCOs, but they need keep building the reserve because we are going to have deepened level of loan growth so that we\u2019re calling out here so that's really what's driving that overall range we don\u2019t see anything from not at shifting in the consumer portfolio is maybe a little higher because our risk appetite has shifted, in commercial we\u2019re keeping our eye as we said on energy but nothing that is rattling us at this point and nothing really broadly across the portfolio is migrating so again we feel quite good about this range that we are offering, Don do you want to talk about.","Don McCree","Yes I would eco everything that Bruce said I think as I look across the entire portfolio we continue to feel very good about it and it's highly diversified we have got our eyes on oil and gas and then describe that the quite picking non formers in the fourth quarter was one real estate situation which we've had our eyes on for several years it just slipped into a nonperforming status so it is something we've been aware of it's been reserved and really has no overall impact on the credit quality of the broad book.","Bruce Van Saun","Eric, anything?","Eric Aboaf","So overall NCOs where relatively steady in the range 1.60 billion this quarter up from 1.35 billion so just up 25 million and kind of within the range of what we've seen so clearly a place for us to be watchful and careful but it is been in line with our expectations.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","I think maybe just sort of a follow-up on the prior question about levers to pull if the rate outlook becomes for us I guess more flattish and I think specifically what I\u2019d do with that is the volume is about at 540 where you have got the 1% to 1.5% efficiency or variable so I guess that Eric if you can just talk about what kind of stuff is already baked in and I imagine that's sort of top two related stuff in that 1% to 1.5% and then it should be rate outlook not 10 out of the 4 the coverage you suggested where maybe some places that you would have additional leverage on the cost side that you would be thinking about these initially?","Eric Aboaf","Yes there is always opportunity I mean just to share the big picture right we are continuing to invest in a discipline way on expenses on headcount at the frontend kind of the frontend sale and we continue to spend some on technology and you see that coming through so this past year we had that real effect of the top one program and part of the top two program coming through and that shows you on Page 40. A real sizeable efficiency pay I think as you look through next year right what we\u2019re starting to see is that continuation of the top two savings I think we mapped that out in quite a bit of detail this past summer and there is at least a percentage point of savings that will come from that incremental to 2015 and so we have high confidence there.","I think beyond that we are obviously disciplined as we go so over decide transforming the operations and working on procurement right there is always the long list of opportunities that we focus on we have done de-layering in the past but that doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t go back and make sure that our headcount expansion is very disciplined on the frontend sale and continue to look at some of the middle office and back office personnel so well they have to do that and I think the easy part of that a down graph over and above up to is that if revenues don\u2019t come in, in certain areas where it could be more to give for example then you are not paying out commissions so that naturally falls to the bottom-line. Beyond that, that we are going to have to work hard and find the areas to address and you could imagine we don\u2019t put a budget like this together without having a list of 3, 4, 5, 6 items that we are already working on in contingency that we can pull if we don\u2019t see the economic activity that we would have anticipated.","Bruce Van Saun","I would just add Scott, it's Bruce that, Top II was a little different in its composition than the first top program so we said that maybe 60% of the benefit was going to come from revenues and 40% on expenses. And so one of the reasons that we feel confident in our higher revenue outlook is that things like our checkup program and pricing initiatives and alike are giving us some momentum on the revenue comps. So you are going to see that and that\u2019s a little bit of the difference. We do have a commitment to continue its improvement and so if there was a Top I and there was a Top II you can speculate that there might be a Top III coming down the road. But that\u2019s the way we want to operate this place is to constantly look to make sure we are running the bank better and that we are maximizing the utility at every expense and investment dollar that we have. And the last thing I would say is that if the rate hikes don\u2019t happen it's not just an expense lever that we would look to as I said in the answer to Joe. There is also the other things back on Page 39 in terms of can we drive a little more asset growth, can we focus a little more on the mix to try to get the yield up. So I think there is some embedded offset potentially raising NII to compensate to that but yes you are right. Expenses were clearly at the stock market is saying -- what they are saying we don\u2019t know it's not always a great leading indicator but if revenue growth was a little hard to come by, we have certainly have to go back and look at your expenses again.","Operator","And next question will come from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Within your guidance you have 6% to 8% loan growth next year, could you speak to the drivers of that loan growth between whether it's portfolio of purchases or organic growth? And then what mix of assets do you expect to drive most in that growth?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes sure, I\u2019ll start but in 2015 I think we were roughly 80% own originated and maybe 20% or so was purchased and that\u2019s really on the consumer side. And it started out being more purchase of auto and as we have ramped up our own capabilities in prime auto origination we have scaled back the auto purchases. We still like the student space and we struck a relationship with SoFi and so we now are purchasing some student loans and fewer auto loans. So I would expect to broadly see that and overtime we will be just be opportunistic on purchases and as we keep putting offense and putting more originators out there we may be able to fully lit our appetite on own originations. But for now we think we are getting some very high quality assets that really fit the profile of what we can do on our own and augment the growth rate a little bit. So maybe I could -- and I\u2019d say the other thing is that we are pretty balanced in terms of the growth coming between consumer and commercial you can see that in Q4, there is good balance between the opportunities in commercial and consumer. So we are growing on both sides but maybe I will flip it to Brad and then Don just to quickly offer where they see the opportunities in the aspect of booked.","Brad Conner","Yes Bruce I mean I think you did a very nice job of letting it out. I think one of the areas that we have seen a lot of growth in 2015 has been the student OEM and we are still very optimistic about that there is good momentum assuming and I think that will be a driver of organic growth for us. You talked about it we had slowed down the purchase of this skews to offset but that\u2019s really more of a maintenance mode as opposed to growing but we like the relationship with SoFi which will supplement the loan growth in student. We expect to see some continued growth in mortgage. We have actually been in position where our home equity portfolio has been going down a little bit of time in 2015. But we are reaching that point now not abstaining meet back into the growth mode, so we have a very-very strong application and closing quarter in the fourth quarter in home equity and we will probably see. It would be modest I think you can probably see some growth in home equity. But the nice thing about build asset classes that we are talking about during your growth is you are contributing to our improving yield to non-proving margins.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, exactly and not to mention the afterlife back end which has very attractive merging.","Brad Conner","Exactly.","Bruce Van Saun","Don?","Don McCree","And on the commercial side, we were very pleased with what we saw last year. Our growth areas which were real estate, industry verticals, mid-corporate and franchise finance, so we saw solid double-digit growth in all of those verticals while also keeping a good pricing discipline and a good credit discipline which I think is the balancing access we will continue to focus on in 2016. And in '16 we expect to see some more growth in the middle market, we did quite a lot of hiring across our middle market since last year and it's taking a little while for those new bankers to begin to ramp and begin to get traction, so we expect to continue to see good growth what we saw in '15 and get a little bit of incremental growth out of our mid market channel. So overall we're expecting to grow slightly lower than 10% in terms of loan and interest growth. And the other thing we think we will see in '16 is even more acceleration in the fee lines as we begin to take advantage of some of the investments that we've made around capital markets and treasury services in particular.","Bruce Van Saun","Great. Eric, anything to add?","Eric Aboaf","No, that's a wrap.","Kevin Barker","You mentioned the Apple program driving some growth. Could you speak to you where you expect that to go, over the next couple of quarters given that you had $220 million on your balance sheet as of the fourth quarter and then what your expectations are for a mix of yield compared to your other portfolio off of that programming?","Brad Conner","Yes this is Brad, as and may be Eric had mentioned in his comments we ended the year at $220 million in balances and we would expect we continue to see that to grow. I would tell you it's a little hard to pin down exactly where we see it going for a couple of reasons. We're actually somewhat limited in the scope of that initiative to-date in that it's available only in the Apple store and it's only available for the current model. So there will be a few drivers that dictate where that program goes, do you expand that beyond just the Apple store, do you later launch new product do you extend the program beyond just the current model following and so forth. So I guess the way I would sum that up is we would certainly expect to see volume in one quarter in a row we're one quarter in and we generated $220 million so you're certainly going to see growth. There is some questions to how fast that growth will be given some of those parameters. We're very pleased with the program we think we provided a very good customer experience. Can't speak for Apple but I think they would say the same. They're very pleased with how the program is going so far. So we\u2019re optimistic it is a nice program and there are nice assets for us in terms of yield and more jobs, so very attractive return for us.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. To summarize that I think the wildcards are when do they open the online offering, beyond just the stores, which we\u2019re working through with them and then when do they launch their new phones which you'd have to ask them not us. Those are the things that could really spur an uptick. And then the thing we like about this too is these loans generally have a relatively high yield and so not too dissimilar from credit card balances, and they don\u2019t have the same acquisition costs to us as credit card balances and growing a credit card book so, it's a relatively efficient way for us to increase a nice higher yielding asset class.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore, please go ahead.","John Pancari","I wanted to just dig in a little bit more into the commercial real estate portfolio you put up some pretty good growth in the fourth quarter. Wanted to see if you can give us little bit, around your thoughts on your ability to continue to grow that I know that's still a notably undersized portfolio for you at Citizens and also I know the spreads in that business are getting incredibly thin, so where do you see the opportunities within commercial real estate to grow?","Bruce Van Saun","I'll have Don answer that one.","Don McCree","So you know we've had a portfolio historically which has been largely the REIT portfolio which has generally been lower margin than our overall real estate book right now. A couple of years ago we began to move into the construction lending business which is higher margin, so we have seen our margins in real estate on a blended basis go up and we expect to continue to see that. As I think Eric mentioned we took down a lot of business over the last two or three years with very targeted sponsors and very targeted NSAs on the construction side and we\u2019ve only just started to fund a lot of that. So there's some embedded growth in the book that we expect to see just as private mature and we begin to fund up commitments that we've made already.","We think we can grow the construction businesses at between a little over 10% as we move into 2016 we're seeing you know good flows. I expect the weak business to stay roughly flattish and that's the lower margin business so I think you'll see blended growth of slightly under 10% and margin uptick as we roll through '16. And I think as you mentioned margin, we are cognizant of where we might be in the real estate cycle it\u2019s been a very-very strong market for the last several years. We're not saying that in positive dynamics are changing we don\u2019t really see the terms changing but we're keeping an eye on that as we go into '16 and we will be disciplined based on what we see the marketplace doing.","John Pancari","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess on that same general point can you help us with the and give us the average new loan yield that you're seeing on new production in some of your main portfolios including commercial real estate but as well as in your other loan portfolios in commercial and consumer?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. Let me give you that kind of directionally, but it\u2019s -- the loans yields on new production actually move around quite a bit quarter-by-quarter so let me just kind of give you some directional information. If you think about some of the core portfolios that we have, I think we have said previously and I\u2019ll reemphasize that as we\u2019ve grown in industry verticals middle market and franchise finance. We tend to put yields on that are higher than the portfolio to the tune of 30 to 40 basis points it moved around quite a bit by quarter, but you get good benefit there that are actually average of your yields. And that has been part of the reason why we\u2019ve been able to hold yields steady in commercial. You also get a bit of an uptick in asset finance that is where it is kind of 10 basis points over the average portfolio.","And then the areas where you get a little less commercial real estate, you get a little less 10 basis points, but I think we for the right risks of term, we feel like there is good economics there. And something like in the corporate, which we\u2019ve not emphasized as much, because it tends to be higher grade clients you get it to narrative of 30 to 40 basis points in your mortgage originations, but more of a cross sell and bigger wallet into the cross sell. So there is kind of a mix of facts and that\u2019s in a way the texture that we used as the management team we got where do we want to emphasize, how much we want invest in these different areas. Don mentioned some of the hiring in middle market quite an obvious place for us to hire and to continue strengthen because of that 30 to 40 basis point lift that we get and across all that comes with that whether it is deposits or cash management. And that\u2019s kind of part of the, I guess the tool set and the specificity at which we\u2019re carefully driving growth, margin and getting the NIM to where we like it to be.","Bruce Van Saun","And Brad just on the consumer side, the kind of rough gross yields, roughly 5% on student kind of run though for the kind of a couple of those relationships?","Brad Conner","Yes, you bet. So we\u2019re about a 50-50 mix on student between fixed and variable and our variable yields on student would be somewhere in the 4 to 5 range, of course it\u2019s first day price on fixed size would be somewhere in 6 to 8 range it is a little higher on initial program as opposed to the refi program because that\u2019s a little bit higher quality asset. So more like 605 more like 8 on the initial program, so that\u2019s what should lead to those yield improvement for us as we grow the student business, really being the mid-30s in auto. And it\u2019s a variable rate product obviously that you thought would be in the low-30s.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to line of Vivek Junenja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Vivek Junenja","Number one, just couple of shorter term, and near-term ones, the terms under consumer agreement on auto loans are you still buying loans for them and just reduce shopping and we have better stand? Any color on that?","Bruce Van Saun","I\u2019ll start and Brad if you want to call out. But we\u2019re buying at a rate of around 750 would be our target for 2016. And that deal runs a little bit into the first half of 2017. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re at.","Brad Conner","Yes I think that\u2019s right we did 200 million of purchases in the fourth quarter which was down from the third quarter again probably didn\u2019t arrange that well, deal a very good one.","Vivek Junenja","And certainly with the near-term, does deposit cost given the December rate hikes, have you seen any change in the rates that you are seeing from your competitors or your year-end flow?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Vivek, it\u2019s Eric. Let me take that. As expected, right the first hike has not result in a lot of movement in rate. So that was the speculation everyone had which is the Fed moved and there is a call for a big shift. So let me kind of decompose for you, on the retail side there has literally been no movement. They have actually been up to down fixed in a few geographies and obviously we look at everything, we look at every geography, every city, we are looking at the online players and we\u2019re looking at the community banks. And it\u2019s actually been very-very quite there.","And so that gives us some confidence, that the betas that we\u2019ve been talking about are sound and as you recall the betas are kind of over the cycle betas. So the data on retail is going to be quite low for the first rate hike for a couple of quarters. So that I think bodes well for us. On the commercial side, there is always the job volume, because commercial clients have done a lot out there their loans re-pricing a LIBOR and some of them comeback on deposits and obviously that\u2019s the business we\u2019re in, I think there wasn\u2019t much change in December with what you saw a little bit in January.","And I think as you see the months stay through February and March, we\u2019ll have some amount of uptick and so it could be a little bit, but you\u2019re talking a handful of basis points on that side. And so as you look at it, we actually have some confidence we\u2019ll deliver good, deposit pricing in the first quarter, today it is some nice corresponding uptick on loan yield, because those on the commercial side [Multiple Speakers] and that's a big driver for the 5 basis point higher NIM guidance in the first quarter.","Vivek Junenja","Okay, great and perfect. I have a longer question looking at your guidance. Your noninterest income guidance I want you to clarify the rates that you have given that 5% to 7% rate does it just based on reported noninterest income, which include securities gains and secondly very strong quarter on the net interest income and the fourth quarter given that on the 5% to 7% growth are you assuming still soft capital markets, is that's what's keeping it low. Could you talk or give a little more color on that on those two?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. Look I first off in the phase I think there is an element of securities gains, which I think will continue, so I think we will from time-to-time be making repositioning decisions in the portfolio and as we kind of cross up $5 million or $10 million here and there that's I think ongoing income, so as you would expect to see, so yes so the noninterest end guidance covers the whole category. ","When you strip out some of those like one timers like the impact of Chicago, we think we grew about 4% last year and the 5% to 7% growth guidance is really where you get the uptick, I think if you would look for the uptick with the rebound in capital markets hopefully that market stabilizes, and the leverage credit markets and that won't be a drag away like it was in Q4 and were building at our product capability, so as we've moved away from RBS, we've had to add our own capabilities and we were sharing some of those dollars with RBS and that was dollars 400% to us when we get our broker dealer stead off and when we move off on to our own FX and derivatives platform there is additional revenue opportunities that come from that.","We've invested in the cash management business and are doing a better job across selling, we've gone out and hired more sales resources to get better penetration, as our whole product is set, so we some good upside on the commercial side, and similarly on consumer, if we can get the mortgage business going in the let's say we took a little pause here in the fourth quarter, as we had to move and be focused on our system and the rest curtailer compliance I think that goes well and will provide some lift and then well we are very under penetrated as well and I think we had a great recruiting quarter in Q4, we've got in 12 FCs best quarter we've had in the long-long time coincidently or not we have had a new competitive well, we have high hopes for so in both mortgage and loans we have new leadership and I think both have hit the ground running.","So I think it's a bit across the board and yes you are right it's the great if we could exceed 5 to 7 but I think fees in general in the industry have been a little sluggish in the environment and so I think we're just being measured and hopefully that's a range that we can step up from 4 and get into that 5 to 7, Eric do you want to add anything.","Eric Aboaf","And I\u2019d just add that the anchor on fees is the first one right sort of charges and fees which is cash management as well as certain charge on deposits overdraft and cart fees and so forth so it is the core of what we do that sort of start in key line is over 40% of our total fees that was up 2% for the year, but up 8% year-over-year this quarter why because some of those fees or increases that we've talked about as product cost to our time of place really and so I think we have some confidence that that can an anchor the fee growth of 5% to 7% and then given that that 40% of the fee line and then some of the other areas that we've covered, I think all the areas where we\u2019re really driving hard on and will update as we go during the year.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Eads","On the last point on the service fees, can you just talk obviously a pretty good progress there, can you talk about how much of that was related to commercial fees versus retail and then maybe kind of what you think you are and how much more opportunities there is from the re-pricing and reselling of the contracts on the commercial deposit side?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. Let me start there and there is some textures that I'd like to weight in. I think the way to look at that is that there is probably order management around the 5 million to 6 million of increase so we saw there from the fee re-pricing and the cash management and that covers that's nice on the commercial stock, as well as some of what we do in cash management on the consumer side. Followed by just some a little bit of uptick in seasonality that will get in 4Q, so that's the kind of the anchor point that caused a $6 million drop. Now that wasn\u2019t there in the first three quarters of this year but should grow through consistently for four quarters next year and that's the basis, gives it a little more in that fee increase that caused to $5 million to $6 million just trying a little more but I think we've seen the both of this and now we are coming back at parity levels of fees right we are not planning to fee we\u2019re just trying to catch up for not having re-pricing four or five years and we feel like we\u2019re at a good point with our clients and with the value that we offer.","Don McCree","And Eric the only thing I would add, it's Don, is we\u2019ve seen with some of the sales hires that we made, particularly on the transaction banking side, good momentum and actually incremental business away from price increases. The challenge there is, its long lead-times in terms of clients are moving their business from one bank to another due to technology. And then it's a question of rate of ramp of actual utilization. So I\u2019d say our momentum on winning business is ahead of the revenue progression. And that will be incremental for 2016 to just I am sure as to exactly the speed of it.","Bruce Van Saun","And so I think commercial is a real opportunities because we have said we are under penetrated in terms of the products set in extent of cross-sell that we have. Brad in Europe we\u2019re trying to grow household. And so that\u2019s going to create a little bit of tailwind. And then also better penetration in business liking, I guess would be the other area.","Eric Aboaf","And we will get some of the benefit of the price increases in business plans as well. And we\u2019re driving some of it to improve cash flow, which is up about 2%.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","David Eads","Great, thanks for all that color. And then maybe Eric if you could touch a little bit more into deposit environment. What's in the efforts you guys have done and where you think the opportunities are to grow deposits, also within eye to keeping pricing as flat as possible?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, let me describe deposits at these rates, because there is working on the retail side, working on the commercial side, and there is in-depth in each one. I think in retail -- let me actually do the top of the half. I think we\u2019ve actually had a focus on increasing over the last couple of months and quarters waiting with non-price driven offer. And really focusing on that core DDA and what we call checking of interest, which is really checking on the low amount of interest.","And we have been doing that on the commercial side, on the consumer side, for the cash management product, which is the low EPR. And that\u2019s actually been growing nicely. If you actually look at this take for DDA and checking with inventory from the balance sheet, those are up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 6% year-on -year. And you can actually go back and you can see DDAs and after the last three quarters in a row, certainly with interest, the last four quarters in a row. So we are seeing the engagement with clients that are non-price driven way that we\u2019d like.","Now, we need to keep doing that and that need to be an ongoing focus. And part of what you heard about the tax management investments, it's functionality, part of what we continue to on consumers will allow revise and improve value propositions to really draw clients. And that\u2019s what I would call the heart of what we do on deposits. I think that the other part of deposit question, so there is always a little bit of slight forward again in deposits out there. And we like any bank take those logs, because they are from our clients, and our clients are only funding with us.","The issue is how you do that in a disciplined way. And so in commercial with Don arriving, we have gone back to some of the large pools of deposit that we put on close to Chicago divestiture a year ago. Those were specialty promotional deposits. And back in September after the Fed didn\u2019t go, I remember in September the Fed didn\u2019t, that\u2019s the national construct and the trade goes off of those old promotional rates.","And then obviously, we managed to a little bit of attrition, but then we reset and can grow-off a comfortable level. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve really done in commercial. And then emphasize the work, the step works needs to do on our cost out basis in that segment goes in a mirrored away that prior too long to describe here.","On the retail side, we do something similar. We\u2019re quite disciplined, region-by-region. And the Brad\u2019s team where they are thinking about where there are opportunities to continue what was on money market. But you\u2019re going see we pull back on CDs much like those the less of the industry does, and has been doing. And I think that\u2019s been fruitful. So all told I think the real nice performance across the front on interest bearing deposits down a bit, which is great to see we\u2019d obviously will keep pushing on that front.","Bruce Van Saun","Brad, do you want to add some color.","Brad Conner","Just one point I was going to add, which is I think one of the biggest opportunities we have on the consumer side is in real estate. So, we talk a lot about our investment in growing that, growing our fee business, which it will. And if you look other opportunities on the deposit side, probably [missed] opportunities, penetration of low interest or non-interest bearing deposits with our wealth customers. And we are working on a new value proposition and new deposit checking product for our wealth customers that will be growing out maybe and we think that\u2019s a very good opportunity for us.","David Eads","Just out of curiosity, do you have means for wealth management deposits at this point or is that a new opportunity?","Eric Aboaf","I would say, we do have obviously, we have wealth deposits. So I would say yes our peers were under penetrated and there is an opportunity that we can capitalize on.","Operator","And our next question in queue will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Just one follow-up question, I understand that we don\u2019t have the CCAR parameters yet. But given where your stock is trading relative to tangible book, Bruce, what is your appetite in terms of maximizing your ask relative to what you think your earnings power is going to be over the next year or two?","Bruce Van Saun","So, we\u2019ll go through the process. And I think our guidance of an 11.2 to 11.5 says that we're still going to be, I\u2019d say, moderate in our appetite as opposed to all out aggressive. And part of that reason is having a capital surplus that we\u2019re using to fund loan growth that was not our ROE today is not high enough to fund that level of loan growth. I want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of the opportunity to add customers and grow the franchise. And it's good to have a little bit of cushion there in the overall capital ratio and that helps feed the ROE, it\u2019s kind of a circle. So we\u2019ll get our ROE up then we don't need as much of a surplus.","So I would say over-time we're clearly looking to get back to the pack. And so if our peers are running at 10 or 10.5, there's no reason we shouldn't run where the peers are running. Once we're fully operating, the way we want to operate in our returns or where we want them to be, it is, I think we do look at the opportunity to buyback the stock and where it's trading. And it is attractive here, we think. And so that will be factored into our thinking.","But I just wanted to give you the guardrails were coming down on a gradual glide path, and it's somewhat also dictated by how fast we can get the ROE up, and generate more capital and then we don't need that cushion.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to the line of David Durst with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","David Durst","Good morning. I think you've covered everything. But just what would be some of the areas of concern that you could have this year, and where you had pull-back here and leads you to low end of your loan growth guidance.","Bruce Van Saun","I guess at this point, we don\u2019t see, I think good demand in housing, there'll be a little less refi than last year, but the purchase market seems pretty firm. Auto seems to be doing very strong and there's certainly a need for student debt refinancing. So, I think the drivers on the consumer side look pretty solid to us. And the one wildcard I guess is what happens with Apple iPhone upgrade, we could get a wildcard there. But hopefully is a positive surprise because I think we're being moderate in terms of how we're looking at that. And then on the commercial side, really, there'd be more cyclicality would be the concern, it's just stock market is presaging concern over a slowdown and therefore corporate CEOs and CFOs decide to pull back a little bit on investing, or on line utilization, and that could have an impact. But maybe, Don, you want to add a little\u2026","Don McCree","I think that's right. I think for me the loan growth is, it\u2019s all about the economy. And we still continue to think the U.S. economy looks pretty good, jobs looks good. So are anticipating a decent year in terms of growth. And I think it really comes down to loan demand based on commodity levels and economic activity. So, I don't think that there'd be any other variable that would cause us to say we would pull back.","Bruce Van Saun","I think the one thing, if you look at that NII walk, obviously, we don\u2019t know if the two rate hikes happened, and it's not a huge impact. I feel quite good about our ability to deliver the earning assets growth unless somehow the economy really falls out of that. But so far, it doesn\u2019t, that's not our view. We don't think that's going to happen. So, that column feels very solid. The thing that's been our challenge and we've spent a lot of time on this call talking about it is how can we make sure that we\u2019re improving our asset yields and then growing deposit costs effectively. And I think it took us a little while to really establish a rhythm on that.","But the good news is if you look at the second half for the last year, in 2015, we actually moved them up by 5 basis points. So, I think we're doing a better job at that, some of that I\u2019ll see it, because the credits of the guy on my right here Eric who\u2019re really driving that and spearheading that. But that's the thing that we really have to focus on. We can\u2019t have any leakage. So, last year, if we grew loans to 7 and we grew NII at 4, we have to, if we grow loans at 7, I want to grow NII at 7 plus. And if we can do that, I think that's really powerful in terms of the operating leverage that will deliver.","David Durst","Great, okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next call will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just a couple of very quick follow-ups. You've mentioned your exposure to energy or at least specific to the higher risk areas of energy. I just want to confirm as you said in the past the total energy portfolio remains below 1% of your loan book.","Bruce Van Saun","The total energy portfolio, I think, it's about $1.6 billion in terms of outstanding. So it\u2019s below 2%.","Matt Burnell","And then just following-up on the last set of questions, you mentioned that corporate confidence is really the big risk in your outlook for commercial lending. But it also sounds as if you've not heard that from your conversations with your borrowers, at this point. So that the downturn in the markets over the past couple of weeks really hasn't filtered through to your borrowers\u2019 sense of confidence, at this point, correct.","Eric Aboaf","I think that's correct, obviously anybody who\u2019s depending upon the high yield market or the institutional loan market is on the guidelines right now, because they\u2019re effectively close. One of the things we have heard and we just published our Fifth Annual M&A survey for mid-market companies is an expectation across our client base that M&A activity could be quite interesting in this year and the next year, just as people struggle a little bit with top-line growth and look to supplement their businesses. So, there is a desire to grow and a desire to transact out there. So, we\u2019re hearing a solid message of expansion among our clients. And that impact needed to be through combination or it could be through organic growth.","Matt Burnell","And just combining those two questions, how much of the capital markets revenue activity is energy related? I guess the question is, is there a potential for further headwind in the capital markets business coming from $25 or rather than what it averaged over 2015?","Eric Aboaf","We have very-very little in our historical pipeline around energy; most of our energy activity is in regular label lending, asset-based lending, and the like.","Matt Burnell","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And our next question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Maybe one, it makes for Don to say. When you getting through commercial credit cycles in the past, what are the early indicators that you\u2019ve seen which is started through flash back before you grow the portfolios start to deteriorate? And how are those performing this time around?","Don McCree","So I think the right answer that is, we go through, in my past and certainly now, we go through rigorous review of our portfolios on a continuous basis with our portfolio management teams. And relate those credit based on financial performance, covenant compliance, and a whole verity of different things. And we obviously did that through\u201915 and that\u2019s been very modest deterioration in credit grades. So, that\u2019s usually early signal that you start to see people missing covenants and people having financial deterioration.","The other thing in my past has been what really tends to per institutions is concentration. And we do have a very rigorous concentration management system. I think one of the interesting things that I see at Citizens is just core diversification in the portfolio given that it's a mid-market lending activity predominantly is very-very great, both on a geographic basis, on an industry basis, on an individual credit basis. So, I think there is a little bit of a hedge in the overall portfolio also.","So, we would look for credit deterioration in the terms of credit grades, we would look at any concentrations in industries that are troubled as things that we would flash really to us, so we\u2019re not seeing them to any extent at this moment.","Bruce Van Saun","Okay. Brad, I think given the time here, we probably have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. We\u2019ll go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Just two quick ones, first of all, on the expense guide for the year. Does the growth contemplate this assessment? And if it does, can you just help us understand how much that is as a part of it?","Bruce Van Saun","On what assessment, I\u2019m sorry Ken.","Ken Usdin","The deposit issuance assessment\u2026","Bruce Van Saun","We have a base care in our forecast. And we haven\u2019t, I don\u2019t think it settled out yet as to what the amount the big banks will pay and the timing on that. So, yes, we are working off the base case.","Ken Usdin","So it\u2019s in the base case, so you have it in your expense outlook?","Bruce Van Saun","We\u2019re operating on a continuum of where we\u2019ve been historically without an increase at this point, because it\u2019s not certain the timing and the amount of that increase.","Ken Usdin","So if you were to get formalize, you would then have to add that to your forecast?","Bruce Van Saun","That\u2019s correct.","Ken Usdin","Second question, Eric you\u2019ve done some good work with restructuring some of the long-term debt. And I just wanted to ask you what opportunities do you continue to have there? And also in the original debt for stock swap, preferred for stock swap, what are your plans this year as you look ahead to that original 250? So in aggregate, what opportunities you still have to lower the wholesale funding cost side?","Eric Aboaf","I think on wholesale funding, we\u2019ve done some substitute adjustments actually over the last year and half two years really when it comes to swap portfolio that I think what you\u2019ve seen in the announcement was sub-debt repurchase, which is anticipated in this summer, obviously allocated on the CCAR ask, the $500 million of the old RBS on sub-debt would be retire. And that one would obviously help with our funding costs. And then I think that is actually the rest of the program.","Obviously need to right into a little bit of senior debt where we finished with mix of fix and flowed and three year and five year. But that would be modest in size. And then I think the last part of that place and which is really one out of our treasury area is how do you continue to position the first carefully around rates and take advantage when rates pop-up a little bit, and manage around the curve and we\u2019ll keep doing that.","Bruce Van Saun","So Ken I\u2019d say the thing that presents an opportunity if you have this right to repurchase 500 of RBS and stop that. And depending on where rates are at the time, as we can refinance that with senior, which still be a spread differential to stop that versus the senior. And if we can choose it down, the amount of it that we have in the stacks. So obviously there is a full coupon saving on that. So we are working on that. We\u2019re studying that we have to consider that in our CCAR request. But there is I think some potential upside there relative to our outlook and our guidance.","Ken Usdin","Okay, so that's not contemplated in your guidance either. Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Please go ahead sir.","Bruce Van Saun","Thank you all for dialing in today and for participating in the call. And we feel that we finished the year strong, and we feel we\u2019re well positioned as we look out into 2016. So, thank you and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference for the day. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5528":["Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

My name is Brad, and I'll be your operator on the call today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.","Ellen Taylor","Thanks so much, Brad. Happy 2019 everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Our earnings release, presentation and financial supplement are available at investor.citizensbank.com. Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results along with our outlook for the year and then we will open the call for questions. ","Once again, we're pleased to have Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking with us today. And of course, I'm required to remind you that our comments will include forward-looking statements, that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations, and can be found in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. ","We'd also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our filings. And with that, it's all yours, Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to report another strong quarter today, with underlying net income up 36% and diluted EPS up 38% year-over-year. These results were paced by solid loan growth of 5% year-on-year, continued NIM expansion, which combined with good expense discipline drove 5% underlying positive operating leverage, excluding Franklin American Mortgage acquisition. Our underlying ROTCE improved to 14.1%. The underlying efficiency ratio dropped to 56.7%. Our success in hitting our new medium-term financial targets has led us to raise them again, which we will cover later in the call. For the full year, our results were also strong. Underlying net income was up 32%, and diluted earnings per share was up 38%. Our PPNR growth was 13%. We consistently exceeded expectations each quarter during the year given our disciplined execution along with favorability on credit. ","We feel very positive about the accomplishments in progress that we made in 2018. Some of the highlights from my perspective include: first, strong execution of our TOP and our BSO programs; we had excellent progress on our customer, colleague and community agendas; we had some really strong technology innovation, including the launch of Citizens Access, reaching 10 fintech partnerships and great momentum on our digital and data agenda; acceleration of our branch transformation effort with 109 branch actions delivered; and also the smooth opening of our new campus in Johnston, Rhode Island. We made 2 smart fee-based acquisitions, Franklin American Mortgage and Clarfeld Financial Advisors, and we delivered strong returns of capital to shareholders including 2 dividend increases with a dividend now up 45% year-on-year. ","We also added some great talent to the company including Ned Kelly and Terry Lillis to the board, and Michael Ruttledge, recently, as our new Head of Technology. Now as we've many peer banks, there is a disconnect between our progress on the field and our stock price in 2018, but that said, we are focused on what we can control and our expectation is that if we continue to execute well, run the bank better and better and make the right investments to grow our franchise value, then the stock will recover and better reflect our true value. The market's been concerned with the possibility of recession and rising credit costs. Our view is that a recession is unlikely in '19 or '20, and the economy is on a sound footing. We have been highly disciplined in the process of growing our balance sheet and our expectation is that we will perform better than the median super regional in the next downturn. We did moderate our loan growth somewhat in 2018 relative to our beginning of the year outlook, and we've steered away from riskier lending on both the commercial and consumer sides. ","During the choppy Q4 loan markets, we did not take any underwriting losses or have any hung deals. We've provided our usual detailed guidance for 2019 in our slide deck, which John will cover in a few minutes. The blueprint will seem very familiar, reasonable loan growth, some NIM expansion, better growth on fees, good expense discipline and positive operating leverage. Credit provision, while normalizing somewhat, should remain well behaved. And we will continue to prudently manage our capital base. ","So in summary, our expectation is for another year of good execution and further progress across the board. With that, let me turn it over to John.","John Woods","Thanks, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with improving results and a great finish to a year marked by steady execution and significant progress against our targets. We continue to run the bank better, and we are entering 2019 with nice momentum. I'll touch on some of the slides in our earnings presentation. So if you pull those up, it may assist in following along. Some highlights for the quarter are shown on Page 4. We grew our underlying EPS 38% year-on-year. We continued delivering robust positive operating leverage 5% year-on-year, excluding the impact of the Franklin American Mortgage acquisition. And we did this while making the long-term investments required for sustainable success. ","We continued to make progress on improving returns with underlying ROTCE for the quarter of 14.1%, up 61 basis point linked quarter and 3.7% year-over-year. We continue to focus on growing our customer base and loan portfolios across our Consumer and Commercial businesses, while also expanding and investing in our fee-based capabilities. This has led to consistently strong revenue growth. ","We have been disciplined on expenses giving our TOP programs and mindset of continuous improvement. This has created the capacity to make significant investments in technology, digital, data and customer experience, which positions us well for the future. This plan and our ability to execute provide a strong foundation and outlook for 2019. ","On Page 5, we provide information on some notable items this quarter, including the impact of an additional $29 million benefit tied to 2017 tax legislation. This was partially offset by other notable items totaling $26 million aftertax, largely associated with TOP V, including several real estate initiatives such as accelerated branch closures. We also recorded $12 million of aftertax integration costs related to the Franklin American acquisition. In order to make it easier to see our core trends, we will largely focus on our results without these notable items. On Page 7, you can see that we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 5% excluding the impact of Franklin. We also delivered an underlying efficiency ratio just under 57%. And our underlying PPNR growth year-over-year was 13% excluding Franklin. ","Moving to Page 10. We are pleased that despite a fairly competitive landscape, we continued to drive disciplined balance sheet growth and delivered a 2% sequential quarter increase in net interest income. And our net interest margin increased 3 basis points in the quarter, reflecting continued expansion in earning asset yields, with deposit costs in line with our expectations. ","Turning to fees on Page 11. Underlying fees increased $10 million despite a challenging market environment in the fourth quarter. This was driven by strength in global markets and the full quarter effect of Franklin. In global markets, FX generated excellent results up 16% quarter-over-quarter, due to elevated customer activity against a volatile but mostly range-bound U.S. dollar index. Our capital market fees were relatively flat linked quarter despite some major volatility and disruption in the loan and debt markets. Our loan syndications fees were up 20% linked quarter with very strong volumes leading to a record number of lead and joint lead transactions for the fourth quarter and the year. This was offset by lower bond underwriting fees given limited issuance in November and December. Additionally, we had a strong quarter and M&A revenue as we gained leverage from our Western Reserve Partners acquisition.","On the Consumer side of the house, we now have a full quarter of fees from Franklin and the integration is on track. We also saw continued traction in our Wealth business with a 4% linked-quarter increase in managed money revenues and 19% growth year-over-year. On Page 12, we continue to focus on balancing expense discipline with the need to fund investments to drive future revenue growth. As a result, excluding the impact of Franklin, linked quarter expenses were down $5 million, reflecting the benefit of a decrease in FDIC insurance expense. We utilized some of this benefit to fund strategic growth initiatives while maintaining strong expense discipline overall. ","Let's move on to Page 13 and discuss the balance sheet. We continue to focus on prudently growing our balance sheet in a fairly competitive environment. We saw some nice growth in commercial loans in our industry verticals and in our geographic expansion areas. We remain very selective about CRE but are still finding some attractive opportunities for growth in areas like tenant-secured office and industrial distribution facilities. On the retail side, we continue to see good traction in some of our attractive risk-adjusted return categories like education and unsecured as well as important categories like mortgage. ","Overall, we grew core loans by 2% linked quarter and 5% year-over-year, notwithstanding the impact from the planned runoff in auto, noncore and leasing, which was around $1.7 billion or 1.5% year-over-year. Core loan yields improved by 14 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of the 11 basis point improvement we saw in the third quarter. ","We continue to see good results from our balance sheet optimization efforts, which in the quarter delivered about 4 basis points of 14 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year before the impact of Franklin. ","Turning to Page 14. I am pleased with what we were able to accomplish in deposits this quarter. We continue to do a nice job of growing deposits, which were up 1% linked quarter and 4% year-over-year. In particular, we continue to see gains in DDA balances, which were up about 3% year-on-year and approximately 1% before the impact of Franklin. This is the sixth consecutive quarter we have grown DDA on a year-over-year basis. This growth is led by strength on the consumer side where our deposit initiatives are really paying off and DDA balances are up 4.5% year-on-year, ex Franklin. Our total deposit costs were well controlled, up 9 basis points, which was better than the 10 basis points we saw last quarter. ","Interest-bearing deposit costs rose at a slower pace again this quarter, increasing 12 basis points compared with a 14 basis point increase in the third quarter and 15 basis point increase in the second quarter. Our cumulative beta on interest-bearing deposits is in the mid-30s, as expected, and remains in line with our overall expectations given where we are in the rate cycle. We are benefiting from investments we've been making in Consumer that began back in 2016 in areas like enhancing our product suite, improving the customer experience through our customer journeys work and in analytics to improve our customer targeting. In Commercial, we are making investments to build out additional product capabilities like escrow services, and are rolling out our new cash management platform in 2019. Also, Citizens Access has contributed nicely to our funding diversification and optimization of deposit levels and costs. By year-end, we reached about $3 billion in deposits, having launched in mid-July. While this remains a relatively modest part of our overall deposit strategy, we continue to be very pleased with the progress so far. We now have over 30,000 customers through Citizens Access, with 96% of these deposits from new deposit customers and the average account size is about $72,000. ","Year-over-year, our asset yields expanded 55 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and the impact of our BSO initiatives. Our total cost of funds was up 44 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher rates and a continued shift to greater long-term funding. This included the impact of the $750 million senior debt issuance late in the first quarter of 2018. ","Next, let's move to Page 15 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be excellent, reflecting the continued mix shift towards higher-quality, lower-risk retail loans and an improving risk profile in our commercial book. The nonperforming loan ratio improved to 68 basis points of loans this quarter, down from 79 basis points a year ago. The net charge-off rate of 29 basis points for the fourth quarter was relatively stable linked quarter and year-over-year. Retail net charge-offs reflect improvement in auto, which helped offset expected seasoning in the unsecured portfolio. Commercial net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were up modestly compared with the prior year, which benefited from higher recoveries. ","Overall, we feel good about credit metrics and trends in the book including a continued decline in criticized asset levels. Our allowance to loans coverage ratio ended the quarter at 1.06%, reflecting continued improvement in the loan mix towards higher-quality retail portfolios and improved rating agency-equivalent risk ratings in Commercial. The NPL coverage ratio improved to 156% as we saw 4% reduction in NPLs linked quarter with continued runoff in the noncore portfolio. ","Investors continued to be worried about a challenging macroeconomic environment and the potential for increased credit costs, but we continue to feel good about our risk management talent and profile, and our overall credit quality trends continue to be variable. We've included some good slides on Page 27 through 31 from a recent conference presentation on this topic, in case you missed them. ","On Page 16, we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions, ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.6% compared to 10.8% in the third quarter. This quarter, we repurchased $300 million of common stock and returned a total of $427 million to shareholders including dividends. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.32 a share, which is a 19% increase over the prior quarter. With this increase, the dividend is now 45% higher than it was a year ago.","Our achievements against our enterprise-wide initiatives are highlighted on Page 17. We continue to make traction on our balance sheet optimization efforts as we recycle capital out of lower-return categories like auto and leasing, where the core yields have improved and the portfolios have increased significantly, and we redeployed that capital against higher-return categories like our education refi and Merchant Finance portfolios as well as in higher-return relationships in Commercial. Balance sheet optimization contributed 5 basis points of our 17 basis points full year 2018 versus 2017 margin improvement. Additionally, we continue to deliver beyond expectations in our TOP programs, where we now expect TOP IV to deliver about $115 million in pretax run rate benefits. As we work on expanding our capabilities, in Consumer we completed the acquisition of Clarfeld Financial Advisors. Clarfeld provides a unique opportunity to accelerate our strategy of building a highly competitive wealth management business to serve some of the most affluent markets in the country where we operate. They have sophisticated high net worth and ultrahigh net worth offerings that will really complement our wealth platform. Most noteworthy in the quarter on the commercial side is the launch of commodities hedging services as well as a modest high-yield sales and trading operation. ","Given a further tax benefit from the 2017 tax legislation, we were able to accelerate a number of our efficiency initiatives including a significant acceleration of our branch modernization efforts. And as we bring TOP IV to a successful close, our TOP V initiatives are well underway. Bottom line, we've been able to successfully lean forward with our longer-term strategy, while also executing well and delivering strong results in the near term. On Page 18, you can see the steady and impressive progress we are making against our financial targets. This quarter, we hit the middle of the range of our 13% to 15% medium-term ROTCE target set in January 2018. ","Since third quarter of '13, our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 14.1% underlying and our efficiency ratio has improved by 11 percentage points from 68% to 57% and EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well up to $0.98 on an underlying basis from $0.26. ","On Page 19, we review our full year performance against the guidance we provided at the start of 2018 as it's always good to hold ourselves accountable. You can see mostly green ticks on the right column demonstrating another year of strong execution against the backdrop of slower loan growth across the industry. We remain focused on improving the fee income line through both organic initiatives to expand capabilities as well as through smart targeted acquisitions.","On Page 20, we detail our guidance for 2019. Quite similar to 2018, with good top line growth, a 3% underlying positive operating leverage target excluding Franklin and Clarfeld, further efficiency ratio improvement and capital normalization.","A few points of color. We expect reasonably strong loan growth similar to 2018 in the range of 3.5% given the unique opportunities to capitalize investments in people and products. Growth will continue to be focused in the areas we believe offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. We project NIM to be of low to mid-single digits despite no short rate increases on the forecast and a flattish curve. This reflects continued execution of our balance sheet optimization efforts. We expect continued growth in noninterest income in the 11% to 13% range as we leverage our investments and expand the capabilities and continue to invest for the future. This is 4% to 6%, excluding the impact of Franklin and Clarfeld. ","We expect credit quality to remain well controlled with provision normalizing towards the range of $400 million to $450 million. We expect our CET1 at the end of the year to be around 10.2% with a dividend payout ratio in the range of 30% to 35%. Our outlook for the first quarter is on page 21 and it reflects continued momentum in both our top and bottom line results. The first quarter is typically a seasonally softer quarter for us given several factors, including day count, seasonal activity levels and FICA taxes associated with incentive compensation. ","We expect linked quarter average loan growth to be around 1% given strong commercial lending pipelines and solid growth in education and retail unsecured. We expect NIM and NII to be broadly stable reflecting no rate hike and no impact on NII. Noninterest income should be broadly stable as a rebound in capital market fees is expected to offset seasonal impacts. We expect noninterest expense to be up in the low to mid-single digits given seasonal factors like FICA taxes on incentives. In addition, we expect provision expense to remain relatively stable. And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to end the first quarter around 10.5%. ","Overall, our view for the quarter reflects continued strong execution against our plan. So now, let me turn it back to Bruce.","Bruce Van Saun","Thanks, John. Turning to Page 22. Let's shift gears and focus on where we're taking Citizens over the medium term. We have a mission to really make a difference for our customers, colleagues and communities so that they can reach their potential. Banks that can deliver this will build long-term franchise value and stand out in a crowded banking landscape. And we are committed to getting the balance right between building long-term franchise value while also delivering consistent earnings growth and attractive returns. ","The bottom of the page shows where we will differentiate to be successful. First off is our culture. We have a very powerful customer-centric culture. Next is our discipline around how we're trying to run the bank better each and everyday. I think our financial and operating discipline is fairly unique amongst the regional banks. And lastly, we are committed to excellence being a trusted advisor, having great leaders, having great digital capabilities, a great ability to use data, those things that will really distinguish us.","On Page 23, let me identify some of the keys to taking our financial performance to the next level. There's 3 things that I would point to that are listed here on this page. First, what's gotten us this far are the same things that should propel us further. So having a top leadership team, having a good game plan, a good ability to execute and make the investments that position us for long-term growth, those things will continue to propel us forward. I look at what we've accomplished over the past 5 years as a great foundation for an even better next 5 years. Next, the enterprise-wide initiatives like our TOP program and our balance sheet optimization program still have a good amount of running room, and they are fairly differentiating for us relative to our peers. And then lastly, we're doing a very good job of not only delivering and putting points on the board with our short-term execution, but we're spending a lot of time thinking about our long-term strategy, thinking about what's changing in the banking environment, what's changing in technology, what are the investments we need to make to continue to be successful and position us to drive strong franchise value. And it boils down to some extent to a growth mindset, to look for those opportunities where we can find new revenue pools, new ways of doing business, new ways of serving customers, and we feel good about our ability to do just that.","On Page 24, we present our new medium-term financial targets. You can see that we've outlined our expectations for the overall economic environment, which is relatively constructive. Our the medium term, we expect to deliver continued improvement in ROTCE, moving our target range up by 1% to 14% to 16%. We are not expecting much in the way of further rate increases and while GDP growth will slow relative to 2018, we do not expect a recession anytime soon. ","The key to the continued ROTCE improvement is continuing to deliver positive operating leverage, and there TOP and BSO will be appointed to this given the potential for fewer tailwinds from the environment. We expect to see continued efficiency ratio improvement down towards 54%, we also expect to see some normalization in credit from the excellent performance that we're seeing today. And we continue to be focused on returning capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over this time frame, we would expect to reduce our CET1 ratio towards our target of around 10%. ","So to sum up, on Page 25, we feel that we've delivered strong results in Q4 and for the full year 2018. We are focused on growing the bank in profitable and sustainable ways and we will continue to deliver improved efficiency and effectiveness. We feel our balance sheet remains robust and our credit position is in great shape. And as we head into 2019, we feel very good about our ability to grow the business and drive towards our new targets. As you know, we've been a public company now for about 4 years. At the outset, we had a lot of work to do to, to address the issues that arose from the challenges faced by RBS. Today, the feeling inside Citizens is that we've turned the corner. We've addressed many of the challenges we faced at our IPO. We have demonstrated our ability to set a course, develop a plan and execute that plan. We have a long-standing effort to drive ROTCE higher, drive our efficiency ratio down, normalize the capital ratio and grow EPS. And we have made good steady progress on that path, quarter in and quarter out. We are now in a new phase that we're calling Aiming For Excellence, on our way towards becoming a top-performing regional bank. ","So with that, Operator, let's open it up for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will go to line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill.","Robert Siefers","Let's see. First question, so fees had little bit of noise in the fourth quarter just given the seizure in the capital markets, but it looks like you got traction in most of the other major line items. I guess just as you look out at -- into 2019, within your guidance, can you maybe, either John or Bruce, talk a little about sort of the complexion and the main drivers that you see to get to you -- to your guide for the full year?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. I'll start, John, you can offer additional color. But I think the first area that will really power the kind of underlying 4% to 6% fee growth that we have excluding Franklin and Clarfeld is a bounce-back year in Capital Markets. So we see good pipelines going into the first quarter. The bond markets are starting to loosen and so I think we'll see some good revenues coming out of loan syndications. I think we've got really good traction now in our M&A business. We're going a good job of cross-selling that, the Western Reserve capabilities into our customer base, so we feel good about that. Our Global Markets FX and IRP capability continues to grow. We're doing more than we did under RBS. We're doing a good job of penetrating the customer base. So those would be, I think, the key drivers on the commercial side. We are rolling out a new cash management platform so we have ambition to also pick up the growth a bit in Treasury Solutions. On the Consumer side, I think Wealth is well positioned for success this year. We've made, I think, the right investments to get the right size of sales force in place, the right approach to selling, the right product capability. We're doing more managed money sales. So I think we have a very good outlook for underlying wealth even excluding what we're doing with Clarfeld. And then our card business also, I think, we're going to make some progress. We have reinvigorated that a little bit and we're starting to see some signs of growth there. Anything you'd like to add, John?","John Woods","Yes, no, I think you pretty much covered the highlights. I think the key message being that even without the deals, Clarfeld and Franklin, we're seeing nice growth and then you will see the full year effects of both Franklin and Clarfeld that you'll see that's also built into our guidance. But I think you hit the important points without Franklin and Clarfeld on both Commercial and Consumer.","Robert Siefers","Perfect. And then separately appreciate the new medium-term targets. I had one quick question on the updated capital ratios. So just if I look at things, you guys, obviously, have a very robust starting point. Just curious as you're looking at refreshing the targets if there's any thought to becoming, perhaps, even a bit more aggressive than the 10% CET1 target? And just overall what the thinking was in how you arrived at 10% as the appropriate number?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. So if you recall, last January, we had a 10% to 10.25% as our target range. We've taken the 10.25% range out and so we just moved the target to 10%. I do think we're going through a transition where the regional banks may look to push the capital ratios down a bit. There is -- the Fed proposal's out. And as we've said in the past, we don't see any reason why we can't operate at the median of our peers. So if that moves down to 9.5%, say, then I think you could see us, in the future, making adjustment and over time bring that back to where the peers are. So we are -- that may be a tad conservative to leave it at 10%. That's where we're leaving it for now. Obviously, it would drive up and have positive implications on our ROTCE if we ran it at a little more levered.","John Woods","Yes, it's okay. Maybe just add that I think it served us well to have this gradual glide path that we've been on. Given that, as Bruce mentioned earlier, we just went IPO 4 years ago, and we continue to find new opportunities to deploy capital, which is clearly our primary goal to deploy capital in excess of cost of capital and so whether that's through loan growth or targeted fee-based acquisitions, we've been pleased with the flexibility that this glide path has created for us. So we'll continue to balance that as we look towards that target.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","So, Bruce, we heard you loud and clear that you noted -- somehow your stock gets more of a discount when the market is worried about a recession, and we appreciate all the back data that you've given us. Given that everybody's credit quality looks great right now, and the underlying FICO looks similar across your peers, maybe give us a little more perspective? I think you brought up a good point that you were only a public company 4 years ago and so perhaps give us perspective on the catch up that you had to do since you emerged out of RBS and how that has contributed to above peer growth rates?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, sure, Erika. I'll start with that point first and there's a good slide in the appendix that shows that as RBS ran into its challenges and needed to raise capital levels, Citizens being owned by RBS had to rundown its assets, did not receive TARP funding. And so when you ultimately delever and you're in a high fixed-cost business, it really hurts your profitability. So part of our strategy here in recovering the bank's profitability was we needed to grow assets and gain that leverage back. And I think we've done that in a very, very disciplined way. On the Consumer side, we've decided to grow our mortgage business, which brings two things. It brings fees but it also brings high-quality assets. But then we also look for some niches like education refinance loans, where we're one of the leaders, if not the leader, in the market, which is I think a very great product, a, for the borrower and for society but also good for us in terms of risk-adjusted returns.","And then our merchant financing partnerships with Apple and others and stay tuned, more to come, those also I think offer very good risk-adjusted returns and we have typically a loss-sharing arrangement with our partner. So I feel really good on the Consumer side that we've been disciplined and we've had a desire to grow but we've been very careful in where we're growing. And then on the Commercial side, similarly, we've scaled up the business by hiring some great bankers. We've got really good credit people, starting with Don, who is here with me in the room but also on our credit team. And so I think we've brought over some new relationships to the bank that come with the bankers that we hire, the seasoned banker that we hired. So we've grown in our industry verticals, which tend to be bigger companies, which tend to be better credits and when we've gone into new regions, we tend to focus on the bigger companies there as well, which tend to be higher-quality credit. So another slide in the appendix shows that even just over the past year, the quality of the credit book in Commercial and in Consumer has improved. So we are not growing for growth sake. We're growing in very disciplined fashion, both on the Commercial side and the Consumer side.","Erika Najarian","And my follow-up question is as we think about net interest margin dynamics, looking forward, if the Fed is on a prolonged pause, how should we think about the dynamics beyond 1Q '19? And typically in your previous observations, how many quarters after the last rate hike does deposit repricing start really tapering off?","John Woods","Yes, I'll go ahead and take that one. So we -- it's hard to know exactly but I think we model out something in the neighborhood of 6 to 12 months post the final Fed hike where deposit costs lag starts to continue to burn in, a little bit higher earlier in that period and just kind of tapers off over that first year is how we model it out. I think the dynamics you should think about is, remember, our portfolio is about 50% floating, about 50% fixed and even if the Fed doesn't hike, we still have this momentum of that front book on the 50% that's fixed that continues to reprice over the remaining lives of those assets as long as loan rates don't fall. And so that's why you're seeing the fact that we're still confident that we can continue to drive NIM growth because of that dynamic in terms of how we're organized, and that will be net positive. In addition to that, we have our management's actions and BSO that we will add to that, that will help solidify our confidence that we can continue to drive NIM going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","I just want to follow up on the asset quality question because -- I agree with Erica, the bottom line is you've been delivering very strong results and I do think in a selloff, people worry about your credit quality, even though all the metrics have been very strong. And I think the slide you have on Page 28 that shows the commercial book and how the quality has been improving, it's helpful. But there isn't a lot of focus on things like leveraged lending, which I'm not really sure people fully understand if that really is where the risk is and what it is, but maybe just talk a little more detail about the process of how you think about managing risk in the commercial book, what the -- how involved you are, Bruce, which I would guess is very involved, as you think about some of the big credits? And just how you can change this perception that's out there, which seems to be blown out of proportion in my opinion.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I agree with that, Matt, and let me start, and then Don certainly is well positioned to offer the color on this. At the top of the house, we want to have diversity and granularity in terms of our credit exposures and so we do run a leveraged lending limit and we kind of run it very tightly and try to get a lot of throughput against that limit. So the goal, ultimately, when we are doing sponsored leveraged loans, for example, is to serve customers that we've known for a long time, that we have confidence that they're good operators, help them finance the deals that they want to do and then limit our hold position and view that as really originate-to-distribute kind of business and I think we've been quite successful at that. And I think you can just see in the fourth quarter when the markets were seizing up that we didn't take underwriting losses, we didn't have hung deals. I think we have a good sense for where the markets are.","So and then the other aspect is if you look at Commercial Real Estate, that's another kind of typical worry bead that you have to stay very focused on, what's your limit overall? How much exposure do you want to take? I would say there that there we're -- our limit is quite a bit under our peer level of exposure still today, and so there is a slide in the appendix that shows that. And I think again, the question you need to focus on granularity, making sure that you are not overweighted in any particular class like office or multifamily, making sure that you have geographic diversity, making sure you're banking really good operators that you've known for a long time. And I think we apply those same disciplines on the CRE side as well on leveraged loan. So a lot of this gets to people and leadership. Feel really good about Don, feel good about the whole credit team, Rob Allen runs commercial credit. Very experienced people. And I guess you almost have to go through a cycle to prove it, but when you run the CCAR results, we're kind of in the pack. We are kind of median. So for people to be disproportionately worrying about our credit because we're relatively new company doesn't seem to be sensible. Anyway, with that, I'll turn it over to Don.","Donald McCree","Yes. I think you hit most of the high points, Bruce. So I think it starts to decline selection first and foremost, so where we've long-standing relationships with the vast majority whether it be sponsors or corporate clients we're doing business with. Our growth of the margin as Bruce said, in the growth regions tends to be larger companies, and we've -- we purposely have stayed away from the middle market in those areas because I do worry about adverse selection as if we do get wobbly. So we're dealing with better more nimble, larger companies. The second thing that you've mentioned, Bruce, is origination for distribution. Virtually, everything we do in the risk side of thing, we distribute the vast majority. You heard there's a lot of commentary out in the system about the nonbanks and the nonbanks taking share from the banks, but that's where most of the residual risk is going on the leverage -- lending portfolios. We have very granular holds, I'd say, in our leverage lending books. ","Our holds are in the $10 million range. And I think the service we -- that we're are providing our clients is really diversifying and what you're seeing is try to do more multiproduct business with every client that we're banking. So the addition of Western Reserve, the addition of securities capabilities to distribute not only in loan markets but the bond markets. The ability to deliver risk management to our clients in our hedging business, foreign exchange and interest rates just makes us more relevant with the client and lets us know them better also. We're also doing -- we're doing some interesting things in our payments business where we're getting to explore patterns in our payments business, which could become early-warning indicators of companies having problems. And we've also built a restructuring business, which is a remediation business that helps clients change their balance sheets if they begin to get hiccups in their operating models. So -- and I think the last point that Bruce made is really important. That the people that we have engaging with our clients, approving our credits. Remember in Commercial, every single credit extension is approved on an idiosyncratic basis so credit quality, structure, collateral, everything, we have 30-year professionals, not only in are underwriting syndicated lending businesses but also in our credit teams, most of which have come from large money-center banks. So everyone -- notwithstanding the fact that we're relatively a new company has been around the block numerous times. And we also -- we're all acutely aware of the downside of spiking credit costs and what that can do to an operating performance.","Matthew O'Connor","That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up, Bruce, on the stock itself, I think you're very extensive to where the multiple is here. As we think about the CCAR process getting a little bit easier for regional banks to navigate, you could be one of the biggest beneficiaries there both can give a lot of capital, and I think you've been dinged because some of the legacy stuff that will change over time. But if your stock price does continue to sit at the bottom of the pack on a multiple lease, could you give a look for ways to get more aggressive on buybacks? It might not be necessarily the CCAR cycle, but are you mindful that you will have more flexibility and maybe put more toward buybacks versus bolt-on deals or balance sheet growth as we think about 2020, 2021, as kind of a backup plan if needed?","Bruce Van Saun","Well, look, obviously, we pay attention to the stock price but really the big focus is just keep running the company better than we think the stock will take care of itself. We have to be careful not to be market-timers here in terms of these programs. And you get your CCAR approval in quarterly windows and you can try to change that but it's a little cumbersome. So yes, I think when we go in and think about next year and the CCAR ask will take the stock price into account to some extent. But our view is that the flexibility that we've had, the ability to deploy it in some of these fee deals, it's a complex problem we're trying to solve. We're trying to get our returns up, but we're also trying to expand our capabilities and cement our relationships with our customers and address the kind of fee gap that we have. And so we'll continue, I think, to use good judgment on that like we have, like you've seen us in the past.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Maybe coming back to the net interest margin. Could you help us understand why you've got a stable outlook rather than some upside in 1Q? Given that we normally expect the benefit from the December rate rise to foremostly in the first quarter? And then looking ahead to 2019, the full year, I think the outlook kind of points to low to mid-single digits up from 2018. So similar to that 4Q '18 level, can you just confirm that?","John Woods","Yes, I'll go ahead and take that. So a couple of items to think about the first quarter. First and foremost is, yes, we have the December hike but when you look at the outlook for 1Q, we've got a 17 basis point rise in LIBOR expected versus what you saw in the fourth quarter, which would have been around 24 basis points. So I think you've got to take that into consideration in terms of how that drives the -- our C&I loans and our loan yields. But the other item as I mentioned, earlier, the deposit cost lag is post-December, tends to be strongest in the earlier part of the year and tapers off towards the later part of the year as we look at it. So you'll see the dynamic of the deposit cost increase continuing to the first quarter and across the industry. And then that will taper and what will happen is the strength of the front book in the fixed part of the portfolio that I talked about before will just continue to provide benefits quarter-after-quarter. ","So in the earlier part of 2019, maybe as we say more stable but then as you get towards the later part of 2019, you get deposit costs dissipating and you have the continued burn-in of front book, back book, anywhere from 50 basis points in some of our fixed portfolios up to as much as 150 basis points of front-book yields that exceed back-book yields. So that's the main dynamic without management's action as I talked about before, that plays out, which we say is, I think, over the year a net positive and then the new layer on all the balance sheet optimization work that we're are doing that you need to us. Both on the loan side, where we're rotating lower-returning assets into higher risk-adjusted return assets. And even on the deposit side, we've got a series of initiatives in both commercial and consumer to improve our deposit profile. And we're excited about what that can contribute in 2019 as well.","Bruce Van Saun","And the question about the growth coming off of Q4, that's correct, Geoff.","Operator","Our next question in the queue comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Kenneth Zerbe","One of your peers recently just announced that they purchased an online student lender, which obviously, can make him little more aggressive with the higher end of the student lending space. Can you just talk about your very broadly your interest in acquiring tech companies specifically, to help either grow your loan portfolio or to even deepen your penetration that you have with your current clients?","Bruce Van Saun","Brad, why don't you just address where we sit relative to student loans and the threat we possibly see from that or not?","Brad Conner","Yes, well, we've talked about this a lot. We like the student loan business a lot. It brings the right kind of customers in, and we think we're really well positioned. We've competed directly with [indiscernible] for quite some time so we don't think this acquisition really affects our position in the marketplace. So we think we're extremely well positioned and complementing our ability there. And again, like you said earlier, Bruce, I mean this is an asset that brings the right kind of customers, we've stated in the very high-credit quality area of the asset class, and brings in very attractive customers and helps us with our mix shift to higher asset return -- higher risk-adjusted returning asset.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. And then the second part, Ken, is I think our fintech partnerships if you look at what we've done have really been powering new capabilities. So it's a kind of build-versus-buy decision that we take. And if, for example, SigFig has a great robo-advisory product, why should we build that? Let's just figure out, which one is best on the market and then integrate it into our offerings. Same thing with our small business origination platform powered by Fundation. Why build that? You've got a great product capability. Figure out how to integrate it. So on and on and on, when you add up to 10 fintech partnerships, we've done a lot of that. And I think we've actually become quite good at surveilling the marketplace, having good prioritization of what's important and what can offer the best impact in terms of how we're running the bank and delivering for customers. And then we're effectively a very good general contractor, we know how to integrate these things reasonably, quickly and cost effectively.","Operator","And next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Bruce, when you look at the top-performing banks and you mentioned how that's -- your aspiration is to become more on these top-performing banks, what are some of the metrics that you identify as top-performing in your eyes, when you look at this aspiration?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, that's a good question, Gerard. And I think it's not just financial so I think the kind of knee-jerk is well, he must be talking about a ROTCE or efficiency ratio or something like that. And I think to us a top-performing bank is one that delivers well for all its stakeholders. And so consistently we've had an agenda of improvement as that what do we do across, what we call, the 3C's, the customers, the colleagues, the communities. And I think we've seen tremendous progress there and there's more to go for us to be one of the most admired banks. We have to continue to drive our consumer J.D. Power score higher, our net promoter score higher. On commercial, we're pretty much there. We need more customers, we have kind of top-of-class customer satisfaction.","On the colleague front, we want to be a great place to work and build a career. And so we have an organizational health index score that we're 2 points off the top quartile, so we've made a lot of progress from the middle of the third quartile, we're getting to the top quartile. If you're in the top quartile, you attract great people, you keep on and it helps drive stock outperformance so that's important to us. On the community front, we have taken our volunteer hours, almost tripled them from 50,000. When I walked in the door we had 135,000 this year, so really make an impact and spreading more as we make more money, we can also invest more money to make communities better places to live, work and play in. Regulatory, we needed completely clean regulatory dance card, which we've achieved after a lot of hard work so that feels good as well. And then coming back to financial measures, yes, we've got to continue to drive our ROTCE higher. We haven't done that through deals as some of our peers have over time, we've done it effectively through organic growth. And so I think we're closing in on the pack and I think we can continue over the next 5 years to do what we've done to keep driving upwards within the peer group.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Appreciate those insights. And then just is a quick follow-up, you've obviously done a few acquisitions, Franklin, et cetera. Is there a area that you're looking that you need to add to your product capabilities that maybe something that on the horizon you can acquire? And as part of that do you have any goals of where you'd like to see your fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues?","Bruce Van Saun","I'd say, Gerard, we're kind of constantly surveilling for opportunities and where we've seen a kind of desire for scale, things like the Capital Markets, M&A capabilities. There's more that we can do there. We're not done. Similarly in Wealth, I think we got a great franchise in Clarfeld. There's more that we can do there. We're not done. Some of the other areas where we don't have capabilities, we can build those organically. So Don, I mean, you've added a par loan trading group, we're starting a little high-yield group. So there's things that we can do to expand our offerings, we're starting a commodities-trading service but we don't need to acquire things, we can just build those things. So I think you'll see us with a combination of building some things and looking for smart acquisitions. And to match earlier question, if you got to compare expending capital on these acquisitions with buying back your stock and it's a constant calibration that we're looking at. But so far, the deals that we've been able to find, we've been able to get them done at, I think, attractive ROICs and relatively short earn-back periods in terms of the impact on our tangible book value. Brad, you want to add to that?","John Woods","Maybe just to add quickly to that, I think that over the medium term, we do aspire to grow fees faster than our net interest income line. And as that base has been growing over the past several years with the Fed hiking, just we've got to improve and innovate just to stay flat on the -- in the fee space. So I think we would see that improve a bit going forward, and we're in the high-20s right now, in terms of fees versus total revenues. And I think we'd like to see that get to 30 or higher.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, I think like we've done is one step at a time, don't set the bar for where you want to be in five years. We're raising our ROTCE target modestly, and we think we can keep nudging it forward. The first step on the fees is to get back a three handle and get to 30 and then hopefully, over time, we can push it higher.","Donald McCree","So the other thing that I was going to add, it's Don, we also view this, and you mentioned bright side of the house with partnerships very effectively. So in any expansion effort that were under way we look at organic build, we look at acquisition, we also look at partnership. And particularly, in our cash management businesses we've struck at number of partnerships, which have extended our product capabilities and will allow us to continue to grow that business.","Bruce Van Saun","And then the Commercial Real Estate, you might want to answer that.","Donald McCree","Yes, and we have a very good partnership with the Prudential on permanent real estate financing where they do permanent real estate against our construction books, and we go to market together. We have another very interesting partnership on the equity side for REIT Equity, where we use an investment bank to comarket with us and do relending our REIT equity. So we've got quite a few of these, which allow us to broaden a service setting capture more of the opportunity with the clients.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes, good.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Just back to credit report. Is there any part of the portfolio where you're seeing any indications of later-cycle behavior or any weakness you just want to flag? And then secondly, in terms of your credit outlook, the $400 million to $450 million provision guidance for 2019, what type of charge-off outlook does that imply in terms of a charge-off ratio for the year?","Bruce Van Saun","I guess the -- first of, we feel very good about the totality of the portfolio. If you look at Consumer, Brad, you don't really see any trouble spots.","Brad Conner","We really don't, Bruce. It's very solid in performing in line with...","Bruce Van Saun","No migrations in delinquency bucket. So you're feeling very good and Don, you obviously, there's no hotspot...","Brad Conner","All the indicators are improving and our workout teams are relatively quiet.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. And I'd say, when we look at the guidance for next year, we had I think an even higher guide for this year and we beat that comfortably. There's always a presumption that credit will normalize. There's always a presumption that you're going to be building your allowance and so provision should cover charge-offs. That really -- that happened a little bit this year but not to the extent that we thought it would. And really that's because of the back book continues to clean up and provide offsets to what you would need to set aside for loan growth. So that could happen again this year. I think, we're just always going to be a bit conservative and put a number out there that implies that we'll see some normalization implies that we'll see a decent size build in those numbers. But again, right now, we don't see a lot of issue and so we could end up doing better as the year goes by.","John Pancari","Got it, Bruce. That's helpful. And then secondly just on the loan growth front, wanted to get a little bit more granularity on how you're thinking about the components of commercial growth? When it comes to CRE, you had solid growth here in terms of high single digits on the linked quarter but even low double digits on a year-over-year basis. Can it grow at that high-single, low double-digit pace again, in '19? And then same question for pure C&I. Can it be in the high single-digit range as well?","Donald McCree","So when I answer that, I think you see lower growth levels in real estate and that's strategic. And we're being at the margin more selective on our real estate underwriting because there is some froth in that market. That's particularly true in the multifamily space where we actually downdrafted our growth about two years ago and that portfolio is beginning to mature. So I would say kind of low to mid-single digits is where you see our real estate growth. It's kind of same-ish thing. I've got -- got 5% to 6% in my mind on C&I growth. You could see us exiting portfolios as we drive towards BSO. So the actual gross growth could be lower than that as we trim the portfolio. That being said, we see very robust pipelines right now. And our origination pipelines are running higher than they were at this time last year so there is definitely client interest in engaging with this and borrowing money.","Bruce Van Saun","I think the fourth quarter was 8%, right?","Donald McCree","Yes.","Bruce Van Saun","Year-over-year on commercial C&I. So that could still continue to run hard. I think what Don was saying there was that, that gives us the opportunity to review we have a quintile analysis, what our returns up and down the customer stack and if there's ones where we're not getting the right returns, we're not getting the cross-sell that we need, we can start to run some of those off to make room for new opportunities as they come on. So I don't think we grow C&I gross at 8, we grow it something less than that because we'll start to do that catharsis of moving some relationship.","Donald McCree","And I think, back to the question that was asked before, I think what that does it allow us to move for fee lines also because we will be recycling for capital against higher opportunities on the fee side of the balance sheet. So look at loan growth and fee growth kind of in parallel.","Bruce Van Saun","Yes.","Operator","And we'll go to the next question queue comes from Marlin Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","A little bit different take on capital. Talked a lot about share repurchase. But your dividend, you're guiding towards higher payout ratios, you had about 27% kind of ending this year. You're saying that next year is going to be 30%, 35% and then your medium term is 35% to 40%. One of the things that we did when we were managing a bank where we didn't think we're getting the valuation we wanted was the dividend is actually a better way to kind of show the strength of a growing franchise. If you're growing, the dividend really reflects the ability to be able to show the value of that income stream that you're creating. So I wanted to ask you in two cents, how do you bill? And like is that part of the progression that you're showing because that's going to be a very strong dividend increase over the next couple of years. And right now, you are at 4%-ish going to 5%. If you just look at the stock price that start to move up before we think you will be by the end of next year. And then what about the sustainability of that dividend. What do you think about through the cycle being able to keep a 40%. Payout ratio?","Bruce Van Saun","Sure. So I think that's well said and if you look at the year's results, we had 38% EPS growth, and we took our dividend up 45% with the hike that we just announced today. If you actually go back to October of last year of '17, 15 months we've taken the dividend up 78%. So when earnings are growing robustly, like they have been we're quite confident to raise that dividend and achieve a higher payout ratio. I think the payout ratios were artificially constrained in banking when the Fed had kind of the -- I don't know if it was a bright line, but there's certainly a line to pay attention to at 30%. We've had our earnings growing very rapidly, and so even though in the past we were targeting 30%, we exceeded our budget, and our earnings shot ahead and so we've been a little bit south of the 30%. I do think with the increase that we made today, we can get back above that 30% this year and then you could expect if you -- if we follow suit with what we've done the last two years, we've had a second hike later this year so as long as our earnings continue to move up. I do think that investors value the dividend, investors who own bank stocks like the yield but that's supplies. And so we're very sensitive to that. John, you want to add a few?","John Woods","Yes, yes. Over time when you -- as you progress towards your target capital ratio and if you get to a level of stabilization there, you're going to basically think about solidifying that dividend in respect of your earnings being, as you can see it. Approximately 1\/3 of your earnings in a given year and then you're looking for deploying capital, just in organic ways, it's going to take upwards of another third or more of your earnings in any given year and then you've got to rest to think about strategic investments whether that's small tuck-ins on the fee income side or giving it back to shareholders through buybacks. So that will change and vary over time but as a big picture, when you get to stabilization, that's sort of how we think about it.","Marlin Mosby","And then a totally different thought process, competitive advantage-wise, when you look at what we were talking about, if some of the growth that you're getting is from some very specific business lines but when we're in the area, community banks are saying is they're kind of thinking about the Boston or New England areas, they want to be more like Citizens Financial. You've been able to competitively advantage yourself in that region. So want you to talk about that. And then on the product side. How do you think you're going to create that same competitive advantage in cash management as you're investing in that? That's a product that has a lot of competition in it. So how do you position yourself in that particular product as well?","Donald McCree","It's Don, I'll answer that. So cash management, we -- so if you look at our cash management business, it breaks down into 3 or 4 different sub-businesses, so a traditional treasury services, which is our payments businesses, our credit card business, our trade finance business and our merchant services business. The overall business has actually been growing faster than the industry. So we've been putting investment in it over the last couple of years and it's been growing quite nicely, and we're embedded very well with our core client base. Bruce mentioned we're putting a lot of investment around our digital portal right now and expanding our capabilities to stay on par, if not better than a lot of the competition.","So we expect to get continued lift and incremental lift of those investments. Really starting the back end of 2019 is what we're targeting. In terms of competition, with the community banks, one of the reasons we're trying to build the diversity of product capabilities is to be able to solve any problems that our clients have. And frankly, our product set when we engage with clients is now close to complete, so if it's [indiscernible] interest rates are currency and have commodities or if it's raising capital to build a facility or do a dividend to an owner or if it's just regular way working capital lending, I would put us up against anybody not just community banks but even the largest banks in our ability to actually problem-solve and help our clients do their most important transactions. A huge incremental element of that issue was the M&A acquisition we did and the quality of assignments we're getting on our clients most important actions, which is buying and selling companies, is quite strong right now. So I've got zero worry about our ability to compete particularly, in our target segment, which is that midsize, mid-cap kind of company where we're very relevant.","Bruce Van Saun","Brad, a couple of thoughts?","Brad Conner","Yes. I mean, look we get the question all the time about our ability to compete in Petersburg and Philadelphia and Boston as some competitors are coming in. Bruce it goes back to a lot of things that you talked about earlier, which is we think we provide a great value proposition in those markets. We're very focused on exceptional customer experience. We've got a great presence in those markets, so we're strong on convenience. We've been investing heavily in digital. And you talked about some of the things that make a bank great and top performing. We're very involved in the communities of those markets, and we think that's tremendously valuable. So like Don, I don't have any concerns about our ability to compete head-on with anybody in those markets, whether it's a big national or whether it's a community.","Bruce Van Saun","And it's real strength, both on the consumer side and the commercial side.","Brad Conner","Absolutely.","Bruce Van Saun","And in between with small businesses as well.","Brad Conner","Exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lana Chan from BMO.","Lana Chan","Just two quick questions. One on the fee income guidance for 2019, seems pretty strong. Did you give the impact of the CFA acquisition for 2019?","Bruce Van Saun","No, we hadn't. We didn't think that rose to the level of materiality as Franklin did.","Lana Chan","Okay. And so drivers would primarily be what on the fee income side, in terms of 11% to 20%?","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. We had touched on that earlier. So it's on the commercial side, a bounce back in Capital Markets. Another strong year from what we call Global Markets or FX and interest-rate business and the introduction of some new -- a new platform, a new services in our cash management area and then on the consumer side, really well. I think we'll be quite strong even ex-Clarfeld. And then our card business, we've been investing in getting some growth there as well.","Lana Chan","Okay, appreciate it. And on the -- on capital, in terms of your capital stack, I know you did some preferred in 2018. How do you feel about the capital stack now going forward?","John Woods","I'll go ahead and take that. I think we're well position. I mean, I think when you look at where we stand, we have less than 1% of our -- 1 percentage point, if you will, in our Tier 1 stack in the 81% area, whereas most peers are over 1 percentage point, contributing to their Tier 1 ratio. So that's dry powder. We'll consider that over time as we think about optimizing capital. But as we've been able to grow our ROEs and our ROTCEs, then clearly the benefit of that preferred deal that we did earlier this quarter is very compelling. So again, we'll consider that over time in our submissions and our interaction with the Fed, but I think you could look at that as another area of opportunity and potential that we have versus peers. And we'll be trading that off against growth opportunities going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","I was curious about deposit growth. Is the goal to grow it in line with the loan growth this year? Or could you do it -- or could be a little bit faster with some of the initiatives you have underway?","John Woods","Yes, I think our goal is to grow deposits roughly in line with loans. We have -- we think about deposits -- really funding for loan growth and keeping that LDR in that range that we've talked about in the high 90s that you've seen from us. And I think that -- I mean that could come down a tick. But generally, that's worked well for us and has allowed us to continue on our path of driving net interest margin higher and driving ROTCE higher. And I think when you come back to the BSO program, we're looking to not only grow the overall level of deposits, but we're looking for ways to improve the quality of those deposits. And that's a big part of when we talk about BSO contributing in '19 and beyond. We've got a fair bit of opportunity within the deposit portfolio itself to contribute, so we're excited about that possibility.","Brad Conner","And John, I was just going to add to that. One of the things that we have been able to do is to outpace some of our peers in low-cost deposit growth, particularly DDA. You talked about in your opening comments, and we really do with -- believe what -- some of the work we've done around value proposition and sophisticated data and analytics. That's something we can continue to do is to outpace competitors on low cost...","Bruce Van Saun","Yes. That's another area at upside if we can close the gap in DDA-to-total-deposits ratio. That would be very powerful.","Brad Conner","Exactly.","John Woods","Completely agree.","Peter Winter","Can I just -- one, last one. Just on the mortgage market. It's gotten a little tougher, since you acquired Franklin American. I'm just wondering are you still comfortable with the guidance of 2% accretive this year, 3% next year?","John Woods","Yes, I think, couple of things there. Sure, it's -- mortgage market is cyclical, and you've got to be thinking about that as your managing the business and Brad can comment on that. But as we look out, we're responding on the expense side and on the capacity side as a lot of mortgage companies are. And so you could see us continuing to aspire to hit those targets, maybe in a slightly different way. With a smaller mortgage market, you might see a tiny bit less on the revenue side, but you'll also see a little lower on the expense side as well. So I feel like we're still on track not only in the integration, but also in terms of what we expect for that platform to deliver. It's bringing a significant number of customers into the bank. We love the strategy over the long term that this platform provides us, and I think our guidance is still intact that we communicated earlier, maybe with possibly a slightly different path to get there.","Bruce Van Saun","The other thing that, Brad, you might briefly mention. I know we're running over here a little bit. But the mortgage business offers a great opportunity to innovate. So we're moving to a more digital model. We've got some fintech relationships teed up for this year, so we're quite excited about all of that.","Brad Conner","That's exactly right, Bruce. We've made a lot of investments. We keep talking about the investments we've made in data and analytics capability but that really does allow us to grow our direct-to-consumer side of business. And that's really supported by a great digital offering. And so we do have some fintech partners that we're working with on the digital side that create a digital offering on the front end. So we think there's opportunity even beyond just sort of the dynamics of the market.","Bruce Van Saun","Sure.","Operator","And our next question in queue will come from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","I'll be quick. Just one quick question, the Citizens Access, it seems like you're ahead of the initial schedule in terms of the deposits raised, $3 billion. What sort of a reasonable expectation going forward for how quickly this can grow up over the next say year or 2? And what proportion of your deposits it can ultimately represent?","John Woods","I think we may have covered this before. I'll start off. I think we look at this being less than 10% of our deposits over the long term rate. I mean, I think this is -- as we mentioned upfront, it's a relatively modest part of our overall deposit base, which is quite large. And so when you think about $3 billion, that's really around 2 percentage or a little bit more than 2% of our deposit base. It's incredibly important strategically though. This is one of the fastest-growing segment of the deposit markets in the United States. The customers are incredibly affluent. We're intent on a test and learn strategy so that we can drive some of what we learn from this incredibly value customer segment back into our branch businesses. So it has outsized qualitative importance to us over time, as I said, in all likelihood into single digits of total deposits. But important not only in the here and now, but also over time in terms of how we may want to expand our offerings on the platform.","Bruce Van Saun","I'd say, we -- if you look at what we raised, it was about $3 billion in slightly less than 6 months. That's $1.5 million a quarter. I think we'll have to decide as we go through the year to where do we want to put the throttle because it's quite price elastic. But I would think we could do $1 billion a quarter quite easily as we go through this year and still stay underneath John's let's keep it under 10%. And then the other thing I would say is that in addition to test and learn back to our core customers in our footprint, there's also an opportunity that we're really focused on is how we turn those kind of 1-product customers into more fulsome customers. And so there's testing and learning there as well as to now we have 75,000 new customers. What else can we do for those customers? We're servicing 200,000 mortgages with Franklin. We have through our merchant partnerships, over 1 million customers. And so it's I think really exciting to have those good digital capabilities, those data capabilities, and then start to figure out how can we drive new revenue streams and deeper relationships across that whole set of relationships that we're building. ","Okay, I think that's the queue. So we're glad we had a chance to stay around and answer everybody's questions today. And for all of you on the call, thanks for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support, so have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
