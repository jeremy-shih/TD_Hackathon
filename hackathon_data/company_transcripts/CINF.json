My name is Catherine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer at Cincinnati Financial. You may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel, and we thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our year end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor website cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is a quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you will first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer, and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating in the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenback; and Cincinnati Insurance's Executive Vice President, J.F. Scherer; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Senior Vice President of Corporate Financial, Teresa Hopper; and Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore does not reconcile to GAAP.","Now I'll turn over the call to Steve","Steve Johnston","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter results. Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement for changes in the fair value of equity securities.","Non-GAAP operating income improved for the quarter and on a full year basis, it was 21% higher than 2017. We are encouraged by our 2018 financial results and continue to be confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute it well.","Improved operating performance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 again reflected steady efforts to carefully underwriting price policies, provide outstanding claims service, manage investments and support our agencies.","Our fourth quarter, 93.9% combined ratio helped lower full year 2018 to 96.4%, 1.1 points better than 2017. Slightly more favorable catastrophe weather effects in 2018 contributed one-tenth of a point while improved underwriting was reflected in various underlying measures.","We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter expertise on a policy-by-policy basis. That work is vital to a further improvement of underwriting results.","We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve on the 2018 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2019 GAAP combined ratio below 95%. We also believe our 2019 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2018. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.","In 2018, we continued to manage our business to healthy levels of policy retention and with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for commercial lines were similar to a year ago continuing near the high end of the mid-80% range. For personal lines, our policy retention during the second half of 2018 declined from recent year levels reflecting increased underwriting discipline and was near the high end of the mid-80% range.","Our long-term growth strategy includes appointing agencies in areas where we are underrepresented taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise like benefit they value. In 2018, we appointed 167 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years in 2019, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products and another 80 that market only our personal lines products primarily ones with a high net worth focus.","We continue to earn new business through our agencies from a combination of superior service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. For full year 2018, each of our property casualty segments reported record levels of new business written premiums and overall property casualty net written premiums grew 4%.","For renewal business in the fourth quarter, our underwriters continued to generate overall price increases. Commercial lines estimated average price increases for the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter. Combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by a full percentage point for the year 2018 to 95.4% despite the ratio for catastrophe losses increasing by eight tens of a point.","Our personal lines segment continued to experience a rise in average rate changes as the fourth quarter of 2018 was similar to the third quarter. Personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was profitable, while it was above 100% for the year 2018 it prove compared with year end 2017, as we continued to work for performance improvement. Our excess and surplus lines segment had another year with excellent results including double digit growth in net written premiums and a 2018 combined ratio below 75%.","Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned, but was adversely affected by catastrophe losses from severe weather and wildfires. It finished the year with a combined ratio of 105.8% which is consistent with our expectations for a year with global insured catastrophe losses roughly twice the long-term historical average.","Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, its largest product line, with fourth quarter earned premium growth of 13% and full year 2018 growth at 9%. This business supports account retention for our agents and provides steady contributions to our earnings as it has less correlation to weather than our property-casualty business.","On January 1st of this year, we again renewed each of our primary and property-casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2019 are similar to 2018.","While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premiums for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing.","The full year 2018 value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, was negative 0.1%. The contribution from operating income was a positive 6.7%. The VCR in total was below our long-term target range due to the decline in securities market value. However, the VCR average for the past five years was within the target range.","In conclusion, finishing the year well reflects areas of ongoing operational improvement. Despite the fourth quarter downturn in the stock market, the good performance of our insurance business was a key factor in the recent decision by our Board of Directors to reward shareholders with a 5.7% increase in the regular cash dividend declared earlier this month.","Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will highlight several important points about our financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2018 matching the full year 2017 growth rate.","Dividends from our equity portfolio, again, led the way, up 9% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 6% for the year. Interest income from our bond portfolio was flat for the year.","The pretax average yield was 4.21% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 13 basis points from 2017's fourth quarter. We continued to invest in bonds including $347 million in net purchases for the year. Taxable bonds purchased during 2018 had an average pretax yield of 4.48%, 60 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago.","Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.69%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high coupon bonds throughout 2018.","Our investment portfolio valuation was volatile for much of 2018 and on a full year basis experienced an overall net loss of $741 million before tax effects. That included $395 million for our equity portfolio and $334 million for our bond portfolio. Even though those losses -- even with those losses, we ended the year with a net appreciated value of nearly $2.6 billion including $46 million in our bond portfolio.","Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows, again, exceeded $1 billion and for full year 2018 exceeded $1 billion and for full year 2018 exceeded the prior year by $129 million, or 12%.","I'll briefly comment on expense management always an important part of our focus. While we continue to make thoughtful strategic investments in our business, our full year 2018 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by two tenths of a percentage points compared with the same period of 2017.","Loss reserves are another important area and our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years on both a fourth quarter and full year 2018 basis.","2018 marked our 30th consecutive year of net favorable reserve development. Full year 2018 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points matching the annual average during 2013 through 2017. Our commercial casualty line of business experienced $16 million of favorable reserve development during the fourth quarter -- during the quarter and $47 million for the year.","Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development in 2018. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 38% for accident year 2017, 23% for accident year 2016 and 39% for 2015 and prior accident years. We continue to actively manage our capital and both financial strength and flexibility remained excellent.","This week we concluded efforts to enhance our financial flexibility by amending and extending our line of credit agreement with various banks. The former agreement was due to expire in May. The term is for five years for up to $300 million and the accordion feature allows us to double that amount under the same terms and conditions. Most of the other terms and conditions are similar to the former agreement, although our financial flexibility also improved with the elimination of a minimum net worth covenant and the debt to total capital maximum is now 35%.","I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio.","Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.52. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.17. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.70. And we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $3.12 during the fourth quarter to $48.10 per share.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. It was a good quarter and second half for the year 2018. We are bullish about the future of Cincinnati Financial. We see improving trends in several areas. And look forward to meaningful contributions over time from leaders at Beaufort Underwriting Agency, the Lloyd's managing agency subsidiary of our pending acquisition of MSP Underwriting Ltd. That acquisition is still on track to close during the first quarter of 2019. We know our strategy works and we'll continue to execute it, as we target profitable growth, while providing great service to our appointed agencies that should benefit all stakeholders of the company creating shareholder value overtime. Many of you know J.F. Scherer from his years of investor travel. He's announced his intent to retire in August after more than 35 years of service and leadership to our organization. This will likely be his final earnings call. J.F would you like to say a few words?","J.F. Scherer","Yes, thanks Steve. I'd just like to say it's been a pleasure traveling with and getting to know many of you on the call today. I've learned so much from the conversations, we've had your, your review of the industry, and your comments about the company. I'd be forever grateful for what I learned from all of you. I appreciated your professionalism and your interest in Cincinnati Financial and I certainly wish all of you continued success. Thanks to all of you.","Steve Johnston","As I'm sure you can all imagine, we're sad to see J.F. go. At the same time, however I have absolute confidence in Steve Spray and in his ability to smoothly step into the role of Chief Insurance Officer. I know you all will feel the same as you get to know him during future investor business. As a reminder with J.F., Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, Teresa Hopper, and Ken Stecher.","Catherine, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. The first question, I have is going back to the guidance you mentioned. I wanted to be sure I heard this correct. You said 95% ex cats. Is that correct?","Steve Johnston","No it was 95% or less assuming normal catastrophe loss levels.","Amit Kumar","Okay. So the language is similar to what I think what you had said in terms of the cat definition. I was curious, if I go back and look at the guidance for 2018, 2019 is obviously higher. What's the biggest sort of moving parts? Is this mostly driven on the loss cost side? Maybe just expand on the thought process a bit?","Steve Johnston","In terms of the combined ratio being above 95%?","Amit Kumar","No in terms of it's above when we talked about \u2013 when you laid out the initial guidance for 2018 at that time on 8th Feb, I think you had said mid- to low-90s I think was the number you had given in early 2018. So I was just trying to compare and contrast what had changed in your mind.","Steve Johnston","Right. And yes, I think we were expecting and hoping for a little bit better performance in the personal lines results. They are the one segment for the year that came in over 100%. But having said that we're really buoyed by the work that's been done in personal lines in terms of the rate action that's been taken. I think Steve might be able to expand a little bit on that. But I think kind of the proof is in the pudding \u2013 when we look at the fourth quarter alone it came \u2013 personal lines came in with a 91.7%. And I think that gives us good optimism towards where we're heading into 2019. And maybe Steve Spray might want to comment a little bit on the actions that have been taken.","Steve Spray","Yeah. Amit on the personal lines specifically throughout 2018, we continued to earn in on the homeowner line mid-single-digit rate increases. We think that that is going to strengthen into 2019 into the high-single-digit range. And on the commercial auto, we think that's going to stay strong in the high-single-digit range as well.","Amit Kumar","Got it. Now that's helpful. The other question I had was looking at the workers' compensation line, and I think the reserve release just were substantially higher than the run rate we\u2019ve seen. And I know a lot of companies have been talking about it. I wanted to understand a bit better as to the driver of those reserve releases. And maybe just talk about the market conditions. It seems that we were worried a bit in Q3. And in Q4, I think things have got eased up a little bit just based on the general economic conditions. Maybe just talk about the loss costs and the pricing environment.","Steve Johnston","Yes. Amit, this is Steve Johnston. We have two Steves here, so we'll try to be careful to mention which one. This is Steve Johnston here, and I'll cover the reserve part.","In terms of the releases, we have a very qualified actuarial department that uses some very sophisticated tools, particularly in the long-tail lines, such as workers' compensation. They're looking at trends and explicitly looking at inflation in terms of medical inflation, indemnity inflation, paid loss trends.","And with all of the data that they look at, there's obviously a little bit of a cautious eye towards workers' compensation in that. It's been a cyclical line over time. And that slight variation in actual results on some of the loss trend picks can have a large impact on the overall results given the long-tail nature of the line. So they have taken, I think a very prudent approach to reserving workers' comp.","And yet as they look at the more recent accident years going back in terms of how the actual trends have come in versus what they've predicted feel that it's prudent to release the reserves that they have. And it's a very consistent position that they take a consistent philosophy that they go about the reserve setting. In terms of the market conditions, I'll turn it over to Steve Spray.","Steve Spray","Yes. Amit, Steve Spray. We feel really good about workers' compensation. We're obviously a package underwriter. We don't write mono-line work comp. The results have been good. We feel good about the growth of it in the future and our appetite for it.","Over the last several years, I think we've made really good strides on many different fronts in managing workers' compensation, risk selection underwriting, pricing the analytics that we've employed there, loss control.","And I think no change has impacted our work comp results more than the things that we've done with claims, more expertise, a call center for timeliness of reporting have just helped -- medical bill repricing have just really helped the results over the year.","I will tell you, over the years, we are cautiously looking at the continued base rate declines that come out of NCCI, and the impact that that's having on the accident year results. You can see that in the reports. But something that we are going to continue to watch, we'll continue to be cautious with work comp, but we want to continue to grow it.","Amit Kumar","Okay. That's helpful. Last question and I will requeue. Just going back to that response on the guidance you said it has some level of normal cats. What's the normalized cat load you're assuming? The reason is, I want to be very clear and understand -- how that number probably compares with the investor expectations? Can you just talk about is it six points or so or maybe higher or lower? Just talk about your normalized cat load expectations? Thanks.","Steve Johnston","It would be right in that six point something to seven point in terms of normalized cat. You're right on it Amit.","Amit Kumar","Got it, okay. I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Steve Johnston","Thank you for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","Hey congrats J.F. Wish you all the best.","J.F. Scherer","Thanks.","Mike Zaremski","My first question just following up I guess on the guidance, so it's a 95% all-in combined ratio?","Steve Johnston","That's correct.","Mike Zaremski","And so this year you're about one point higher than that. And your cat load was kind of in line with historical the last 10, 11, 12 years -- 12-year average. And so kind of in this quarter you put up close to 95%.","So is it kind of just doing more of the same as you kind of did in 4Q and first lines gets a little bit better? And that's kind of how we think about 95% and rate is kind of in line-ish with loss cost trends overall? I know it's generalizing a lot.","Steve Johnston","Right. That's very close though Mike. This is Steve Johnston and I think you're very close. We do see and feel that with the actions that we're taking in terms of loss cost trend, we're very prospective on that. What do we feel loss cost trend would be going forward?","We do think that while it may be slight that we are slightly ahead of loss cost trend with our pricing. We think that all of the actions that have been taken will show improvement. And so we do think we'll - on an ex-cat accident year basis see improvement next year.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, that's helpful. And looking at commercial auto, the underlying loss ratio accident year ex reserve developments has been improving and it was in the 50s this quarter which is great. But then on the other hand you have reserve additions from prior developments have persisted, just trying to understand those two kind of contrasting trends?","Steve Johnston","Sure. Good question and this is Steve Johnston. I think anytime when you're at a turning point with a line which I think we are with commercial auto as you pointed out we are seeing improvements in the ex-cat accident year. We have been taking the appropriate action to get there.","I still think as we see that and in terms of setting the reserves as you mentioned the -- that there is a little bit of stubborn adverse development there. I think there's still a little bit of caution in terms of releasing reserves or being more optimistic with the picks on prior accident years until we see a little bit more evidence of the improvement that we're seeing in the current accident year.","Steve Spray","Mike, this is Steve Spray. Having spent the last couple of years in commercial lines, a lot of focus on commercial auto Steve's, right, we are seeing improvement in both the accident year and calendar year results. And one thing I'd point out is, we continue to earn in really solid high single-digit rate increases throughout 2018. We think that there's still plenty of runway in 2019 for that to continue, but those high single-digit increases don't really tell the full story.","I think our underwriting teams with our agents -- in working closely with our agents have really executed well on segmenting the book. And we're getting obviously more than the average on the least adequately priced business and less on the most adequately priced; really focused on retention on that adequately, on that most adequately priced business.","So still plenty of runway. There's still macro issues that are going on in commercial auto that you've probably heard distracted driving, driver shortages, policyholders having difficulty finding, qualified individuals to put behind the wheel. It's all having an effect on commercial auto.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Great. That's -- hopefully that line of business gets better for the industry as the year progresses. And my last question was back to the last question from Amit on workers' comp. So I think you guys said, you want to grow that line of business. And when I look at premium rates \u2013 sorry, your premium volumes there, they've been second half of the year down kind of close to double-digits. Is that mostly just pricing and policies are flattish? Or are you guys expecting to kind of grow premium levels in 2019 because maybe pricing is getting less negative? I'm just trying to understand the dynamic there on workers' comp growth for 2019.","Steve Spray","Yes. Mike, this is Steve Spray again. Let me try to answer that. If I don't hit it, you obviously can give me a follow-up. The base rate declines are putting pressure on the growth. But the underwriters I think are doing an excellent job of trying to mitigate that as much as possible. We still feel really good about the overall pricing of the book at this point in time although again those base rates are putting pressure.","We're a package underwriter. So many times when you write -- let me give you an example. If you're writing a package and you're not real high on the auto, you're probably going to lose the entire package. You're not going to have an opportunity at that. With workers' compensation, there's enough monoline markets out there that if that line of business is not attractive to us, we can still continue to write the package and that comp will end up going somewhere else.","So it allows us to be I think more prudent and more conservative on the workers' compensation. So I think that covers it.","Steve Johnston","Yes. In short, we do want to grow the line. It's a profitable line that we feel that we can do well.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Great. Thank you for all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. I was hoping you could just give us a little update about the expansion efforts that you're doing. And I'm just curious sort of maybe big picture thoughts on how far you think you'd develop products for yourself in the future?","Steve Johnston","Okay. Paul, this is Steve Johnston. And we'll kind of tag team on this. But we have an agency strategy. We are always looking for products and services that we can do with our agents to help grow our company. And we know that when our agents are successful, we'll be successful in or confident in, I think Steve has some ideas on how to expand on that thought. But we are confident in our growth strategies as we appoint agents, come up with products and services that we are definitely in a growth mode.","Steve Spray","Yes. Paul, Steve Spray. Agree completely. Especially the agency strategy piece. We've always been a company as you know that has built -- build around our distribution. And anything we do in here as far as expanding products and services is in direct reflection of what the agents' desires are of us.","So, as an example, our excess and surplus lines company, you can see how that's performing. High net worth. Will Van Den Heuvel and the team that he's built and the growth that we've got there, we started the target markets division which is really niche products and commercial lines in direct response to agents' needs and the fact that they were majoring in specific industries or class segments. We're up to 15 of those now.","We've made extensive product improvements in management liability and surety, especially on the management liability front. That segment is growing rapidly and is very profitable. We stay out of the public company sector. It's primarily non-profit, small privately held companies as well. So, that's performed well. So, it kind of just goes on and on. Now with our Lloyd's Syndicate, things that are always in direct -- again, it's always in direct response to the needs of our agents.","We have -- another area that we are expanding is in commercial lines. And as we move upstream into larger more complex risks for our agents, we feel like we have plenty of capacity. We just need to expand our expertise.","We hired Chet Swisher about two and a half years ago, came over to join us and had tremendous amount of large account experience and expertise. He's building out that unit to just be that much more important to our agents as well. So, hopefully, I think that should cover what your question was Paul.","Paul Newsome","That's great. And congratulations J.F. I'll miss watching you at the company, but all the best.","J.F. Scherer","Thanks Paul. It's been great to spend so much time with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Hi there everybody. Congratulations on a great quarter and particularly in personal lines, just excellent results. I was wondering if we could dig in a little bit about the timing. Some of your competitors have said they've seen a higher frequency of homeowners losses over the past six months or so and it seems you've already priced for that. Did you see that loss trend developing earlier than others? And is that's what's in your price right now? I guess to say are you experiencing higher frequency of losses, but it's already priced for?","Steve Johnston","I think in general, Josh, and not to bring in -- I haven't really heard or read about the competitors. But we do feel just that our people in personal lines have been doing an excellent job in responding to the trends that we see in personal lines both auto and homeowners.","We have seen -- we focused on the pure premium trend which will be the combination of frequency and severity. I do think within that pure premium trend, it is more the severity that's driving it.","But again when we talk trends we talk prospectively. And a lot of the underwriting action that's been put in place by our underwriters we think is dampening that trend some. And we feel that we are in a position where we are getting rate ahead of that loss cost trend.","Josh Shanker","Do you have a general idea of how much rate you're getting in homeowners right now?","Steve Johnston","Yeah, in terms of the homeowners, we feel we're in the high single-digit range in terms of our homeowners increases. I'm sorry mid-single-digit for home high single-digit for auto.","Steve Spray","But Josh, this is Steve Spray. We do see it strengthened on the homeowner line throughout 2018 and we expect the homeowner rate increases in 2019 to move into the high single-digit range.","Josh Shanker","Okay. And I realize, you're not a big auto player compared to a lot of auto specialists out there but there are people who do put their personal auto with you, going forward can a multiline competitor be an effective player in the auto market is that a concern you guys look at or you think that there's many years of roadway ahead of you on the auto line?","Steve Spray","No. I think we can absolutely be effective in the personal auto market. Again we are not a mono-line auto writer, we're a package underwriter.","We are trying to attract the policyholder that sees value in the advice that they get from an independent agent and they claims service that I'm proud of and have been proud of over the years that we provide in the community for our agencies and for the policyholders.","So in the area where we are focused Josh the agency strategy and the centers of influence and the individuals in the community that they work with we absolutely feel like we can continue to grow personal lines.","Josh Shanker","And then one last one on high net worth homeowners, how many states do you plan to be in 2019?","Steve Spray","By the end of 2019, the plan is we'll be in 46 states. We're in 42 right now. The plan is to add Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii and Nevada in 2019.","Josh Shanker","Very good and I'll just say on regard that J.F. is wrong that the pleasure has been all ours, I'm sure. And have a very happy retirement.","J.F. Scherer","Thank you very much Josh. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. I want to echo everyone's best wishes to J.F. it's been a pleasure dealing with you over the years.","J.F. Scherer","Thanks Meyer.","Meyer Shields","A couple of I think small questions if I can. One, for the past couple of years, we've had some seasonality in the workers' compensation underlying loss ratio. Does that represent the fourth quarter true-up of the full year? Or is there something else going on?","Steve Johnston","I do think we try to look at things over an annual period of time, but I do think with workers' comp you're going to see more construction activity. And that sort of thing during the summer months than what you do in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So there could be a little bit of seasonality there.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That makes sense. Can you compare the rate increases you're seeing within excess and surplus lines to the other commercial lines?","Steve Spray","Yeah. I think an excess and surplus line has been consistent for many quarters Meyer and that their getting into low single-digit range is pretty consistent.","Meyer Shields","Okay. So actually lower than I guess the aggregate for standard commercial lines?","Steve Spray","No. I think it's about -- I think it's about the same in the aggregate.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Steve Spray","Yeah.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You do have a question from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Heleniak","Hi, good morning. J.F. wish you the best as well and happy retirement as well.","J.F. Scherer","Thanks very much.","Scott Heleniak","And so the first question I had was on the -- just the life insurance book. You saw really good premium growth for the year. It was up about 8%. So, how much was that of just -- was that more a function of just your agency base kind of more -- marketing that more assertively? Was it market conditions something else going on there? And then, if you can just talk about just the opportunity there and not only in the term life which is where you're seeing most of the growth, but in some of the other ancillary products annuity and disability and kind of where you see the opportunity in the next few years?","Mike Sewell","Yes -- no this -- great. Thanks great question. This is Mike. We had another really good year on the life company. We're thinking about the term product as our main product. For the first year, term premiums were up about a little over 14%. And it's just been a lot of applicants -- applications that they've been receiving this past year. I think we had a pretty good year at 2017 too also with the applications up. So the worksite -- so when we're out there on the commercial lines side and getting the worksite that was up 17.7% for the current year and that's a first year. So it's -- just all around, it's been very good. It's rounded out the -- what our independent agents have in their toolbox for the insurers to be able to sell the insurance.","From the annuity side, we just have fixed annuities. We don't do any variable annuities. So we think we do remain competitive there with the interest rates that we apply to those products. And we do look and adjust those quarterly to make sure that we are remaining competitive in that area. So overall another -- I think a great year for the life company. Their non-GAAP operating income was $52 million this year compared to $40 million in the prior year. So with the premiums that are in there, the mortality was up a little higher than what we predicted at the beginning of the year. And then kind of rounding that out with some tax effects, we had a great year. So the life insurance company continues to be a valuable asset for us.","Scott Heleniak","Okay, great. And the E&S premium growth it ticked up quite a bit compared to last couple of quarters. I just wondered, if you could just talk about some of the trends there and some of the areas where maybe you're running a lot more business. And are you just generally seeing more of that type of business flow to -- as a sort of E&S risk as opposed to standard market risk? Or just any color on the 20% growth rate there.","Steve Spray","Yes, Scott, Steve Spray. That I was involved in the E&S company from the get-go. And Don Doyle's leadership and that team they just continued -- it's blocking and tackling. They've stuck to their knitting, but they've also continued to expand their expertise. It's outstripping their appetite. But they're just -- they're out on the road constantly meeting with agents. Their value proposition is extremely compelling. And I think like anything else you have to just tell somebody 90 times over and over what your value prop is. And the agents just continued to move more and more business that way. It's primarily a casualty book. It's about 90% casualty about 10% of it property. So it's -- our agency plant today has about $3 billion of E&S business of which we write roughly $260 million. So we just think that there is a long runway for us there.","Scott Heleniak","Okay, great. And then just one last one on the E&S as well just the accident year loss ratio saw a pretty big improvement. Are you seeing any different trends there versus any other units as far as frequency or severity that kind of drove that improvement?","Steve Spray","No, I think that -- again it's an E&S book. They do an excellent job of pricing in terms and conditions. But it's going to have a variability component to it. It's a -- just inherently it's going to be a severity book. They only retain $1 million so that helps their cause there as well. But I think it's just inherent variability that happens in that book.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. Got you. Thanks a lot.","Steve Spray","Yes.","Operator","You do have a follow-up question from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Just two quick follow-ups. The first question goes back to the discussion on MSP Underwriting. At the time of the announcement you had, I think, you had mentioned that it was going to be modestly accretive. In the slide deck you had mentioned, 98% or better. I think it was a penny accretive at that point. I was curious had -- is that pretty much unchanged since the announcement? Or is there any more additional update on that?","Steve Johnston","Yes, good question. It is unchanged since that. I would turn everybody to the slide deck that we released that Amit is referring to on October 12. And that is where we are still in terms of how we feel about the transaction with Beaufort. We are confident that it will close here in the first quarter. We've been in contact with the people and continue to be very confident in the people there, the quality of the people, the expertise. And we are optimistic and we're ready to get going with that one.","Amit Kumar","Got it. And the second and the last question I have is, if you look at CinFin Re in the 10-K you had laid out, I think 30% of the premiums were coming from property exposures, 60% was from casualty. That piece has seen some decent growth. I was curious, how are you thinking about that piece for 2019, and especially, coming out from an active hurricane season as well as other losses? Is there -- could there potentially be a desire to grow that book and hence we could see an upside down the road? Or is the desire to keep the PMLs within check and hence this book's, sort of, proposition varies around $150 million or so in terms of premiums?","A \u2013 Steve Johnston","This is Steve Johnston, and we're very much focused on the profitability on a risk-adjusted basis there. We intentionally didn't set up a separate company. It's written on Cincinnati Insurance paper. We just look at each individual contract one by one to see if we think we can make a good risk-adjusted profit. So we don't put pressure on them to write. With the one on ones, they've been very selective. They wrote less than 20 new property cat treaties out of some 130 cat submissions. They're very much looking to align themselves with quality companies.","And I think we would see continued more premium on the casualty side as we go through the year as we saw in 2018 just based on the market conditions. But to the extent that we see good opportunity on a risk-adjusted basis to either increase our share on contracts that we like or selectively write new ones, we feel very confident in their ability going forward.","Q \u2013 Amit Kumar","Got it. That\u2019s actually very helpful. I will stop here. Thank you so much for the answers.","A \u2013 Steve Johnston","Thank you, Amit.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your questions. I'd now like to turn the call back over to the Steve Johnston for any closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Thank you all. We very much look forward to talking with you and I look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2019 call. Thank you, Catherine for running the call.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5553":["Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Dennis McDaniel - IRO","Steve Johnston - President & CEO","Mike Sewell - CFO","Marty Mullen - Chief Claims Officer","J.F. Scherer - CIO, Cincinnati Insurance","Analysts","Arash Soleimani - KBW","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Operator","Good morning. My name is Jane, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. And the shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On today's call, you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be given by others in the room with us, including Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; and Senior Vice President of Accounting, Theresa Hoffer.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","And now, I'll turn over the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter 2017 results. While the past quarter presented challenges, we see several positives regarding future prospects from improved operating performance.","First, our third quarter and nine months 2017 property casualty combined ratios stayed just 100% putting us in a good position to earn an underwriting profit for the sixth consecutive year consistent with one of our primary objectives. Second, we reported a nine month current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses of 91.1%. While that was 7\/10 of a point higher than accident year 2016 at nine months, the higher ratio for losses of $1 million or more for claim largely contributed to that variance and we know large losses tend to vary, particularly over relatively short-term periods.","We also gained confidence from internal reports and observations that our underwriters continue to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on expiring policies that our models in judgment indicate at relatively weaker pricing, that's an ongoing result that's segmenting our portfolio of accounts through careful underwriting of risks covered by individual policies.","I'll take a moment to comment on Cincinnati Re, our reinsurance assumed operation. Following a very favorable contribution to profit during the first two years since its inception, Cincinnati Re experienced a quarter of sizeable catastrophe loss effects which happened from time to time in the reinsurance industry. That loss experience was consistent with our models in projections for significant catastrophe events. Our underwriters and analysts are experienced subject matter experts to understand how the balance qualitative and quantitative aspects of reinsurance decision making. So far in 2017 we've assessed nearly 500 potential reinsurance transactions declining approximately 80% of them, a rate consistent with the prior two years.","History shows that the tendency for firming reinsurance premium rates following periods similar to the recent spike and industry losses translates into near-term opportunity and we are well prepared to take advantage of it. We recognized the long-term benefits of risk diversification and Cincinnati Re should continue to help diversify our business in smooth results overtime.","Turning to premium growth; we continue to grow premiums in a disciplined fashion for each of our churn segments. While overall premium growth for our commercial line segments slowed during the third quarter of 2017, renewal written premiums continue to rise and we reported a combined ratio of 95.2%. Overall, commercial lines estimated average price increases were similar to the second quarter with higher pricing for commercial auto, the notable exception.","For our personalized segment, third quarter premium growth continues at a nice pace, the personalized 2017 combined ratio before catastrophe effects improved for both the third quarter and first nine months partially offsetting a higher level of catastrophe losses for both periods.","Estimated average premium rate increases for personalized in total, were slightly higher than in the second quarter of 2017 with personal auto average rate increases reaching the high single-digit range. Our access and surplus like segment reported another should quarter of underwriting profit and premium growth. It has a nine months, 2017 combined of under 70%. Our life insurance subsidiary again, made a good contribution net income growing third quarter 2017 for life insurance earned premiums written by 5% and helping to diversify our earnings sources.","Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation was 3.1% for the third quarter and 10.3% for the first nine months of the year; we're still on PACE for another year that reaches our long-term target of 10% to 13% annual average.","Despite the third quarter being a challenging one in terms of operating results for us and the P&C industry we continue to opportunities every day to deliver long-term value to shareholders and outstanding service to the agencies that represent a company and their clients.","Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results, reserve development and other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter 2017 was our 17th consecutive quarter of investment income growth rising 3% for the quarter and 2% for the first nine months.","Dividend income was up 10% for the quarter and interest income was up 1%. The double-digit growth in dividend income will make a tough comparison in 2018. Since the beginning of 2014, we've reported quarterly dividend growth ranging from 2% to 19%; such variability can result from irregular patents for dividend payment such as special dividends that can occur anytime. For our portfolio, they tend to occur in the fourth quarter.","Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth and unrealized gains, up 7% for the quarter to more than $2.7 billion. The bond portfolios pre-tax average yield was 4.43% for the third quarter of 2017, down 20 basis points from last year's third quarter. That yield decline reflects the effect of higher yielding bonds that continue to be called or that mature. While we've reported another quarter of interest income growth, the third quarter 1% growth rate is well below the recent peak of 4% we've reported for each of the first two quarters of last year.","Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.81% and purchase tax exempt bonds averaged 3.15% for a blended yield of 3.55% while bond portfolio effective duration did not change.","Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first nine months of 2017 totaled $746 million, down $89 million or 11% for the same period a year ago. A $103 million increase in catastrophe losses and loss expenses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.","Once again, we carefully managed expenses during the quarter while at the same time investing strategically in our business. Our third quarter and nine month 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratios improved somewhat from comparable 2016 periods.","Moving to loss reserves, our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in net favorable development on prior accident years. For the third quarter of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 1.6 percentage points, somewhat lower than a typical quarter in recent years. Development for each of our major lines of business was favorable with the exception of auto and also commercial casualty which is our largest line of business. Reserve development for commercial casualty was essentially flat for the third quarter of 2017 as we reported a net unfavorable amount of less than $1 million.","Paid losses and loss expenses were higher than in any quarter since the beginning of 2015, in part, due to an increase in large losses.","On a case incur basis, the ratio of losses and loss expenses was approximately two percentage points better than the first half of 2017 but remains approximately four points worse than the average for the prior two years. Yet for considering these trends for commercial casualty, we maintained our consistently prudent approach of setting reserves including IBNR reserves that resulted in basically no favorable or unfavorable prior accident year development for the quarter at a nine month current accident year loss and loss expense ratio of approximately two percentage points higher than the full year 2016.","Our commercial casualty third quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 63.2%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so indicates an estimated combined ratio of approximately 95%. In total, favorable reserve development for the first nine months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 7% for accident year 2015, 19% for accident year 2014, and 21% for 2013, and prior accident years.","Regarding capital management, our approach in financial strength remained stable. We have excellent financial flexibility including September 30 holding company cash and marketable securities that rose 16% from the year end 2016.","To conclude, I'll summarize third quarter contributions to book value per share. They've represented the main drivers to our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.54.","The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.05. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.72, and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.89 during the third quarter to a record $45.86 per share.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to thank our associates who work relentlessly to respond to our agents and policyholders affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.","With our client's team leading the way, associates from all across the company jumped into action and helped wherever they could. Storms of this magnitude leave widespread damage in the community and widespread concern about how to get back to normal. This is when our associates shine, calming those fares, upholding the reputation of our agents and delivering on the value of Cincinnati Insurance Policy.","The starter of the fourth quarter didn't bring much relief to our country as communities continue to experience devastating loss from both Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires. Our hearts go out to the families and business including our own policyholders affected by these events. In terms of losses, we estimate insured losses for our company will be less than $1 million for each of these fourth quarter events.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Ken Stecher, J. F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Jane, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Arash Soleimani","Good morning. So I just had a couple of questions here; in terms of the commercial casualty line, I just wanted to talk about that a bit more. So I mean would you say that you're seeing kind of deteriorating trends there? Does the severity seems like it's actually ticking up or do you think this is more of a temporary issue? I just wanted to get a bit more color about what's happening with that line?","Steve Johnston","Arash, we feel good about the line. As Mike went over, the profitability is holding up well. Within commercial casualty there are a lot of parts there that are analyzed and moving in different directions but overall, I think while we do see some upward trends, we feel confident with the way that we're underwriting and executing and are confident in terms of the continuation of the profitability in the casualty line.","Arash Soleimani","So as mostly just kind of an uptick in severity, is that a fair characterization?","Mike Sewell","This is Mike. You know, it's really how much we review the severity but it's the -- we had a few more larger losses and so when you take a look at our losses that are $1 million or more, well, we had a few more of those during the current quarter and so we were prudent, we're not necessarily seeing a trend yet but we were prudent to releasing any IBNR reserves as some of those came through. I would probably say that some of those losses, there is not necessarily a trend whether it's geographic or with what it is but maybe I'll ask Marty Mullen if he's got any -- maybe kind of give a little color on the types of those large losses Marty?","Marty Mullen","Sure, thanks Mike. First, this third quarter we had 28 commercial lines claims, 17 of those large claims which categorized, there is main dollars or more were spread across the commercial lines. And to give you some example, nine of those were $1 million claims in commercial auto and other nine losses, eight were in different states. The same with the general liability, five of those large losses of over $1 million were in general liability lines and again, they were in five different states. So the claims are very diverse spread across our pattern and I think it's just one of those quarters that we saw a significant increase in those number of claims spread across the country.","Arash Soleimani","And is that 63%, I mean is that more or less like a fair run rate to assume for commercial casualty in terms of the core loss ratio?","Steve Johnston","Yes, you know, it maybe -- when you take a look at like let's say the last few quarters, it's ticked up a little bit. Again, I'd like to wait to see another couple of quarters and see where the large losses come in, see how our actuaries -- you know, we're going to follow their consistent approach and how they are setting but if you look at our loss expense ratio that's in our supplementary on Page 13, you know, looking at the last so many quarters, it's ranging from a low -- kind of in the low 50s up to the 60s, up 63.2%. But let's wait and see, it's a long-term line, let's -- we're going to follow what our actuaries say.","Arash Soleimani","Sure. And just in that same kind of question, are you seeing an uptake in jury awards?","Marty Mullen","Arash, this is Marty. I think we haven't seen a trend in that regard, there are certain jurisdictions that you certainly have to be more careful in making decisions to take a case to trial and certainly we're very cognizant of that and prudent in deciding which cases to take to trial depending on the facts and specific jurisdictions. So I think you still have to be careful in making those decisions in specific areas.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks for those answers. And just my last one was; for Cincinnati Re, the 1 in 250 net PML looks like it's actually below your 1 in 100 net PML. So I just wanted to see how you guys are accomplishing that.","Steve Johnston","I think that was in the 10-K and I think it had to do with the change in the loss per change in TVAR [ph], I'm getting kind of technical there but in terms of change in risks; so it wasn't necessarily a change in bar number.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. Alright, well, thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Go ahead please, your line is now open.","Paul Newsome","I wanted to ask about the possible expansion of the reinsurance business and specifically what sort of metrics are you using in terms of ROE or underwriting or what-not in terms of the volatility measures today to determine whether you want to be on a piece of business versus what you might be doing tomorrow? I'm wondering if there is any change there as well?","Mike Sewell","Good question, Paul. It will be a consistent approach. From the beginning, we've been very consistent in not focusing on growth but try to focus on profitability, to focus on returns with each contract. For example, we did not set up a specific company for Cincinnati Re with capital that had to be used for return, we try to look at each risk individually on the merits. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we've been very disciplined in the ones that we accept and a number of measures are looked at and will continue to be looked at. Obviously what do we estimate the expected combined ratio would be, we do look at as we're looking at lack of correlation with our regular business, we will look and try to estimate what we think the change in TVAR [ph], the 1 in 250 year will be in combination with our already existing book in terms of the capital needed, what type of return we can get on that, we look at rate on lines from a judgment factor.","So, and to me it really always come down to the people and we have a very experienced team there that have been hired and are very confident in their ability going forward to be even in the stronger position than we are now. I think exception [ph] to-date was probably the worst quarter in memory in terms of reinsurance losses were maybe about $13 million in the whole inception [ph] to-date and that's something that really, with a good first quarter we could bring it back to breakeven or near breakeven by the end of the year and perfectly positioned I think as we move forward into next year.","Paul Newsome","Some related question; I think hard markets are primarily created by changes in perceived risk that changed underwriting methods, whether they'd be terms and conditions or pricing or what not? But there is usually something out there that says I need to change how I do my underwriting prospectively. Is there anything on the horizon from your perspective that would make you change this how you think about your underwriting and if so, doesn't that mean that there won't be a hard market? If not, if there is no -- if they are not going to change underwriting standards, wouldn't that preclude a hard market?","Mike Sewell","Well, I think that as we look going forward the same approaches will be used as I just went over. I do think it has been a wakeup call in terms of appreciation of risk. We had three hurricanes, two earthquakes, now we've had a four storm in Nate [ph], we've got wildfires; and I think are is just a little bit of renewed appreciation of what can happen all at the same time. And I think also it's been a long time since there was an event in Florida, things have changed there over that period of time in terms of what we're seeing with assignment of benefits and the recognition of what that can bring, different players settling claims and maybe a better appreciation of degree of adjustors that are available to settle the claims and what that means.","So I think that there is kind of a wakeup call in terms of everybody understanding or being reminded of the type of risk that's out there but I do say in terms of our approach, it's going to be very consistent in to what we have done but we will recognize these factors.","Paul Newsome","Great, thank you very much.","Mike Sewell","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead please, your line is open.","Scott Heleniak","Good morning. Just a question, a follow-up on reinsurance, it sounds like pricing is probably going to improve there, that's at least with -- everyone is kind of talking about. So just wondering how that might change your appetite, I know you mentioned it -- some comments on the call about that and specifically, your appetite for property reinsurance, I know the book has been sort of 50 property versus casualty but if you could talk about some of the growth you might see there if we do see better pricing in your appetite there?","Steve Johnston","To the disciplined approach Scott, I actually over timed. We started out at about 50-50 but now we're more casualty oriented than we are property. I think you know here more recently it's a good bit over 50% in the casualty lines. So, again I think we'll look in terms of -- does it diversify, how correlated it is, we'll run through everything we can to understand the risk quantitatively and qualitatively and really be a no pressure to grow. It will be interesting to see how affirming takes place, I am confident that there will be firming, I think we're -- it will be interesting to see is how broad is the firming relative to contracts that had losses versus contracts that didn't. How long might that affirming last with the capital that is out there, how might it move from the property to the casualty, I think there are lot of unknowns but I do think and agree with kind of the consensus that we will be in a affirming here certainly for the short to mid-term.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And -- so would you say property is, what percentage of the reinsurance book would you say that is now around\u2026","Mike Sewell","The property right now for 2017 year-to-date, the property is 38%, casualty is 53% and specialty is 9%.","Scott Heleniak","Okay, great. And then just switching to the high network personal lines unit; can you talk about where that is tracking versus your expectations and which you're expecting in 2018? Do you expect to continue to roll that out to new state or kind of just working on penetrating where you are mostly?","J.F. Scherer","Scott, this is JF. Things have gone as planned and we're pleased with what's going. In personal lines we were up 34% of new business this year, for example, high net worth was up not surprisingly a big percentage, almost 90%. California is up and running very nicely, we're pleased with reception we got out there, Massachusetts just went live, and Washington State in August went live. So we're now in all of the parts of the country that are centers of high net worth; Long Island, New York, Westchester County, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Texas and California. We'll continue to open other states that would be the kinds of states where secondary residences would be located; Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, places of that nature, Hawaii.","So I think in terms of setting the infrastructure operate in good shape, out West for example, you heard Steve mention that we did not suffer many wildfire losses. We had some exposure in those areas but we've also established our wildfire defense services that will go out and protect individual homes with specific care, so we're pleased with the work that we've done there. So I think between our reputation as a company with agencies and we'll abandon who rules reputation in the industry. We've been able to get into all the agencies that we would like to get into, we're consistent approach there relative to -- relatively few number of appointments and we have a fairly -- thankfully, a fairly long list of agencies that do want to do business with us but we're committed to the initial appointments.","So I think we're obviously pleased, the premiums coming in well, we're pleased with the quality of the business that we're riding there. So, I'd say it just starts -- it's been a great start.","Scott Heleniak","Okay, that's helpful. That's all I have, thanks. Good luck.","J.F.

Please go ahead.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Late yesterday we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents please visit our Investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time some responses maybe made by others in the room with us, including Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, please we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. While severe winter weather, interrupted our recent strength of quarterly property casualty underwriting profits, we continue to be confident that our initiatives will drive long-term profit and will steadily grow our insurance operations. We had another solid quarter of price increases in excess of our loss cost trends and our mix of business continues shifting in a favorable direction, as we get more rate on lower margin policies and retain higher margin policies.","We continue to outpace the industry in premium growth, delivering new services to help our agents grow, while we carefully underwrote and priced each risks and we grew investment income by 5% over the first quarter of last year.","Our first quarter combined ratio was just over 100% with the catastrophe loss ratio roughly two thirds higher than our five year average for the first quarter. For our commercial line segment, we experienced the highest first quarter catastrophe loss ratio in at least 10 years and still generating the small underwriting profit.","In addition to higher than typical first quarter affects from natural catastrophes we experienced an unusually high amount of weather related losses that were not part of the main catastrophe event for the industry. On a total property casualty basis, our ratio of non-catastrophe weather for the first quarter of 2014 was 3.6 percentage points higher than last year\u2019s first quarter, and it was at its highest level since the first quarter of 2009.","Premiums continued to grow within the range we expected. Our property casualty net written premiums grew by 7% and we continued to benefit from greater pricing precision. Commercial policies that renewed during the first quarter, had estimated average price increases in the mid single-digit range. The average was near the lower end of the mid single-digit range and includes the [musing] effect of three other policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the first quarter.","As usual, some lines of business had average renewal price increases that were stronger than others. For instant our smaller commercial property policies had an average increase near the upper end of the high single-digit range. Consistent with the fourth quarter, renewal price increases for our excess and surplus lines segment continue to be in the high single-digit range, and for our personal lines segment that increase was in the mid single-digit range.","Our first quarter 2014, new business premiums slowed compared with a year ago, reflecting pricing and underwriting discipline. The first quarter decrease in our commercial lines of new business premiums was essentially due to a reduction in new larger workers compensation policies. New business written premiums for our major package lines, commercial casualty and commercial property grew 10% and 6% respectively. The reduction in our personal lines of new business premiums was as expected, reflecting the efforts of our recent underwriting profitability actions, higher premium rates and greater precisions in our pricing.","We believe the new business we are hitting is a higher quality, the homes we are arriving had new roofs and more of them are higher value homes. A larger portion of our personal lines new business is packaged to include both home and auto.","We also experienced satisfactory premium growth, in both our excess and surplus lines segment and in our life insurance segment, both producing operating profits. We continue executing on initiatives to improve insurance profitability and to drive premium growth. One initiative that adds premium growth overtime is our careful selection and appointments of new agencies.","In the first quarter of 2014 [we have] 27 new agencies. We also reported investment income growth for the third quarter in a row. First quarter 2014 investment income would have been higher than a year ago even without the effect of suppressed first quarter 2013 dividends.","You will recall that we reported about $5 million of special or accelerated dividends at the end of 2012 as issuers responded to anticipated tax law changes. I\u2019ll concluded with our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio. While that measure is most applicable for measuring long-term performance and creating shareholder value, our 2.6% first quarter result gives us a good start toward our longer term objective of an annual ratio averaging 10% to 13%.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will now add his comments about performance in related financial items.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you Steve. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin with a few important details about our investment portfolio.","The first quarter of 2014 again illustrated the benefit of our equity investing strategy. Our book value benefited from appreciation in our stock portfolio evaluation, and the bond portfolio also made a positive contribution.","Our stock portfolio\u2019s pretax net unrealized gains are approaching $1.9 billion and the dividend income from the portfolio continued to increase. Yields for our bond portfolio again moved slightly lower as the first quarter 2014 pre-tax yield of 4.82% was 11 basis points lower than a year ago.","Taxable bonds representing about 70% of our bond portfolio, had a pretax yield of approximately 5.29% at the end of the first quarter of 2014. The average yield for new taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter of 2014 was 4.51%. For the same period, our tax exempt bond portfolio yield was 3.85%, and purchases during the quarter yielded 3.19%. Our bond portfolio\u2019s effective duration measured 4.5 years at the end of first quarter unchanged from year end.","Cash flow from operating activities continues to benefit investment income. At a $129 million for the first quarter of 2014, net operating cash flow more than doubled the same period a year ago. We continue to carefully manage expenses helping to reduce the first quarter underwriting expense ratio by a full point compared to a year ago.","Moving to loss reserves, we continue to follow consistent approach, seeking to remain well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. For the first quarter of 2014, favorable development on prior accident years of 3.1% was close to the full year 2013 ratio of 4.1%.","We added net IBNR reserves in the first quarter, and property casualty growth reserves in aggregate for all accident years was $82 million or 2% from year end. As a result of larger than expected accident year 2013 loss payments for umbrella and general liability, we recognized $8 million of unfavorable development during the first quarter in our commercial casualty line of business.","Despite recognizing that development, the loss and loss expense ratio for that line\u2019s accident year 2013 is in line with accident years 2012 and 2011 after updating reserve estimates for all years as of March 31st. Commercial casualty has historically been among our largest and most profitable lines of business.","In each of the last 10 years, we have reported favorable annual reserve development and our consistent approach to reserving gives us confidence in the adequacy of current reserves for that line. Our first quarter reserve development by accident year was $18 million unfavorable for accident year 2013 driven by the commercial casualty lines of business, and $23 million favorable for accident year 2012, $11 million favorable for accident year 2011 and $14 million favorable for all older accident years in the aggregate.","Our financial strength and liquidity remained in excellent condition. We repurchased 150,000 shares during the first quarter, an average cost of $47.71 per share. This repurchase activity was again a maintenance type action intended to partially offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. Cash and marketable securities at the parent company remained at over $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter.","Our property casualty premiums to surplus ratio remained at 0.9 to 1 providing plenty of capital to support continued premium growth of our insurance business.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared comments as usual by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by less than $0.01. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.36. The change in unrealized gains on March 31st for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.35. The change in unrealized gains at March 31st for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.19. And we declared $0.44 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.52 during the first quarter to $37.73 per share.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. While the insurance business will always be challenging and challenged by the weather or other forces, investors, agents, associates and others can count on Cincinnati Financial to remain steady in execution of our strategy. That includes openness and integrity in how we operate. And we are pleased to be recognized again by Forbes. In its inaugural list of the America\u2019s 50 most trustworthy financial companies, we are the top performing company. This marks the fourth time in a row that Forbes has recognized us on one of its lists of trustworthy companies.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you throughout this year. As a reminder with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Matthews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck.","Jay, we are ready for you to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Bijan Moazami with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","Good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Bijan.","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","Good morning. If I\u2019m looking at the accident year loss ratios, typically if you look at the industry 2011, 2012, they were bad accident year, ending up [decision] and 2013 looks to be positive, could you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on in the commercial lines, casualty, commercial casualty, why you are seeing adverse losses in 2013, is there anything in particularly happening? And I understand that you guys have historically been incredibly conservative, so in terms of loss cost trend, if you could provide little bit more color would be great.","Steve Johnston","Sure Bijan, good question, thank you for asking. We have, as you mentioned, been very consistent in our approach, conservative in our approach and that is reflected in what you see today by posting some upward movement in our PIC for the most recent exit year of 2013. I think, the important thing to look there is that we did see a little bit in terms of more or higher payments and so we reacted to it.","But when you look at the exit year, even after we adjusted the PIC upwards, it's still very consistent in the mid-50 loss ratio range, where we've been the last few years. And we still feel very confident about the line, very confident about our reserving position, feel we're getting rate in excess of our loss cost trend and probably more important, really segmenting the book there and getting more rate on those that need more rate and nearly working hard to retain those that have the highest profit potential.","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","Great. As far as the personal lines goes with a very significant increase in current accident year loss ratio before cat, even when I adjust for the non-catastrophe weather related losses. Is there anything in particular going on in there or I'm counting my non-catastrophe weather-related losses somewhat in a wrong way?","Steve Johnston","No, I think your analysis is good, it's line we're keeping a close eye on. Again, I think we feel confident in the trends are within achievable rate increases. I think it is a first quarter, which there is a lot of uncertainty there that we reflect in terms of really for an exit quarter, the claim has to occurred in the first quarter and then reported the end reserve. So, I think we're taking a cautious approach there, but to your point one will be keeping a close eye on. And I think, whether it's weather or not weather a lot of it was driven by the physical damage part of it.","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","Great. One last question. Could you talk a little bit about what you expect the property inspections that you are planning to do for 2014 impacting your level of rate increases this year?","J.F. Scherer","John, this is J.F. Scherer. What we are trying to concentrate on the property inspections and in addition to that more loss control inspections is taking more underwriting action unnecessarily by raising rates and by recognizing conditions of property that would cause us to perhaps raise deductibles, suggest to the policyholder changes that they should make to minimize the possibility of a loss or to reduce a large loss.","There are a number of and we have mentioned this before, there are number of accounts that once we inspect them on homeowners, for example, we discover that a house is in a different protection class then what we had in our file, and so consequently we will get a rate increase there. From time to time we will also note that there is an undervalued circumstance both in commercial property or personal lines property of homeowner that will increase the coverage amount and there would be a corresponding increase in premium from that.","So the inspections really are designed to just provide us with a better look at the quality of the overall book of business that we have. Sometimes (inaudible) you\u2019ve point out, there would be a rate increase associated with it. Most times, however, we are taking underwriting action to improve the profile.","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","Thank you.","Steve Johnston","Thank you Bijan.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Good morning folks.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","If we look at the reserve charge from the casualty item, are we able to (inaudible) and that pull out maybe those discrete items and then look at what happened there from the reserve perspective, are we still at a sort of typical level of reserve releases if we exclude those items?","Steve Johnston","I think the reserves in terms of how we\u2019re doing that is very consistent with our approach. The actual overall reserve release was pretty consistent with the full year of 2013, maybe a little bit more favorable than it was first quarter a year ago. As we point out, with the first quarter we\u2019ve just completed the full year analysis just a few weeks ago, so we\u2019re not going to be making a whole lot of changes there, but we are prudent, we are conservative, and so when we saw and to your point, dug down a little bit deeper, we saw a little bit more higher than expected payments in the commercial casualty on a package or CMP liability and also our umbrella and so we reflected it.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Thank you. That\u2019s it for me. Nice question. I appreciate it.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Paul.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent DeAugustino with KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent DeAugustino - KBW","Hi. Good morning everyone.","Steve Johnston","Good morning Vincent.","Vincent DeAugustino - KBW","Just going back to one of your initiatives that we talked about a couple of quarters ago on the predictive claims launch that I think was supposed to go live in the third or fourth quarter on full workers comp last year. I am just curious maybe how the launch went? And if you haven't had any early thoughts on how might that process from a loss cost savings might be trending so far?","Marty Mullen","Good morning, Vincent. This is Marty Mullen in Claims. Yes, actually April 1st, we went live with our [fairest generation] of a predictive model for workers comps claims. We\u2019re quite encouraged with the initial results of the model, it\u2019s providing data and metrics on new claims as they move forward projecting the outcomes or projecting potential for outcomes for loss cost and return to working issues. So we're pretty excited with what we\u2019ve experienced so far. What we are looking forward to is the next generation will be to identify and apply the model to existing claims that have been open for a month to highlight tendencies those claims, which may require different type of attention via nurse case management or certain prescription attention. So it\u2019s live active and we're pretty encouraged.","Vincent DeAugustino - KBW","Great, sounds good. And then Marty just to stick with you, I guess it would be the right way to go on this anyway. So on an earlier call today, there are some discussion around some of the harsher winter weather impacting contractor activity and that basically leading to little bit of a benefit on workers comp, but I\u2019m just kind of curious if some of the underlying loss trends, I guess particularly on frequency, if you happen to be seeing anything similar to that in the -- since you\u2019ve workers comp book?","Marty Mullen","","I think our first quarter for work comp was fairly quiet and fairly normal, I can\u2019t say that we saw an uptick in that type of activity as far as on a claim count basis, so no I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve experience that.","Vincent DeAugustino - KBW","","Okay. And then just this is kind of a follow-up to the earlier reserve discussion here on this call, but if we go back to some of the older exiting years, I\u2019m looking at index reserve performance. One of the things that we have sometimes seem and necessarily has responded to some emerging, a trend is maybe a little bit of adverse reserve and immediately following initial calendar year, but then ultimately if you track how that exiting year develops more often not you end up getting the net cumulative favorable reserve development even including that initial kind of increase. And so, what I\u2019m just kind of curious about and kind of speaks to Paul\u2019s question a little bit, does this to you guys feel like it's consistent with your historical prudence that potentially implies that we'll ultimately see, if things kind of do not deteriorate, net favorable development on accident year 2013, or is it kind of as we look at some of these more concrete payment trends that really, no, maybe that's not the right way to think about it?","Steve Johnston","I think it is the right way, Vincent. I think it's the same stable approach. And as you were making your question, I was thinking to those excellent charts you have in your reports, the line graphs that show as the time progresses, accident years develop favorably. And I don't think that we see anything that would make us feel differently.","Vincent DeAugustino - KBW","Okay, sounds good. That's all I had and look forward to talking to you soon.","Steve Johnston","Great. Thank you Vincent.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The next question comes from Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital","Yes, good morning. A couple questions. First on the expense ratio, very good year-over-year improvement and although it\u2019s fairly consistent with the prior quarter, anything unusual in either last year's number that made it high or this year's number that made it a little lower or is it just continued blocking and tackling?","Mike Sewell","That's a great question and thanks for it. There is definitely going to be a little bit of a combination, that's going to be in there. Of course, you are going to have in any given period some accruals, timing of payments, things that occur that might make it bounce around a little bit. I would put the change here that you are seeing a little bit more along the lines of an overall -- we are controlling the increase of our spending on expenses and we are letting the increase in premiums outrun it. And so I think that\u2019s really going to be the major driver that you are seeing. As a full point improvement, if you are to look at the first quarter last year which was at 32.2 and where we ended up the year at 31.9, I am not sure if that trend will necessary continue for the rest of this year when you look at the 31.2 because you will have some volatility. But I am very encouraged that the way that we are controlling our expenses, there may be some fluctuations that are in there and will probably end up in a low 31 by the end of the year.","Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Same question, maybe for J.F. as much as anybody but anybody can chime in. Are you seeing any change in competitive behavior as far as competitors being, I will say, either more defensive on defending their own books of business or alternatively more aggressive on attacking newer books of business? And really we've heard a number of comments from different carriers, and we are seeing signs of higher overall premium retention ratios. Just curious, what you are seeing on the ground as far as how that dynamic is playing out?","J.F. Scherer","Mark, I think you hit an important factor on defending renewals. Last year this time, for example, there were still carriers that were pre-announcing if you will to their agents that they intended to be very aggressive about increasing rates, just trying to set the stage for it. I think it consequently, a lot of the business that would have been written with that carrier would have found itself in the marketplace being [shot]. I think what we\u2019re seeing just relative to competitive environment is that there is more defense of renewals. What I would say is that carriers are little more comfortable with where they have their rates. They\u2019re signaling that they will be happier with modest increases and therefore more aggressive perhaps about defending the renewal, not wanting to lose it. So we\u2019re clearly seeing that in the marketplace.","We\u2019re seeing some signs of a little bit of added competitiveness from some carriers. A few examples of bonus commissions been announced by some carriers to go after business. I can\u2019t say that we feel that our book of business is being specifically targeted by anyone. We haven\u2019t noticed that. One of the things about our new business for example for the first quarter and we had a significant first quarter of last year. I mean it was really a heck of an increase in new business in the first quarter. We are very pleased with what we saw in our ability to write business both in property and casualty lines to have an increase over a big increase last year.","The only thing we saw in terms of new business in commercial lines that, and I don\u2019t think it was an example of a competitive marketplace, is that we just didn\u2019t write as many larger workers\u2019 comp policies as new businesses we would have. And I don\u2019t know in the second quarter, we might write an extraordinary amount simply because of just the timing, things of that nature.","So I think as a general statement as far as the marketplace is concerned, it seems that the marketplace has pricing more in line with what the way it would have wanted to be. Somebody else\u2019s renewal will be less attractive or less easy to compete for this year, and so that\u2019s how I size up the whole marketplace in general.","Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital","","Thanks very much. That\u2019s great color.","Operator","","There are no additional questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Johnston for closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, thank you all for your excellent questions and for joining us today.

We're also pleased with another quarter of strong investment performance, and Mike will soon comment on investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains.","Before that, I'll highlight a few more aspects of our insurance operations. We believe we're reporting a healthy rate of premium growth for each of our insurance segments. Our work for greater pricing precision allows us to underwrite on a policy-by-policy basis and strengthens our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.","Pricing was generally in line with the second quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced third quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single digit range with personal auto near the high end of that range.","Our reinsurance assumed operations known as Cincinnati Re saw another quarter of steady growth as our team works to selectively build out a diversified portfolio of treaty business.","Third quarter underwriting results benefited from the June 30 loss reserves that are developing favorably as we obtain additional information on reinsured claims. The resulting favorable effect for the short tail portion of the portfolio contributed to a $6 million third quarter underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re.","We also experienced ongoing progress in expanding personalized products and services, we offer to our agencies higher net worth clients. Almost one fourth of the total $91 million in Personal Lines new business written premiums for the first nine months of 2016 came from high net worth policies.","We continue to see good performance for our Commercial Line segment, with a third quarter combined ratio near 90%. Our Excess and Surplus lines segment continued to report superb results with a combined ratio below 70% for both the three and nine months ended September 2016.","For our Life Insurance subsidiary, earned premiums continue to rise at a double digit clip for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2016. Even though unlocking of interest rate is similar actuarial assumptions slowed our year-to-date growth and income.","Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio reached 14% on a year-to-date basis with generally higher investment portfolio valuations using the strong 6% contribution from operating performance.","I'll also briefly comment on estimated effects of Hurricane Matthew on fourth quarter results. While still early, we estimate the catastrophe incurred loss effect to be between $40 million and $65 million pre-tax. Including a net effect of $5 million to $10 million from our reinsurance assumed operation.","While the financial impacts are important, the real story for us lies in the hard work of our field claims representatives. More than 50 associates volunteered to leave their families to help policyholders in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina to put their lives back together. We're here to pay claims. As our associates fulfill that promise with efficiency and empathy, they become our greatest sales advantage. Satisfied policyholders share their experience with their neighbors, giving our agents and us the opportunity to write more business and continue growing our company.","With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will comment on other areas of our financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few third quarter investment highlights. Third quarter 2016 was our thirteenth consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pre-tax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis, that growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income.","Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of nice growth and unrealized gains, and we reported a 1% increase in fair value. In total, we ended the third quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.7 billion before taxes including more than $2.1 billion in our equity portfolio. The bond portfolios pre-tax average yield reported a 4.63% for the third quarter, slightly exceeded 4.62% from the last year's third quarter.","Taxable bonds purchased during the first nine months of 2016 have an average pre-tax yield of 4.27%, 23 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased average 2.89%, 45 basis points lower than a year ago. Our bond portfolios effective duration at September 30 was 4.9 years, up slightly from 4.8 years at the end of June.","Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first nine months of 2016, rose 9% compared with a year ago and helped generate $375 million of net purchases of securities for investment portfolios.","As always we work to carefully manage our expenses at the same time strategically investing in our business. Our nine month 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.3 percentage points compared with a year ago.","Moving to the other side of the balance sheet, our loss reserves continue to experience favorable development, as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first nine months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 4.6 percentage points, very similar to the same period a year and full year 2015.","Reserve development for the first three quarters continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014 and 15% for accident year 2013. Overall reserves at the end of September, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded, rose 6% from last year with IBNR representing more than half of that.","Our assessment of the Company's cup of strength, liquidity and financial flexibility, is that they remain at healthy levels. Capital management objectives include supporting future profitable growth of our Insurance operations plus other areas such as returning capital to shareholders.","As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.35. Life Insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than Life Insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.48.","The change in unrealized gains at September 30th for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.04. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.51. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was book value increase of $0.87 during the third quarter to our record $43.24 per share.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston: Thanks Mike. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder, with Mike and me today, are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. ","Shannon, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","Congratulations on the quarter. I was wondering about, what you are seeing in both the claim frequency numbers for both the commercial auto and the personal auto businesses? And whether or not, you saw particularly in commercial auto sort of an acceleration of frequency over the last couple of months or quarters?","Steve Johnston","Paul this is Steve, and as we look at that, not that we don't see any issues with frequency, but for our auto lines, it's been more of a severity issue than it has been frequency issue. So, obviously, I think we've had strong results. Thanks for the compliment. There are some areas obviously that we need to work on and that would \u2013 the auto lines would be at the top of that list. And I think there is a lot of action that's taking place that makes us feel good about the progress. It just does take a while for the various initiatives we put in place, including rate, but in addition to rate, to help the situation. And I don't know if J.F. wanted to add anything to that.","J.F. Scherer","Yeah, Paul. Going along with Steve's comment about rate, we did particularly relative to commercial auto, we're up counts of agents from brokers meeting a couple weeks ago, met with 40 agencies, the larger agencies out there. And the topic of conversation among those agencies was commercial auto, and the fact that market is firming up and that they are prepared to deliver rate increases. So, that's kind of a bigger hurdle, but there's that acknowledgement throughout the industry of the need for more rate. And so we would anticipate that will continue into the future. But, that's right if things we continue to do on the \u2013 to try to address the severity issue.","I think most of what we would say is the exact same things what others in the industry are talking about, whole variety of things. Cars are more expensive to fix, aluminum is being used more than steel, and that's more expensive to repair. A lot of the same things, distracted driving continues to be an issue. A lot of accidents that we've noticed, no skid marks, lot of distracted walking and biking. We've had two very severe accidents in the Chicago area. You may have heard about them that, where people in bike lanes and they'd be not in bike lanes for example in metropolitan areas have resulted in some larger claims.","The issue related to the driver shortage continues to be one that's talked about a lot. Drivers, some statistics from the PCI Conference, drivers that are under 30 years old are two times more likely to have accidents. And so, a lot of discussion about older drivers being brought back, folks that haven't retired, drivers that are above 60 or 1.5 times more apt to have accidents.","So we're seeing a lot of issues related to that. So, what we're trying to do is to ramp up our loss control making certain that as we visit policyholders, if they have driver education programs, things of that nature, and then as we underwrite business, an awful lot of attention \u2013 additional attention is being applied to the driver information, age of driver, the types of vehicles that those drivers are assigned to. In other words, young driver to heavy trucks is a bad formula. So, all those things are going to be taken into consideration in addition to the rate that we expect to get.","Paul Newsome","Just to be clear on this, because it is \u2013 what I'm hearing, I think is different from others, and that on the commercial auto side, we've had a severity issue for some time, notable big liability losses, and then \u2013 but not a frequency issue until, perhaps recently. And then on the auto side it was the opposite, we've had sort of ongoing severity running in or frequency \u2013 pardon me, ongoing severity running sort of 3 to 5 for years. But frequency only rose sort of beginning \u2013 well really beginning of 2015 and have gone through increases. And it sounds like we've had some other companies talking about sort of spike and higher frequency particularly on the commercial auto recently. You are saying, it's not a frequency issue, it's all about the severity in your book, is that fair, or am I oversimplifying?","Steve Johnston","I think it's \u2013 I wouldn't say it's unfair. I think that we do keep an eye on all elements of the pure premium, the frequency and the severity. But I think as we see it with our book, it is much more of a severity issue for both the personal and the commercial. I think that's pretty consistent with what we've seen and said through time here.","Paul Newsome","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Steve Johnston","Okay. Thank you, Paul.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Scott Heleniak","Just a \u2013 first on the E&S unit, obviously a great result there and I was just wondering if you could talk more about why that business continues to perform so much better than your peers, and I don't know if you have anything you can attribute to that, to specifically if it's mix or the risks you are writing or some of the relationships you have in place in that business? I don't know if you have any color on that, because that business has done so well for quite a long time.","J.F. Scherer","Scott, this is J.F. I guess I would probably put top of the list just our model doing business with our independent agents, unlike others in the E&S business. We are not going through wholesalers. We're only doing business with established relationships with the Cincinnati Insurance Company. We test that as part of the amount of opportunity we have in our agencies, there is somewhere in the area of $2 billion of E&S premium is written with Cincinnati Insurance Company agents.","We visit the agencies in person, in many cases with our Excess and Surplus lines underwriters, are field reps that are in the E&S side of things. We include the premium, intermingle the premium with our standard market premiums and losses on the profit sharing contract. So, I think our agencies appreciate what we're doing. They want to make certain that the business they put with us isn't for lack of a better word, the type of thing you throw against the wall and see if it sticks, it's more carefully placed with us.","I think our appetite is, perhaps a little bit more conservative than most. Having said that, we'll finish this year $200 million at the end of our ninth full year in the E&S business, and it's not as though we don't write some tougher risks. But I think the balance there has been good. Don Doyle and his team have been very disciplined about what we're doing. About 85% of what we write is on the casualty side, and we stay pretty strong with our terms and conditions. So, I wouldn't say there is anything magical about it other than I think our model of doing business with just Cincinnati Insurance Company agencies has probably paid off for us.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. What I would imagine, so you are benefiting from increased admission through this business gets bigger, you get a lot more looks, is there a factor too recently?","J.F. Scherer","Yeah one of the things that we are consistently doing is adding more and more field underwriters in this area. And so, when you're calling on your agents, person the person, you do get more looks. We visit with a lot of our agency principles about the advantages we think we bring to the table. And as time goes on, perhaps some of the habits that they're in, using various E&S wholesalers, so we break through those, and once that gets going, there is a momentum associated with that.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. That's helpful on that. Then, just moving onto the Cincinnati Re, that's obviously been kind of ramping up nicely $50 million or so, pretty in this year, and I saw you had, three kind of senior hires in the quarter, and wondering if you can share anything just about kind of the opportunities you see for just 2017 in the next few years and how you are looking at that business?","Steve Johnston","Thanks Scott. Good Question. We're confident in the business. We do and we appreciate you noticing that we have really hired some very talented people. Jamie Hole, who we've known for a long time started to add up. We're right on it down the line, I won't call him out by names, but every single hire I think has been very strong, very experienced, come with a variety of strong backgrounds and they are really working together as a team. You know I think it's important as we go forward to rely on their expertise and that we're going to take a conservative approach to it. We didn't set up a company to do this with capital allocated with demand to produce a return on that capital. It's very much just allocated, treaty by treaty as we look at them, and so appreciate you noticing the talent. We feel confident in the people that we've hired, the business plan they've put together and our prospects going forward.","Scott Heleniak","Okay, got it. Then just, last question was just on the accident year loss ratio and commercial was up a little bit. And I was just wondering if there is anything kind of unusual in there year-over-year, where there is any non-cat weather, any other factor that kind of drove that or any particular line that it kind of stuck on that?","Steve Johnston","I think we feel confident in the strong results of the Commercial Lines. Obviously, we talked about commercial auto being a bit of an issue that J.F. laid out on the initiative that we've put in place that I think we're confident in any uptick can be attributed to noise and we fell pretty darn confident.","Scott Heleniak","There was a tough comparison that.","Steve Johnston","Yes. Thank you.","Scott Heleniak","That's all I had.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ian Gutterman","I guess maybe to start off. This is probably for J.F. Market competition sounds like it's fairly stable in your eyes, is that right and the reason I ask is, as you listen to some of the commentary from others over the last quarter or so, it feels like a number of your competitors are kind of calling out, the things are getting tougher. Are you seeing that, or not as much in your business?","J.F. Scherer","No. I think there might be a slightly muted effect from us because of our three year policies, not as many of our accounts go to market every year, so I think that's a real positive from our standpoint. There's competition out there. It is muted by the firmness of commercial auto side of things, and when we compete, we compete on an account by account basis, and there may be some carriers that maybe more aligned and business oriented about how they compete, they might see, they may be seeing a different type of competition or more intense competition, for example. But it's \u2013 there is competition. It's modest. A great account goes to market. It will draw \u2013 it will definitely draw some attention. But, the types of things that we may have heard in previous soft markets where there's reckless competition, we don't see that occurring.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Great. And then to follow-up on the reinsurance, Steve I guess about a year into it now, right. So, I don't know if you can give us a little more data on sort of what the book looks like you know maybe a split of short tail versus long tail or [indiscernible] or just, I guess what I'm struggling with the most is just how to think about, how caveat is I guess, like what kind of \u2013 like you said, I guess $5 million to $10 million for Matthew, but you know sort of if there is an event, how should I think about that book, or what a normal cat load is or however you are comfortable talking about it?","Steve Johnston","Right. That's a good question and something we monitor as well. It is very much in allocated capital model, so we don't even put targets if we're going to have this much in property, this much in casualty and so forth. But if you look at it, this would be inception to-date. So including last year, we have just about $89 million in net written premium. Of that about $43 million is on the property side, so that can kind of give you \u2013 it feels almost 50\/50. You know we feel pretty good that in about a year of existence including the ramp up in hiring of the talent and joining the team together that we have had profitability so far. And so, we feel good about it, but we're not going to be as a start up here, we're not going to put demands in terms of growth or particular mixes of business.","We just want them to look at them one-by-one, try to determine how much capital that we would want to allocate to that particular contract, really make sure that we understand it quantitatively and qualitatively, and if we do, then we will go forward with that contract. And we'll keep you posted as the numbers might move, but I have to say it's been pretty balanced as it's turned out.","Ian Gutterman","And the non-property component is that mostly sort of traditional casualty or is there like you know U.K. Motor or mortgage insurance or some of the more trendy type things, or is this just kind of an casualty, or how should I think about that?","Steve Johnston","I think it's mainly United States. I don't think that we have much in terms of international. We do have a little bit of mortgage insurance, but not much at all. It's you know contractor too that they've very much vetted. So, I would say that it's a pretty standard. In terms of reinsurance anyways a pretty standard book of casualty business.","Ian Gutterman","Perfect. Okay, and then just my last topic was, last year for the first time you did essentially a fifth dividend, I guess a special dividend. Given how results have been this year and capital being in good shape, have you given any thought to whether it's something you'd want to repeat or is that really just a one-time thing, and don't expect it going forward?","Steve Johnston","Well, I thought that question might come up. So, I pulled the press release from last November, and I think we were trying to be pretty transparent then. We were looking at this as a one-time special dividend and that we did cite the increase in operating earnings being up 30% from where they had been in the prior year and just wanting to reward shareholders, and we're going to continue to look at capital management, hadn't been on this 56 year of increasing our dividends and feel very confident in everything that we're doing. But did want to \u2013 I think we were trying to put the message out last year, that that was to be considered a one-time event.","Ian Gutterman","Got it, just checking. Alright, thanks, good luck.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Ian.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Can we talk a little about Life Insurance strategy? You know it seems like you guys have grown it somewhat hopefully this year, it's still you know a very, very small part of the business. Why does it make sense for Cincinnati to be the owner of this business, and what is the opportunity and is cross-sell successful or most of it is at least sold through Life Insurance agents at this point. How should we think about it?","Steve Johnston","I guess we're again confident in the Life Insurance business. We think there are cross-serving opportunities there. About, I think 70% of the premium or so, comes from our P&C agencies. And as you know, whenever multiple policies are involved, the retention rate on all of them goes up. We do have some exciting products I think that are on the development board that we've talked about with our agents and they're excited about. It would be an easy issue, term policy that would be marketed through our P&C agents, where we would be able to ask just a few questions and draw on data that they've provided through their Personal Lines applications to be input into a predictive model, such that we could offer up to $500,000 in term coverage right on the spot. So, we think that's going to roll out early next year the early.","The early trials that we've been putting that through seem to make it, you know something that we're confident in. The worksite products that we have on the Commercial Line side are a nice complement to what we're doing through our commercial insurance, and so we do think it very much complements what we do on the P&C side. It allows us have higher retention and we're confident in the growth of Cincinnati Life going forward.","Josh Shanker","Is the point, so all you have to do is ask that, you give someone a product they didn't have before and they are going to sell it or there are particular competitive advantages in the Cincinnati product versus what's already in the market?","Steve Johnston","I think the latter. I think there will be some competitive advantages to this product.","Josh Shanker","Because it \u2013 how would that work I mean in terms, and to my mind is a pretty generic product overall. How do you see you having an advantage in that market?","Steve Johnston","Just the ease of the issue and how will it be coordinate with the sale of the Personal Lines P&C products, I think makes it relatively unique.","Josh Shanker","You wouldn't need a medical test with this product?","Steve Johnston","That's correct. I mean assuming the questions that are answered and the data that we collect comes back in a favorable light, there would not need to be the blood draw, the medical exam and so forth.","Josh Shanker","Alright. Well, good luck. Keep us updated.","Steve Johnston","Okay. Thank you, Josh.","Operator","At this time I would return the conference to Mr. Steve Johnston. Mr. Johnston, please take over.","Steve Johnston","Okay. Thank you, Shannon. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call he may now disconnect."],"5545":["Cincinnati Financial Corp (NASDAQ:CINF) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 25, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Dennis McDaniel - VP & IR Officer","Steven Johnston - President, CEO & Director","Michael Sewell - CFO, SVP & Treasurer","Stephen Spray - SVP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director","Martin Hollenbeck - CIO, SVP, Assistant Secretary & Assistant Treasurer","Conference Call Participants","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital Markets","Meyer Shields - KBW","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Dennis McDaniel with Investor Relations Officer. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us on our Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the navigation menu on the far left. ","On this call, you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. ","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules, and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn it over to -- call to Steve.","Steven Johnston","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Our operating performance was again strong, and we're making steady progress on profitably growing our insurance business overtime. We believe our improving results reflect our winning strategy and dedication to executing it well. ","Net income for the third quarter of 2019 was very good. Although, it did not match our results from a year ago when changes in the fair value of equity securities represented nearly 2\/3 of the total. Non-GAAP operating income was up an impressive 31% and is up 26% for the first 9 months of this year. Every segment of our business performed well, and it was nice to see an underwriting profit in each of our property casualty operating units for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. ","Our 94.2% third quarter 2019 property casualty combined ratio was 2.6 percentage points better than a year ago, and it improved 2.7 points on a year-to-date basis. We continue to see benefits from work in recent years to diversify risk by product line and geography. We also are pleased with results from ongoing segmentation of risks, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business. That gives us increasing confidence to decline opportunities when we determine profit margins are unsatisfactory. We also benefit from having outstanding independent insurance agents, representing the company. They understand how to communicate value to their clients, and they continue to produce more premium revenues for us as we earn a larger share of their business. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 8%, including renewal price increases and healthy growth in new business written premiums. ","The commercial lines segment's third quarter 2019 estimated average price increases were similar to the low single-digit percentage increases of the second quarter. The combined ratio for commercial lines was 2.5 percentage points better than the third quarter a year ago and 1.8 points better on a year-to-date basis. Our personal lines segment also continued to experience average rate increases similar to the second quarter of 2019. We're encouraged by two consecutive quarters with the personal lines underwriting profit, and believe we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. Our excess and surplus lines segment continues to perform very well, including a third quarter combined ratio below 85% and net written premium growth of 25%. Cincinnati Re continues to perform as planned with the year-to-date combined ratio in the low 90s. Cincinnati Global experienced a very profitable quarter and has a post-acquisition combined ratio in the low 80s, including some favorable effects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. ","Our life insurance subsidiary continued to grow its business with third quarter term life insurance premiums up 12% on an earned basis. While as net income contribution was not as strong as last year, Cincinnati Life provides valuable diversification to our insurance risks and our earnings. More importantly, agents appreciate the ability to add life insurance solutions for their clients, all under the Cincinnati umbrella. Our investment performance also continues to be outstanding. Investment income continues to grow and our equity portfolio during the first 3 quarters of this year has outperformed the S&P 500. ","I'll wrap up with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Improving operating results and favorable securities markets resulted in a third quarter VCR of 3.6%, boosting the 9-month measure to 22.8%, well above our targeted annual average of 10% to 13%. The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was 6.3% for the first 9 months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. ","While our equity portfolio supported our healthy VCR, we understand the risk of short-term variability due to market effects. We believe its potential for long-term appreciation is important for creating value for shareholders overtime. ","Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will share insights on other important areas of our financial results.","Michael Sewell","Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our investment income rose again, up 5% for the third quarter of 2019 before income tax effects. Dividend growth from our equity portfolio was 11% as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings. Net purchases of stocks during the third quarter totaled $77 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio declined slightly from the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.03% for the third quarter, down 16 basis points from the third quarter of last year. ","We continue to invest in bonds with third quarter net purchases of $208 million. As we reported in our 10-Q, the average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds was roughly 60 basis points lower than the same period in 2018, so interest income may continue to be pressured. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the third quarter of 2019 were again favorable for both our stock and bond portfolios. The overall net gain was $186 million before tax effects. That included $89 million for equity portfolio and $99 million for our bond portfolio. ","We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of $4.2 billion, including $3.6 billion in our equity portfolio. Cash flow remained strong and fueled investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $880 million for the first 9 months of 2019, up 7% or $54 million, even after paying $114 million more this year in catastrophe losses. Another important area for management is balancing expense controls with strategic investments to aid in the profitable growth of our business. ","The third quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.3 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter. But on a 9-month basis, it matched the average of full years 2016 through 2018. Regarding reserving, doing so carefully is imperative. We aim for a consistent approach as we target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the third quarter 2019, we experienced a satisfactory amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefit our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points. ","On a year-to-date, all lines basis by accident year, it included 33% for accident year 2018, 27% for accident year 2017 and 40% for 2016 and prior accident years. Regardless of weather, the root cause of particular changes and loss control trends is from social inflation or other matters, we do our best to establish adequate reserves. For example, we have disclosed that since the end of 2015, we've increased our commercial casualty total loss reserves by $324 million or 26%. ","The IBNR component of that total is up $220 million or 49%. During the same period, annualized earned premiums, one way to estimate the change in insured exposure is up only 8%. For commercial auto, total loss reserves are up 44% with the IBNR component up 158%, while earned premiums are up 25%. Turning to managing capital, another critical function for the company. Our approach remains stable. Our financial strength is excellent as is our financial flexibility. As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.08. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.62. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.48. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.43, and we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.45 during the third quarter to a record high, $57.37 per share. ","Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steven Johnston","Thanks, Mike. As we head into the last quarter of the year, we're committed to maintaining the momentum we've created so far in 2019. We're confident that Cincinnati Financial was on the right track to deliver shareholder value far into the future. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. ","As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, Theresa Hoffer and Ken Stecher. ","Katherine, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski","First question. Thanks for addressing the loss trend discussion. If I look at your year-to-date losses paid versus incurred levels for commercial casualty and commercial auto, they -- just the ratio does seem to be higher year-over-year, I think, or I could be wrong year-over-year but it's close to 100%. Does that indicate that you potentially are seeing a rise in loss inflation trends? I don't know your view there. Are you guys seeing any changes, some of your competitors, the larger ones, have said that they are seeing an increase in trend? And they also pointed out that they're getting more pricing, so maybe you could comment on that.","Steven Johnston","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And that does seem to be the question of this earning season. As we look at the paid-to-incurred ratios, the paid -- as you mentioned, the paid to incurred this year is a bit higher than last year. But last year was actually one of the lowest paid incurred that we had. So if we look at it more over the long term, we think we've addressed our reserving position in casualty, commercial auto and really all the lines very consistently over time. And I think I break it down, going back to 2015, 2016 as Mike pointed out in his conference call. ","We look at inflation in total. So social inflation or any other kind of inflation would be a part of that, and we have a very talented actuarial team. They use a very sophisticated basket of techniques to come up with the estimate. ","One of them that they use is a multiple regression method that regresses not only over the accident years, the development years but also the calendar years. And that regression over the calendar years makes an explicit estimation of inflation effects. ","And so I thought it was important that Mike pointed out that while the total reserve has been increasing much more than the earned premium or our proxy for exposure. Within that increase, the IBNR was up significantly. The IBNR for casualty over that period of time was up 49%; the auto, up 158%. And if you think about it, we like, most people, that IBNR component has a provision for both the development on case incurred losses, which our claims department does a great job of estimating, and those are claims that have actually been reported and we put an estimate on it. So within that IBNR, there's a good bit of -- for pure IBNR, pure incurred but not reported claims. And so I think a lot of the inflationary effects, no matter how we described them, would be in those ones that we really don't know about yet. The incurred but not reporting. And I think over the history of our company, we've just really done a good job of being prudent in terms of estimating the total reserve. And I think this increase in IBNR that we've had over a period of time has put us really in a good position. I think it's manifested in now 29 years in a row that we've had our reserves developed favorably, and we really just think our best to estimate for our lines of business are all in a good position right now. So that's part of it. That's the reserving part of your question, I think. ","And I think that that's an important part of it because you don't want to have to be paying for adverse development on prior years. So we feel we're in a good position in terms of our current reserves. ","On the pricing side of it, again, and I might ask Steve Spray to contribute a bit here too. But I think between where we estimate the loss cost trends and where we think we're getting rate. And when we throw in that rate, we really throw in the contribution of the segmentation that we're doing in terms of not treating every risk the same. We're really differentiating, segmenting, treating each risk on its own merits. And so we are -- we feel good about our position in commercial casualty. If you take just the overall commercial expense ratio of 32% and add it to either our accident year x-cap, loss ratio or the calendar year, and we're under 100. And so we feel both on the reserve side and on the property or on the pricing and underwriting side, we're in a good spot too.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. Great that's helpful. And I guess, I think, I've tried to ask this in previous quarter just because there's a number of moving parts, and it's -- workers comps are meaningful beneficiary and the -- to earnings mostly from reserve releases. But the top line is coming down a lot and the underlying loss ratio is deteriorating. ","So is that trend mostly due to decreases in pricing? And on the other hand, what's causing so much of reserve releases to come out. Is it both severity and frequency are better, or is it mostly more recent accident years or the older accident years? Any color would be helpful.","Steven Johnston","Sure. This is Steve Johnston again. On the reserving said, I'll touch on that, and then Steve Spray will touch on the pricing side. But on the reserving side, we -- whenever we set these, we set our reserves with certain assumptions as to inflation settlement practices in all the data that we can look at. And basically what's been happening with the workers compensation is, and I think it's a real team effort around here in terms of every area the company contribute in, particularly our claims department, our underwriting department, the pricing department. The actuals have just been coming in underneath, what we said is our expectation for the reserve development. ","So it's just been a matter of actuals comparing favorable to what we put in in terms of the expectation. And you have to be careful with setting those expectations. I'm sure you know in the workers comp, longtail line, a lot of the trends have been favorable over time but you have to be careful to keep an eye out for any turning points that there might be. And again, we take a prudent approach to the reserving of all lines. And Steve, you might want to comment on the pricing.","Stephen Spray","Yes, Mike. Steve Spray. On the pricing, it's similar to the discussions we've had in the prior few quarters. NCCI base rate declines across states are having a compounding effect. But I will tell you, I concur completely with Steve, it's been a total team effort here. Our field reps, our renewal underwriters are working with our agents on work comp pricing, making sure that our risk selections where it needs to be that we're getting the right rate. Of all of our lines, commercial lines, lines of business, the new business is really only off in 2 lines, workers compensation and professional liability. Professional liability is a much smaller segment. But I think it shows the discipline we have in risk selection and in pricing on the work comp book. ","Just looking at the -- as Steve talked about the segmentation, specifically the workers compensation, and we use the analytics and the tools that we have there. We still feel good about our overall pricing of that book of business, but it's no doubt the accident year results are under pressure from the base rate declines.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. Great that's helpful. And just lastly on the excess and surplus lines segments. If you could remind us is this growth sustainable? Is there something one time, or is it -- I know there was a Lloyd's acquisition maybe that's in that segment too?","Steven Johnston","Yes. The CGE, the Lloyd's acquisition would not have any impact on our E&S company, CSU. I would say that I feel that the -- that we feel that the growth there in CSU is sustainable. I think it's -- it is showing what's going on in the marketplace. The submission counts in our E&S company are up considerably. I would make note there too Mike that we've got just a great experience team, and they have been consistent and stable in their underwriting appetite, the terms, conditions and the pricing, and the pricing is improving as well. ","Our value proposition for our agents is still extremely attractive. I think we have more and more of our agencies turning to us and because of our value proposition with the E&S company, and I've talked about that in the past as well. So we feel good about not only the profitability that we have there but our growth trajectory too.","Michael Zaremski","And I guess just I could ask you sometimes I don't have the best answer. So just the -- like usually an E&S company doesn't fit in a traditional commercial insurance company. So what -- why are you -- how are you able to have the analytics or capabilities to have an E&S company, since you are more of a traditional commercial insurer? Is there something unique there?","Steven Johnston","Yes. I think one, we've just -- we've built a tremendous amount of expertise on the team for E&S underwriting. The majority of that book, about 88% of it, is really traditional casualty business, albeit a little tougher, all right? So it might be -- well, inherently it's going to be a risk that is not eligible for the admitted market. As an example, you might have a borrowed tab and the admitted market doesn't feel that it can get the proper terms and conditions or pricing, so that would end up in the E&S market. ","Where I think our differences, and why we are outperforming the industry on our E&S operation is we've stuck to our knitting, like I said before, the underwriters, the entire team has been consistent in their appetite in terms, conditions and the pricing. And the value proposition we have for our agents and the policyholders and their community is different. The traditional E&S route is for a retail agent to go to the wholesale market, and then the wholesale market go to the broader E&S carriers. ","We've formed our own brokerage, our underwriters are employees of the brokerage, our agents have direct access to the decision-makers in our E&S company. The other big thing is, now there's a several of them. But we gave our agents, I think more confidence on that E&S business because we use all the local resources of Cincinnati Insurance company to bear with our E&S company as well. Most importantly, our claims operation. So our agents have a relationship with that local claims adjuster that will handle both the admitted market business as well as the nonadmitted. We run our brokerage lean and mean. We can return more of the commission to our agents. And on top of that, we include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the Cincinnati Insurance company overall profit sharing arrangements. So we're aligned with our agents but they send us business that they feel is going to perform better than maybe some other E&S might.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","Congrats on the quarter. One of the things just comes up with the call so far has been most of BCF reported incrementally stronger price increases in the third quarter and the second. But I think you said that you really weren't seeing that, it was more flat, not that that's terribly bad. But could you maybe, I think, I know what the answer is but could you maybe talk about why this might be the case that maybe you're not seeing quite the same dynamic as some other companies in the commercial insurance role?","Stephen Spray","Well, Paul, this is Steve Spray. Let me try to tackle that. Let me try to tackle from commercial, personal and E&S. We have had consistent average net rate change that we've reported over the last several quarters. But that doesn't tell the full story. What we're really trying to execute. And I think we're doing a great job in all segments. At the underwriting level working with our agents is focused on segmentation. We're really focused on retaining the most profitable business, the business that we feel we have an opportunity to have a better margin. We are really focused on getting larger rate that's needed on that business that we feel is less apt to drive a profit for us. And our retention spreads look really good there as well. So we are retaining more of that -- more profitable business. We're either getting rate or we're losing some of that business to the market, and we're comfortable with that. It's changing our mix, and I think it's -- you're seeing it in our results. ","Now that's primarily, what I'm talking about there is commercial lines. The same story is going on in personal lines. You can see it in our auto results. We continue to improve our sophistication on pricing both on the auto, in home. That continues to evolve. It's good number that's going to continue to get better. And as everybody is reporting, you're seeing better personal auto results, and we're seeing that as well. But there is certainly some variability and volatility going on in the homeowner book and we've seen that as well. ","And the good news there is we feel like we're in a positive rate environment on homeowner, and we think the runaway is long, and we'll continue that we'll serve everybody well and it's needed. Our E&S company has continued to get low single-digit rate even with the levels of profit that they've generated. They've gotten low single-digit rate quarter over quarter over quarter for quite a while. So that really sums up the way we look at rate, and the way we look at execution, the way we work day-to-day with our agents, Paul.","Steven Johnston","And Paul, this is Steve. I might just add 1, just -- I agree with -- 100% with everything Steve said. With the commercial casualty and it's more of a Q comment then we put in the press release or the scripts that we are gaining a little bit more on the commercial casualty, still in that same range that we put out. But it is a little bit higher than it's been in the second quarter on average and Steve's points about segmentation talk to the distribution about that average.","Paul Newsome","Could you home in on some of the -- on your commercial auto business and what's happening with your business as well as your perception of the market. That seems to be the most notable segment the people are focusing on -- across the industry.","Stephen Spray","Yes. Sure. Paul. And prior to the role I'm in now, when I was leading commercial lines. I lived this real time. So I think I can speak to it. This is Steve Spray. We really saw back in 2016 is where we really took a sense of urgency and started taking serious action on the commercial auto book. And again, it goes, to what I mentioned before, we really focused on the segmentation piece of it and risk selection. But just from a pricing standpoint, we really got aggressive starting in 2016, and I really believe that we're out in front of this issue. And the reason I can -- why I measure that is we have such a close relationship with our agents. We have so few of them, you know our distribution model. But we on a daily basis, we're delivering necessary auto rate change back starting in 2016. We were causing considerable pain, and we heard pretty regularly that we were, \"an outlier\" from our agents as far as how hard we were pushing. ","Well, fast forward to fourth quarter '18, really beginning in '19, that pain has really, kind of, gone away. And I think it's because others really started noticing and started taking similar action. So if you look at our x-cap accident year on the commercial auto, it is continuing to improve. We haven't crossed the finish line. Now that loss ratio isn't where we wanted to be. But I can tell you we feel really good about the trajectory and where we're heading with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Another great quarter. Congratulations. So I got a question this morning, somebody wanted to know just how well you're doing in the high net worth individual market? And I started trying to build a time series. I noticed that you've talked about overtime your growth rate differently. Some years you've talked about it in terms of most recently how much premium you're getting in that business, sometimes you've talked about it in the new business generated, some of them tend to change in new business generated. ","In terms of going forward, this has been a good growth here, and you're talking about in terms of total premium. Are you planning on breaking this out into its own segment given the clarity of the disclosure?","Michael Sewell","Josh, this is Mike Sewell. We are not planning on breaking that out. That would still be a part of the personal lines, now whether or not we give additional information within some charts and so forth. But it would not qualify as a separate segment on its own under the GAAP rules. Go ahead, Josh.","Joshua Shanker","Well i was wondering, may be if we talk about the relative margin high net worth versus personal lines, the whole, whether it's a more profitable business or about the same level of profitability? And two, whether we can talk about rate in high net worth versus rate in the personal lines business more broadly?","Stephen Spray","Sure, Josh. This is Steve Spray. Let me first start with, I think some numbers I can give you on high net worth. It's -- right now, it's about 28% of our total personal lines book. It's how we would break out high net worth. When we started really focusing on high net worth, being deliberate about it. A little over 5 years ago, our book was at about $100 million, and it's now approaching $400 million, written premium this year is up over 30% and new business was up about 25% to give you a little flavor there. ","I will tell you that we've got an experienced, Will Van Den Heuvel leads personal -- leads all personal lines, came to us with 25 years of high net worth experience, has brought nearly 40 people with him who had many years of high net worth experience as well. ","So overnight, we became a 25-year high net worth experienced company. We were deliberate to get into that business because over time, historically, it has outperformed the broader personal lines market. Plus we like the value we bring as a company through claims and our coverage forms and all of that. So it was a natural progression for us there. I will tell you that on the homeowner front, from the very beginning as we're growing this business, we fully expected quarter-to-quarter variability. We're writing larger risks that can have larger losses may also bring larger premiums with them, but we have experienced some of that inherent variability. We did in the third quarter this year with some larger losses on high net worth homes as well. ","We've dug in to each one of those. We don't see any trend on geography by agency. You name it. So we think it's, again, it's just inherent variability from quarter-to-quarter, it's expected. We expect it to continue on that front going forward as well. ","Now I think, if you look at the industry, we're seeing many of the competitors are reporting some pain in the high net worth homeowner area as well, and that kind of goes to what I was saying earlier is we think the runaway for rate will remain positive there. And it's going to benefit us as well.","Joshua Shanker","And correct me if I'm wrong. But your strategy, not because -- for any of the reasons I think it's just where you started, is concentrated in the New York tri-state area more so than other places. Can we talk about the scaling that naturally, and whether or not the geographic concentration is sort of you're sticking with or should we expect in 5 years that your writing is robustly on the West Coast as you are in New York?","Stephen Spray","Yes. Well, no. It's a great question, Josh. Let me clear that up as well. It's not centered just into the Northeast. We've rolled out our high net worth product across the country. I believe now we're in 41 states -- 42 states, excuse me, active, where we have agents appointed. We're running high net worth across the country with all of our agents. Now candidly, a lot of those -- a lot of that clientele is on the coast, and we are growing in New York in the Northeast, and we are also growing in California. Now our California growth has slowed some and it's been by design. That market is, I would say, in flux from the '17 and '18 wild fire losses. We were undersized there, and we've talk about that in the past and our loss experience was -- we experienced losses. We didn't experience any total fire losses either, and we actually avoided 11 -- excuse me, 11 total losses on risks that we had declined. So we think our underwriting there is really solid as well. So California has slowed a bit but we are still completely committed to California. Our agents there, we think it's a good opportunity, and we'll continue to grow that too. Does that answer the question, Josh?","Joshua Shanker","Yes, that's great. That's great. And then in terms of the E&S market, can you talk about a little bit on where you think the business came from the past to you to the extent that you were taking it from the admitted market, form competitors who were well entrench within your agencies. And as next year happens do you expect that there will be as easier market to pull business away from it. It's never easy, of course, but does seem like there was a lot of business looking for an omen in 2019?","Steven Johnston","Yes. It's a great question. I think that it's kind of coming from a little bit of everywhere, Josh. I think there's certainly is an element to admitted market companies taking kind of retrenching in some of that business that flows back and forth between E&S and admitted market based on the cycle is flowing back into the E&S company. That's a big chunk of what they're writing. I still think our value proposition is -- the word still continues to get out, and we just continue to trip on our agents, and they continue to send more and more business our way. The key there though Josh for us, I think is that -- a key point is that our underwriting appetite and consistency and approach in terms of condition and pricing have stayed -- have remained stable, they've stuck to their knitting and just getting more opportunities because of a market, a little bit in flux.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle with RBC.","Mark Dwelle","I think a lot of the ground has already been covered. But maybe just ask a two more -- two other question, I don't think we've hit on. First one for Mike. Just within the investment portfolio with interest rates having declined. Or anything that you're doing there different or just strategically for positioning? And if you could just remind me there, kind of what portion of that portfolio typically is up for reinvestment in any given year?","Martin Hollenbeck","Sure. Mark, this in Marty Hollenbeck. We really don't do a lot of different in the fixed income portfolio. The exception in the last couple of years is being skewed more favoring taxable versus tax-exempt bonds. There's really 2 -- kind of 2 variables as to what determines our interest income that will be kind of the yields on purchase, which would detain you treasury in 100 basis points year-to-date, that's really seeing some pressure on that front. ","On the other hand, and I've mentioned in the prior calls, bonds that we have lost through maturities or calls, those yields were very high, it was about a lot of corporate bonds 10-year not a call paper during and in the aftermath of the financial crisis. So we've been bleeding fairly good out the back door on yields lost, that seems to be abating now. The worst of that, we feel confident is over. So if we can get the 10-year treasury, for example, up to, let's say, the 2.5% to 3% range. We think we can get some traction on interest income growth. So we -- again, we typically will choose the point on the yield curve that's got those risk-adjusted, tax adjusted yields and kind of go with that. So and short answer is, we're not really doing anything much different.","Mark Dwelle","Okay. That's helpful there. And the same question, and it's probably too soon to have any particular. But obviously, the devastating tornadoes in Dallas, that's traditionally been a big market for you. Is that a lost event that you would expect to have for some fairly substantial exposure to?","Steven Johnston","This is Steve, and it is too early to really comment on that. We've obviously seen that, we're getting our claims people on the ground but don't really have specifics for you at this point in time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","I was wondering if we could get a breakdown of the accident year '18 reserve leases by line of business.","Steven Johnston","Yes. We have that, and Mike is pulling it up.","Michael Sewell","Accident year '18?","Steven Johnston","'18.","Michael Sewell","Yes. So on a year-to-date basis, is what you asked for, Meyer?","Meyer Shields","Yes. Whatever's in it or third quarter?","Michael Sewell","Yes. So for the reserve development for 2018. So if we can drill down on any of these. So for commercial lines, it was 4.7%; personal lines, 1.6%; Cincinnati Re, we actually had -- that was 3.7%; and for the surplus lines, 12.6%. So overall, it was a 3.4%.","Steven Johnston","And those are all percents.","Michael Sewell","Those are all percents. That's exactly right. And it was -- when I said the 1.6% for personal lines that was strengthening there.","Steven Johnston","So just in total in terms of dollars, Meyer, it was $68 million for the whole thing.","Michael Sewell","For the whole thing.","Meyer Shields","Right. Understood. Okay, yes we can top that I think. Two other quick questions. When I look at workers composition lines. And I'm asking that in the light of your comments about recognizing worsening trends a few years ago in casualty. Are you seeing something in workers compensation that's for that the year-over-year higher loss pick or is this just anticipating that favorable trends may not continue?","Steven Johnston","I think it's the latter there. You just -- with the longtail line like that, it pays to be prudent with your picks and just a small movement in medical inflation can turn that number in a big way. So difficult with our prudent approach, we don't want to get too aggressive there.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That's helpful. And the finally, so you mentioned that the E&S book is predominantly casualty. I'm wondering is that by design, do you want less property because I would've thought the submission flow would have increased there earlier than casualty.","Steven Johnston","Yes. It's been by design, Meyer, on the casualty side. And just to give you a little flavor of what the book looks like, it's -- our average premium size for the general liability on E&S is just a little over $6,000. So certainly on the small end, our limits profile there, 80% of our limits are $3 million or less. So kind of gives you a feel for that too. The other thing that I would add there is about -- it's between 40% and 50% of the time when we write an E&S, say casualty line, Cincinnati Insurance company is picking up the other lines of business on the admitted side. So it might be a manufacturing concern as an example that has a really tough product liability exposure where our E&S company can underwrite it term, condition and price it appropriately, and then Cincinnati Insurance will write the property, will write the premises liability, the auto workers compensation. So that happens 40% to 50% of the time. So that's driving us more towards casualty as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And I'm showing that there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Johnston.","Steven Johnston","Thank you, Katherine. Well done, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Late yesterday we issued a news release about our results along with our supplemental financial package including our quarter end investment portfolio.","To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investors website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is a quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call you will first hear from Steve Johnston, Pres. and Chief Executive Officer and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks investors participating on the call may ask questions.","At that time some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including the Cincinnati Insurance Company's Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, Marty Mullen.","First please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to those risks and uncertainties we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.","Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Overall it was another strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associates and independent agents.","We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. Together our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit and the ninth consecutive quarter in our streak of investment income growth.","Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was slightly offset by less favorable weather-related catastrophe of facts than in the third quarter of last year. In total we achieved a third quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 87.8%. Our nine-month 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe effects was also 87.8%, improving that ratio from both full-year 2014 and 2013. Each of our major lines of business have performed well so far this year except for commercial auto and personal auto. We continue to take action through better pricing precision and other initiatives for improved performance over time for our auto business.","In late 2011 we established a long-term target of profitably reaching $5 billion in direct written premiums by the end of 2015. While it looks like we won't quite reach that level this year, we have often emphasized that we seek to grow only where we believe we can do so profitably. I am pleased with our overall underwriting profitability so far this year and won't be disappointed if we don't write $5 billion in premium until 2016.","Over the past five years or so our premium growth has approximately doubled the U.S. P&C industry. We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies including areas we've been emphasizing such as personal lines products and services for our agency's higher net worth clients.","Of the $16 million increase in nine-month new business written premiums for our personal lines segment, nearly 20% of the increase was from high net worth policies. We launched Executive Capstone, our new suite of high net worth insurance products, in New York during September. We expect those products to contribute significantly to profitable premium growth over time. We're on track with progress for an initiative we announced in the second quarter, expansion of reinsurance assumed which we refer to as Cincinnati Re. We have an experienced executive leading the effort and continues to develop a small team of excellent people to help execute our plans. We aim to remain disciplined in this expansion, particularly during tough reinsurance market conditions.","At September 30 we had entered into a handful of diverse treaties. If each treaty remains in effect for its full-term and premiums that are subject to the risks we're reinsuring occur as anticipated, we estimate those treaties should generate approximately $30 million in premiums over the next year or so. Premiums, losses and expenses recognized during the third quarter of 2015 for our reinsurance assumed program were each less than $500,000, an immaterial effect on results for the quarter.","Turning to renewal policies, as we further segment our business we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriter judgment to select and retain policies at prices we believe provide an appropriate return for the risk we assume. Overall pricing for the third quarter was similar to the second quarter. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low-single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of three year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the third quarter.","For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the third quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid-single-digit range and auto averaging near the high end of the low-single-digit range. Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, workers compensation, averaged slightly negative pricing during the quarter. While the average pricing change may have been negative, we continue to price on a policy-by-policy basis. Certain policies that we determined needed a price increase received it. Our personal auto policies average renewal price increases near the low end of the mid-single-digit range while home owner policies were a little higher in that range.","For excess and surplus line segment, third quarter 2015 averaged renewal price percentage increases that were near the low end of the middle-single-digit range. The NS segment continues to perform very well producing another quarter with a combined ratio below 80% and double-digit growth in net written premium. Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had another good quarter. Strong growth in profit in the third quarter brought our nine-month life insurance results above last year's.","Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, is by design long-term in nature. We know that measure may sometimes fall below target in the short term due to securities market volatility. We're staying focused on underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business is in excellent shape contributing more significantly to this year's nine-month value creation than a year ago.","We have confidence in all of our associates, in the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance. I would like to conclude by expressing my sympathy for those impacted by the flooding this fall. We sent a storm team of our own highly trained associates to South Carolina to meet face-to-face with policyholders, quickly beginning the recovery process. We currently estimate our total losses from that industry catastrophe event to reach between $4 million and $8 million -- that is $4 million and $8 million.","I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great, thank you, Steve. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. First I will highlight some important aspects of our third quarter investment results. While the fair value of our equity portfolio fell 4% during the quarter, we ended that period with a net unrealized gain of over $1.5 billion before taxes for our common stock holdings in total. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 4%.","All 50 common stocks in our core portfolio increased their annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of October 2014 through September 2015. The median dividend increase for those stocks was 7.6%. For our equity maturity portfolio -- I'm sorry, for our fixed maturity portfolio interest income rose despite declining average yields in part due to 9-month 2015 net purchases totaling $486 million.","The bond portfolio's third quarter 2015 pretax average yield reported at 4.62% was 14 basis points lower than a year ago. Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.64% while tax exempt bonds purchased average 3.32%. In both cases those yields are higher than we experienced a year ago. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at September 30 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year end. The increase was due -- primarily due to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds, not a change in strategy.","Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first nine months of 2015 rose 19% compared with a year ago to $755 million and helped generate $624 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. We're still carefully managing our expenses. Because we continue to strategically invest in our business, third quarter and nine-month property-casualty underwriting expense ratios rose slightly compared with prior year periods.","Moving to loss reserves, I will first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. We continue to aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. For the first nine months of 2015, favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefited our combined ratio by 4.4 percentage points, slightly better than 3.9 points for the first nine months of last year and in line with the first half of this year.","Although in commercial and personal auto our major lines of businesses have developed favorably so far this year, for our auto lines nearly 75% of the unfavorable reserve development was for accident years 2013 and 2014. Our nine-month of 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 41% for accident year 2014, 21% for accident year 2013, 29% for accident year 2012 and 9% for all older accident years in aggregate.","Our capital strength remains excellent and includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at September 30 totaled just over $1.8 billion, up 1% from year end. Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other management actions such as returning capital to shareholders.","During the third quarter we used $73 million for cash dividends to shareholders. We also used $21 million to repurchase 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $51.74 per share. Similar to our share repurchases in recent years, it was a maintenance type action intended to partially offset issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. I will end my prepared remarks as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.","Property-casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.53; life insurance operations added $0.07; investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.07. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value by $1.37. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.83 during the third quarter, to $38.77 per share. ","And now I will turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Mike. In closing our prepared remarks I would like to share some other positive news we received during the quarter. While we don't seek accolades, it is nice when we're recognized for our efforts. Forbes has again ranked Cincinnati Financial Corporation among America's 50 most trustworthy financial companies in 2015. This marks the fifth consecutive time Forbes has recognized Cincinnati Financial for openness and integrity in accounting, governance and management.","As we head into the last quarter of the year we're committed to maintaining the momentum we have created so far in 2015. We're confident that Cincinnati Financial is on the right track to deliver shareholder value far into the future.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff, Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Matthews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck. Nick, would you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Josh Shanker","I wanted to get a little detail on your entry into the New York market and the appetite for high net worth homeowner's products there given incumbent carriers and whatnot.","J.F. Scherer","Okay, Josh, this is J.F. We started things off in New York similar to the way we do things in other areas is to appoint a few agencies. So we have appointed 12 agencies in the New York City\/Long Island area and two outside of that area but close by, so a total of 14 agencies. And our intent would be to keep the number of appointments at a fairly low amount.","Our appetite, as advertised, is with Coverage A limits up to $50 million. While I wouldn't expect to see a lot of that at this level, but we clearly have an appetite that is reflective of the qualifications that Will Van Den Heuvel has brought to the Company along with the team of people he is continuing to assemble. So, we've got our marketing folks on the ground in that area, we also have which I think is an important consideration, some professionals that Will has recruited from -- that have worked with him in his prior areas to head up our risk control and our appraisal and valuation units in those areas as well.","We have a specialist here in Cincinnati in high net worth, we have trained 100 of our field claims reps in high net worth areas. And so, I think we're prepared to provide the kind of claim service that distinguishes us around the country as well. So, it has been a good start. Obviously we're not trying to explode on the scene; we're trying to do things the way we normally do it, slow and steady. But the appetite from an agency standpoint to do business with us has been great.","Josh Shanker","And what about the source of business? Are you taking that business from incumbents? A lot of the high net worth writers say there are plenty of opportunities to gain business from the general market, people who are not being served by a high net worth specialist. [Indiscernible] New York is a pretty sophisticated buyer's market. What does the marketplace look like there?","J.F. Scherer","Well, we're getting business. The agencies we have appointed have pretty much all been high net worth specialist agencies. So we're writing business in some cases from within their agencies, we have helped them write new accounts, have written some accounts that have previously been written by some of the major players in that area.","But as you mention, an awful lot of that marketplace, the majority of that marketplace is currently being served by carriers that don't specialize in the high net worth area. And we're seeing some business not only in New York City and that area but also around the country from carriers that would not be in those top five carriers that everyone speaks of when it comes to mind.","Josh Shanker","And in terms of thinking about the current accident picks in commercial casualty, obviously a very, very good quarter and a big pick down in terms of the loss ratio. When you [indiscernible] that business what sort of allocation is IBNR and what allocation is case to the extent that when you make a big move in your new loss pick how do you think about that? Where is the data flow coming from that gives you your best estimate?","Steve Johnston","Yes, Josh, this is Steve. And basically we look at it in terms of estimating and making our actuaries do the best estimate of the ultimate accident year for each accident year. And they will use a variety of techniques for commercial casualty. In particular they are going to use a multiple regression technique on paid losses which would take any variability and claims reserve setting and so forth out of the equation, although they do also look at incurred methods, Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and so forth.","But there is an emphasis there on the paid losses and regressing along three different ways, the accident year, the report year and the calendar year. So, I think in answer to the question, the main point is to try the best, the actuaries try their best to pick the appropriate accident year ultimate, then they would subtract off the paids and the case reserves to arrive at the indicated IBNR.","Josh Shanker","Well, if I am getting too specific with the next question I completely understand. How far is the current ultimate pick for 2014 comparing cash with where you are picking 2015 today?","Steve Johnston","We have that, I need to find that exhibit probably in the supplement here.","Josh Shanker","I can come back to Dennis on it. I appreciate the help--","Steve Johnston","Okay, I think the way to look at it would be just to go to the supplement for that particular line and look at the current accident year before catastrophes which there wouldn't be for casualty -- any catastrophes and just multiplying that by the premium that would be the pick for the ultimate.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Mark Dwelle","A few questions. Let me start with just clarifying a couple of numbers. In your opening remarks you said that the high net worth products were 20%, that is of the personal lines new business, not of all new business, right?","Steve Johnston","That is correct.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, so that sort of $6 million-ish for about one month worth of work?","Steve Johnston","Yes, but the point and I think to emphasize a little bit what J.F. said is that we launched the Capstone high net worth in New York in September. But we have also added four endorsements to our Executive Classic which would have been our existing high-end homeowners -- to bring it up to snuff and are selling the high net worth product through existing agencies throughout the country. So that growth there would also be counted in terms of the high net worth new business.","J.F. Scherer","Mark, this is J.F. Yes, I would just emphasize what Steve said there. Since Will has joined the Company we've communicated to all of our agencies across the country that we have a more comfortable appetite for the high net worth. I think before -- and we have mentioned before about 10% of what we have written has been high net worth, though I would probably describe it more mass affluent with Coverage A limits of $2 million or less. And so, when we say high net worth, it is $1 million Coverage A or more. We're still -- and we're writing a lot in the $1 million to $2 million to $3 million range. So, the response we're getting from agencies throughout the country that already had represented us for personal lines has been improved.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, so just to paraphrase what you said, it would be a mistake to assume that the $6 million is all New York area. Some of it is New York certainly, but it is also the rest of the Cincinnati map is in that total via the endorsement of the existing product?","J.F. Scherer","A small percentage would be New York.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, that was my first question and actually you answered my other question related to high net worth on where the limits tend to kick in. The second question I had, again, in your opening remarks, Steve, you mentioned the Cincinnati Re and I think you said $30 million of premium, was that right or --?","Steve Johnston","Yes, that was correct and we might want to just amplify a little bit in terms of how we're booking the premium and I will turn it over to Mike to maybe touch on that.","Mike Sewell","Yes that would be great. Hey, Mark, it is Mike. So currently Cincinnati Re, we have six contracts or treaties and they are generally running 12 to 18 months in duration. And although the premiums are not always known on day one, we estimate that we will receive $32 million over the periods compared to the $15 million that we reported at the end of the second quarter. So we basically have doubled that amount.","The amounts that we have reported in the third quarter financials though are not material quite yet. When we write a contract we may know what the entire premium or we may not know what the entire premium will be until the cedent actually cedes all the risk to us.","So an example might be, say, if I use an example like workers compensation in California. We may not know what the final premium on the specific contract will be until we know how much ultimately the cedent rights and cedes to us. So at any given point in time it can be difficult to give a future written or earned number of projections.","So, but what we have stated so far is we're going to walk, not run, as we build this business and we're only going to take risk with superior returns that enhance our VCR. So congratulations right now to [indiscernible] and the team for I think a great start and we will have more to report to you in future quarters.","Steve Johnston","And Mark, this is Steve. And kind of the intention on the disclosure here is that we're being our usual prudent self when it comes to booking revenue, but we also want to let you know that we have six contracts out there that have the potential of ultimately producing $30 million in written premium. So we could have losses, we're being cautious on both sides I think.","Mark Dwelle","Most of that was exactly what I was going to ask. The two other little bits related to that and again this is really more just a disclosure and where I find it. I assume all of this is currently being reported up through the commercial lines unit and that those amounts are also showing up in the new business written premiums totals.","Mike Sewell","That is another great question, Mark and I probably should have touched on that. We're doing this similar to the way we did our E&S business when it was a start-up. So currently it is in other for our segment business. So you won't necessarily see it in there. When it gets to be larger it will actually be reflected as its own segment within the Q.","So it's in other right now, so you really can't see it because it's so small. So again, we expect it to grow and then at some point it will be material enough to break out as its own segment. So you will soon see commercial lines, personal lines, E&S, Cincinnati Re assumed life investments and then you will end up with other. So that is the way we're expecting it to go.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, good on that. And then the last question that I had -- in the commercial lines unit you had an excellent quarter from an accident year standpoint and even a non-accident year standpoint. But the improvement in the accident year, I guess in the commentary in the press release you talked about the nine-month improvement related to non-cat weather and large claim losses and so forth. Do those comments apply equally to the quarterly improvement?","Steve Johnston","This is Steve. I believe they do. I think the quarter and the year -- it has been pretty consistent across time.","Mark Dwelle","So what I am really more directly asking or indirectly asking is, so, to some extent that is just -- I mean obviously it is good any time, but there is likely to be some mean reversion on that in some other quarters where those things start to swing back against you.","Steve Johnston","Well, I want to make sure I was stating it right. We were trying to peel right down to the core ex-cat accident year. And we just feel we're making incremental steady improvement. It is not huge but it is -- we're just grinding it out and we're going to have some noise based on large losses and so forth. But we feel that with the initiatives in place we're still -- have runway to go on some incremental improvement. But I would make those comments more in terms of the nine-month data in that there is less variability there.","Mark Dwelle","Okay. And then last question, Mike. You had mentioned the buybacks, those were all bus quarter, right? There wasn't anything incremental this quarter this quarter.","Mike Sewell","Actually there was incremental this quarter. So, it is by coincidence maybe. There was 400,000 shares in the second quarter and also an additional 400,000 shares in the third quarter. So year to date we have purchased back 800,000 shares for a total price of just a little over $41 million. So it is kind of averaging in the low $51 per share.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is now open. ","Ian Gutterman","I guess my first question is, the E&S business had a spectacular quarter on an underlying of about an 82% accident year. Normally that is say in the -- I know it bounces around a lot, but I think it is the best you have ever had potentially. Anything unusual there? Was it just a lack of property events or change of mix? I was curious what was going on there.","J.F. Scherer","Ian, this is J.F. No, our mix really hasn't changed much, it is about 15% property, so it is a pretty heavy casualty book of business. I think the newsworthy items in E&S and it was mentioned as well, is that we're seeing a lot of pressure on larger accounts almost all of which are going into the standard market. So competition has kind of accelerated there.","I think we have just done the folks that are -- [indiscernible] and the folks that are running E&S have just done a really good job of making certain that we're being thorough underwriters. I think we have got a good opportunity within our agencies. Our agency's right ballpark $2.5 billion in E&S business in their agencies and our model is unique. I think we provide a good option for our agencies.","And so, I think we can continue to be pretty choosy about what we write. And from the very beginning Don has taken the approach that if we're going to -- being in this business there are going to be times when you have to be tougher and maybe not grow as much, though I don't think we're at that point yet.","But we have been able to continue I think growing it. We have got 61 consecutive months of rate increase, so I think that fortifies the results there. So all in all nothing has changed, nothing that would have caused that loss ratio to go down a lot more. We're just continuing to be we think pretty good fundamental underwriters.","Ian Gutterman","And then before I move on to Mike since I have you here. On commercial auto, switching topics, any additional color you can give on sort of where you are seeing pressure in the book? Meaning is it local vans, is it the construction business, is it stuff you had that is maybe longer haul? I am just kind of curious where -- or maybe it is all the above. But I am just curious if there is any particular areas that stand out.","J.F. Scherer","Yes, I was going to say yes, yes and yes, there is really no smoking gun that I can tell you on commercial auto. There is a variety of things. For us as you probably noted, it is a severity issue not a frequency issue. And we're seeing and the industry is seeing, with the economy improving, a lot of newer employees, therefore a lot of newer drivers that are out there.","Some of the drivers of which and we have seen it in some of our claims, are in our view perhaps a little too young to be driving the size of truck that they have been given responsibility for. Regrettably we find that out after the fact. The American Truckers Association, just I guess by way of a comment, said that at the end of 2014 there was a shortage of 38,000 drivers and at the end of this year there would be a shortage of 48,000 drivers. So we're trying to concentrate better at verifying driving records, driving experience and the assignment of vehicles to particular drivers help out there.","But even in Ohio which is our gold standard state as far as profitability, it has been a little tougher here in Ohio. We noticed on -- when you drive around I am sure in your area and they have signs above the highway that says the number of deaths. Well, the number of deaths on Ohio highways is up double-digits this year.","This is anecdotal to my way of a description, but distracted driving we believe also has had some effect obviously not on the frequency, but had some situations where there were no skid marks and somebody that was texting or talking on the phone piles into someone and so I think the industry is searching for a variety of things that are contributing to this. But, I think it is not one thing, it is a lot of things.","Ian Gutterman","And just related, does it put any pressure on the comp book for certain types of customers? Meaning if I have a business that has a lot of delivery vans or something and obviously if someone gets in an accident on the job I assume there is a comp payout too. So does that create any inflation pressure on comp as well?","J.F. Scherer","It could very well and something we're paying attention to. When our loss control folks go out they are on the lookout for that type of thing. We haven't seen it in our comp book yet, but we're looking for it.","Ian Gutterman","And then just lastly for Mike, was there any change in any of the segments in I guess adjusting the picks for the year? Meaning like do you sort of true up the year in this quarter at all? And so maybe some of the change from trend is related to catch up from either releasing or adding from the first half?","Mike Sewell","Yes, you know the picks really haven't moved a whole lot. We look at it every quarter, the actuaries perform a thorough review during the quarter. So I would say it has been fairly flat from quarter to quarter, but it is a thorough review each quarter when they are looking at the picks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Johnston, I turn the call back over to you.","Steve Johnston","Well, thank you, Nick and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5449":["Cincinnati Financial Corp.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. You may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel of Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Late yesterday we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents please visit our Investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time some responses may be given by others in the room with us, including Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen.","First please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.","Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. And thank you for joining us today to learn more about our third quarter results. We are pleased to report our best third quarter operating results ever, adding to a solid first half 2013 performance.","We believe the improvement is largely attributable to ongoing initiatives that aim to improve insurance profitability and drive premium growth, helping to create shareholder value overtime.","With our third quarter combined ratio of 93.7% and our year-to-date combined ratio of 93.8%, we continue to operate in the sub 95% range that we are aiming for. While catastrophe losses remained lower than in 2012 and helped our results.","Our combined ratio before catastrophe losses was under 89% for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013. The ratio of our catastrophe losses for the first nine months of 2013 at 5.1% is a 4 percentage point under our full year historical average of 6.1% for the past 10 years.","Our premium growth was as we expected for the first three quarters of the year. Each of our property casualty segments grew at double-digit pace, as they benefited from greater pricing precision and higher overall pricing.","We continue to believe that our overall pricing trends are ahead of our loss cost trends and probably more importantly, we believe we are making progress on getting more rate on lower margin policies and retaining higher margin policies. This action results in shifting our mix of business in the favorable direction.","On an average renewal price increase basis, commercial policies that renewed during the third quarter had estimated average price increases in the mid-single digit range. That\u2019s consistent with recent quarters, with the exception of commercial casualty, our most profitable major line of businesses.","Increases on average per commercial casualty trending slightly lower as expected due to the level of price adequacy indicated by these lines 45% nine-month loss and loss expense ratio.","Increases for our smaller commercial property policies averaged in the high single-digit range. Personalized policies that renewed in the third quarter also averaged in a price increase in the mid single-digit range, with homeowners policies continuing in the high single digits. Our excess and surplus line segment also experienced renewal prices increases in the high single-digit range.","As in recent quarters, we believe that our new business written premium growth is reflection of both higher pricing we are able to get in the marketplace and the cumulative effect of growth initiatives.","Our pricing analytics and modeling tools continue to give us confidence in the level of our new business pricing. Again this quarter there was nice balance between growth from newer agencies and growth from those who have represented us for several years.","In our life insurance segment earned premium for term life insurance, the largest product in that segment also grew in a double-digit rate during the third quarter. So, all of our insurance segments, we\u2019re careful to grow premiums only when we believe profitability is adequate.","Another area of growth was third quarter investment income, up slightly and increasing for the first time this year. Finally, our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was another positive aspect for the quarter.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will now discuss that further along with other financial items.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As Steve said, results so far this year have been quite satisfying. Importantly, our 9.8% year-to-date value creation ratio remains on track to reach our annual target range.","In addition, the third quarter again demonstrated the benefit of our equity investing strategy to improve the rising interest rates or when investment income is pressured by the low interest rate environment. The stock portfolio continued to grow with third quarter pre-tax net unrealized gains up $90 million to over $1.5 million.","Dividend income grew 7% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013. Dividend income growth in the upcoming fourth quarter will be a challenge. Our levels of dividend income for the third quarter was approximately $4 million, or 12% below the fourth quarter of 2012.","Last year, we received about $5 million of special or accelerated dividend in the fourth quarter in response to anticipated tax law changes. During the third quarter of 2013, the bond portfolios pretax unrealized gains declined $28 million, following a $282 million decrease during the second quarter.","Yields for our bond portfolio continue to move lower but at a slower pace as its third quarter 2013 pretax yield of 4.91% was 19 basis points lower than a year ago. At the second quarter of this year that decline was 23 basis points.","Taxable bonds representing about 70% of our bond portfolio at a third quarter end 2013 pretax yield of approximately 5.41%. The average yield for new taxable bond purchased during the quarter was approximately 4.9%. For the same period, our tax-exempt bond portfolio yield was approximately 3.94% and purchases during the quarter yielded approximately 3.32%.","Cash flow from operating activities continues to benefit investment income. At $538 million for the first three quarters of 2013, net operating cash flow exceeded the same period a year ago by $105 million despite paying an additional $161 million so far this year in income taxes.","Moving to loss reserves. We continue to emphasize a consistent approach. We seek to remain well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.","For the first nine months of 2013 on a non-catastrophe loss basis, favorable development at 4.2 percentage points was 5.8 points less than a year ago. About one quarter of that decrease is attributable to workers\u2019 compensation as reserves were added during the third quarter for older pre-2009 accident years.","That addition reflects recent paid lost data indicating it is taking longer to pay off order claims. Because some open workers\u2019 compensation claims extend beyond 30 years, a small assumption change for the average life of a claim can add up to be a considerable reserve amount recognized in a given quarter.","About another 40% of the favorable development decrease is attributable to commercial casualty. That line benefited more in 2012 from umbrella reserve releases and that was also experienced more favorable loss trends in 2012 than in 2013 for general liability coverages.","There was a relatively small amount of adverse development during 2013 on general liability loss reserves on a per case or specific claim basis, particularly for accident years 2002 through 2005. So we are exercising prudence by maintaining IBNR reserves at a higher level as of September 30th.","Prudently managing expenses is another area with ongoing effort. Our Property Casualty underwriting expense ratio for the first nine months of 2013 is just below the 2012 level in spite of a 0.5 percentage point increase for commissions to agents. We continue to maintain excellent financial strength and liquidity.","Cash and marketable securities at the parent company reached more than $1.5 billion at September 30, one third higher than the end of last year. Property Casualty premiums to surplus ratio remained at 0.9 to 1 reflecting strong capital in capacity to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.24. Life insurancse operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.47.","The change in unrealized gains at September 30th for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses lowered book value per share by $0.09. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.42 and we declare $0.42 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.68 during the third quarter to $35.51 per share.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Mike. Our performance in recent quarters continues to be a source of encouragement along with various ways the company has been recognized. Most recently, Cincinnati Insurance was awarded the 2013 Pinnacle Award from Applied Systems. We're the first carrier to receive a Pinnacle Award, which recognizes innovation in technology deployment, the power of partnership and the ability to deliver proven intangible business results to our organization and the insurance industry.","As always, we see continuous improvement in all aspects of performance, whether it be providing outstanding service to agents and policyholders or adding value for shareholders, diligence and excellence and work by our independent agents and our associates continued to be reflected in our operating results and I salute them.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you throughout this year. As a reminder with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff Junior, Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Matthews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenback.","Chris, we\u2019re ready for you to open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","I guess first question, the expense ratio showed a good amount of improvement. I know you guys have just talked about the expense ratio being an area of focus. I believe 3Q of last year there were some -- kind of it was pushed a little bit as well, so I am not looking year-over-year. But anything unusual in the expense ratio or we just think about this as continued gradual improvement towards your goal of closer to 30?","Mike Sewell","Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. This is Mike. It is overall -- we\u2019ve got -- we still have our general cost controls in place and how we manage our expenses. This year, we probably did see just a little bit of a downtick in some assigned risk pools that we expensed. But when you really offset that with the growth in premiums that are growing quicker than as were growing expenses and controlling the expenses, you are really seeing the decline in the -- I\u2019ll call the non-commission expense, part of the expense ratio. When you look at the commission side that side is up a little bit but it\u2019s primarily, because we are more profitable and we are adding more expenses to our profit sharing that we pay up to our agencies.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Got it. So, then as you guys work towards the goal of I think $5 billion or so of premiums, is that kind of the operating leverage the driver of bringing that expense ratio gradually down towards closer to 30?","Mike Sewell","That plays a significant role in that. We still need to keep investing in various areas in our business, whether it's IT, predictive modeling, et cetera et cetera. We will continue those efforts but we will do them at a managed pace with the growth on the premium side.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Got it. And lastly on investment income, so I think you broke out that some of the equities dividend gains won't recur next quarter. The portfolio yield looks like it has held up the last few quarters. Can you remind us -- should we expect pressure on the fixed income yield and maybe what is the new money versus existing portfolio yield? Thank you.","Marty Hollenbeck","Sure. This is Marty Hollenbeck. We think we\u2019ve seen probably the worst of the pressure on the fixed income portfolio. As was mentioned, book yield for purchases in the quarter in total was $454 million versus $494 million and we broke that out taxable versus tax-exempt. We will have a very tough comp in the fourth quarter, again as was mentioned on the special one-time dividends were paid in the fourth quarter last year pulled from the first quarter this year. We will look at much better comps once we get into 2014%.","So we are starting to see a little bit improvement obviously with the rising interest rates in the kind of May, June timeframe and the rate at which we are losing to calls has slowed somewhat so.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. And are you guys at your threshold for the amount of equities the composition of the entire investment portfolio? Thank you.","Marty Hollenbeck","Sure. We\u2019re just under 30%, the way we look at that is less as a percent to the total portfolio as we look at it from the ground up by entity subsidiary and we taken a consideration regulatory and rating agency concerns, as well as tax considerations. Right now we could probably support up to or on the mid 30% level, so we had a little bit of room left.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent D'Agostino from KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","Great. And thanks, and good morning, everybody.","Steve Johnston","Good morning.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","One of the things that we've been hearing about is that there was some localized Midwest hailstorms that had caused some loss ratio pressure for some of your peers and that secondly that these weren't really large enough to be considered cat events and so I'm just curious if we are seeing any of that in your personal auto loss results?","Marty Mullen","Hi, Vincent. This is Marty Mullen. Not particular really do the third quarter at all. We have eight cats in the quarter, six that we\u2019re tracking, only two of any significance and that was a hailstorm in Kansas in mid-July and then early September hailstorm Minneapolis, but both of those are, I would say fairly moderate and not impacting personal auto any more than homeowners.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","Okay. Perfect. And on your workers comp IBNR comment. I'm just curious if maybe what you are seeing if there's any lingering impacts from the recession here as far as a late claim reporting kind of cycle?","Steve Johnston","This is Steve. Good question. I don\u2019t think it so much that, I think back in 2009, we recognize we had a problem and we increase the worker comp reserves pretty substantially and that proved to be a wake up call for all this. We realize we need to improve really every aspect of our workers compensation area. And every area in the company, from underwriting, claims, pricing, loss control, everybody, lost into a series of initiatives that have resulted in considerable improvement. Improvement that we are recognizing in our accident year results and I think we were ahead of the industry in that action.","So as I saw, what everybody seen here with some adverse development. I went back to our 2012 annual statement schedule P and from 2000 -- December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2012, we actually recognized about $86 million unfavorable loss in DCC reserve development on accident years 2009 and prior.","And approximately 99% of these claims are -- that were originally reported for accident years 2009 and prior are now closed. So, the roughly 9 million adverse development. We see for workers comp this quarter is largely attributable to accident years 2009 and prior.","So, what we are see is appropriate caution in reserving of the 1% of claims, the tougher claims that are still open. I guess in the perfect world with the benefit of hindsight we will release reserves on those years in more straight-line passion but reserves are uncertain and we make our best estimate each quarter.","So even with the small step back that we had in workers comp and reserve in this quarter, we\u2019re confident in our consistent process. It\u2019s result in 23 years of consecutive favorable reserve development. So, I think, more than something that has to do with the recession, I think it just being prudently cautious with some of the really old claims and how we handle them this quarter.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","Okay. That color is really helpful. One of the things that we heard more recently from some participants at our conference is some things about the litigation environment. And one of those was that some more economically hard-hit jurisdictions have been yielding higher awards. I'm just curious if you've seen any of that in your own book or if that was maybe something we shouldn't extrapolate it?","Marty Hollenbeck","Hi Vincent. This is Marty again. That\u2019s actually an area that we track very closely concerning the areas that we are in and some of the counties that. Certainly our target is being the more volatile counties as it relates to jury verdicts and we are very prudent about watching our files as the Progressive litigation environment knows particular counties. So I don\u2019t think we have seen any change in that. We continue to monitor pretty closely. But I wouldn\u2019t say overall there has been any change in our book in those counties.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","Okay. Perfect. And J.F., one of the things that we've heard is that some competitors are making investments in small commercial agent portals with what seems to be like a concurrent increase in the appetite for small BOP accounts. And I'm just curious if you are saying any more competition for small commercial accounts in light of the relative strength in pricing versus the larger and midsized accounts?","J.F. Scherer","Vincent, I know, now I can say that we\u2019ve seen any change in that. Explain to me again when you are talking about investments, you are talking about -- in their companies for Asian portals.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","Sure. So most of it has been, I mean, Hartford has probably been the biggest proponent of that but there's been a number of other competitors that have made comments about agent facing technology and also looking to get I think more aggressive on BOP accounts just as a way to take advantage of the pricing strength and then also to get, I guess, more mind share as far as just having more looks throughout any given period and that helping them to get to increased traction on even the larger accounts just from that greater visibility?","J.F. Scherer","I expect we\u2019ve seen that going on for last three or four years. To say that it\u2019s heated up or any different but they were getting feedback from our agents or whether it\u2019s impacting our ability to compete in that area. I have seen a lot of change or difference right now but it\u2019s clearly a pretty hot area in the market place.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. And then if I could sneak one more in. Mike, you have commented before quite recently on the FASB's insurance contract's draft. And the comments are due today and just since you are a little bit closer to it than many of us. I'm curious if you have any insight into how -- or how likely these proposals are to get implemented?","Mike Sewell","It\u2019s a great question. Thank you for it. I m not going to guess on what\u2019s the ultimate outcome. I m not -- I\u2019ll say -- I m playing that. That arena we -- we stay on top of exposure drafts that do come out. We will have a comment letter that is, I believe, in process of being posted. I think there is about 31 letters that are currently out there. But we do support the FASB and their efforts and what they are trying to do.","And so the current exposure draft, however, we believe is really not an improvement under the current U.S GAAP. We think what is out there right now is really time tested. It\u2019s highly effective. It\u2019s preferred by the investors. And we think investors really do understand the current accounting process. What is being proposed would really fundamentally change the way that we -- we record things.","And I think it will be very difficult for investors to understand. It\u2019s -- as you know, recording premiums, recording losses, actuarial and so forth. It\u2019s a very complex industry that we work in. And I think the exposure draft really adds complexity on top of our complexity. We\u2019ll have to look at all of our systems, potentially re-mapping, maybe getting new systems like where the initial data comes in, we\u2019ll change.","And what we really don\u2019t change is our managers. We\u2019ll be managing with different numbers. And so this potentially will fundamentally change the way that we operate our business versus just doing a change in accounting in the way that we that report. So we encourage you to read the comments that will be out there.","I think they are due by the end of the day today. I got to mention there is 31 that\u2019s out there. We will have one. There\u2019s also one that we participate in with the U.S. property casualty coalitions. So we\u2019ll have to see but I\u2019m not going to make any predictions. But at the end of the day, we do support the FASB and their efforts.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","It looks like your guy's comment letter just hit. So I look forward to reading it and thanks for all the answers, guys. Talk to you soon.","Mike Sewell","Thank you for your letter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple questions. The first is you guys have made a pretty big push to hire the loss control specialists over the past few years. Just wondering how far along you are in that process and what kind of benefit you are getting? I would assume it's -- consider ongoing but if you can give a little detail on that?","J.F. Scherer","Yes. This is J.F. We\u2019ve added 60% field -- to the field since 2009 in the loss control area. We\u2019ll be closing in on total of 100 field reps in that area. To that, we\u2019ve also added some specialist in property, casually, auto, professional liability, construction. So as far as the results, I\u2019d say part of the reason why are growth has been -- well we expected it but healthy is that the ability of the lost control reps to gain confidence for us to go into slightly larger more complex accounts.","We\u2019re in the midst now of a very extensive inspection protocol implementation and the inspection protocol little literally over this next several. Hundreds of thousands of inspection on the push line side and quite a few on the commercial line side that the loss control reps will continue to lead the way on. One of the areas that we\u2019ve seen the most lift from lost controls has been in workers\u2019 comp.","We\u2019ve seen those results over the last couple of years. We\u2019re now inspecting and interviewing every single account for us that has a $50,000 premium or more in workers\u2019 comp. We send loss control out and go through probably half a day questionnaire with the policy holder then follow up with loss litigation activities there.","So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen all the lift we\u2019re going to get. In fact, I know we haven\u2019t seen the lift. We\u2019re going to get on the property side from the loss control stand point. We\u2019re really just now getting into the meat of what they\u2019re doing there.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Using it kind of consistently even for their renewed accounts to consistently kind of follow up in addition to obviously what you described that you got a new business in some of the more larger complex accounts as well?","J.F. Scherer","Yes, for example, on the property side, we\u2019ve profiled every single account that we have in the company and based on a protocol, it\u2019s been established by our loss control department, we have determined how many of those locations need to be inspected with and with what frequency. So not only will we be out on new business or we might be out inspecting properties more in depth than we would have in the past but we are saving them up on a rotation wherein some cases depending on the complexity of the account, it might be four times a year, or it might be once every three years.","But we are in the past, that type of thing was left to the judgment of the underwriter based on just the circumstances when the account came up for renewal. We have transferred that accountability to our loss control division based on their knowledge of complexity of accounts TIVs, total insured values, things of that nature. And these things will automatically happen now rather than it being random.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Right. Okay. That\u2019s good explanation. Just a question too on the personal lines side, you guys talked about some of the new initiatives to improve margins and how that was impacting some of your new business. Did you see any impact at all in your renewal book? It didn't really look like it because premiums were up I think 10% or 12%. Just curious, how your renewal customers are responding to some of these actions?","J.F. Scherer","Well we are seeing a little bit of -- in other words, we\u2019re inspecting as I mentioned, we will inspect 60,000 or 70,000 structures this year, a 100,000 next, most of which are going to be renewals. And we are seeing a decent percentage of those where we are non-renewing or canceling those policies based on what we\u2019ve discovered.","We are also seeing that those policies may in fact not have been rated correctly. In other words, there are surcharges for things such as wood stoves, protection classes where a house might be located. There might have been an error when the policy was first written. So we are actually charging more in many cases for the policy just to get the right rate.","So -- but having said that our retention remains good. It\u2019s still in the low 90s for personal lines which is a pretty strong retention rate. We\u2019ll continue all of this inspection protocol. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about the rate increases that we\u2019ve initiated over the last several years.","Once again, since 2009, we\u2019ve increased rates countrywide cumulatively just under 50% homeowners. So on the one side as far as pricing is concerned that\u2019s been a real positive but I am real confident that getting now, seeing these properties, reaffirming the condition of the properties, taking a look at the roofs, one of the big motivations for us is to verify the age of the roofs. In those cases where the roofs are older than 15 years, asphalt shingled roofs older than 15 years.","We are going to an ACV endorsement in those cases. We are going towards higher deductibles, minimum $1,000 on new business for accounts less then $500,000 coverage A and $2,500 minimum deductible for accounts greater than that.","So that\u2019s had some effect. That\u2019s depressed our new business but the new business is still at a decent level where I am not alarmed at all. I don\u2019t think we are alarmed at all that the new business is down given the fact that we are getting a much better book of business right from the very beginning.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That makes sense. And then my last question was just about -- I don't know if you had an early read on what your new agency appointments might be for 2014? Compared to this year, I think you are on track for 80, which looks like you might even beat that but I don't know if you had any early expectations on that?","J.F. Scherer","Yes. We\u2019ll probably be around a 100 next year. And I suspect we will finish this year in the low 90s on it. And I would, in addition to the number of agencies, we have a point where we\u2019re also monitoring the critical mass of the agency. In other words, what\u2019s the total property and casualty premium that each agency currently controls. And we are about a $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion at this point of the year in terms of that amount of premium we have appointed this year. And next year I would suspect the target would be $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Yes. Thank you. Can we talk about -- where you stand on E&S right now? If you look at the standalone expense ratio there, is it still being run as a start up or is it at full throttle?","Mike Sewell","Yes. Josh, thanks. This is Mike. Some of those expenses are still some of the ramp up as we are growing that business and expanding and adding folks to that group. What you are also going to see, you probably noticed in there also that commissions are up a little bit also and that\u2019s primarily due to the profit sharing. So the numbers are relatively small when you are putting expenses on the premiums compared to the commercial lines or the personal lines but that still is a -- that is still a growth mode there.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","What size volume needs to be there to reach critical mass?","Steve Johnston","Josh, this is Steve. I think -- I think we\u2019re approaching that. I think as these expenses that we have had as a start-up entity have been running on. I think it will be close to finishing those and we should be in a position where we\u2019re in a -- what you would consider an ongoing operation.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Okay. In that market, when I talk to some competitors who are dedicated to that market, they say the pricing isn't as strong as in -- is in the admitted marketplace. Do you find it's true? Do you find that's inhibiting your desire to grow as quickly in there as you might otherwise be able to?","J.F. Scherer","Josh, this is J.F. I guess, I\u2019d answer that in two ways. We are continuing to see upper single digit renewal increases in the -- in the E&S company, very consistent and so we haven\u2019t seen any light up in that.","Now having said that and keeping in mind that our appetite is relatively conservative, we write a fair number of accounts that would probably fall into the category that could fall into the standard market and then back into the E&S market from time to time, and what we have seen is that on larger accounts that we have in the E&S market, they are finding their way back into the standard market. I don\u2019t know exactly.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","With you?","J.F. Scherer","No. We have lost those accounts.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","J.F. Scherer","We would have preferred to keep them in the E&S market, the terms and pricing that we had already and then we lost then. And also if any standard market company will quote on that account, the agent can\u2019t place it with us. In other words, they have to get three declinations from the standard market or to be eligible to be put in the E&S market.","So that we are seeing that occur in terms of some larger accounts. Now put in the context and we have mentioned this before, our agency write close to -- now based on all the appointments we have last few years close to $3 billion in excess and surplus lines premiums.","We are not in markets for all of it, some of it is a very challenging business. However, we are in market for a good bit of it. So I don\u2019t think I would -- we don\u2019t view our opportunity grow to be simply be consistent with the overall growth rate that you might see in the E&S industry.","We are continuing to take advantage of the fact that the model we have. How we tie the premiums into our agencies overall, profitability with our company, the -- our claims approach, all of the things we think make attractive to do business with us continues to give us, I think and will continue to give us a lot of opportunity to write our agencies E&S accounts. Notwithstanding what\u2019s going on in the larger accounts.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Well a thorough answer and thank you. Congratulations on a great quarter.","J.F. Scherer","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from BAM. Your line is open.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","HI. Good morning. And I guess, Steve, my first question is, I was hoping you could give a little more color on your pricing comments on commercial lines. I guess I was a little surprised that casualty is starting to slip, just other carriers just talk more about casualty and comp hanging in there and property showing the most pressure due to the lack of losses. So I'm just curious why you are seeing something a little different?","Steve Johnston","Yeah. Good question. I think the overwriting thing has been pretty consistent overall. As we look at by line though I would have to say that the property is where we are continuing to get more particularly on the small property and just a bit less on the casually, I think, just we want to point that out in terms of just being totally open and a fair disclosure to give you more color by line. But overall, I think the price has been pretty down consistent.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay. Great. Thanks. And let's see, my next one was on the reserves. I guess, on the comp -- can you explain sort of why this is limited to \u201809 and prior, I guess, is what I'm trying to get at. Is there a risk that this bleeds into \u201809 to \u201812 and is it as simple as the loss control initiatives will prevent that or could there be potential for this to leak?","Steve Johnston","Yeah. That\u2019s another good question. I don\u2019t think so, I mean, there is always potential for anything, there is something uncertain as reserves, but we feel very confident and we tend to historically by accident year be more prudent, I would say, with the newer accident years and more recent accident years because there is more uncertainty given the limited age of development we have there.","I do think and what we saw this time as when you get into some of the older accident years, it\u2019s a well known reserving axiom that your simpler claims, settled more quickly and the tougher ones require more work on the older claims. And so I think this is limited to those older claims at this point.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay. And do the loss control specialists just work with recent years vintage or they have worked on older claims as well, pre-existing claims?","Steve Johnston","I think it\u2019s going to be more with the newer claims, in terms of\u2026","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay. Right.","Steve Johnston","\u2026 really preventing newer claims, yes.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay. Okay. And then there was also a little bit of adverse in specialty package, anything unusual there?","Steve Johnston","I don\u2019t think so, that\u2019s a relatively small line and as we role out our CinciPak product, its going to become smaller yet, so I don\u2019t think that there was anything there of note.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Got it. And then my last one is on auto and I guess before I ask the question to make sure I'm thinking about it right? Can you remind me how much of your auto book or personal lines book is sort of written through commercial agencies as sort of in combination to the business owner versus true personal lines in all agencies.","Steve Johnston","Most of our agents are appointed for both personal and commercial, we really have had good success on rounding all the accounts where we had a business owner. We are also able to write the personal lines account and life insurances so forth. But I think if you look in totality, you will find most of the personal lines is for non-business owners that would like business insurance for this is just that size.","J.F. Scherer","Yes. Ian, there is only be a handful of agencies in the country that are personal lines only agents for us.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay. That\u2019s right thoughts. But this question may not be as appropriate but maybe a still as. I was just wondering if you are seeing increased competition in auto, I mean travelers I am sure you have seen as been very public about cutting rates, cutting commissions? Progressive has talked a lot about pressure from these rater vehicles. Are you seeing any of that or because of your profile not being so much personal lines only agents, are you not seeing that as much?","Ken Stecher","Well, it\u2019s hard to imagine, it would get tougher particularly with the advertising that the Geicos and the Progressives do. I can\u2019t say that we have seen anything unique to travelers so far, the only thing we will write on occasion on monoline private passenger auto policy, but typically what we write our packages.","So and in fact on homeowners, we\u2019ve just almost gotten to the point where we\u2019re not writing any monoline homeowners at all, we require the full package. And so the buying decision of the public would tend to be more of what\u2019s the total package cost. There is a lot more agent involvement in it. And we\u2019re trying to focus more on the more affluent buyer.","Everyone has got a definition of that, but what we don\u2019t want to do and of course everyone is talking about the comparative raters and what happens. When that auction begins, we\u2019re in a lot of these comparative raters. We don\u2019t like it but we are truly focusing more and trying to direct our marketing and our discussions towards the more value conscious buyer. The person who appreciates the agent appreciates the kind of claim service that we give and are willing to pay up for it.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Got it. And to the extent, J.F. said, Travelers is successful in being able to get some market share out of kind of commissions meaning the price gain is enough to offset that and that sticks and maybe say I'm going to make it up. Say Liberty sees that and says well Progressive and Travelers are cheaper, we'll cut commissions too and then some other people follow.","If commissions are going down in the personal line space over time, would that be something you suspect you would follow? Or just given your business model, do you think you kind of stay where you are and market that as a differentiator that we take better care of our agents and people are just going to try to squeeze your commission?","J.F. Scherer","Well, we study and we recently studied the commission levels that our competitors pay between the base commission that we pay our agents, add to that the profit sharing component, we are at the top of the heap. And we intend on staying there.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Got it.","J.F. Scherer","I don\u2019t have -- as a company, we don\u2019t have much interest in trying to win the commodity gain in personal lines. We are a more valued approach than that and so that will be the focus of our marketing.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay. That's what I thought. Just checking. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Paul Newsome. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Just two questions and actually really just two. The first one, when we think about your book and you can even comment on the industry as a whole and the re-underwriting process that is coming through, as I understand it, you've described it as being mostly focused on the lower tiers and less in the higher tiers. Does that -- are we at the point where the math is going to mean that the overall average rate of price increases will decelerate because you've gotten to those lower quality tiers already?","Steve Johnston","That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s necessarily the case. This is Steve. It is clearly, we are looking at each policy, its unique characteristics. We are taking the appropriate rate increase based on those characteristics, but I think it will be too simple to say that that\u2019s going to result in more or less increase overall. It could go, I think in either direction when you focused on such granular pricings.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","My second question is have you looked at the sensitivity between just your overall profitability and the commission rate given the contingent commission has some -- I assume there is some relationship between basically your combined ratio overall and your contingent commission?","But have you ever looked at sort of big picture sensitivity on what that means? I assume that we should be sort of thinking along those lines but I've never really been able to figure out exactly what it means, even though there is a maximum band.","Steve Johnston","Yeah. Paul, I guess we\u2019ve never tested it, if I understand your question, right. Could we pay -- are you saying could we pay less in profit - ","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Well, no, I just think your combined ratio -- as your combined ratio goes down, your contingent commission is going to go up. And I'm wondering what sort of sensitivity there is? If you've ever looked at how much that contingent commission could go up if you reached really an extraordinary level of underwriting profitability?","No, I just think it your combined ratio as your combined ratio goes down your contingent commissions going to up, and I am wondering what sort of sensitivity there is, if you ever look at just how much that contingent commission could go up if you reach really and extraordinary level of underwriting profitability.","Steve Johnston","Yeah, this is Steve. We have actually done simulations on that in the past. I think that we\u2019re in partnership with our agents obviously. We really rely on them as front line underwriters and so we see those two going hand in hand.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Is there any rule of thumb that we could as outsiders use?","Steve Johnston","I don\u2019t think so. I think if you look at the past history, particularly in the last couple of years, I don\u2019t know that I would necessary have a rule of thumb for you.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Okay. Thank you.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve Johnston for closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Well, thank you very much. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your questions, we appreciate your interest and we look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Stephanie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cincinnati Financial Fourth Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to avoid any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Dennis McDaniel, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer for Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio.","To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor website www.cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you\u2019ll hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.","At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Committee Chairman Jack Schiff Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements may involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.","Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the fourth stop on our 20 plus state tour of sales meeting with our independent agents. Our senior leadership team gets out and visits agents in the first half of each year. Meeting with our agents is always energizing. I\u2019m also looking forward to talking with all of you about our very strong fourth quarter earnings and operating performance.","Our fourth quarter results reflect a steady -- steadily growing benefit of initiatives designed to improve insurance profitability, drive premium growth overtime and create shareholder value.","The contribution by our agents of premiums producing an underwriting profit was one of the keys to a successful year and we sincerely thank them for trusting us to protect and serve their clients.","Our fourth quarter Property Casualty Insurance combined ratio at 81.9% was the best we\u2019ve had in years. We\u2019re also encouraged by the consistency of improvement across the company. For instance, all three Property Casualty segments had a combined ratio lower than the fourth quarter of last year.","For the full year 2012, our 96.1% combined ratio improved by over 10 percentage points from a year ago on both a current accident year and calendar year basis. Lower catastrophe losses drove only about one quarter of the improvement.","Turning to premium growth, each of our Property Casualty segments continue to experience steady growth in renewal premiums. In total, net written premiums for the fourth quarter rose by 10%, both profitability and premium growth once again benefited from greater pricing precision and higher overall pricing.","Commercial policies that renewed during the fourth quarter continue to average a mid single-digit price increase, although down slightly from the third quarter. Increases on our smaller commercial property policies reached the double-digit range. For the full year, pricing averaged an increase in the mid single-digit range for our Commercial Lines segment.","Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment experienced higher renewal prices for the 28th consecutive month. The fourth quarter average price increase remained in the high single-digit range and annual written premiums exceeded the $100 million mark.","Policies in our Personal Lines segment renewed in the fourth quarter with an average price increase in the mid single-digit range, price increases specific to homeowners\u2019 policy approached double digits.","Higher renewal pricing contributed to a slight decrease in our Commercial Lines policy retention as it moved to the mid 80% range. Personal Lines policy retention has remained fairly steady and continues to be in the low to mid 90% range.","New business written premiums for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 continued to grow at a nice pace for both our Commercial and Personal Lines segments. The increase reflected higher pricing and the cumulative effect of growth initiatives, including new agency appointments. Just over half of the $64 million full year increase in new business written premiums came from agencies appointed since the beginning of 2011.","Our pricing analytics and modeling tools once again indicated that our new business pricing is adequate, providing confidence to compete for good accounts and to avoid under priced ones.","As we end -- emphasized on this call last year, we are not interested in growing premiums without doing so profitably and we are satisfied with our progress so far. We are well-positioned to continue growing earnings, dividends and book value, adding value for shareholders overtime.","In 2012, we appointed 140 new agencies in areas we consider underserved, about 10 more than we planned at the beginning of the year. During 2013 we plan to appoint around 65 agencies, that\u2019s lower than in recent years and is based on our latest assessment of potential for our current agencies given our premium volume targets by territory, where we believe we can reach our goals in a given community with the currently appointed agencies we refrain from new appointments.","It\u2019s also important to remember that it takes several years for a new agency to develop the double-digit market share we tend to earn with agencies appointed for 10 years or longer. Because of the pace of appointments in recent years, plus our commitment to serving all of our agencies and their clients, we expect to achieve $5 billion of consolidated annual direct written premiums by the end of 2015.","Appointing new agencies is just one of several strategic initiatives for 2013 that I\u2019ll highlight today. We are working to enhance our underwriting expertise and knowledge by expanding our use of data and analytics for more precise pricing.","We are improving results in our property-oriented lines of business with several initiatives. First, we\u2019re increasing the use of property inspections, second, using more robust deductible features in our policies and third, increasing specialization among associates in our operating areas that handle various property insurance functions.","A multi-department task force has been leading our property initiatives and we are confident in its ability to drive improvement because that approach is similar to what led to improvement for our workers\u2019 compensation business. We\u2019re also using that approach to improve results for our Commercial Auto business.","Finally, in 2013, we\u2019re continuing to develop new programs that target specific markets, featuring enhanced products and service to promising classes of business.","Our Life Insurance business will also work to increase opportunities to cross-sell products and services as we seek another year of steady profits and growth from that segment. For the full year 2012, our Life Insurance business grew earned premiums by 8% and generated a 6% increase in operating profits.","January 1st marked the renewal of our reinsurance program. We were able to add coverage and efficiency while keeping overall cost basically flat. We also further diversified credit risk associated with reinsurance while preserving the strong relationships we have with our quality reinsurers.","Our per risk treaties remain substantially the same as in 2012. We increased our retention by $1 million to $7 million per loss and used the cost savings to purchase $10 million of additional property per risk coverage.","Our property catastrophe treaty has coverage and pricing similar to 2012, and we added $100 million layer with our share of covered losses in that layer at 28% through collateralized reinsurance in the form of a catastrophe bond.","The coverage applies to severe impacted storm losses in selected areas particularly in the Midwest, as well as supplemental coverage in the event of an earthquake occurring along the New Madrid fault line. The storm aggregate coverage applies to the 75 counties with our highest amount of total insured property values.","Loss recovery under the treaty terms occurs when storm losses for all events in aggregate exceed $125 million after a $5 million deductible per event. The earthquake coverage applies once insured losses for an earthquake event exceed $600 million. Reinsurance is an important part of our enterprise risk management effort, helping to protect capital and remove some of the earnings volatility caused by natural catastrophes.","We finished the year with a great quarter, producing a healthy increase in investment income. It\u2019s important to recognize that our primary financial performance measure, the value creation ratio reached our target range for the year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to discuss further along with other financial items.","Mike Sewell","Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter value creation ratio was 2.8% and we finished the year at 12.6%. That included a 5.2% contribution from our dividend to shareholders and 7.4% from the change in book value per share.","The fourth quarter again demonstrated the benefits of our equity investing strategy during periods when investment income is pressured by the low interest rate environment. We received special or accelerated dividends of approximately $5 million during the fourth quarter, contributing to a $7 million or 26% increase in total dividend income.","While that dividend income pace is unlikely to continue in 2013, individual common stocks in our portfolio have the propensity for dividend growth overtime, plus we invest new money in that portfolio and that helps offset declining bond portfolio yields.","For full year 2012, we added new money to both our equity and fixed maturity portfolios as indicated by the annual increase in our cost basis rising 10% and 2%, respectively. Yields of our bond portfolio continue to move lower as its fourth quarter 2012 pre-tax yield of 5.01% fell 16 basis points from a year ago. Our bond portfolio\u2019s effective duration measured 4.2 years at year-end 2012 down from 4.4 one year ago and 4.3 one quarter ago.","Strong cash flow continues to enhance investment income. Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for full year 2012 at $638 million, exceeded the full year 2011 by $391 million and exceeded 2010 by $107 million.","Our stock and bond portfolios each experienced changes in fair value of less than 1% during the fourth quarter. The stock portfolio\u2019s unrealized gains remain at over $1 billion before taxes and its fair value represents just over one quarter of invested assets.","Moving to liabilities and reserve development, we continue to take a steady consistent approach to loss reserving. We aim to remain well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss experience reserves.","For full year 2012 our Property Casualty combined ratio benefited from 10.7 percentage points of net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses, up somewhat from 9.3 points in 2011 and 9.8 points in 2010.","Every major line of business contributed to the 2012 favorable development that totaled $396 million including catastrophe losses. 45% of the development occurred in our largest line of business -- commercial casualty, similar to 46% in 2011. That favorable development occurred for several accident years including 39% for accident year 2011, 17% for accident year 2010, 23% for accident year 2009 and 21% for all older accident years.","We continued to carefully manage expenses and our property and casualty underwriting expense ratio fell slightly despite a 0.8% point increase in the component for profit sharing commissions to agents. At year-end, our financial strength and liquidity remains stellar.","We had nearly $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level, up 10% from a year ago. Our premiums to surplus ratio of 0.9 to 1, indicates our capacity to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments as well as provide for other capital needs.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.62.","Life insurance operations added 5%. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.40. The change in unrealized gains at December 31st for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.04.","The change in unrealized gains at December 31st for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses lowered book value by $0.09 and we paid $0.4075 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.53 during the fourth quarter to $33.48 per share.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Mike. While completing another quarter with improved underwriting performance adds to our optimism about the company\u2019s future, we realized that your efforts must continue to build on that progress. I want to thank every associate of the Cincinnati Insurance Company for their good work, and encourage them to keep getting a little better everyday at what they do to serve our agents and policyholders.","The operating environment for property and casualty insurers still has plenty of challenges. We will continually seek to improve our performance while still fulfilling our insurance promise to policyholders and providing outstanding service to agents.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to investor questions, and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you throughout this year. With Mike and me today are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck.","Stephanie, we\u2019re ready for you to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Hi, gentlemen.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","So very impressive margin improvement, one segment that really stood out was the commercial property. If I\u2019m calculating this correctly, I\u2019m getting an accident year excluding cat combined ratio of 27%. If that\u2019s correct, is there a non-recurring element benefiting that ratio?","Steve Johnston","Mike, let\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got some numbers here. I want to check real quick before we answer that. You\u2019re looking at commercial property? That loss ratio is at the current accident year loss ratio of 28.1. It improved from 31.1 and that\u2019s before catastrophe losses.","28.1 before catastrophe losses versus 31.1 fourth quarter a year ago. And then for the full year, which I think really for all of our lines is one to look at as well -- it\u2019s 46.1 and 69.7 for the full year 2012 compared to 2011 and that\u2019s current accident year before catastrophe losses.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","So, I guess the moral of the story is I need to kind of take for you guys last 12 months average more so than looking at the absolute level this quarter versus -- I guess it\u2019s just that ratio, that\u2019s like a very, very good ratio.","Steve Johnston","Right. That\u2019s a good point, Mike and we look at all the numbers obviously. But we do tend to focus on these full year numbers.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. And I guess then kind of asking the question in another way then. In terms of the overall margin improvements on a consolidated basis, is there a way to kind of break down the drivers of the margin improvement. For example, maybe pricing versus technology driven underwriting initiatives, et cetera?","Steve Johnston","Yeah. It\u2019s a great question and again something we think about it lot. And we do feel that we are getting improvement across the board from every area of the company pricing and maybe I will let J.F. comment on this a bit. But I\u2019d say in general terms with the missing digit rate increases that we have been getting. We have been seeing about half come from rate and about half from other areas.","J.F. Scherer","And then, what I\u2019d add on the property side, we are actually up close to 10% net rate increases on commercial property increases, so that is driving the improvement in property. We are also doing a lot more loss control inspections as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. Modeling has helped us across the board, but also in the property lines as well. So, as Steve said, it\u2019s in across the board contribution.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And lastly, I guess can you comment on the competitive environment as it pertains to rate increases that seems like everyone in the industry including you guys have been taking?","J.F. Scherer","Well, no question that everyone is raising rates, some more than others. Agencies right now, what we are finding and particularly this week when we are out travelling is that there are some companies that are taking some fairly sizeable increases and in some cases we are too.","What we are finding at least in terms of market conditions that it\u2019s driving quite a bit of business into the market for competition. One of our agencies report that because they perceived at some of the increases are little more than policyholders can tolerate, that there is a lot of preempting, preempted shopping of accounts that are perhaps type of thing that a carrier would want to keep, it\u2019s driving it in the marketplace.","So there is a lot going on out there, new business. We are not seeing the rouge if you will the rouge carriers and I guess everybody gets credit for being a rouge carrier sometime. But we are not seeing anyone carrier driving a new business overly aggressively.","So, mid-single digits to upper single-digits -- from our standpoint is what we are seeing on improvements on renewals and I\u2019d say just by way of commentary obviously property, cat prone property, awful lot of aggressive action being taken there.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent D\u2019Agostino with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Vincent.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino - Stifel Nicolaus","I guess, first, I\u2019d just to say I\u2019m glad that you guys are finally getting up a few quarters worth. It\u2019s not so much of an uphill battle with the weather. It\u2019s just good to see. My first question would be is if I remember correctly in 4Q \u201811, there was an 11 point adjustment that needed to be made to the reported core loss ratio for workers\u2019 complaint, but even if I back that adjustment out, the core loss ratio picked up in 4Q \u201812. So, I just wanted to see if there was anything notable in workers comp in terms of one-offs just in light of the recent progress that you guys have been making in workers\u2019 comp?","Steve Johnston","Vincent, this is Steve. And I think again, I would focus a little bit more on the year, especially if the line is volatile and has been as you know is volatile for us as workers compensation. We still feel very confident with the progress that we\u2019re making and it\u2019s just that most recent accident quarter for workers\u2019 comp is going to be pretty volatile in any year.","And so we are looking more to the long-term trend, the full year improvement and feel good about the improvement that we\u2019re making. But given the volatility that can occur, your point is well taken that it\u2019s aligned and it always has to have a close eye kept on it.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. That\u2019s good. And then just what you guys writing some of your accounts on a three year basis, how do you feel about the increases that you\u2019re getting on the three year accounts that are renewing now?","I guess this versus what the one year accounts have been getting as far as rate increases in the last few years? And then thinking about it in that way, what would the implied forward rate increase be that you\u2019re assuming I guess in the go forward next three years on those accounts?","J.F. Scherer","Vincent, this is J.F. The way I would characterize the three year policy right now is that we probably more than at any point in time, previously are strengthening the difference between what we would offer as a one year renewal price increase and a three year policy price increase. The take up rate has been a little bit less.","Agencies have renewed policies on a one year policy rather than three. And that\u2019s all right, because we\u2019d be very happy with the kind of increases we\u2019re asking for. And in next year, we\u2019ll have the opportunity to revisit the policy. So, I\u2019d say very committed to the three year policy. It\u2019s still a very stabilizing mechanism for us. So, all-in-all good progress there, but once again strengthening the kind of increases we\u2019re looking for in three year policy.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. The comments you made about renewals going to one year versus three. In some cases, it seems really interesting. I\u2019m curious if I should -- maybe the takeaway that I should make from that, would it be that agents maybe don\u2019t think that the current rate environment is going to persist for the next couple of years and insurers would be better off taking a one year renewal or is it -- should my takeaway be that you guys are just being very conservative and the rate increase that you\u2019re asking for on the three year.","Steve Johnston","Yeah, the latter. Well, I think we are pressing for higher rate increases on the three year policy. I think the bottom line of the economy is not as robust as some businesses would like for it to be. And there they can\u2019t tolerate quite the increase that we may ask for on the three year policy.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Perfect. And then the last one from me. In terms of the 65 agency appointment goal, is that just because of reaching saturation and I think that\u2019s what you mentioned. I guess the other question would be, was there any volume of agency own or complaints regarding the last few years pace that would have impacted that lower target.","Steve Johnston","Yeah. There have been some volume of agency complaints, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything drastic. Obviously, when you add agencies as we have and we have been so careful throughout our history to make certain we don\u2019t over saturate an area. You can get into a lot of discussions with agencies about better debates.","But the 65 level for this year I think is a reflection of the fact that over the last three years, we have increased the agency force in lot of areas. A lot of opportunities we appointed about $2.7 billion in property and casualty premium this year which was probably double our best year previously or certainly a significant increase over previous years.","So having had a lot of conversations over the last year and a half with agencies about our long-term aspirations for growth. Number of agencies we have in our area examining the agencies that have plateaued as far as their activity levels are concerned. We think we\u2019ve done a real good job. We have a lot more critical mass to work with right now. Having said that, there are always going to be opportunities for new appointments, there are 65 agencies that we\u2019re projecting for this year will reflect that.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino - Stifel Nicolaus","All right. Perfect. Looking forward to talking to you guys again real soon.","Steve Johnston","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ray Iardella with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just maybe wanted to touch on the year-over-year improvement and the accident year loss ratio, not looking on a quarter basis but just the full year. I think it\u2019s somewhere around 8.5 points. I know Steve you had talked about maybe rate being half of it but maybe you can give a little bit more color of what the other half of the improvement is?","And then maybe just talk about your overall position in terms of how you guys are setting loss picks and whether or not it\u2019s changed at all over the past 12 months or 24 months?","Steve Johnston","Maybe I\u2019ll defer to J.F. to talk about the improvements because he really has been spearheading along with Marty Mullen in claims in a true team approach here and then maybe I\u2019ll touch a little bit on the second part of your question.","J.F. Scherer","Yeah. As far as initiatives to improve the loss ratios, as was mentioned -- as Steve mentioned, inspection protocols for us both in personal lines and in commercial lines, we are literally inspecting or re-inspecting hundreds of thousands of structures both in personal lines and commercial lines to give us a more confirmed view of the quality of the property that we\u2019re insuring, the age of the roofs, the condition of the roofs, obviously with the weather being as bad as it has been, roof claims is a very significant part of what we\u2019ve been battling.","Our loss control division has expanded significantly. Specialization within our loss control division has expanded a lot. That\u2019s manifested itself in a lot more attention in the area of workers comp but also in the casualty and property lines as well. Marty touched a little bit on some of the initiatives they\u2019ve been involved in, in the claims area. But that\u2019s been a significant driver for improved results.","Marty Hollenbeck","Thanks J.F. Ray, this is Marty. We really have seen some great efficiencies going on from expansion of our worker\u2019s compensation, call center and direct call center and expediting those types of claims and having the impact on our overall results.","We\u2019re also focusing on our overall spend, especially workers compensation, focusing on best practices within the repricing issues and addressing a new nurse case management, pharmacy bill strategy. So we\u2019ve got a lot of balls in the air, a lot of progress being made, still much to be done but we\u2019re very happy with the progress we\u2019re making.","J.F. Scherer","Ray, I guess I might add that of course, in and as much as we\u2019ve done a lot more in lost control and just overall inspections, it\u2019s really just kicking into full gear right now. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic that in 2014, we\u2019re going to get a lot of payback from that as well.","Steve Johnston","I\u2019d just add Ray, that the thing that\u2019s kind of hard to quantify, to quality independent agents that represent Cincinnati, we\u2019ve had the high privilege over last three nights to really spend a lot of time with the agencies and the enthusiasm they have really is contagious. And they are doing a great job out in their communities in terms of really servicing their clients and helping manage risk.","All of that added up allow us to be optimistic about the future in terms of our loss pick and so forth, but it\u2019s -- very much a bottoms-up, one risk at a time granular approach that really is driven by great independent agents and great people, field rep and underwriter level across our company. So I think credit goes to them.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Then just a follow-up, I guess on the agencies, you guys have appointed more recently. I mean if you look back over the past year or two or even three years. Has that level of premium that you guys have gotten from these newer agencies exceeded your initial expectations, meaning does the premium coming on quicker or is that kind of as expected?","Steve Johnston","I would judge it as expected. We don\u2019t appoint an agency and expect over a very long period of time, we eventually gear up. We go through a fairly extensive interviewing process that deals with everything from financial statements of the agencies, to having members of different disciplines of our company go interview the agency about what they may be doing in personal lines, commercial lines, their access and surplus lines area, life insurance. And so we tend to hit the ground running. And we have historically always been there. So I would say it\u2019s gone as expected.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Okay. One more if I can squeeze it in, I mean I know you guys have expanded. I believe on the personal line side, more recently I believe in New York and Oregon, I mean any sort of thought process and expand into new states in 2013?","Steve Johnston","Connecticut is a state that we will be expanding into natural as we have mentioned on previous calls. We\u2019re very interested in diversifying our property exposures into these new states, many of which Oregon -- of course, Sandy would have proved to be strong in Connecticut, but certainly upstate New York is less cat prone. We don\u2019t have anything on the drawing boards right now to go beyond adding Connecticut.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Okay. Thank you very much.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Ray.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill","I guess I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about cat exposure and how that has changed for you with recent expansion. Obviously, you\u2019ve tried to do something there with the cat bond, but could you talk a little bit more about sort of how that you now show up with the models and whether or not we should think of you as having sort of more or less cat risk than you had say a year or two ago?","Steve Johnston","Paul, maybe we can tag team on this. This is Steve and just getting to start. It is kind of a two-pronged attack there and that we are growing more in areas that are less cat prone. So, overall that is going to have favorable effect.","But I think importantly in the areas where we have been historically by managing the book and carefully underwriting from what we are seeing from the models, the expected losses are actually moving in a favorable direction as well. And so we\u2019ve had action in Florida and various coastal areas as well as actions that we\u2019ve taken in earthquake prone areas. And those that are susceptible to Midwestern convective storm activity, a lot of the things that we\u2019re doing just every day to manage the risk profile overall or working to improve our position vis-\u00e0-vis the cat exposure.","Mike Sewell","Paul, moving forward, I think we are strengthening some of our underwriting actions as Steven mentioned in more cat prone areas in homeowners. For example, on new business for asphalt shingled roofs, anything over than 15 years, we have already announced that we are going to an ACB loss method of payment on those particular risk in commercial lines, much higher deductibles, building deductibles rather than per occurrence deductibles.","The homeowners initiatives l mentioned is on new business. Percentage deductibles they are starting to be used in the Midwest in for habitational risk. So, there is a lot going on that we think can mitigate losses. I wouldn\u2019t want to underestimate the fact that the inspection protocol that we have, we\u2019re inspecting a lot of property to determine its susceptibility to withstanding weather.","So, it\u2019s not just so much deductible. I would expect that we will probably have a fair amount more non-renewals of certain property that we find to be in total repair.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Cool. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everyone.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","I want to talk a little about the dividend. Have you thought about increasing it a little bit. There is a change in story a little bit but you guys have been just inching it up very, very slowly. Obviously, there is a return to profitability. What can an investor expect is a normal run rate of dividend growth for the company??","Steve Johnston","Well, good question in fact. This is Steve. We do discuss that dividend all the time. I mean, that is important. Capital management activity for us. So every time the Board gets together, there is a lively discussion. I think we have this history of 52 years now in a row of increasing dividends.","So, I think that sets a good precedent that the shareholders can latch onto. But beyond that in terms of where we are in terms of specific future guidance, I just don\u2019t think that we are in a position to give that other than to point to our history and to point it to payout ratio is much improved and has been improving over the years and that puts us in a pretty good position and just knowing that the dividend is a very important part of our capital management strategy with shareholders.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Can we speak of a quarter percent increases as a suppressed increase?","Mike Sewell","You know it\u2019s an increase and again everything is done meeting by meeting, looking at all of the information that we have. I have to think that with what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the improvement that certainly we are going to have more positive discussions. But again this is a board action and I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s a lively discussion with the Board.","And I really can\u2019t commit one way or the other, other than to say the dividend is and has been a very important part of what we do for shareholders in terms of capital management.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Well, then along those lines, can you talk about how you think of excess capital here now?","Steve Johnston","We see various ways to deploy our capital, certainly the dividend is a big part of it. We\u2019re growing the way we\u2019re at the underwriting profits that we\u2019re growing at, we see a capital strategy of investing in the business. It\u2019s a big part of our capital deployment and so in addition to dividends, repurchases went appropriate, investing in equities. So it\u2019s been a very successful strategy and I think a way of deploying excess capital.","We really are looking at investing in the business, doing what we can to support our field people who are the strength of the company to allow them to be out, nations offices more frequently and to really service that agent. So we just -- we look at things over the long pool. We think we have a very strong and winning business model that it survived every cycle for over 60 years. And I just survived thrived in -- we are going to invest in the businesses as well.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you for your answers and congratulations on all the good news.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","Your last question comes from Fred Nelson with Crowell, Weedon. Your line is open.","Fred Nelson - Crowell, Weedon","I have been on these conference calls for almost 20 years and the key to your success is how you treat people. And I\u2019m always in awe of the benefits you do with people, both women and men, to build this business for all of us. But I wanted to say thank you to Ken Stecher. I heard he got a very nice award and he led this company under some very difficult times. And I just wanted to personally say on this call, thank you, Ken.","Ken Stecher","Well, thank you Fred. It\u2019s really an honor. It\u2019s something I never expected to receive. There is a lot of greater graduate candidates and to be selected for that is really humbling. Thank you very much.","Fred Nelson - Crowell, Weedon","You deserve it, buddy.","Ken Stecher","Thank you. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re past those three or four years and things have turned the corner. And all the hard work that we\u2019ve done and put in, the team put in is now starting to pay some fruit and benefits. So we\u2019re glad to see that.","Fred Nelson - Crowell, Weedon","Couldn\u2019t support you more. Good. Congratulations.","Ken Stecher","Well, thank you.","Steve Johnston","Stephanie, do we have any further questions in the queue.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Steve. Johnston","Thank you. Thank you, Stephanie for presiding over the call and thanks to all of you for calling in for participating with this and we look forward to getting together with you in the future.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. You may begin sir.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for the second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our -- quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer, and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call are welcome to ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Martin Hollenbeck, and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray, Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","And now I'll turn over the call to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Operating performance was very good, particularly given challenging spring weather including storms affecting the Dayton, Ohio area with insured losses that exceeded the $100 million retention level of our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty. We believe our steadily improving results reflect our proven strategy and careful execution, as we continue efforts to grow profitably over the long term.","Net income for the second quarter of 2019, nearly doubled the amount of a year ago. Changes in the fair value of equity securities held at June 30th, produced most of the increase. Non-GAAP operating income was up 5% and is up 23% for the first half of the year. Our 96.5% second quarter 2019 Property Casualty combined ratio was 0.7 percentage points better than a year ago. Without the effects of natural catastrophes, it was 3.6 points better.","Our results benefited from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography in the recent years. That, along with various improvements over time and how we underwrite property risks, helps reduce adverse effects of catastrophic weather events in the Midwest that have tended to impact our second quarter results. A major reason for our confidence and improved underwriting performance is progress in segmenting our business, retaining more profitable accounts, and getting better pricing on the less profitable business, while walking away from opportunities when we judge profit margins to be too thin.","In addition to profit improvement and strong investment results, premium growth in pricing were bright spots for the second quarter, as we earn more business through our agencies and augment that with growth in other areas. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 9%, including renewal price increases and nice growth in new business written premiums. Commercial lines segment had second quarter 2009 estimated average price increases that were slightly higher than the low-single digit percentage increases of the first quarter. The combined ratio for commercial lines was 4.4 percentage points worse than last year's second quarter, although it was 0.8 points better on a before catastrophe loss basis.","Our personalized segment continued to experience average rate increases by slightly lower than the first half for the first quarter of 2019. Personal auto remained in the high single-digit range. The personal line, second quarter combined ratio improved significantly and was below 100%, as personal auto profitability continued to improve. Our excess and surplus line segment had another outstanding quarter with the combined ratio below 80% and net written premium growth exceeding 20%. We've seen abundant growth opportunities in the E&S market, while our underwriting appetite has remained consistent with recent years.","Cincinnati Re had a very good quarter of growth and profitability with the combined ratio in the mid '80s. Cincinnati Global had its first full quarter contribution to our results and did quite well with the combined ratio in the mid '70s. As we noted last quarter, purchase accounting has favorable effects on Cincinnati Global's expense ratio for the first few periods following its acquisition. Our life insurance subsidiary continues to grow term life insurance premiums in the second quarter, up 7% on an earned basis. The net income contribution was not as good as last year, but this part of our business is another source of risk and earnings diversification.","I'll finish with highlighting the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results in favorable securities markets produced an excellent VCR at 6.8% for the second quarter and 18.6% for the first half. The contribution from our operations, measured as net income, before investment gains was 4% for the first six months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. Despite short term variability FX, market appreciation over time as we manage our stock portfolio remains an important part of our long-term value creation for shareholders.","Now, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other important areas of our financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great, thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.","Our investment income continue to climb up 4% for the second quarter of 2019. Dividends from our equity portfolio rose 14%, as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings. Net purchases of stocks during the second quarter totaled $75 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio was down slightly, decreasing just under 1%. The pre-tax average yield was 4.12% for the second quarter, down 16 basis points from the second quarter a year ago. Steady investment in bonds again occurred during the quarter as we made $69 million in net purchases. Although the average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax exempt bonds was a little lower than in recent quarters. For the first six months of 2019, there was 6 basis points higher than the same period in 2018, and within 2 basis points of the full year 2018 purchases.","Investment portfolio valuation changes for the second quarter of 2019 were favorable, both for our stock and bond portfolios. The overall net gain was $564 million before tax effects that included $366 million for our equity portfolio and $199 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with net appreciate value of more than $4 billion including nearly $0.5 billion in our bond portfolio. Strong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $476 million for the first six months of 2019, up $12 million even after paying $57 million more this year in catastrophe losses. Regarding expense management, we watch our spending carefully as we make strategic business investments. The second quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.4 percentage points higher than last year's second quarter. But matched the full year 2018 period and was within a 10th of a percentage point of the average a full years 2016 through 2018.","Moving next to reserves, we apply a consistent approach as we continue to aim for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the second quarter of 2019, we again experienced a healthy amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefit our combined ratio by 6.4 percentage points. Of two longer-tailed lines, commercial casualty and workers compensation, represented nearly 2\/3 of the property casualty total. Other than homeowner, each of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development during the first half of this year. On an all lines basis by accident year that included 29% accident year 2018%, 26% for accident year 2017% and 40% for 2016 and prior accident years.","On the subject of capital management, the approach there is also stable. Our financial strength remains stellar, providing plenty of financial flexibility . As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting, increased book value by $0.23. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.58. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.96. Net investment gains and losses from the equity portfolio increased book value by $1.77. And we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $3.04 during the second quarter, to a record high $55.92 per share.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Mike. The second quarter is often a challenging one, yet we are satisfied with our overall results. The storms that crisscrossed our nation over the past few months gave our independent agents and our claims associates who work with them a chance to shine. In August, our field associates from across the country will come together in Cincinnati to celebrate the progress we are making to attend educational opportunities in the plan for the future. It's a great opportunity to reinforce our Cincinnati advantages into learn from our associates about the opportunities they are seeing firsthand.","Our strong performance for the first half of the year bodes well for the future. As always, we remain focused on execution of our proven strategy, seeking profitable growth for the benefit of all stakeholders, and creating shareholder value over time. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Martin Hollenbeck, and Theresa Hopper.","Natalia, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","Hi, good morning. My first question is regarding the catastrophe levels this quarter. I know it depends when you, when I -- the long-term average cat load, I believe, for 2Q was higher than what you experienced this quarter. I know it depends when I start my start the average calculation, what year I start. I know that's changed since then, you have grown into different segments and states and you have a new treaty. So I'm trying to understand whether this quarter's cat load was materially above your kind of base case normal expectations, if you can opine?","Mike Sewell","Yes, this is Mike Sewell, and that's a great question, Mike. And actually if I think about the second quarter cats that we had, so it was 10 points for this year. When we think about cat loads and we do look at averages, and that average actually was right in there between a 5- and 10-year average. So, a five-year average for us was right at 10 points, if you gauge as of 12\/31\/18. So we actually we're right on top of it. We were actually a little bit lower if you go and look at a 10-year average, but included in the 10-year average -- remember back at 2011, where we had our two largest cats, back to back. So we were actually right, kind of right in the middle on this one.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. I'll check my math then, and I think I probably added more cat load for the reinsurance division. So then this would kind of be kind of within your normal expectations, was, is my take away?","Mike Sewell","I would say so, yes.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. In terms of the commercial pricing environment, it sounded like in the press release that pricing is -- there hasn't been much momentum quarter-over-quarter. I think some peers have shown I think a good deal of momentum. Specifically Travelers showed over a point of momentum in their book quarter-over-quarter. Any color or thoughts there?","Steve Spray","Yes, Mike, this is Steve Spray. You're right. Second quarter, just from our major lines of business, what we're experiencing is in commercial auto, we're still in the high single-digit range, commercial property mid-single digits, casualty low single-digit, and workers compensation is down mid-single. Just as a reminder, I think we talked or I commented on this on the last quarter as well. I don't think the averages really tell the complete story for the way we're trying to execute with our agents, both on new business and on renewals. As an example, while we remain consistently in that high-single digit range on the commercial auto, we're really focused on executing on segmentation. So a portion of our book, the analytics that we have that would indicate that we have less of an opportune chance for profit, or at least adequately priced business, another way to put it, we are getting increases far in excess of our average.","And then on the business that we see that is most adequately priced, we're working with our agents to really focus on the retention there. And that will impact the average, but it also, if you think about it, it's improving our mix. And we don't just do that in commercial auto, we take that across all major lines of business and commercial lines, new and renewal. Now to comment, I think I'd like to add a little extra color too, because we are seeing in the marketplace, a pronounced firming, hardening -- how you'd like to put it. And it's focused in some specific areas and commercial lines. As an example habitational risks, so apartments, condos, anything coastal, large property schedules or large property risks -- we're seeing an additional firming in that. Commercial auto, of course, we're seeing that there. Commercial auto would be the area that we would track with the industry. Those other areas, we certainly have larger property risks, larger property schedules. We have some tougher casualty, we have a little coastal as well. But on a relative basis, not to the rest of the industry. So I think that's what's driving some of the muting of what you're seeing there as well. Does that make sense?","Mike Zaremski","Yes, that's good color. As a follow-up to you, and then some of your peers have talked over the years about being more precise in determining which accounts need more or less rate. I'm just curious, at a high level, is this, are these tools you're using to determine this, are they proprietary to Cincinnati Financial? Are they, is it a change in the last couple of years versus the prior decade? Or is this kind of off-the-shelf software that most of your competitors are using too?","Mike Sewell","No, I would say it's proprietary to Cincinnati Insurance. Others obviously use predictive analytics and tools as well, and theirs would be proprietary to them. We implemented this from on the workers compensation front about 9 or 10 years ago, and then our package lines, our major package lines -- auto, GL, property, and work comp -- property followed right after the workers compensation. I just think we are continuing to execute better and better on the segmentation across all those lines, Mike, and just really focused on it. Our underwriting teams are doing an excellent job working with our agents and it's picked up steam over the last couple of years. And I think that's -- well, I'm confident that's what we're seeing in the results.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, great. Maybe a piece of that is your field underwriters have gotten more comfortable using the analytics? I don't know if you have a thought about that.","Mike Sewell","Yes, that's a great follow up. Absolutely, the analytics, we use the tools both on new business and on renewals. And I would say that both our HQ renewal underwriters and our field sales underwriters, it took time to evolve on this, get more comfortable, communicate with the agents, work with the agents. I think we're, our underwriting teams are doing a great job of getting out in front early and often and communicating with the agents on those risks, where we think we need to take maybe the most drastic action. So yes, I feel really good about that. And we can see any the analytics too, that our new business pricing has continued to improve and its continued to improve this year as well.","Mike Zaremski","Okay and great. One last question, also then, probably for Mike. Did you say in the prepared remarks that the gap between the new money investment yield and your portfolio yield, or whatever is expiring in the portfolio, is 2 basis points?","Mike Sewell","Yes. Yes, that's right. And let me have Marty maybe give a little bit more detail on that.","Marty Mullen","Yes. Purchases of about $419 million, book yield purchase was 427. That's about, call it 3 basis points less than the prior quarter and embedded book value, so very slight.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. So then if it seems like you guys have less -- if that's on the go-forward basis, it doesn't seem like you guys have much of a drag, whereas some peers have a bigger gap.","Marty Mullen","I wouldn't quite glad for. We do have a drag in that, we've got a number of corporate bonds purchased 10 years ago in the aftermath of the financial crisis at very generous credit spreads and for the last year and a half or so we've been experiencing those leaving us. So that's created some drag. So we're doing our best to counter it, but there is still some drag there.","Mike Zaremski","Thanks for the insights.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. My, I was looking at the paid losses relative to incurred. It looks like they've risen significantly in both the commercial lines and personal lines this year and I was wondering if you could kind of reconcile what's underneath that, too. I mean, it looks like paid losses are pretty flat. But the incurred is down, what do you think is going on with that?","Steve Spray","This is Steve, I'll jump in. I think there is a very steady approach to setting the reserves. And I think if we look at the half year, and its total, the paid to incurred look pretty reasonable. I think we've added about 2.4 loss ratio points to the first half in terms of IBNR additions. And I think one thing to consider is that we're coming out of a period that had relatively higher catastrophe losses. We're looking at this paid to incurred on kind of a calendar year basis. And so we could have the emergence of claims that are being paid and also some take down in reserves is showing up in the favorable development column. And so I think the deeper that we dig into it, and the confidence we have in our consistent approach to setting the reserves, gives us great confidence to the point on the cat payments. They were $57 million more so far this year than they were for the first half a year ago. So I think that has some explanation there.","Paul Newsome","Great. Given the environment with pricing sort of outside the core business being a little bit more attractive, have you thought about putting more capital than you had previously thought into the reinsurance in and the voids business?","Steve Johnston","We are pleased with the way both of those are performing. I think one thing that we've done that was -- the way to do it, on the Cincinnati Re was to not establish a separate company there. Basically it's a part of Cincinnati Insurance and it puts us in a position to just not have pressure to grow into a capital base, to maybe be incentive to take a little bit more risk to provide a return on the capital amount has been allocated. To that point, we have a very small but talented group. I think there's about 20 in the Cincinnati Re that are performing I think at a high level in there. It puts them in a position where they can just, on a risk-adjusted basis look policy-by-policy. It's not at all top-down dictated, it's very much our people getting more and more opportunities. As we see in the marketplace, Cincinnati Re is just developing a reputation, getting a lot more looks, maintaining their underwriting discipline, and we can be very selective in the risks that we entertain and the contracts that we entertain.","In terms of Cincinnati Global, our Lloyd's subsidiary, again, very happy with the way they're started. They're a talented group that's been profitable 20 out of the last 24 years. We think we have sufficient capital there to execute on the business plans that they have submitted and received approval for. And we will keep a close eye on that. So in this instance, I don't want to show any lack of confidence in either by not saying we're going to pour more capital to it, but we think we have adequate capital in both places and we think that both are executing at a high level.","Paul Newsome","Great. thanks. Congrats on the quarter again.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Josh Shanker with the Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes, good morning everybody. I don't know I'm connected, hello?","Dennis McDaniel","Yes, good morning Josh, can you hear?","Josh Shanker","Good , good. Got it. And I'm glad you are there. I just wanted to hear, I mean the workers' comp reserve releases continue to be quite excellent and I expect that they will be in the future for the industry. I was hoping you could give us some color on what years you're seeing excellent reserve releasing trends in the workers' comp book, and whether you've touched upon the recent years at all?","Mike Sewell","Yes. Josh, this is Mike. And so for the year-to-date on the workers' comp, we had $42 million and favorable development. So thinking about that and looking at our details, it's actually kind of spread throughout, evenly throughout the year. So for accident year 2018, it was $6 million, accident year '17 it was $9 million, accident year '16 it was $9 million, and then for accident years 2015 and prior it's $18 million. So it's that kind of evenly throughout the most recent accident years.","Josh Shanker","And in terms of your forward writings, to what extent are is the pricing that you guys are putting to place a function of regulatory requirement? To what extent are you taking those profitabilities yourself and saying that you can offer better prices to your customers?","Steve Spray","Yes, I think -- Josh, this is Steve Spray. It's hard to ignore the base rate declines that are coming through from the very state rating bureaus, and that's putting pressure on the accident year results for sure. But we've seen the loss trends be benign. We're an open market for work comp. I couldn't, we couldn't be more pleased with the way we're managing work comp. I mean underwriting, risk selection, pricing, loss control claims -- everybody hitting on all cylinders there. So we're open for business, but that line can be volatile, it can be variable as everybody knows. So we're just watching that closely and want to and want to grow it. But as we are seeing these base rate declines come through, again, we're using the tools that we have, both the art in the science of it, and we're trying to mitigate those base rate reductions running through our book as much as possible.","Josh Shanker","Terrific, and one more if I can. I'm wondering if you could give any color -- I know obviously you give great detail. On the personal lines and net premium growth rate, is there any way to segregate your traditional business growth rate from your high-net-worth homeowners' growth rate? And if you can talk about a few geographies where you found recent success in the high-net-worth homeowners' business outside the, I guess the New York Metro area, I'd love to hear about it.","Steve Spray","Yes. Our high net worth, we are really pleased with the progress there and that just continues month after month. Our high-net-worth is growing. It's obviously on the coast is the main areas where that business is, and where it's going, but we're seeing growth across our entire agency footprint. I would tell you our middle market business, the growth there has been under maybe more pressure than the high-net-worth, because of necessary rate actions we're taking. That's put pressure on the new business as well. But we think it's appropriate, we need it. We're targeting it by state, and some of our larger states need the most action -- Michigan, Kentucky, Georgia are three states to, just to name three of the larger ones that we're taking very aggressive rate action, it's needed. It's prudent, but it's putting pressure on both the new business retentions and written premium in, on the whole book.","Josh Shanker","Would it be wrong to say that high-net-worth homeowner policy count growth continues to be in the healthy double digits for you?","Steve Spray","Yes.","Josh Shanker","That'd be correct. Would be wrong to say, is that correct?","Steve Johnston","That would be correct.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Okay, thank you.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Good morning. I was wondering if what lines are driving the reinsurance growth?","Steve Spray","The reinsurance growth would be Cincinnati Re.","Meyer Shields","Well, specifically like what, I guess, types of business are you?","Steve Spray","Yes, it is -- when you look at it on a very ground-up basis, it is about, I think for the year, 42% property right now. Let me check that number, it's 40% property. Year-to-date, the rest would be in our casualty and specialty. That is varied over time, but as we go through various times of the year and we're getting a lot of great looks at some of the property business here in the second quarter, we were a little bit higher on the property this quarter. But if we look inception-to-date, it's a very balanced portfolio of 35% in property, the other 65% in the casualty in specialty buckets. So again, very much a ground up contract-by-contract emphasis on where we grow.","Meyer Shields","Thank you. I appreciate that. On the Lloyd's, can you just give a little color on what you're seeing in the pricing and market environments there? I think we are there was one insurer who just recently mentioned. They're seeing some E&S business bouncing from Lloyd's back into the US CNS market, and are you seeing that as well?","Steve Spray","It has been a firming market. I would say it's been a firming market both in what we see with our CSU in terms of excess and surplus lines. Also what we're seeing in the Lloyd's market is firming that is welcome. We're seeing it from some of the bigger carriers in the United States as well in terms of firming. So I think it's just overall, especially given the experience over the last couple of years, it's definitely been a firming market and we're seeing it in our Cincinnati Global underwriters and Lloyd's as well.","Meyer Shields","I appreciate the tie up, thanks.","Operator","We have a follow-up from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, thanks. One follow-up on, on the high-net-worth space. Just curious, do you feel, do you have any sense of whether the high-net-worth marketplace is growing or whether you're mostly taking share? And also, do you have a sense of whether your pricing is similar to that of peers, or are you kind of taking share because of its less price sensitive and more of the relationships with the agents, if that makes sense?","Steve Johnston","Yes, I'll take the first. This is Steve Johnson, I'll take the first quick shot at it and turn it over to Steve Spray. But we're seeing both growth from -- in both areas. And I think not only from what you would think of as the traditional high-net-worth carriers, but also much of the business is also written from just standard carriers that the clients have been with for many years and I think they see the value that we bring in terms of upgrading coverage and expertise in handling the higher-net-worth policies. So I think a lot of the growth can come from that area, both the traditional and the non-traditional.","Steve Spray","Yes, I would, I would just add, Mike as well that as far as the pricing goes, we feel like we have an excellent value there with the agents, and we feel like our pricing is in there with the marketplace. It's more of a value play for us, and the claim service that we bring, the broad coverage from that we have, the services that we provide. We've just been received. Our strategy and our model has been received really well by all of our agencies.","Mike Zaremski","Yes, thanks again.","Dennis McDaniel","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Hi, thanks and good morning. Maybe just a couple of quick follow-ups. So, the first is on the commercial auto discussion. I was looking at the supplement. The current AYLRs look to be trending in the right direction. Can you just refresh us on that discussion because your numbers are getting better, however, Travelers had more noise in this quarter. So I'm trying to figure out what exactly is going on in the book?","Steve Spray","I mean, this is Steve Spray again. Yes, every quarter that goes by, we get even more confident that we were out ahead of this commercial auto, the trends that we've seen. For us, it's severity. I think it's severity for the industry. Our frequency has been good and trending even more positively. The macro things in the marketplace, so those macro effects, haven't gone away. Those will be examples of just distracted driving. We have an improving economy, there is increased miles being driven. Employers are having difficulty hiring qualified drivers to put behind the wheel, and then I think we all can see that the construction that goes on in the infrastructure of the highway system. So all that's leading to the severity. But I think we -- again, we were out ahead of this. We've worked with our agents, starting back probably about 2 years ago, maybe a little longer than that, of really focusing on segmenting the book. And we've got the pricing in a good spot. We still have room for improvement. There is still a runway there. The market's going to allow us to continue to improve, but we feel really good about where we are with commercial auto right now. And a matter of fact, are looking for opportunities inside our agencies as this market is firming. We think we can help our agents write some new business, well underwritten and at more adequate prices than we've seen in the past several years.","Amit Kumar","You know, related to that answer, we've been reading more and more about the oversupply of I guess big rigs, falling freight rates et cetera. How does that factor in your book? I know you talked about the driver issue and the overall economy, but how does that oversupply of big rigs and freight rates impact your book?","Steve Spray","Yes, I don't think it -- it doesn't really apply to us. I mean, not that we don't have some of that business with our agencies, but we've just -- we've never been a big transportation market for long haul trucking and such. But I can -- that kind of goes to the question earlier, too. That market, when we do see those risk presented to us, you can understand why that market is as firm or as hard as it is, that segment of the market.","Amit Kumar","Yes, fair point. It's been a challenge for a long time. The other question I had was the discussion on the child victims exposure and I don't recall you mentioning in the opening remarks. Can you remind us what exposure you may or may not have to those claims?","Dennis McDaniel","I assume you're talking about New York and some of the things we've seen here with the diocese and so forth. Marty Mullen may want to chime in here a little bit on that.","Marty Mullen","Sure. Thank you, Amit. This is Marty Mullen. That really won't be a very big factor for us with Cincinnati and in New York as we wrote little very little of that back in, 20 or 25 years ago in New York, which I think you're referring to the statute of limitation change for these claims. We really weren't in New York at that time, back -- I think this mainly pertains to '80s and mid-'90s. So our exposure as a result of those change in the statutes should have very little impact on us.","Amit Kumar","Got it. And then the only final question is, maybe a broader question, is the discussion on social inflation and in jury awards and sort of plaintiff awards have been climbing a bit. Any thoughts on that and your thought process changed, let's say, over the past few quarters?","Marty Mullen","This is Marty, again. And that's not the -- in our experience, it's a jurisdictional issue and it's very specific to the type of claim, the type of defendants that you might have, and the actual details of the incident. And our experienced claim staff that's been with Cincinnati -- we promote from within, so we have what we feel a culture within Cincinnati, to just recognize those types of situations, where severity may play and an impact in certain jurisdictions over another. And it certainly is impacting the industry, you just have to take it a case-by-case basis and be aware of the potentials for an adverse verdict.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's very helpful. I'll stop here. Thanks for the answers, and good luck for the future.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Fred Nelson [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","So number one, I want to tell you, to thank all of you for what you've done, because through ownership of your company I've changed people's lives and allowed them to do things they never dreamed of. You never hear much about that in our society, but I do, and I want to say thank you for what you've done. A couple of questions now, the taxes on the dividend income and equities, could you tell me how it's done now? Is there a certain percentage that's free and a certain percentage that's taxed at 21%?","Steve Johnston","Fred, I'll start out, this is Steve Johnston. I'll turn it over to Mike Sewell. First off, and I thank you for your initial comments. They're very much appreciated. When we look at the tax rate for the dividends received deduction, as it was changed a bit by the new tax reform and Jobs Creation Act, it really didn't affect the overall tax rate for the dividends because the rate came down, but the parts that could be offset there went up a little bit, and the overall effective tax rate for the dividends that we receive remained really pretty much unchanged. So Mike might have more specifics.","Mike Sewell","Yes, yes, no, it's. Yes, Fred, that was a great, great observation. It really hasn't changed between the different subsidiaries, if you will. So, for the life insurance company, there is no dividends received deduction. So you're still going to have a 21% rate there. So therefore we don't hold any stocks where we get dividend income in the life company. For the property casualty companies, you do get partial dividends received deduction. So our effective tax rate on dividend income there would be about 13%, and then for the non-insurance subsidiaries which would be like the parent company or CFCI, again, we do get dividends received deduction. The effective tax rate there is going to be about 10.5%. So there still are benefits for holding that. There were also a few changes on the tax-exempt interest, but if I think about it in total related to our investment income, whether it's interest income or dividend income, our effective tax yield or effective tax rate would be about 16%.","If you add that on top of the non-investment income, so through operations, gains and losses, which will come in at 21, our effective tax rate will probably be in the 17% ,18% range, if you have the same mix. This quarter our effective tax rate was around 19%, a little bit higher, but that's primarily because of the movement of unrealized gains and losses on our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio were so much that kind of skewed a little bit more towards the 21%.","Unidentified Analyst","It used to be, there was a percentage of the dividend income that was exempt from taxes, like 60%, and then that remaining 40% was taxed at 35%. Is that formula kind of still in use, but just a different range and different structure?","Mike Sewell","That's right. And that effective tax rate, when you blend it all out, has stayed pretty much unchanged from before the tax reform of two after it's down just a little bit.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, the other question I have is on your book, defecting book value, your deferred tax liability has increased. Does that reduce your book value?","Mike Sewell","Well, yes, yes. So you've got your -- the reason that's going up is because our unrealized gains on our equity portfolio, if that goes up a $1, then your deferred tax liability in that case is going to go up 21%. That is an offset to the asset that increased. So it, it is offsetting that. And so that's, it's a good thing that that liability is growing, because the asset is growing on the other side.","Unidentified Analyst","It could be $3 a share that's taken off book value. I am just rambling with my math here.","Mike Sewell","Yes, another way of looking at it is we carry on the balance sheet the equities, net of their tax liability. And so as the overall total value goes up, the liability goes up, and as Mike mentioned, it's a good thing because well, looking at it all out it's very positive.","Unidentified Analyst","Well, hey, thanks for making my life. You guys and gals and everybody in your company deserves a pat on the back, because you've been terrific. So I just want to say thanks again.","Mike Sewell","Thank you, Fred. We really appreciate your comments, and your questions were excellent.","Unidentified Analyst","You deserve it.","Mike Sewell","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions, I will turn the call back over to Mr. Johnston for any closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Natalia. Thank you for joining us all today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Steve and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Investor Relations Officer, Dennis McDaniel, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel of Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call.","Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including the Cincinnati Insurance Company\u2019s Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer for the Cincinnati Insurance, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, Marty Mullen.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Overall it was a strong quarter. Our results reflect well on our strategy and on the efforts of our associate and agents. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing on the fundamentals while enhancing performance through various initiatives. Together our underwriting programs and investment philosophy translated into substantial underwriting profit and are eighth consecutive quarter of investment income growth.","Disciplined underwriting and pricing on each policy was aided by more favorable weather than in the second quarter of last year. Together they led to a second quarter 2015 consolidated property-casualty combined ratio of 92.4%. Our first half 2015 combined ratio before catastrophe affects was 89.1% improving on that ratio from both full-year 2014 and 2013.","As we further segment our business we use pricing precision tools and informed underwriting judgment to select and retain policies at prices we believe provide an appropriate return for the risk we assume. We continue to earn quality new business from other agencies especially in areas we been emphasizing such as personal lines products and services for our agencies higher net worth clients.","We're on track to release executive capstone our new suite of high net worth insurance products in New York this quarter. We\u2019re also on track with progress for an initiative we announced early in the second quarter expansion of reinsurance assumed which we refer to the Cincinnati Re.","We have an experience executive leading the effort and we are developing a small team of excellent people to help execute your plans. We aim to be very disciplined in this expansion particularly during tough reinsurance market conditions. We have already entered into a future that will that will be reported during the third quarter generating approximately $15 million in diversifying written premium in 2015.","Overall pricing for the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter with average renewal price increases for commercialized continuing the percentages near the middle of the low single-digit range. That average includes the meeting effective of three year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the second quarter. For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the second quarter we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with both lines averaging in the mid single-digit range.","Our personnel auto policies, average renewal price increases near the low end of the mid single-digit range. Home owner policies were little higher in that range. For our excess and surplus line segment, the second quarter 2015 average renewal price percentage increases were also near the low end of the mid single-digit range. The ENS segment continues to perform very well producing another quarter with combined ratio below 90% and double-digit growth in net written premiums.","Our life insurance subsidiary including income from its investment portfolio also had another good quarter. A double-digit growth and profit in the second quarter, while our six-month result in line with last year\u2019s first half.","I will conclude with a couple of points that I think are important for all companies stakeholders to keep in mind. First, our primary measure of financial performance the value creation ratio is designed long-term in nature. So we are not alarmed when that measure falls short of target in the short-term due to securities market volatility. Our insurance business is in excellent shape. We have confidence in all of our associates and the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance.","Second, those studying this industry over the years have seen other times were merger and acquisition activity generated excitement and speculation. We believe our proven successful strategy will continue to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Looking forward to the next few years, our vision includes continuing to profitably grow the company with our agency-centered model.","I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to highlight other aspects of our recent financial performance.","Michael Sewell","Great. Thank you Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First, I\u2019ll highlight some important aspects of our second quarter investment results. We had another quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 3%. All 48 common stocks in our core portfolio increased our annual regular dividend over the 12-month period of July 2014 through June 2015.","The median dividend increase for those stocks was 7.7%. For our fixed maturity portfolio, interest income rose despite declining average yields, in part due to the first half 2015 net purchases totaling $311 million. The bond portfolios second quarter 2015 pretax average yield reported at 4.64% was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.48% while tax-exempt bond purchases averaged 3.43%. In both cases those yields are higher than those we experienced a year ago and in the first quarter of this year.","Our bond portfolios effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years up from 4.4 years at year end. The increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and not a change in strategy. Cash flow from operating activities again contributed to investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2015 rose 34% compared with a year ago to $470 million and help generate $394 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.","Paying $46 million less for catastrophe losses compared with a year ago help drive the increase in operating cash flow for the first half of this year. We are still carefully managing our expenses while we continue to strategically invest in our business. We kept the second quarter and first half property-casualty underwriting expense ratios essentially flat compared with prior year.","Moving to loss reserves, I\u2019ll first remind you that our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past. we continue aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. For the first half of 2015 favorable development on prior accident years at 4.4% was essentially line with 4.8% from the first half of last year.","As we noted our news release we again prudently added IBNR reserves to our commercial and personal auto lines. At the same time we were pleased to see another quarter of improvement in the case occur loss ratio for those lines. Our six month 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years including 41% for accident year 2014, 23% for accident year 2013, 32% for accident year 2012 and 4% for all order accident years in aggregate.","Our settler capital strength includes liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at June 30 total nearly $1.8 billion up slightly from year end. Our strong capital is vital for ongoing growth of our insurance operations as well as other capital management actions such as returning capital to shareholders.","During the second quarter we use $74 million for cash dividends to shareholders we also use $20 million to repurchase 400,000 additional shares at an average cost of $50.90 per share. Similar to our share repurchases in 2014 there was a maintenance type action intended to partially offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans.","I\u2019ll end my prepared remarks as usual by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.51. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.29.","The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.71. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $0.32. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.62 during the second quarter to $39.60 per share.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. In closing our prepared remarks, I have to say that we have a lot of positive momentum going as we move into the second half of the year. In addition to the strong results we had positive news from two rating agencies that rate our company. In June Standard & Poor's ratings services raised its financial strength and credit ratings on our standard market and life insurance subsidiaries to A+ from A with a stable outlook.","S&P cited our improved underwriting performance and efforts to continue building strong relationships with our agency partners. Two weeks ago, Fitch ratings affirmed the A+ insurer financial strength rating of our standard market and life insurance subsidiaries maintaining its stable outlook. We are confident that Cincinnati Financial is on the right track to deliver shareholder value far into the future.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff, Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Matthews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck.","Steve, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, our first question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Paul.","Paul Newsome","This is probably a question for Mike. I\u2019ve noticed, it looks like a fairly sizable increase in at least amount of reserve releases in the commercial business in the second quarter of every - for the last well, three, maybe four years. Is there, are there any studies or events that happened during the quarter that would account for that pattern?","Michael Sewell","Let me kick it off Paul. And then we\u2019ll see if Steve wants to jump in. We do studies really every quarter we\u2019re using the same actuaries we\u2019re following a consistent approach. They\u2019re really looking at every everything you know commercial lines, personal lines ENS. And so full study is done each quarter I'm looking at the paid losses as they come in.","And then in addition to that annually we do have the external auditors are reviewing the reserves and opining on the financials in total. So we do have a process that we follow. We\u2019ve got controls around that process and we believe it's a - it's a consistent process, that really we've been following for years. I don\u2019t know Steve if you have anything to add on to that.","Steve Johnston","Mike I think that was well put. I don't have anything to add.","Paul Newsome","So I guess I'm really asking why there is a seasonality to reserve releases in the second quarter.","Steve Johnston","I guess, this is Steve you know I don't know basically when it comes to prior year reserve development as Mike described as a consistent process or actuaries are looking at their best estimate of accident year ultimate losses to the extent they decrease their estimate of an ultimate accident year loss on prior years that would result in favorable development. I think we\u2019re careful to point out in the first-quarter call, that there isn\u2019t a lot of activity at that point because there\u2019s been such short time and such lack of additional information. Since they did the full year review but I think it's just a matter of actuaries doing their best to get a best estimate of ultimate accident year losses at each of the financial close periods.","Michael Sewell","Paul, maybe I\u2019ll add one other comment related to the commercial lines specifically to the releases this year were, I am going to say fairly I mean we have releases for accident year 2014, 2013, 2012, there were releases in total in addition to all accident years prior to that with accident year 2014, 2013 and 2012 being, I\u2019ll say somewhat consistent kind of between the $15 million to $25 million range for each of those accident years. So there's no necessarily spikes in one certain year versus another.","Paul Newsome","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","I'm not going to let you guys off the hook so easily. Paul is much more of a gentleman that I am. Workers compensation, I know you're trying to get a best estimate $40 million in reserve releases, this is a long-tail line of business; tell me what happened during the quarter, please, that caused such a change in your outlook on that business?","Steve Johnston","I guess with the long-tailed line as you would expect to take not that much of a change in assumption, with the payments that stretch out for so long to result in higher changes in the estimate. So I think it's just the result of a lot of hard work just going on in the claims department and the underwriting department. And is being reflected in the actuaries view of accident year ultimate losses in terms of original assumptions versus revised assumption as they gather more information.","Josh Shanker","So I mean in terms of - is this a information about claims progress on the severity side? On the frequency side? What accident years are affected? I mean, look, you guys always tend to have reserves in workers comp. That's definitely clear. You have a very, very conservative approach in this. It just seems outsize in nature. I know you are consistent. But understanding the methodology would help us out a lot. Is there anything you can point to in particular in that line that made you more optimistic during the quarter?","Steve Johnston","Josh, I just think they're looking at paid losses, how they are developing, they are using multiple regression methodologies, they are using standard methodologies, they are testing their assumptions currently versus assumptions that they've set before and coming up with their best estimate. And I think in total reserves in terms of favorable development at this point in time this year are pretty much in line with where they were at the same point last year. I think we are trying our best to keep our reserve margin consistent and it\u2019s just reflecting the best estimate of our actuaries.","Josh Shanker","Well, it looks excellent and I applaud your efforts. If we go back about a year ago and two years ago, you guys were on an aggressive sort of scouting of your properties, analyzing roofs and whatnot for the re-underwriting year. That became a huge benefit. One of the things that we've been hearing a lot about is drone technologies and the extent to which you can get aerial views. Do you think that Cincinnati could benefit and lower their expense ratio by doing regular roof analyses via remote-operated units?","Marty Mullen","Hi Josh, this is Marty Mullen. Actually, we already have a team formed to analyze the effectiveness and the values of the drone technology and underwriting loss control for those inspections as well and in claims and so we\u2019re pretty excited about the opportunities with that technology and what it can bring to the industry for our commercial inspections on property during the new business cycle and also in claims, certainly in storm situations to provide visual data, confirm measurements and actually confirm loss cost estimates as well.","Josh Shanker","Is that in development, or have you begun to use it?","Marty Mullen","We haven\u2019t started using it yet. We have teams investigating the opportunity to file the appropriate paperwork as you know that has to be filed and approved before you can implement the technology, but we are encouraged with our progress and looking forward to the opportunities certainly before the end of year.","Josh Shanker","Great. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your relationship with Google Compare and what kind of flows you are seeing from that new channel?","J.F. Scherer","Josh, this is J.F. We don\u2019t have a relationship with Google Compare, we are not a fan of comparative raters, to be honest with you\u2026","Josh Shanker","I'm sorry, I thought you were listed as one of their vendors on their site. But I guess that's a mistake.","J.F. Scherer","No, we don\u2019t have a relationship with them.","Josh Shanker","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC. Your line is open.","Scott Heleniak","Hi, good morning. Just wondering if you could - now it's been a quarter since we announced the new reinsurance unit, reinsurance assumed. Wondering if - and you announced a couple new hirings yesterday as well. Wondering if you had an update or you could share a little more on where you see that business heading and particular areas you might focus on?","Steve Johnston","Sure, Scott. This is Steve. We\u2019re hiring some very good people, very talented people, we\u2019re very happy with that. We are going to be very cautious as we move forward. We know it\u2019s a tough reinsurance market. But as we look out there I mean just with the domestic reinsurance market. I think there's something like $70 billion in premium volume.","I kind of joke with the guys that we've now captured $15 million of it, I think that despite an overall tough market with talented people if we can look at it one treaty at a time, we can put ourselves in a position to especially utilize in the strong capital position to A plus rating that we\u2019re in. We can really differentiate and write those policies where we have good profit potential, good expected risk-adjusted returns. Again being very careful but putting our capital to work to generate more growth,","Scott Heleniak","But could that be in property or casualty?","Steve Johnston","Yes we are not going to limit it to you know property or casualty we\u2019re going to just look for the best opportunities treaty-by-treaty.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. That's fair. Then just on personal lines, I was wondering if you could elaborate on something in the press release. You talked about you are benefiting from agents broadening their underwriting appetite there. And just wonder if you could comment on that. Does that mean because you're simply writing more personal lines in more states and you have more products to offer, such as high net worth? Just wondering if you could kind flesh out that comment?","J.F. Scherer","Yes, Scott this is J.F. I think what we intended to communicate there was that because of the high net worth focus that we now have an expanding our appetite not necessarily the agents appetite, we\u2019re able to offer a lot more products to our current agency force throughout the country and the business we are writing in the high net worth category has gone up quite a bit as you would expect that it would.","Additionally we are expanding Steve mentioned in his remarks that will be opening up operations in the greater New York City area in the September introducing our high net worth approach and will be consistent with the way we've done things historically throughout the country. We\u2019re only going to point a few agencies our aim will be to earn a portion of their business that would be significant enough that we deem it to be successful in that area.","We are pleased, not unlike Cincinnati Re, we are very pleased with the work that Will Van Den Heuvel is doing to introduce us to that great appetite and he\u2019s brought along a lot of very talented people that will enable us not only in New York, but across the country do a better job in high net worth area.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. Along those lines, the comment about you are talking larger personal lines accounts, is that just - is that high net worth customers, or is that bundling, or a combination?","J.F. Scherer","No not necessarily any bundling as a company we always would write package if you will the auto, the umbrella, the homeowners so that\u2019s no different there we really don't write monoline business but when we talk about larger customers we\u2019re talking about a high net worth.","Scott Heleniak","Okay, in the personal lines. All right.","J.F. Scherer","Yes, in the personal lines.","Scott Heleniak","Right, okay. And then the only other question I had was there's been an uptick in the realized gains this year. I guess over $100 million or so. So could you talk about some of the areas you're reducing exposure? Is any of that just portfolio repositioning ahead of what might happen with the Fed next? Just any thoughts on that?","Marty Hollenbeck","This is Marty Hollenbeck. Not really it\u2019s more we manage - we are generally buy and hold. But in the equity portfolio we do on occasion reconfigure that\u2019s primary driver of that we sold a few positions, awaiting deployment on some of it. But it doesn\u2019t represent any kind of real strategic change.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There no further questions of this time Mr. Johnston I turn the call back to you.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1, 2013 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. You may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Late yesterday we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor website, www.cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer, JF Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen.","Please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements may involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and our various filings with the SEC.","Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. We\u2019re very pleased with our strong operating results for the quarter. They continue to reflect the steadily growing benefits and initiatives designed to improve insurance profitability to drive premium growth in creating shareholder value overtime. The continuing improvements resulted in a 91.2% combined ratio and 15% growth in net written premiums. Catastrophe losses contributed just 1.2 loss ratio points down from the 11.1 points in the same quarter a year ago. The favorable trend in exercise-catastrophe current accident year result continued. The ex-cat current accident year combined ratio for the first quarter was 90.3% reflecting a 9.4 point improvement over the first quarter a year ago. A 6.5 point improvement over the full accident year 2012 and it was 2.9 points better than the second half of 2012. Loss and loss expense reserves for all prior accident years in aggregate developed favorably during the first quarter of 2013 benefiting the combined ratio by 1.1 points. The comparable number a year ago was 14.5 points.","While that\u2019s quite a change in the amount of benefit we follow a well-defined and consistent process every quarter with just a few weeks passing since our year-end analysis of accident years 2012 and prior. Our estimate for those years in total did not change much resulting in the lower than usual 1.1 point favorable development in the quarter.","Net reserve development for our personal auto, commercial auto and surety and executive risk lines of business was unfavorable. We will continue to keep a close watch on those lines. Those same three lines contributed to net unfavorable development on an all-lines basis for accident year 2012. Accident year\u2019s 2011 and 2010 developed favorably as did all older accident years.","The higher reserve estimates in total were primarily for losses incurred but not reported or IBNR as the consolidated property casualty ratio for prior accident years case reserve development was the same this quarter as the first quarter of 2012. During the past 12 months we have observed a turning a point in terms of performance by accident year separate from catastrophe loss trends. Accident years 2012 with a combined ratio of a four catastrophes of 96.8% started an improving trend that has continued into 2013. When more time is passed and more information is available we can verify any improvement and incorporate that into our future estimates or reserves. While net favorable development on prior accident years is lower this quarter we remain confident in the process, and confident in the reserve position that continues to be well into the upper half of the actual range of estimates.","Turning to premium growth, each of our property casualty segments continue to increase at a steady pace again benefiting from greater pricing precision and higher overall pricing. Renewal price increases remained ahead of expected loss cost trends and each of those segments. Commercial policies that were renewed during the first quarter continued to average price increases in the mid-single digit range. Though moved into the higher end of that range since the fourth quarter.","Increase on our smaller commercial property policies remained in the low double digit range. Our excess and surplus line segment experienced higher renewal prices for the 31st consecutive month reaching the low double digit range. (Inaudible) our personalized segment that renewed in the first quarter averaged a price increase in the mid-single digit range with home owner\u2019s policies continuing in the high single digit range. New business written premiums for the first quarter continued to show strong growth for both our commercial and personalized segments reflecting higher pricing in accumulative effect of growth initiatives including new agency appointments.","Our pricing analytics and modeling tools once again indicated that our new business pricing is adequate providing confidence to compete for good accounts and to avoid the under-priced ones. For our commercial line segment, policies with annual premiums of $50,000 or higher represented just over half of the 22 million first quarter increase in new business written premiums. Given recent quarter growth in larger commercial policies. We have reviewed results by policy size and continue to find no correlation to large losses. We drew a similar conclusion when studying large losses compared to length of time and agency has been appointed to represent us.","We believe the larger accounts we wrote resulted from our efforts to increase loss control services and client specialization making Cincinnati a more attractive market for agencies mark-key accounts.","Our life insurance business continued to grow with first quarter term life earn (ph) premiums rising by 7% as operating profit more than doubled the result for last year\u2019s first quarter well a onetime adjustment lower 2012 profit. The first quarter of 2013 also benefited from more favorable reserves for life insurance policy benefits. We continue to emphasize growing premiums only when we believe we can (inaudible) profitably and we\u2019re encouraged by our progress so far.","We also remain well positioned to continued growing earnings, dividends and book value per share adding value for shareholders over time. The first quarter produced a satisfactory level of investment income given the head wind caused by low interest rates. Our primary financial performance measure, the value creation ratio was also excellent and was up compared with the first quarter of 2012. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to discuss that further along with other financial terms.","Mike Sewell","","Thank you Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2013 value creation ratio was 7.0% including a 5.8% contribution from the change in book value per share plus 1.2% from our dividend to shareholders and was well ahead of last year\u2019s first quarter. The dividend payout ratio for the first quarter was below 50% and was 15 percentage points less than the full year annual average since 2002. The stock portfolio grew during the first quarter with pretax net unrealized gains up $381 million to $1.4 billion. This quarter end fair value represented 29% of invested assets. The bond portfolios pretax unrealized gains declined $25 million during the quarter. Our company continues to benefit from its equity investing strategy during periods when investment income is pressured by the low interest rate environment.","Dividend income was up 4% for the quarter despite accelerated dividends received in the fourth quarter of last year that we normally would have received in the first quarter. Of the 50 companies we held in our core common stock portfolio at March 31, 2013 46 have increased their dividend rate in the past 12 months, we also continue to invest new money in that portfolio helping to offset declining bond portfolio yields. Yields for our bond portfolio continue to move lower as its first quarter 2013 pretax yield of 4.93% fell 27 basis points from a year ago that contributed to a 4% first quarter decline in interest income.","Our bond portfolios effective duration measured 4.2 years at the end of the quarter unchanged from the end of last year. Cash flow from operating activities continues to benefit investment income and contributed to a $102 million in net purchases of securities during the quarter. Compared to a year ago first quarter consolidated net operating cash flow was lower mainly due to higher payments for income taxes and profit sharing with agencies.","Careful management of expenses continues to be a priority, our first quarter property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose 0.6 percentage points primarily due to higher commissions to agents. Our financial strength and liquidity remained at healthy levels. We had over 1.3 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level up 14% from the end of last year. Our premiums to surplus ratio remained at 0.9 to 1 a reflection of our capacity to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments in addition to capacity for other capital needs. I will conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share.","Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.31, life insurance operations added $0.08, investment income other than life insurance was reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.38. The change in unrealized gains of March 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses lower book value per share by $0.09. The change in unrealized gains at March 31, for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses boasted book value by $1.66 and we paid 40 and three quarter cents per share in dividends to shareholders.","The net effect was a book value increase of $1.93 during the first quarter to $35.41 per share. With that I will turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. The moment we\u2019re building is encouraging and our progress is being recognized. Forbes recently issued this list of America\u2019s most trustworthy companies where we\u2019re again the top performing large cap insurance company. The year ahead of us still has plenty of challenges. We will continually seek to improve our performance while fulfilling our insurance promises to policy holders and providing outstanding service to agents. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you through the year. As a remainder with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff Jr.; Ken Stecher; JF Scherer; Eric Matthews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck. Brad we\u2019re ready to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Vincent D'Agostino of KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent D'Agostino \u2013 KBW","","Just I would like to first start with acknowledging what you guys have accomplished just because it's been quite a week over the last few years and then secondly I would just like to preamp my questions with saying that it's on our side unfortunately tend to overly focus on some of the negatives on these calls and our questions which doesn\u2019t really often reflect our optimism. So in that way don\u2019t want to come across as being too critical but I would just like to spend a moment on the reserve development in the quarter specifically the comment in the press release on the IBNR reserves and just from my side when going through the scheduled (inaudible) share on some of the lines. I thought I could easily justify the lower carried IBNR reserves on accident year 2012 just understanding that in a lot of these lines workers comp a really good example where you have pulled forward a claims reporting and have done an excellent job on managing the loss cost side. Of all things in my opinion that would allow you to carry a little less IBNR reserves, so is there anything that has emerged that would maybe change your thinking in terms of some of the progress that you have made and just how that impacts your estimates on the IBNR side?","Steve Johnston","Good question and we really appreciate and respect your balance Vincent. There really hasn\u2019t been a change, I think that we\u2019re very consistent in our process and I might just kind of start at the beginning on these sort of things and I know you\u2019re expert in this and so I just want to make sure that I cover this fully as I can and I know I\u2019m not telling you anything that you don\u2019t already know but just to kind of put a framework around our discussion we do have a consistent process where our actuary makes an estimate of the accident years losses for each line and then these estimates are used to calculate the best estimate of IBNR and for this quarter and really for every quarter as I can remember management then adopts actual best estimate.","So when we show a 1.1 favorable development during the first quarter overall that just means that our estimate of accident years 2012 and prior didn\u2019t change much during the quarter and I think where you\u2019re coming from that is different than the first quarter a year ago but I think it's very explainable and it's very much indicative of us as a company that prides ourselves on maintaining a strong and conservatively state of balance sheet. We consider a lot of factors when we\u2019re saying reserves including that are growing at a strong pace that our result have turned as you mentioned and that our accident year loss ratios are improving in a strong fashion. So we look at all these information and we just think it's prudent that the best estimate for accident year 2012 and prior did not change much in the short period of time from then they will review at your end.","And to be clear and I think answer to your question, it doesn\u2019t mean that we think reserves weakened during the quarter. In fact on the contrary we\u2019re confident that reserves remain low into the upper half of the actual range. To better that position when we compare the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2012, the emergence of case incurred (ph) for prior accident years was the same. Virtually the entire amount of the change was due to change in IBNR released on prior accident years. Just to summarize and I think that we maintain the consistent process that was a big difference from the first quarter year ago to this quarter but I think it's indicative of us in terms of prudent reserve setting and I think we\u2019re reflecting the progress as you mentioned that we\u2019re making in a lot of areas in terms of our pricing and our underwriting.","Vincent D'Agostino \u2013 KBW","That\u2019s really helpful again from our side your track record is virtually unparalleled. So really good color, As far as just because the time of the year that as you guys go through and meet with a lot of agents with the point of sales meeting that you do. I\u2019m always curious. I usually get to go to one or so but as you go through these, is there anything that you\u2019re hearing that it's a bit of surprise or just really any good feedback that you might be getting some agents that you\u2019re thinking about implementing?","JF Scherer","I would say nothing surprising coming from agencies, I think we\u2019re always anxious to hear about pricing and how agencies feel about the industry overall, industry and their agency if you will and how comfortable they feel we\u2019re delivering rate increases and we upto this point we have four more meetings to go of the 19 we have attended, it's been consistent that they are comfortable with the approach we\u2019re taking that rates are up and pricing is up. A lot of discussions about particularly in win proven areas about the use of higher deductibles, percentage deductibles, wind and hail deductibles or something that we\u2019re focusing on a lot and there is a generally consistent comment from everyone that we\u2019re going to be able to implement some of those initiatives. So I wouldn\u2019t say that there has been anything at all surprising this spring that relative to the types of things we have talked about on previous calls and what is in general happening in the marketplace.","Vincent D'Agostino \u2013 KBW","Okay perfect and then one last one if I can seek it in, just on auto premiums from accounting standpoint. When you have a dollar of auto premium come in is there a corresponding incurred losses that or because of the way that you do your reserving. Have you already necessarily booked the incurred loss regardless of the auto premiums coming in and so would it end up just falling all to the bottom-line as far as audit premium tail winds?","Mike Sewell","That would basically fall to the bottom-line because we have already incurred the losses. So that has been a very positive for us over the last so many quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","","First I was curious your goal to the expense ratio is 30%, I was curious if that\u2019s what the time frame is around that goal, I was curious is the driver to that 30% largely premium growth leverage?","Mike Sewell","And part of that is premium growth leverage, you\u2019re exactly right. As we grow the top-line there that will have a natural effect to bring down the expense ratio. We\u2019re controlling expenses, one of the I can say the problems that we have but as we have more income, more profitable a lower combined ratio the offsetting effect of that is that our profit sharing for the agents tends to go up and so that works against us. So the commission side is a very large item and that\u2019s really what affected the increase for the current year. We do have a lot of initiatives are going on that are also helping to reduce our loss and expense ratio. So we\u2019re controlling those, we watch them we have got an expense committee, a head count committee and we\u2019re committed to drive it down to the 30 but it's a good problem to have with the profit sharing to the agents.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Secondly clearly a really great combined ratio on an accident year, ex-cat basis I was curious if there was a non-cat weather benefit versus maybe what you call \u201cnormal\u201d or versus last year 1Q. A number of peers are larger insurers have cited the benefit this quarter so far of their earning season, thanks.","Steve Johnston","We don\u2019t track that for all lines. I mean we could track it for certain personalized and so forth. I do think though to your point that it's just kind of natural that when we do have high catastrophe losses what we will have more what you call non-cat weather it's just because there are losses in the region that may not fall into that particular cat but their weather losses nonetheless. So I would think this is more of an opinion than something I can back-up with a fact because we don\u2019t keep up for all lines but I do think that there would be a benefit because we had lower cats that would naturally fall, that they would be less non-cat weather as well.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Yeah that makes sense, so probably a correlation between the cat level and non-cat weather. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ray Iardella of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Chris Maimone - Macquarie","This is actually Chris Maimone calling for Ray, thanks for taking the question. I just couple of quick ones. I was wondering if you could just comment on what you guys have been seeing that\u2019s being driving the E&S pricing since we last heard from you guys, just generally as far as any incremental negatives that might be behind the slowdown in pricing there.","Steve Johnston","First of all on our renewals for our E&S business we have had 31 consecutive months now where we have great increases and they have actually risen for us. So relative to our book of business the business that\u2019s renewing we\u2019re continuing to get strong pricing increases. One thing that we\u2019re seeing and in particular on larger E&S accounts is that there has been a fair number of standard market carriers that have taken business out of the E&S side for us. So it's I guess somewhat of surprising circumstance but I say in terms of how we size up how things are being going on E&S side. Good progress on renewals, still some competition relative to some larger accounts are being taken out of the E&S market.","The model for us continues to work nicely. We\u2019re still having good experience working with our agencies and writing more E&S business from them so we still feel very good about how things are going for us.","Chris Maimone - Macquarie","Great thanks for that and then just one follow-up I was wondering if you could just run me through with little more detail on what was behind the life insurance benefit this quarter?","Mike Sewell","What we had there is on some of the smaller lines there we were refining a little bit of the reserving process between gap and stock reserves and so that was under a $4 million effect on the total net income. So it was a minor item but it was a refinement of our reserves.","Chris Maimone - Macquarie","Okay that\u2019s just going to be one time refinement or is there sort of huge?","Mike Sewell","I would put as a one time, there may be smaller ones in the future but if you were to adjust let\u2019s say that refinement out of 2013 and out of 2012 first quarter and then kind of come to maybe what I will call it core adjusted. We would end up actually with about a 24.4% increase in net income when you adjust those out so that might help you out go from call it may be 7.8 million to 9.7 million for the current quarter. So hopefully that would help you in your analysis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","","I was just wondering if you can talk about the new business growth, you mentioned more of the half of the accounts are from have more than 50,000 in premium. Was that part of the strategy when you pointed all the new agents over the past few years, was the intention to get more large account business or is that the way the mix just kind of happen. Did you get more of that from your existing agency based, just wondering if you can give more detail on that.","Mike Sewell ","I don\u2019t think half of our new business is coming from $50,000 premium, half of the increase comes from the larger accounts but as far as the strategy is concerned no we haven't appointed agencies with the idea of writing larger accounts. The strategy continues to be the same, we expect as a company to write by our definitions continue to write small to mid-size accounts. Our definition of medium would be from 10,000 to 150,000 or there about. We write our share of larger accounts, large and larger for us I would call perhaps in the $50,000 range and higher. One thing that we have done though and Steve referred to in his remarks was that we have progressed quite a bit in the lost control area; we have also done a much better job in claim specialization. Consequently agencies had greater confidence in us to write these larger accounts. They are still on awful lot of accounts out in the marketplace right now being shopped. Many carriers continue to describe very publically that they are going to get substantial rate increases on their renewals that provokes agencies to shop their accounts to protect themselves, I think we have done a good job of reinforcing to our agencies that we\u2019re a consistent market and that in addition to rate claim service and loss control our pricing is consistent. So it hasn\u2019t been a specific strategy to increase larger accounts, it's just evolved to that.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay that\u2019s helpful and then could you give a little bit more detail just on the large claims that you had the ones were, they were 4 million is that just, those are in the three areas that you talked about where I guess you strengthened the reserves in the quarter. Is there anything (inaudible) in that? Was there any other areas besides that or? If you can give any detail on that.","Mike Sewell","I can give a start and maybe Marty can follow-up. You want to give this?","Marty Mullen","","Sure the majority of the large claims over 4 were in those lines mentioned assuring executive risk played a big piece of that more so in the area of the FI accounts, some 2000 in those areas that mainly was the main driver of those 4 million increase reserves.","Steve Johnston","So I will just tag on this, it is consistent with the question that you\u2019re asking. We agree.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay and then the only question I have was just on pricing in April you said was up toward the higher end of the mid-single digit range and are you saying that pretty broadly in other words is pricing the price increases that you\u2019re seeing in April is a little bit bigger than you were seeing at the end of or the beginning of the quarter?","JF Scherer","We have really consistent pricing for example in the commercial fire area we were in the low end of the double digit increases on our small to medium size accounts in the fourth quarter of last year, it's been sustained this year as well. And pretty level net rate changes and casualty and auto as well. So we haven\u2019t seen a change up or down, it's been very consistent trending a little up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital. Your line is open.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","","So I guess I will add a couple of specific questions on reserves but I guess if I can ask a big picture one first and I admit I\u2019m grasping (inaudible) here but just want to make sure there is not a relationship here. On taking sort of two unrelated statements and trying to tie together possibly. One is that you have seen a very good growth from agents appointed since the beginning of 2012 and then you have seen average development on 2012 and it makes me wonders or maybe some kind of tide or maybe the agents that you have added have produced worst business than agency you have added in prior years?","Steve Johnston","I will go ahead and take the first shot at that Ian, the short answer is no and we have studied that. We feel that the production of the new agents is of high quality and in particular of our new business whether it's coming from more recently appointed agents or more mature agents. We feel that the new business premium that we\u2019re getting is adequately priced in we\u2019re confident that throughout the various appointment periods.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Then just couple of the detailed ones and I know it's hard to sometimes draw chances you have lot of quarter-to-quarter volatility in your lines of business but for example I\u2019m looking at commercial auto which has been showing average sale and for a few quarters now and the accident year throughout the last fourth quarters prior was averaging at low 70s and this quarter it dropped to 60. So I\u2019m kind of wondering if you\u2019re seeing adverse trends or why do we see such an improvement in the accident year.","Steve Johnston","Well that\u2019s a good question and that is one that we specifically study so it's very insightful. As we look at what we\u2019re getting in price versus what we see in the lost trends, we have seen a favorable trend there where we feel we\u2019re getting rates over and above lost cost trend which I think supports the decreasing trend. I think as we do look back at the prior year\u2019s we\u2019re taking I think a prudent view of particularly given the growth, given this as your point out that there is a turning point and with consistent improvement in the results I think we\u2019re being prudent to not release the IBNR on the prior year\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re seeing in our accident year picks.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","But is that translating how is that translating into how you set the pick? I guess and this is oversimplifying but I guess I would have thought if you feel a less comfortable with the IBNR from the prior year\u2019s then maybe put up a little bit of extra IBNR cushion in the current year.","Steve Johnston","That\u2019s a great point in one we debate but I think the overwriting factor is what we see in terms of the improvement, in terms of the price versus what we\u2019re doing and the underwriting loss control all the other elements we think it justifies the pick that we have for the current accident year.","And that\u2019s the overwriting factor there.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","I just had a couple on personalize. I might have missed this going a little fast for me, did you say specifically on the personal auto what drove the adverse was that the same trends or was it just something changing in severity or loss trends or something?","Steve Johnston","It's the same overall trend and I do think we had a little bit higher in terms of large losses. I think that it's a severity or something that we\u2019re keeping a close eye on there and I do think, I made the statement that overall our case incurred emergence in the first quarter was very much equal to first quarter year ago, I think personal auto might have been one exception there where we did see a bit more emergence this first quarter than we had seen the first quarter of 2012. So we\u2019re kind of reflecting that as well.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","And then my last one, I promise on home owners obviously you\u2019re taking a lot of rate there, things are getting better, there is sort of time back to I think was (inaudible) question but non-cat weather. When I\u2019m looking at the accident year before cat of a 40 the prior four quarters are between 50 and 80 so I assume a fair chunk of that is the real improvement from the pricing underwriting actions you have taken but I assume some of its non-cat as well. I mean is there any way to sort of get a sense for maybe just what a normal target is for home owners. I mean is your goal to be able to have a 40 ex-cat loss ratio or was that really just kind of an outlier number?","Steve Johnston","I think your question is very intuitive, very spot on and we have been seen the improvement in the price, we do think that the losses have been benefited from some of the action we\u2019re taking. We do see, we think favorable movement in terms of the non-cat weather and we do, we built 26 points of catastrophe, expected catastrophe losses into our home owners pricing. So, we\u2019re shooting for pretty low ex-cat loss ratios.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Vincent D'Agostino of KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","","I just had two quick ones, you have talked a little bit more about enhanced property inspections lately and I was just curious how the retention for policy is going through that process or kind of playing out just because in the aggregate it doesn\u2019t really seem to be a drain which would imply that you\u2019re getting the rate and you have to push through the terms and conditions as you kind of won on those policies which would be good, you know or if they, you obviously didn\u2019t retain them that would also be a margin enhancing so just curious of any thoughts on how that\u2019s trending.","JF Scherer","","We\u2019re not renewing a huge percentage of that business. I think and I don\u2019t have the exact numbers with me but I think something into the turnaround 6% of the property we think has been inspected on home owner side. We have non-renewed gotten rid of them in some fashion and awful lot of what we find our things where we have increased the premium because the policy wasn\u2019t rated correctly it wasn\u2019t in the right protection class. There might have been for example in personal lines it would burn in stove (ph) for which we have a surcharge, a variety of different ways that premium has been increased which improves the margins but even at 6% I think that\u2019s a reassuring amount of that we\u2019re finding properties that have deteriorating since we first wrote them and we\u2019re going to be getting off of them.","Another area of inspection that has paid off has been in terms of rough conditions where we discover in some cases dwells in that (inaudible) is much older than we anticipated. We\u2019re using an actual cash value endorsement for example and those houses that we would choose to stay on are in poor condition. So we\u2019re at really attacking it from a whole variety of directions on the inspection initiatives feeling very good about the return we\u2019re getting.","Vincent D'Agostino - KBW","And then just one last the agency appointments were pretty strong and it's about 50% of your full year target which is a little bit ahead of kind of the first quarter waiting that we had seen last year. Is it possible that we might see appointments getting closer to maybe 80s and 65s?","JF Scherer","At this point I don\u2019t necessarily think so. One of the things that we feel better about I think a little more encouraged about is that we\u2019re coming off a couple of years a pretty strong agency appointments. We have talked to all of our agencies throughout the country about the aspirations we have to grow premiums in their areas. In more cases than perhaps we would have planned for our current agency force is responding a bit better, the alternative being that we would point another agency and their general community and they prefer us not to do that. So right now I don\u2019t believe that we would go much higher than the 65, I think we\u2019re getting obviously good new business out of our agency force in general. And so I think I still plan on 65.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mr. Johnston.","Steve Johnston","Thank you very much Brad and thanks all of you for joining us today.

Scherer - Chief Insurance Officer","Analysts","Arash Soleimani - KBW","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Operator","Good morning. My name is Emily and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. You may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Late yesterday we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents please visit our Investor Web site cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is a quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you will first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer, and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating in the call may ask questions. At that time some responses may be made by others in the room with us including Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenback; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer. Also Chief Claims Officer Marty Mullen and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Teresa Hopper.","First please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and for our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore has not reconciled the GAAP.","And now, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning. And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Net income for the second quarter of 2018 more than doubled the same period a year ago. While this year's new accounting requirement for changes in the fair value of equity securities represented a large portion of the increase operating income which is independent of that change also rose significantly up 24%.","Our 97.2% property, casualty combined ratio for the second quarter of this year was 1.1 points better than a year ago and reflected benefits of diversifying our business in recent years. Our commercial lines segment experienced a combined ratio below 95%. Our excess and surplus lines segment and Cincinnati Re had excellent results each with the second quarter 2018 combined ratio below 80%.","Our life insurance subsidiary also had an excellent quarter reporting a 42% increase in net income or 31% on an operating income basis. Our personal line segment reported a down quarter reflecting reserve increases in part due to a 53% year-to-date increase and large losses of $1 million or more per claim.","Our all lines accident year 2018 combined ratio before catastrophe losses is roughly 2 points higher than accident year 2017 both measured as of June 30 of the respective accident year. However, on a paid basis, the ratio is nearly the same for each of those two periods.","Despite that fairly stable level of paid amounts experienced by each of our major lines of business management's best estimate of ultimate loss and loss expense ratios and related reserves maintains a prudent amount of IBNR including elevated levels for two lines in particular, homeowner and commercial casualty. As more data becomes available, we'll just estimates for reserves up or down as appropriate.","One of the benefits of stable paid ratios as we profitably grow our insurance business is that it increases the float helping to fuel cash flow for our investment portfolio. Mike will elaborate on that in a moment.","Consolidated premium growth was much better in the second quarter of 2018 than it was in the first quarter. Our commercial line segment rebounded from a 1% decrease in that written premiums to a 5% growth in the second quarter 2018. Each of our other insurance segments experienced second quarter premium growth ranging from 5% to 7%. Importantly our internal reports and observations suggest that this growth is healthy. Our underwriters continue to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on businesses where our models and judgment indicate it's needed. Segmenting our portfolio of accounts through careful underwriting of risks covered by individual policies.","Average pricing remained mostly steady including overall commercial lines estimated average price increases similar to the first quarter with commercial auto remaining in the high single digit range. Estimated average premium rate changes for personal lines in total and for both personal auto and home homeowner were somewhat higher than the first quarter of 2018. With personal auto average rate increases near the high-end of the high single digit range.","As we reported in our 10-Q effective July 1, we added a new component of reinsurance protection from catastrophe losses with an excess of loss treaty providing coverage for up to $50 million in aggregate. It includes coverage of $50 million in excess of $125 million dollars per occurrence for combinations of business written on a direct basis and by Cincinnati Re and $25 million in excess of $32 million for catastrophe events affecting only Cincinnati Re.","It also provides additional coverage for earthquakes, brush fires or wildfires in certain Western states after a per event loss retention of $10 million. Our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio was 1.6% for the second quarter of 2018. The component of net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.7 percentage points, an improvement of 0.2 points versus a year ago and investment gains in our equity portfolio contributed 1.0 percentage points enough to offset a negative 0.8 contribution from the fixed maturity portfolio.","We were pleased to see a partial recovery evaluation in our equity portfolio following the downturn experienced in the first quarter of the year. We'll continue to place much of our focus on the profitable growth of our insurance business. That focus has served us well in the past and will help us create shareholder value over time.","Next our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will provide insights on a few other important elements of our financial performance and financial condition.","Mike Sewell","Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today.","Second Quarter 2013 was our 20th consecutive quarter of investment income growth up 2% including 5% for dividend income. As we reported, overall investment gains for the second quarter were favorable at $25 million before tax effects that included a $105 million increase in our equity portfolio partially offset by $78 million decrease from our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with a net appreciated value of nearly $3.1 billion including $84 million in our bond portfolio.","As we highlighted last quarter, new accounting standards required that in 2018 and future years, changes in fair value of equity securities will be reported as part of net income instead of other comprehensive income. And we noted that our value creation ratio was unchanged by the new accounting.","The second quarter 2018 net income effect of fair value changes of equity securities, we still loan was a favorable $80 million a sharp reversal of the unfavorable $156 million we experienced in the first quarter of 2013.","Drilling down a little more on interest income from our bond portfolio, the pre-tax average yield was 4.28% for the second quarter of 2018 down 14 basis points from last year's second quarter as many of our higher yielding bonds continue to be called or redeemed as a reach their maturity date.","Second quarter 2018 interest income grew 1% in part due to $226 million in net purchases of bonds in the first six months of this year. Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter 2018 had an average pre-tax yield of 4.68%, 93 basis points higher than we purchased for last year's second quarter. Tax exempt bonds purchased just average 3.72% up 39 basis points from a year ago.","Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first six months of 2018 totaled $464 million up $19 million or 4% for the same period a year ago.","Turning to underwriting expense ratio, careful management of expenses continues to be a priority as is investing strategically in our business. Our second quarter 2018 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 0.5 percentage points versus the second quarter of 2017.","Regarding loss reserves, our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Second quarter 2018 favorable reserve development benefit our combined ratio by 2.6 percentage points and the six month 2018 benefit of 3.3% match the same period last year.","Our commercial casualty line of business experienced $14 million of favorable reserve development. Most of our major lines of business have experience favorable reserve development in the first six months of 2018. On an all lives basis by accident year, it included 38% for accident year 2017, 15% for accident year 2016 and 47% for 2015 and prior accident years.","In terms of capital management during the second quarter we repurchased nearly 1.6 million shares at an average price per share of $70.57 related to that and opportunities to modestly grow our commercial leasing and financing subsidiary, we used a small portion of capacity available from our $225 million line of credit. Our financial strength and financial flexibility remain excellent.","As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.17. Life insurance operations added $0.10, investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.39. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.38; net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.51; and we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.26 during the second quarter to $48.68 per share.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike.","We are encouraged by our second quarter results as we see several positive trends that are building momentum. While there is still work to be done we have confidence in the future because of the outstanding independent agencies that represent our insurance companies and because of our capable dedicated associates who deliver excellent service daily to our agents and their clients.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder with Mike and me today are Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Marty Mullin, Marty Hollenback and Teresa Hopper. Emily please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Arash Soleimani","Thank you. So first question I had was on the workers comp side, I saw that the growth there was negative the last few quarters, but it was positive this quarter. So just wanted to see if that's something that we should expect going forward. And what drove the growth there?","J.F. Scherer","Hi, Arash. This is JF. We're experiencing what a lot of carriers are experiencing the net rate decreases have moderated our growth. We're not as we've said in the past, we're not an aggressive writer work comp -- it comes along with the package business that we've gotten. We simply experienced some good new business growth overall in our commercial line segment and the workers comp came along with it.","So we were pleased by that. We're not afraid of comp, but I don't think you'll see anything drastically different moving forward.","Arash Soleimani","And is it fair to expect that the core loss ratios there to continue being elevated year-over-year just given the pricing environment in that line of business?","J.F. Scherer","Yes. It's tough to keep up within that rate decreases that we're seeing there. On the other hand, I think we continue to see improvements on our lost cost from the initiatives we have in the claims area as well as loss control.","So we're comfortable with how we're doing in comps, it's actually doing fairly well for us. So we're pleased with the outcome.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. And on the commercial casualty side, it look like the core loss ratio there was better than it's been the last two quarters and you have favorable development this quarter as well. So is that just simply a factor of the initiatives you've been taking on the underwriting side bearing fruit and should we continue to see that type of sequential improvement.","J.F. Scherer","Yes. We're pretty pleased with how things are going on the commercial casualty. The loss activity we've seen has been a bit more in the umbrella area, some large claims most of those claims have been associated with commercial auto. So what we're spending a lot of time doing in addition to increasing rates on the commercial auto line itself is being a lot more careful about the underwriting side of things relative to scrutiny of drivers more loss control activity in the commercial auto area. And we think that that will pay off over time.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. Just last question you mentioned in the prepared remarks but on the homeowner side, can you just go into a bit more detail about the trends there and what drove the core loss ratio and the reserve development?","J.F. Scherer","Well, once again in homeowners severity is the issue there. We've just seen an increase in the dollar value of the $1 million and higher claims that we have. We've taken a look at all of the claims that have occurred, review them, done post-mortem on all of it. There's a lot of variability in these large claims. So for example in looking back in full year 2015 million dollar plus claims doubled over '14 and then '16 was down 73%. So as we take a look at what's going on there, I would say first of all quite pleased with the initiatives we've got going in homeowners our entry into high net worth, the severity of the claims that we're seeing doesn't -- that doesn't worry us. We've just experienced a little elevated levels of that here of late.","But all in all looking forward we're pleased with how things are going we think all the initiatives including rate increases and better inspection protocols will continue to pay off for us.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. And when you say the $1 million plus -- are these claims on the high net worth side then and if so can you just maybe briefly talk about the profitability of the high net worth book versus the standard homeowner's book?","J.F. Scherer","When we talk about it. It's on both sides of it. And we have seen overall some elevated high net worth claims and most of these are fire losses by the way. But we're writing more high net worth and the homes are more valuable. But for example in the first quarter of the year, we had an increase of $12 million in these large claims and only 20% were from high net worth. So once again, these are highly variable. What we're seeing on the high net worth side in terms of -- in particular of the new high net worth business for writing in some of the newer states is progressing as we would have hoped to do.","So no alarm bells are ringing here relative to what's going on there. We are seeing some variability and we're monitoring that as it goes on. As a result of it though we'll take a prudent approach in terms of how we're reserving, so the losses occur as you would expect out of us, we're very prudent and conservative about how we are reserving. We will continue to do that and then we'll see how things play out.","Arash Soleimani","And what's the premiums in force currently for high net worth?","Steve Johnston","On the homeowner side, its direct written premium through 6 months is about 83 million.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. Great. Thank you for the answers.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Scott.","Operator","Mr. Heleniak, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Scott Heleniak","Oh, sorry about that. Good morning everyone.","Steve Johnston","Good morning.","Scott Heleniak","Just a quick question first on capital management. So you guys had some buybacks in the quarter you do those from time to time. Can we expect to see those more frequently. I know that's obviously depending on what happens with the stock, but how are you looking at those now versus in the past and how you weigh that up with uses of capital including special dividends over time?","Mike Sewell","Hey, great. This is Mike. Doing the buybacks it's a form of returning capital back to shareholders. Yes, with what we've done so far in 2018, it's a little less than 1.8 million shares. If I look back a couple of years in 2017 we did about 1 -- as we did 1.3 million shares, a year before that a little under 600, year before that there was a million. So we've been saying that we've been doing kind of maintenance which runs around say a million shares a year. And so far this year it's a little bit elevated not by a whole lot. And so it's really something we think about when we look at the time it depends on the circumstances, we've got the discretion and really being opportunistic about it when we look at the -- what those sale price or the price of the shares currently are. So on average it's been about a million-ish -- million shares a year and we'll just keep our eye on it and we'll take advantages when the price tells us to take advantage of it.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And any thoughts on how you weigh that versus special dividends which you've done from time to time. Is there any underlying factor behind that as to -- when you declare those?","Mike Sewell","That's -- there's a couple of -- those two uses right there of using our capital, there's five uses. But the two of them you just hit on was dividends and buybacks. So the dividends we obviously we think about that every quarter. It's a board decision. So we talk about at the board -- the board kicks around the -- has been a special dividend to the last three years. And we do say that it's called a special dividend for a reason, it's special but it's actually actively discussed at the Board meetings and it's circumstances again based on how the company is doing and where we think we're headed.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. That's fair enough. Then I had a question two on personalized pricing, I think you mentioned that improved Q2 versus Q1. I wanted to see if that was both on the homeowners and the auto side. And is your outlook that that will accelerate further in the second half of the year. Because it depends on the company but some companies are actually talking about rates decelerating for them and you guys -- sounds like you guys are seeing the opposite a little bit.","Mike Sewell","As far as our rate increases are concerned, we would anticipate that the increases that we've been talking about will continue on both in home and auto and for that matter in commercial auto as well. Commercial auto is at the upper end of the single-digit range and that's in the second quarter that's on top of a similar type of a rate increase of the second quarter last year. So we're pretty comfortable with our strategy and rate increases. They're sticking our retention is -- continues to be in the areas that we wanted to be in. So we're pleased with the strategy there.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And then, it's my last question -- was just on the expense ratio improvement for the quarter. I know that Q1 was you had the impact of the higher deferred acquisition costs and I think you mentioned that you thought the expense ratio would come from around the low 30s ones. It was a little bit better this quarter. So wondering if you have any comment on where that might be tracking for the rest of the year.","Mike Sewell","No. You're exactly right. I did make that comment in the first quarter that we thought it would be pretty close to a 31.1, which is where we ended up 2017. That's still we typically don't give a lot of guidance but I think that's probably fair if you -- you're building out your models this quarter being a little bit say lower at 30.5. There's some timing of when we spend things we're continuing to invest a lot of things going on in IT, innovation, predictive modeling. And so I could see it still being around that maybe a little bit lower, but I would not take 30.5 as an indication that the next two quarters will be the same.","Scott Heleniak","All right. Fair enough. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Mike Sewell","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Zaremski","Hi, good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Zaremski","Regarding the reinsurance program you spoke to and I haven't gone to the 10-Q yet so maybe there's info there. But I'm sure -- how should we be thinking about that impacting the income statement if you do think it has a kind of material impact in the near term?","Steve Johnston","Yes. Thinking around that was we've got two relatively new businesses that we're ramping up with Cincinnati Re in our high net worth home. We're very confident in the management of both of those enterprises. But as you grow a business the premium volume is growing. It starts out smaller which leads to some variability in results. We've been very happy with both of those organizations. Those we were looking at it -- starting out with Cincinnati Re. And we have disclosed this I think well in our 10-K and so forth. You could have an event where the two combine for more than $100 million. And we've been writing Cincinnati Re in a very diversified fashion in terms of cat losses with the Cincinnati standard. But in the lower return periods you could have a combination of the two starting to add up. And the kind of came to light as we looked at the hurricanes last year really there was nothing that jumped out at us in terms of behavior there that was unexpected. We were quite happy with the way it worked out. For example with Aroma, the 10-K we had a $52 million loss, $33 million of it coming from the standard CIC Cincinnati Insurance, $19 million from Cincinnati Re.","But as we do our modeling, we could see and this again is in the 10-K on Page 31, the one in 100 year event for the combined of the two would be $173 million with Cincinnati Re having a marginal contribution of $77 million. If we move out to the 1 in 250 year event, the combined goes up to $413 million, the marginal contribution from Cincinnati Re only goes up to $80 million showing the diversifying effect. But in those lower return periods you could see the numbers starting to add up. So we thought an aggregate cover would be beneficial. And so we bought part A of this $50 million aggregate with the $50 million excess of 125 for the combination of Cincinnati Standard and Cincinnati Re. And so we think that's very prudent in managing that volatility in the lower return periods.","As we look further, we also thought well that the smaller amounts for Cincinnati Re could add up and so we bought an aggregate on just Cincinnati Re $25 million ex of $32 million.","And then on the high net worth side, on the personalized side, we thought with earthquakes as a potential in California, the wildfires that we're seeing, the third part of the agreement would be $50 million ex of $10 million per occurrence for earthquakes, wildfires, brush fires in certain of the states out west, it would be California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada.","Now the aggregate is $50 million. So there's only $50 million available in total for those 3 coverage parts. And we thought the pricing was reasonable and that is just slightly over $7 million for the entire cover and so we just thought it was good risk management and good management in terms of managing the volatility that could arise from the ramp up of these two new businesses that we're very confident in.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. That's very helpful color. Can we -- can you touch a little bit on commercial auto. I believe it reserves trended negatively and last quarter they were -- they trended -- they were more flattish. Anything jumping out at you that's changed?","Steve Johnston","I think we're continuing to feel good about the progress we're making in commercial auto. In terms of sequentially the accident quarter improved a bit. It's also down a little bit from where it was same quarter a year ago. On the current accident year basis, we did see some adverse development of 3.3 points on the prior accident years this time. And just the way we do reserves when we've seen some of this adverse development and as we reflect it we're cautious there and I think prudent in the pick of the current accident years, ultimate loss ratio and that would go for commercial auto and homeowners as JF described.","So I think we're taking a prudent approach to the selection of our current accident year picks. But I think we're also confident when we see rates coming in the high single digit range all the work that's being done by our people in terms of mitigating the loss trend we feel we're ahead of the game there and are optimistic about the prospects for future improvement in the commercial auto.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Great. And then, lastly if we can -- if I can ask a question for the broader pricing environment and maybe this should be bifurcated personalize lines versus commercial. That's up to you. But are you at all surprised at the -- it feels like there's been more pricing power than I feel some people in industry expected at least from this -- from my vantage point given results or a lot of participants in the industry have been okay. And so it feels like maybe something is a little different this cycle. It feels like there is the carriers have been able to both keep retention in healthy levels and push pricing increases at a decent rate and x comp, workers comp obviously. So just kind of curious if you feel at a high level things have changed this cycle versus in the past.","Steve Johnston","I think we've just become better and more skilled at the way we underwrite -- the way we handle claims the way we price. And it's very much on a risk by risk, policy by policy basis. So sometimes the averages don't cover enough. They don't describe the whole distribution of what's going on risk by risk in our underwriting pricing claims departments in terms of just looking into every risk, what can we do to make sure that we understand the potential risk that we eliminate risk the way that we can and that's a win-win for us and the agent and their client. What can we do to mitigate risk that might happen? How can we price it appropriately risk by risk using our predictive models, our underwriting judgment, the application and the cost control and all the traditional underwriting measures? And I think by looking at it that granularly it gives the more appropriate price reflection over time.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Got it. So that seems like -- it's a -- it will make results more stable over time, but we shall see. Thanks for the color.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have no further questions at this time.

Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","Now I'll turn over the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We are pleased to report second quarter 2017 operating results that outperformed last year\u2019s second quarter. Our 98.3% property casualty combined ratio for the second quarter of this year was a four points better than a year ago. It's also important to note that 98.3% was an improvement from the first quarter of 2017 despite an unfavorable effect from higher catastrophe losses. On a basis before catastrophe effects, our second quarter 2017 combined ratio was better than both the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. We believe these improving trends bode well for the second half of 2017.","Other good news for the second quarter of 2017 includes another solid quarter for our investment results and premium growth that continues to outpace the industry. Our associates continue their steady efforts to support the outstanding local independent agent who represent Cincinnati Insurance as they carefully underwrite each policy and provide personal service to agents and their clients.","We believe we'll continue to see benefits over the long-term from our various initiatives designed to support profitable growth in each of our insurance segments.","Our commercial lines segment grew net written premiums 2% and returned to producing an underwriting profit in the second quarter and for the first half of the year. Overall commercial lines estimated average pricing improve slightly from the first quarter of 2017 most notably for commercial auto. As Mike will explain further, our commercial casualty line of business returned to a more typical level of profitability. Although a high level of catastrophe losses continues to challenge our personalized segment, it reported another quarter of nice growth for both middle market and high net worth premiums.","Estimated average pricing for personal lines in total was in line with the first quarter of 2017 again with significant personal auto rate increases were needed. Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another excellent quarter including a combined ratio of 66.2% and premium growth of 20%.","Cincinnati Re logged another quarter of strong underwriting results with steady premium growth and the combined ratio just under 80%. The third quarter of 2017 marks two years since Cincinnati Re began assuming risk and generating premiums. Through the second quarter of this year, its cumulative net underwriting profit totaled $20 million on $183 million of net written premiums and an estimated combined ratio of 81%.","Our life insurance subsidiary continued its steady contribution to net income while growing second quarter 2017 term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. The steady growth of our life company, our E&S Company, and our reinsurance assume division diversifies our business helping to smooth results over time.","Our primary measure financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.2% for the second quarter and 7.0% for the first half of the year. We are on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of 10% to 13% in average. Each day brings new challenges to insurance companies. We see them as opportunities for our associates to compete and to deliver value to agencies and policyholders. We know that can translate into long-term shareholder value.","Next our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results. Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth rising 1% for the quarter and 2% for the first six months. As in recent quarters, both interest and dividend income growth contributed or contributed to growth.","Our equity portfolio again reported growth in unrealized gains, up 6% for the quarter to nearly $2.6 billion. The bond portfolios pre-tax average yield was 4.42% for the second quarter 2017, down 22 basis points from last year's second quarter.","Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter of 2017 had an average pre-tax yield of 3.75% and purchase tax exempt bonds averaged 3.33% for a blended yield of 3.53%.","Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30th was 5.2 years matching March 31 and up slightly from five years at the end of December.","Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide fund for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first six months of 2017 totaled $445 million, down $54 million or 11% from the first half of last year, an $85 million increase in catastrophe losses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.","Careful management of expenses continues to be a priority including investing strategically in our business. Our second quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly and the six month ratio was in line with a year ago.","Next I'll comment on reserves. We again experienced net favorable development on prior accident years as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the second quarter 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. That was down 1.2 points from a year ago but fairly close to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past three calendar years.","Our largest line of business, commercial casualty returned to experiencing favorable reserve development for the second quarter of 2017 with a ratio of 2.5% that line was similar to its longer-term ratios which averaged 2.6 points over the past three calendar years. Our commercial casually second quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 57.7%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 or so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of just under 90%.","Favorable reserve development for the first six months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years including 51% for accident year 2016, 12% for accident year 2015, 15% for accident year 2014, and 22% for 2013, and prior accident years.","Touching briefly on capital management, our approach in financial strength remained stable. During the second quarter we repurchased 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $69.73.","As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.","Property carefully underwriting increased book value by $0.09. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.29. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.54, and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.90 during the second quarter to a record $44.97 per share.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. In closing our prepared remarks I'd like to share some additional positive news about our company. In June, S&P Global ratings affirmed is A plus financial strength rating for our standard market and life insurance subsidiaries and in April, A.M. Best affirmed with a stable outlook its rating of A Excellent for the Cincinnati Life Insurance Company. We were also pleased to be recognized for a six time by Forbes Magazine as one of the most trustworthy financial companies in America and to be included in the Fortune 500 for the second consecutive year.","Our solid performance, combined with this news, gives us confidence that Cincinnati Financial is on track to deliver shareholder value far into the future. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.","As a reminder, with Mike and me today are J. F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Jessie, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open.","Arash Soleimani","Good morning. Can you -- you would have high net worth premiums in-force, I know -- I think you had $7 million of new business license you get the in-force number.","Steve Johnston","We have let's see here estimating for the first half of the year, we have about $180 million -- $180 million in the high net worth segment.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. And I saw the commercial casualty as you mentioned turned favorable for this quarter. I guess by just looking at the loss environment more broadly, are you seeing year-over-year changes in kind of inflation trends are you seeing juries paying higher awarding higher awards or any changes in that sense?","Steve Johnston","No we haven't. We haven\u2019t noticed that to tell you the truth.","Operator","You next question comes from Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Heleniak","Hi thanks, good morning. I'm just wondering if you could the E&S had a very good performance again, just wondering if you could go in any detail on some of the lines or the industry sectors where you\u2019re seeing the performance where that's really standing out it comes to mind?","Steve Johnston","Did you say in the E&S segment?","Scott Heleniak","Yes, yes.","Steve Johnston","It\u2019s largely casualty and casualty driven, we do point out that I don't know with 40%, 45% of the risk that we write in E&S policy on, we might have a standard Cincinnati policy, so there are a lot of situations where we'll write the property on a standard basis through Cincinnati Insurance, the casualty through the E&S company with appropriate terms and conditions but the largest percentage of the premium is in casualty and the E&S company.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And then just wondering on E&S too, if you could talk about the -- some of the submission flow I would imagine you're getting a lot more looks of business given where the size of Cincinnati is, so just wondering if you might be able to comment on what you're seeing as far as new submission flow?","J. F. Scherer","Scott this is J. F. Scherer. The submission flow is up this year we're pleased about that. To tag on Steve's comments a little bit earlier, the -- I guess the classification if you will of the business we're writing is kind of reflective of a generalist approach that our agencies take. We don't really have a strategy of going after a line of business or an industry classification. We're pleased that that 44% of what we write in the E&S is attached to a P&C account but our agencies write closing non $3 billion in E&S business in their agencies in total. And so what we're trying to do just with the model we have is just to continue to compete for primarily that book of business that they already have, we think we've got a pretty good value proposition on the E&S side and do what we can to write that seasoned business just within those agencies right now.","So we're very pleased with submission flow there's a lot of competition particularly in larger accounts in the E&S were carriers taking accounts out of the E&S business into the standard market. We've got a pretty conservative appetite in this I mean we're -- we I guess in some respects we play on the fringe of E&S versus standards that's not surprising that some of our accounts would go back into the standard market during a softer market the way that it is right now but notwithstanding the fact we're losing some of that business with the standard market where the submission flow obviously has been very good which has allowed us to grow nicely.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And then I'm just wondering on the commercial lines that actually in your loss ratio look like that was up mostly because of property. Was there anything unusual in there just was that just kind of an uptick in non-cat weather you see any kind of large losses or anything in the quarter.","Steve Johnston","That was a good, good observation I think if you compare that the X cat actually your -- we had a very, very favorable quarter a year ago in the property with a 36.3% loss ratio. The 49.7% that were post this year is right in line with what you would normally expect. Maybe one other area where there were would be some large losses if we look to the personal lines to the other category we're up a little bit this year at 68.3% from where we were 42% a year ago and as we dig into that as some of the larger of umbrella losses. So, I think those would be the two points to describe other than the non-cat weather. I think I'd also like to make the point that if we just look at the X Cat exiting year for the quarter these are the longer-term trends, including each of full last three years it's very much in line.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. Yes, I want to just make sure I wasn't missing anything there but make sense but then just final last question was the tax rate was lower than I have been tracking was that just the share-based compensation accounting change rule that came into factor was there anything else one time in there.","Mike Sewell","Yes, this is Mike. What that really is, is when you take a look at the -- what's driving that primarily is the underwriting profit for this quarter compared to other quarter. So, that's really what dropped a little bit. You've got your preference items of the dividend received deduction or tax exempt interest et cetera but the more underwriting profit you have, the more that that's going to come in straight at the 35% less underwriting profit you'll have a little bit less, less or more. And then and so therefore you've got your, your change there.","Steve Johnston","Excuse me I might add we\u2019d say municipals over corporate to some degree over the last 12 to 18 months so that's starting to have a little bit of an impact.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","The next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you. I'm just understanding how your model works in relation to the rise of an insurance technology. There's a lot of your competitors who are investing in heavily in digital distribution platforms, artificial intelligence, claims handling whatnot and you guys have benefited from all time of a decentralized claims and distribution model. Do insurance technologies hope Cincinnati be competitive against peers or is this going to be a time change where Cincinnati is getting a change to stay competitive.","Steve Johnston","Good question Josh. We do see it as an opportunity. We do see people have tremendous financial assets on the line when they enter into an insurance agreement and we think that the as you mentioned a decentralized personal approach that we take to things both at the point of sale and during the claims as a competitive advantage.","Having said that we just don't want to see disruption happen and we react to it so, we have actively sent our strategy team out to Silicon Valley to the various incubators we actually have one here in Cincinnati we've been up to Detroit to talk to those that are actually making the automated cars. So we're keeping our thumb on the polls and really what I see us doing is to take away the things that we learn, try to find opportunities in the claims area or whatever area it is that we could execute our personal touch business model better by better using technology.","Josh Shanker","Are there any specific investments that you're making right now?","Steve Johnston","We have some. I don't think I would like to go into the details on those but particularly in more efficient delivery in the claims area may be in the underwriting area as well, we are in the investment stage.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Steve Johnston","Very good. Thank you Jessie, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. My comments on the second quarter parallel several I made at our last earnings call. Investment income remained steady and our investment portfolio continues to grow. Mike will discuss investment details in a few moments.","Underwriting performance before the effects of catastrophes was very much improved compared with the year ago, similar to recent quarters. On the other hand catastrophe losses continued above historical norms for us and for many in our industry.","Previously announced second quarter catastrophe losses added nearly 18 points to our combined ratio. Improved underwriting performance in part reflected pricing for property casualty policies that continue to increase. Overall, pricing was up a bit from the first quarter.","Each of our Property Casualty segments again had healthy levels of net written premium growth. They each grew at a double-digit pace during the second quarter and our Life Insurance segments earned premium rose likewise. Factoring out reinsurance effects property casualty written premiums rose 12%, and were satisfied because more precise and overall higher pricing was a large contributor.","Commercial Lines renewal pricing moved somewhat higher in the second quarter compared with the first. Overall, average increases were in the mid single-digit range, including the blending effect of three year policies. Renewals of workers compensation and smaller commercial property policies again experienced stronger pricing during the second quarter than most of our other lines of business.","Our Excess and Surplus line segment had a higher renewal price for the 22 consecutive month, again in a high single-digit range. And personalized premiums continued to experience rate increases over successive years with renewal premiums up 11% for the second quarter and first half of 2012.","Policy retention for Commercial and Personal Lines continues to remain steady in its contribution to total written premiums. The contribution of new businesses is increasing in significance, reflecting benefits from both higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.","Property Casualty new business premiums in the second quarter were 12% higher than a year ago. Recently appointed agencies again drove that growth. As of June 30, we have appointed 93 new agencies on pace toward a full-year target of 130.","Our pricing analytics and modeling tools indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools help us determine when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced as well as when to have the confidence to compete for good accounts.","We are studying our property book of business and identifying opportunities to improve underwriting results for the property lines. Our approach is similar to the multifaceted effort that has been improving our workers compensation results. We've already put in place some of the pieces and in the future we will further discuss plans and progress.","Over time, we'll also benefit from earning the rate increases we've taken on property coverages. On a written premium basis in recent quarters, those property rate increases have outpaced the increase that's taken on much of our non-property business.","Our total property casualty combined ratio for the first half of 2012 showed good improvement over 2011, on both a current accident year and calendar year basis. That improvement holds up however you analyze it, with or without the effects of catastrophes and the accident reinsurance costs in 2011.","We're continuing to see the benefits of ongoing efforts to improve pricing, underwriting and claims management. We are confident further benefits will manifest in our operating results. At the same time, we remain steadfast in our approach to service excellence, reserve adequacy, investment management and strong capital.","Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on several financial items.","Mike Sewell","Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our investment portfolio continued its steady contribution to earnings in the second quarter. Investment income again matched the prior year's quarter and both major components, interest income and dividends were essentially flat.","Yields for our bond portfolio were slightly lower than last year. As we reported, the second quarter of 2012 was even with the first quarter at 5.2% on a pre-tax basis and 3.8% on an after-tax basis.","Our bond portfolio's effective duration edged down to 4.3 years from 4.4 years. In our common stock portfolio, we're seeing dividend increases over the past year for most of our holdings, but less funds were at work in that portfolio for much of the past 18 months. Its cost basis is just now approaching its yearend 2010 level, following a reduction in the first half of 2011 of almost 8%.","Our fixed maturity portfolio again experienced a valuation gain during the second quarter. For the equity portfolio, unrealized gains were 8% lower at the end of June compared with March. Still, that portfolio is pre-tax net unrealized gains of $891 million or 12% higher than at the end of 2011.","Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2012, continued at a healthy pace. That helps fuel our investment income and offset the effects of the low interest rate environment.","At $265 million, net cash flow already exceeded the full year 2011 by $18 million. It's on pace to exceed the full year 2010 and 2009, each at roughly $530 million since the second half of the year typically has lower catastrophe loss payments and the bulk of the agency profit sharing was already paid in the first quarter.","Moving to balance sheet highlights, a consistent approach to loss reserving is one of our hallmarks. And metrics for reserve development on prior accident years, demonstrate that consistency.","Through the first six months of this year we benefited from 10.8 percentage points of net favorable reserve development before catastrophe losses. That result came within one-half of a point of 2011's six-month development. Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first half, which totaled $201 million, including catastrophe losses.","Our six-month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 19% for accident year 2011, 30% for accident year 2010, 16% for accident year 2009, and 35% for all older accident years. We also continue to maintain our consistently low debt leverage with a debt to total capital ratio of 14.8% at June 30.","As previously reported, we established a new $225 million line of credit in May. It replaced two credit facilities that totaled the same amount. Six banks participate and it's for a term of five years. Most of the major terms and conditions are similar to the former credit facilities, but we gained some flexibility in terms of borrowing capacity such as raising the debt to total capital covenant to 30% from 20%.","In addition to enhancing our already great financial flexibility with a new credit facility, we once again ended the quarter holding over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level. Our capital remained strong and is available to support additional premium growth in our Insurance segments.","I'll conclude my prepared comments as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. Property Casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.31. Life Insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than Life Insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.44.","The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses lowered book value by $0.40. And we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to shareholders.","The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.41 during the second quarter to $31.66 per share. That result is 2% above the yearend level contributing to the first half value creation ratio of 4.6%.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Mike. While we remain encouraged by the trend of strong underwriting performance before the effects of catastrophes, we recognized that there is still plenty of work to be done. Our associates and agents continue to work together to make necessary improvements, while maintaining service excellence in creating long-term value for shareholders.","Our primary performance measure is our value creation ratio. And the incentive compensation aligned with adding shareholder value keeps every associate in the company focused on what is important.","With Mike and me today to answer your questions, and further discuss our results and outlooks are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Marty Mullen, and Marty Hollenbeck.","We're ready for you to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","So on pricing, it appears that the pricing rate of change has slowed, and maybe you wouldn't agree with that and us. Steve, you used the word, adequate, a couple of times. So does that imply the current rate increased levels are enough and it might fluctuate near current levels or maybe even move south?","Steve Johnston","I think actually when we look at the first quarter and compare it with the second quarter, the rate increases are actually up just a tick. But flattening is probably a good term, but it is actually and it did not decline. Overall rate increases are actually up just a bit from where they were in the first quarter.","We feel we're hitting the rate in the areas that we need rate and we're continuing to be able to get rate. I think it's not just the average rate increases that we're taking, but that we're using a lot of precision looking at risk on an individual basis, comparing what we think the exposure is to what the rate that's needed for that individual policy. And we think we're making good progress.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","So workers comp specific, next. The results clearly improved a lot this year. Is that been driven solely by increased prices and some of the new analytics you've talked about or have broader loss costs also helped out?","Steve Johnston","It has not been price alone. Price has certainly contributed. And I'm going to turn it over to J.F. Scherer, because he has just produced human effort in terms of been all-around approach to improving our workers comp results.","J.F. Scherer","Mike, we have gotten strong consistently upper single-digit rate increases on comp. That's been the implementation of the predicted modeling, has been a big contributor to guiding us on the pricing. We'll be introducing our second generation of that model. We in fact are in the process of doing that right now.","But in addition to that, we've done a lot more in loss control, specifically on accounts greater than $50,000. Every single one of those accounts is going through a more rigorous review by our loss control division that are scored, based on the review. That resulted in a lot more insight on the accounts that we write.","I think really, and Marty might want to add to this, Marty Mullen, our Chief Claims Officer. But in the claims area, there's been a tremendous amount of specialization and both in terms of putting loss control specialists in the fields, but bill revising has contributed significantly.","We have call center now where we ask the policyholder to call directly into Cincinnati, which accelerates the lag between when the injury occurs and when we are able to triage the injury, and address how it's going to be handled.","So all of those things have contributed. Pricing continues to be therefore a force in the comp area. That still remains consistent. I think in terms of the contribution that loss control and claims will give us, we think there's still some to be gained there.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","And lastly if I may, so what I'm trying to not struggle with, but when I look at just the accident year ex-cats for the entire company, it's improved a lot in the last few quarters, which is great. I'm trying to figure out has any of that come from pricing really, because pricing just started to improve last year. It's really been mostly from the analytics and calling of the books, and we should expect the pricing increases to come in later in the year or next year?","Steve Johnston","Mike, I think you've hit it pretty well right on the head. I don't think it is all pricing. I think is the other elements as well as you have mentioned. And I agree that I think the pricing will continue to earn as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ray Iardella of Macquarie.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","I guess first maybe for J.F. or maybe Steve. As far, Steve, the agency appointments you shared here today, obviously you guys are tracking above the 130 target 93, I believe year-to-date. I think, Steve, your comment was you guys are on pace. But I'm just curious, how do you think about that 130 target is that a target that could be moving? And then how do you think about appointing more agents relative to I guess your goal of getting to $5 billion in direct premiums by 2015?","Steve Johnston","Well, we set that goal of 134 late last year, based on the continuous contribution we wanted to see agencies make towards the $5 billion goal. Each one of the, now 129, field territories analyzed what they've needed to do to contribute to the premium growth that we needed, talk to the agencies in those areas. And determine whether or not based on what the agencies that have already been appointed have committed that they could do in terms of new business and overall written premium, how many more agencies we need to appoint.","We make a point that based on the 134, while to guess many of those agencies appointed earlier in the year. I don't think it will change much. I think it will probably come in right at that level at the end of this year. So it's going as planned. We just accelerate the appointments as quickly as we can, once we know that we're going to make them.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","And when you guys think you'll be setting a target in terms of agency appointments for next year? Is that something already in the back of your mind?","Mike Sewell","Yes, it is. We have probably in the next couple of three weeks we go into our planning sessions. We'll assess where we are and start putting pencil to paper in that regard here in the next couple weeks.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","And then I guess in terms of the Life business, I mean premium is up a little bit there. I mean has that been a contribution from the new agency appointments or is that just you're seeing a little bit more interest? I know it's a relatively small part of the business, but just curious what's going on that side?","Steve Johnston","I think it's been a combination of both. I think they've been doing a good job in the life company of both supporting new agencies and achieving organic growth, the same agent growth so to speak. Worksite term is another product that we have really focused on in terms of the growth and I think that's contributing as well. And Mike, may have a few comments to add as well.","Mike Sewell","On the universal life policies from collected cash is up about 11.5%. Each quarter we do unlock interest rates, not to get too technical on you, but when we do that there is an adjustment on the load upfront, which affects the premiums and the deferred acquisition cost.","So you'll see that those kind of offset a little bit. But where we then end up with the bottomline changes here this quarter of about $1 million. But we're on pace and doing pretty well with the life company, and it should end up where we've planned it to be for the year.","Eric Matthews","I'd just add to it. About 70% of our life insurance premiums come from property and casualty agency appointments. And almost without exception, when we're making some of those 134 appointments, we're visiting with them about the potential to write life insurance at same time we talk about P&C.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","I think, Steve, you had talk about the price increases in the second quarter and that being inclusive of the three year policies. Has the attractiveness to consumers, to your insureds of the three year policies increased this year or have you seen any meaningful shift in that business relative to the one year policies?","Steve Johnston","I think it's always been attractive, especially to a certain type of clientele, who really wants to focus on their business and make their insurance buying decisions once every three years. So I think it's maybe a little bit more important now. But I think it's always throughout our history been an important feature that we offer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","A couple of questions. One is related to last year's storms. If you look at travelers for all states numbers, they had some significant reserve release associated with overbooking last year's storms. Are you still thinking it's too early to call those reserves? Are you thinking that you got it right the first time? Where do you stand on cat reserve for 2011?","Steve Johnston","I'll turn it over to Marty Mullen to handle that one. But I think we've been pretty steady, pretty conservative, have seen some favorable development on last year. But I'll turn it over to Marty to see if he'd want to add anything in addition to that.","Marty Mullen","Thanks, Steve. Yes, Josh, we feel really confident about our ultimate projections for this 2011 storms, especially cat 46 and 48, those are two strong storms of last year. But we're feeling like they're trending in the accurate and positive direction, and we feel like those ultimate projections are holding up very well.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","So you're saying that you're confident you got it right the first time or you're confident you were conservative the first time?","Marty Mullen","I think the ultimate was right about on target the first time. We're still getting some small new claim activity, but it's less than probably five claims a week.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","The other question for Marty Hollenbeck. Looking at the investment yields, from beginning of the year it seems an aggregate, maybe my numbers are a little more crude than yours. It's fallen by about 40 basis points, which is about as much as fall in the last three years combined. Is there something happening right now in the portfolio that's causing acceleration in yield decline or am I just like reading too much into it?","Marty Hollenbeck","No, Josh, we're not really seeing a decline. Actually it's been fairly steady. Book yield is the metric I monitor. That's kind of the embedded yield in the portfolio. It's down 20 basis points from last year. It has been ranging from say 5 to 8 for a number of quarters here.","We are seeing a little bit on the embedded yield in our bonds that we lose to maturity or call that has slowed a little bit. But obviously new money rates as you know with the 10 year down around the 1.4, 1.5 area, we're just not getting any relief on that front. Maybe you are looking stock and bonds.","We have accelerated a little bit this year our equity purchases. We've been net sellers of common stocks I think every year since just prior the crisis. So we are starting to pick that up a little bit this year.","I think in the quarter we probably averaged around 3.5 and 3.6 pre-tax yield on new equity purchases and about 3.7 again pre-tax on new fixed income money. So the decline in my opinion is not accelerating at this point.","Steve Johnston","I have been thinking about your cat question a little bit here. One thing, keep in mind just for modeling purposes and so forth, and I don't know specifically about other companies. But we did get into our cat reinsurers last year. So to the extent we have a movement in the estimate on a direct basis. If we see it at 95% say in the layer that those two big cats hit any movement and our estimate now will only be about 5% in the total, if you see what I'm saying.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent DeAugustino of Stifel Nicolaus.","Vincent DeAugustino - Stifel Nicolaus.","Last quarter we had talked about personal auto loss cost trends, it's still being rather benign. But if I'm taking a look at the core loss ratio, it ticked up about 11 points year-over-year and then in 1Q '12 it ticked up by about 4 or 5 points. So kind of curious if there was maybe some non-cat hail or something along those lines this quarter that would've pushed auto up or if there was maybe any sort of observable change in loss cost trends more recently?","Steve Johnston","I have to say as I review our financials and was looking at things of every number in there and that personal auto got my attention as much as anything. Especially, after we've seen some deterioration in personal auto results for some others in the industry.","As we dug into it, there was a lot of moving parts in there as you mentioned, you've got cat, different kinds of weather. So we tried to just drill down with all the noise going on to what we saw in terms of the non-cat paid losses. And as we looked at that for the second quarter the non-cat paid loss ratio was up 1 point from it was second quarter a year ago.","On a six-month basis it's actually down seven-tenths of a point from the first half of last year. But we're going to continuing, we've been taking rates in the low single-digits. I think with this new information we're going to continue to analyze and keep a very close eye on that one to make sure that we're maintaining price adequacy.","Vincent DeAugustino - Stifel Nicolaus","And then sticking within Personal Lines. If we think about homeowners, is it easier from a regulatory standpoint and also from an agent and customer standpoint to get tougher in terms and conditions or maybe implementing a higher deductible requirements or anything aside from pushing from a rate standpoint, is it just easier than getting the rate approvals?","Mike Sewell","I think they're both about the same to tell you the truth. I think obviously, with terms and conditions it's a contract language and you really have to make sure that everything is communicated very clearly, and make sure everything is filed appropriately.","But I don't see too much of a difference in terms of the regulatory approval process in terms of terms and conditions versus rates with just kind of amplification that you really do need to make sure that everything is properly communicated.","Vincent DeAugustino - Stifel Nicolaus","Then one last one if I may. What was the audit premium benefit to workers comp in the quarter? I think commercial casualty and work comp together was a favorable $9 million. But just curious if you have the split or will be willing to say what it was?","Steve Johnston","Well, I've seen it. I know the $9 million in total. We're just kind of scrambling around for our numbers here, because we've got a couple of notebooks, and I think we have it, but I don't have it at my fingertip.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ron Bobman with Capital Returns.","Ron Bobman - Capital Returns","I had a couple of questions. I was curious to know, are you doing anything, sorry if I missed this, on homeowners' deductibles?","Steve Johnston","Homeowners' deductibles, we are certainly over a period of time have been moving our homeowners' deductibles up, and in fact now we have over 40%, probably over 43% of the current in-force book at a $1,000 deductible or higher. Virtually everything is over $500, and we're continuing to look at what we might be able to do more and certainly to keep that trend continuing.","Ron Bobman - Capital Returns","Do you have a goal a year from now for it to be a specific or a ballpark percentage over $1,000?","Steve Johnston","We do not have a goal at this time. We have been looking in addition to rate, looking at all non-rate ways that we can improve the results in homeowners', in our way that we handle catastrophe losses and so forth. But at this point, we do not have a specific quantified target.","Ron Bobman - Capital Returns","I don't think you're sort of a licensed player in this business, but as a city folk asking people in the Heartland, do you wrote any crop?","Steve Johnston","We do not write crop. We're still reading a lot about it because we see our fields. I've got about 50 acres of beans and its turning brown. So we read a lot about it and we don't write it.","Ron Bobman - Capital Returns","My last question was I think the late June storms, June 27, 28, something like that, running until almost early July, the first day or so of July, we'll call these just Derecho, and I was wondering if your sort of loss provisioned for second quarter is going to include currently your loss estimate for that event or will some sort of portion of it be apportioned or we have a new provision to some degree in the third quarter?","Steve Johnston","That's a great question, because as soon as someone seen that storm coming in, I was on the line to Marty and we only want to provide for losses that occurred up to June, 30 in terms of our second quarter results.","Any losses that happen subsequent to June 30 will go into the third quarter results. So we are tracking that. To this point, I haven't seen that rise to a level of materiality yet but maybe I don't know if, Marty Mullen, want to comment anymore on that.","Marty Mullen","I'll just give you an update on cat, was expanded in early July to 10 states, it's actually June 28 through July 2. Our main states involved in the cadre, Indiana, Ohio and Virginia.","Our claim count kind of breaks down to about 60% of all of our claims in Ohio and 14% in Virginia. About 80% of those claims are Personal Lines and 20% Commercial.","We've got about 51% of our claims are closed. I think one thing that's kind of unusual about that claim is most of the claims are wind related and about 40% of the claims with incurred on them are under $2,500. Although, we have our share of commercial losses with wind damage, there is also a lot of Personal Lines claims with small incurred.","Ron Bobman - Capital Returns","It's impressive I guess 51% close within less than 30 days that's great, I mean from the customer service perspective.","Marty Mullen","Well, I guess it's a good news bad news. Ohio is our largest state. So we have a lot of business in premium there. But we also have a lot of our top-notch field claim representatives, the majority in Ohio so we have a lot of feet on the ground to handle those claims.","Mike Sewell","So before we go to the next caller I'd just like to go back, Vincent had asked a question related to the effects of audit premiums and for the quarter, the effects or the audit premiums for the quarter was almost $15 million. $23.5 million for the six months, which when you look at the six months, it's about $15 million increase over the prior year, $5 million for the quarter. So I just want to get that out there.","Operator","Your question comes from Scott Heleniak of RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Just wondering if you're seeing any competitors that are rolling back some of the price increases, that they had in Q1 because there were too significant. So did you see any of that in Q2 where maybe they had a double-digit rate increases in Q1 and they rolled that back to 6% or 7%, of that had any kind of impact on your business at all or retentions?","Steve Johnston","No, I did not see any of that.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","What were the retentions by segment, do you have that number at all?","Steve Johnston","I think we had them, they were stable. They are going to be up close to the 90% range, varying a little bit slightly lower for Commercial Lines, slightly higher for Personal.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","The only other question I had was you mentioned, increasing expose your equities, could you could you talk about how much you deployed either in second quarter or first quarter? And how likely we might be able to see equities at the higher end of the 25% to 30% range, that you've talked about before?","Mike Sewell","Sure. For the first quarter common stocks, we were net sellers and this is a very round number of around $24 million. For the second quarter, we were net purchasers of around $87 million.","I think for us to get to that 30% in the short-term would probably take some help from the market, obviously, an increase in prices as well as possibly, if interest rates go up the value of the bond portfolio comes down.","We're not being aggressive though about this. Obviously, with interest rates where they are, we find the cut equities that we buy that you're very familiar with, very attractive, both on a pre-tax and after-tax basis.","So we're not in all our push. We're still very committed to putting new money into the bond portfolio, and building latter portfolio over time, has kind of been our strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Rohrmann of KBW.","Matt Rohrmann - KBW","Steve, most of my questions has been answered, but I just wanted to follow-up on, sort of, the continued revisions within the property book. Second quarter I know has been frustrating in last couple of years.","In terms, of how you view the concentrations in the submarkets within a pretty. Has that changed much in terms of how you view it for the book today, as it stanza versus a year ago on a note. It's not exactly apples-to-apples on the weather, by a long shot, but your thoughts there in terms of your handling concentration, managing that going forward?","Steve Johnston","I'll take an early step and then I'm going to turn over to J.F. because he's been doing, again, lot of great work in that area. We have been getting good organic growth as you've seen in the results.","We are focusing on increasing our geographic footprint, our diversification by agency in terms of where the business comes from. I might talk about homeowners just a little bit before I turn it over to J.F. ","And that we recognized that we have a concentration issue. For example, our top-six states for homeowners, that the Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Alabama, and Georgia they represent over two-thirds, about 67.3% of our homeowners' premium.","And those states, we actually saw new business down 4.4%. So the growth in new business that you see in our published financials came outside of the states where we have the geographic concentration. And so that is part of our strategy to spread our footprint and diversify our catastrophe risk. And so I was just trying to put a little color on, in terms of numbers on the homeowner side of it, and I'll turn it over to J.F. for the second.","J.F. Scherer","Matt, just on the Commercial Line side, just to give you a little bit of perspective, on commercial property it would exclude inland marine. Our five-year average cat loss ratio on that is about 13.6 points.","If you take our ex-cat net underwriting results for property through year-to-date, we're running at if we were to have average cat, at about 105 combined ratio for commercial property.","It's not horrible, considering the kind of cats that we've had, but it's certainly not satisfactory. So we are expanding geographically, but honestly the population of Idaho and Utah and Oregon, that alone is not enough to balance out the kinds of concentrations, we have more in the Midwest.","So we're trying to spend a lot more time here in the Midwest trying to identify ways in addition to rate and property rates are solidly getting into the upper single-digit ranges, and they're accelerating. ","But we've got a lot going on with deductible increases in property, a lot more discussion in the marketplace about percentage deductibles. There is a tolerance on that though.","In coastal areas, people are used to 2% and 5% win deductibles, in the Midwest they are not, but there's a lot more discussion there. We're taking a lot closer look at habitational risks, apartments, condos, all type of things that have asphalt shingles, very much susceptible to hail types of claims. Those are areas where we're looking at much stronger deductibles.","Less owner risk only property, you may hear a lot of other carriers talk about that, but in addition to rough exposures there, we've spend a lot more time verifying through inspections and loss control, who the tenants are? Whether or not during these tougher economic times, maintenance might have deteriorated.","Claim specialization is part of what we're doing in the property area, as well. And I mentioned loss control but specifically, in terms of inspections we're doing a lot more in that area and adding a lot more in loss control.","So the solution to property filling the Commercial Line side, it's not monumental. We want that combined ratio including tax to be in the 90 range. We think we are that kind of company, but there is a lot other moving parts to trigger it there.","Matt Rohrmann - KBW","Just in terms of lot of you touched with, sort of, more at the micro level which is great, and in terms of middle to more macro level. Are there any, sort of, like portfolio specifications in terms of, you are a only write say, X amount of business per county or zipcode or street or how do we define it?","Steve Johnston","We do have loss tolerances in place. We look at that. It may not be quite as green orders as to where we are heading, but we are steadying that in terms of down to a street level or zip code level. At this point, it's more driven by a state or a marketing territory, more at that level.","Operator","Your next question comes from Drew Woodbury of Morningstar.","Drew Woodbury - Morningstar","I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about your appetite for new business. Just given where we are in the pricing cycle, and looking at your accident year ex-cat ratio of above 100%, wondering if you could talk a little bit in more detail about how you're adding to your book?","Steve Johnston","Again, kind of to reiterate the comments I may have made on homeowners before. We are getting new business. A lot of that new business is coming from areas that are outside of our traditional footprint.","We do feel that in terms of our pricing and looking at our models that we are in place that we have or will have price adequacy. I think with homeowners is an example.","Coming up October 1, we have 14 states that I think represent over 80% of our premium volume. We'll be getting double-digit, low double-digit increases on average over those 14 states. And in fact certain segments within there will be getting much more.","So we feel this next round will put us in a place that we feel we're adequately priced to cover the expected losses that we'll have. And so again, in terms of the new business, I would not want anybody to think that we are in agencies writing more new business, because we are under priced.","It's more that we are expanding out into new agencies, new territories, and we feel that the rate levels that we have in place are at the appropriate place or will be shortly.","Drew Woodbury - Morningstar","And then my next question is, kind of, a bigger picture, a longer term, one about investments, specifically about the equity allocation. So with pricing maybe getting a little bit better and if that trend continues in the future, and we eventually see something maybe hardening market with robust price increases.","Have you guys given any thought to lowering the equity allocation or to invest more in policies and writing new business there? And if you could just talk a little bit about your thought process in the trade off between those two types of investments?","Mike Sewell","I'll just start about the equity allocation. We're a little over 25%, now. Historically, if you follow us for a while and that number five years ago was probably 54%, 55%.","So we're actually at a very much the low range of our historical norm. We're not uncomfortable. We don't even like it, hit this level. As it was mentioned earlier, if we went to 30%, that would be okay as well.","We're not going to go back to having half the portfolio in common stocks, but we invest consistently overtime, and I don't see us selling down below 25% nor much higher than 30% of the portfolio. Again, we believe in the long-term, growth aspects of the type of the stocks we have, and again, the income component of it doesn't get mentioned off, but it's just as important as the growth aspect of it. So I'll let Steve, comment on the underwriting piece.","Steve Johnston","I guess, I would just add right on that everything that Marty, said is that we have been conservative with our balance sheet. Currently, we're running premium surplus ratio of just under 0.9% to 1%.","We have an additional $1 billion plus in cash and marketable securities at the holding company. So we keep that conservative balance sheet, so that we're in place. So we can both support our growth goals and our investments in capital management strategies.","So I think given where we are in terms of a very strong balance sheet, we're in a position to grow profitably, invest for long-term and do our capital management dividend paying and so forth.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","I had a question on new business and then on cats. I guess, on new business first, Steve, you personally said that your new business largely came from agents added in the last 18 months. Can you just put some numbers around that how much of your new business actually is from the newer agents?","Steve Johnston","I believe we have that number, and I think J.F. is going through his sheets and paper. So I'll do my best to tap dance here for a while.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","Maybe, I can ask the related question while you look at the exact number, which is you said that the new business is based on your analytics. The new business is priced better than renewal. How do you measure that? I mean, I thought new pricing is very hard to sort of have confidence given you can't see the kind of history you can see on your own businesses as far as claims and so forth?","Steve Johnston","That price adequacy is very much held by our models, and I think for both of those questions, J.F. is very well prepared at this point.","J.F. Scherer","Let me just address the new business and the price adequacy. We model our entire book of business. It's on the books as well as in every single policy that's written on a monthly basis.","So when we write new basis, we know based on the models we're using, what the price adequacy of those risks should be. Now, the model doesn't answer a 100% of the question, in terms of full quality of the account.","It's a huge contributor to it, but there are lot of other things that you might call non-model attributes. So we take that down to the policy levels, and so actually, if you can do that we can take it down to the agency level, to the field territory level, to the state level.","The fact of the matter is that in terms of all the new business we've written in 2012 to date, agencies appointed in 2010 and 2011, the business we've written from those folks has been most price adequate, of all the new business we've written throughout the year.","So we're pleased with the amount of new business we're getting. Frankly, we would expect to write slightly more new business, based on the new agencies that we've appointed and the conversations with agencies we've had. But that is one area where we monitor, very granularly the direction that we've gone in terms of pricing of the new accounts that we've written. So we meet monthly on that. So we're comfortable that, though, a new business is up, it's not at the expense of underwriting profitability.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","So can you sort of, explain why the business is in the market place, if you will, at that attractive price? And I guess, I'm used to thinking of you being is sort of new business penalty right. And that business is being sharp is partly because it's not priced as well as someone's renewal books. So what's allowing you to see business of such high quality, rather than staying where it was?","J.F. Scherer","There is always possibility for the new business penalty. We understand that, and monitor it. I guess, there will be a variety of reasons. When you appoint a group of agencies or appoint an agency, we make it very clear in the appointment process that we expect to be a meaningful part of the agency.","One way of the agency making that happen, is to consolidate the number of carriers they have in the agency. So we may be given an opportunity to look at business, simply because they want to cut down the number of carriers they have.","Some carriers in the marketplace have announced that they're going to take a very, very tough pricing approach. That they are going to get a minimum rate increase on all of their renewals, translation, agency shops most of that business just to be on guard, so we some business because of that.","The three-year policy is a significant advantage, I guess, or certainly an important thing for an agency, right now. There is an expectation that pricing increases will continue, that the market will continue firm for a while. So therefore, an agency would might want to put the policyholder with us on a three-year guarantee. So all of those things together, give us an opportunity to see very good business in the marketplace.","Mike Sewell","I want to add just a couple of more thoughts in there. One is, that we actually have two different models, one for new business, one for renewals. So to the extent that you can get different information from a renewal piece of business, versus a new piece of business, we have a model for new business that churns in specifically on the particular information that we can get for new business.","And then, I think in terms of the new businesses that's available to us, and I kind of try to touch on it in my opening comments is that, that the model allows us to really analyze the new business that's presented to us, and have confidence to go after the ones that we want to go after. But also have confidence to walk away from the ones that would historically create a new business penalty.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","And then I have actually did, a preface calculations, do you have that number on how much of the new business from the newer agents?","Steve Johnston","We wrote both in Commercial and Personal Lines, $21.6 million in agencies that have been appointed in 2011 and 2012.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","And then on the cats, I know it's only as trickier to use sort of, market shares and try to estimate heap of cats, but I guess just sort of wondering, what your take is on your cats relative to the industry this quarter? And what I was looking at is, if you start what the big picture I saw, I think of using a $6 billion, $7 billion cat number, and the odds are like $8 billion. If I look at some of your competitor's cats and extrapolate from their stake market shares, as they come and start to move up to maybe 10, 12.","But based on your market share analysis, that was playing $20 billion or $25 billion of industry cat losses, which makes to seem like you performed, sort of, worse than your share would have indicated. Do you agree with that? Or is it just stake market share is obviously a very broad tool, and if I add county market share, you'd look more normal or was this little bit outsized quarter for you guys relative to what it should have been?","Steve Johnston","I have been analyzing this myself. And I think that stake market share is broad, and maybe, just kind of describing how the rates are made, we'll just take homeowners. It might answer the question a little bit.","And that, the way we provide for the cat provision is we used RMS version 11, they are most recent up-to-date model. One that is pretty conservative. But we use the RMS version 11 model.","We then put in at a very granular level, right down to the street address, our current exposures. What is the coverage area and all the characteristics of the houses that we write, so that we have both a current model and a current picture of our exposures.","The model is run at numerous scenarios, thousands of scenarios are generated and we come up with an expected value for catastrophe losses, and that is what we build into our rate level.","So it's not our last 20 years of history or our last 10 or any years of history, it's what does the most recent model show. And so then we're at a point where we're comparing, what actually happens versus what did we built into the models. And I just think as we look at overall, in terms, of where these catastrophes happened versus where our footprint is, it just happened to be more in line with where we were and produced outsize losses vis-\u00e0-vis what we're building in, and in terms of expected losses for cats.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","And is there anything when I look at sort of, your long-term history versus the past two or three years, wondering has been sort of these elevated industry losses. It seems relative to your own history, the Commercial has been a little bit more impacted than Personal. Historically, is that accurate? I know you talked about homeowners changes you're making, are there any changes you're seeing necessary on the commercial property side?","Marty Mullen","Actually on the Commercial side, we did have two storms that were kind of outlined on the Commercial piece. We got hit pretty hard on the Commercial side. In Joplin last year, we were hit in the city, actual city areas where we hit some Commercial activity and large Commercial losses, which is pretty much an outlier for us in a cat situation.","This year, in our first cat in April, we had our share of Commercial losses in St. Louis from the hail damage. That was pretty much more than 50% of the losses in St. Louis on the incurred basis from cat, pretty much related to Commercial. So with those two were outliers, as far as individual storms are concerned.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","So it sounds more like bad luck necessary, than a new front or any change?","Steve Johnston","Well, we never attribute anything to bad luck. I think it may even be bad luck, but we're not going to accept it within, hearing that that's the answer, because it's natural. When things don't go your way; say, well, luck was against us, and when things go your way, it was due to your extreme skill and expertise.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","I understood. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything beyond that that you identify as a concern.","Operator","Your next question comes from Fred Nelson of Crowell, Weedon.","Fred Nelson - Crowell, Weedon","My question is on the book value, is that an after-tax book-value as you deducted the gains, if you sold everything or can you explain in little more detail?","Mike Sewell","Yes. That is a after-tax book value.","Fred Nelson - Crowell, Weedon","And if you add it back, would it be $2 more $3 more?","Steve Johnston","The tax impacts on investments are unrealized gains.","Mike Sewell","We're taxed at 35% for our realized gains.","Fred Nelson - Crowell, Weedon","But I just want to know if you had it figured, what you would add back. I mean it must be a pretty good figure?","Mike Sewell","It's a pretty good figure. The 35% of that unrealized gain.","Fred Nelson - Crowell, Weedon","Well, you don't have to give it to me. I just wanted to know if I was correct on my thought process.","Mike Sewell","Yes, absolutely are.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Johnston for closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Thank you. And thanks to all of you for joining us. Thanks for the great interest in our company and great questions and we appreciate it. And we look forward to talking to you on our next call if not before.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call for Cincinnati Financial. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","At this time I would like to turn the call over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you will first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Cincinnati Financial Director, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, J.F. Scherer; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; Chief Claims Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, Marty Mullen; and Senior Vice President of Accounting for Cincinnati Insurance, Theresa Hoffer.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","And now I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. Operating profit for the quarter was well below our expectations, primarily due to severe weather as we previously reported. Starting the year with a 99.7% combined ratio, means we have work to do. And we remain confident that we have the expertise and agency partners that will lead to better results as the year progresses.","We reported another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will highlight key items in a moment. Before that, I\u2019ll note a few more important things regarding our insurance operations. We believe the rate of premium growth we reported for each of our insurance segments is healthy. That fast effort by underwriters in executing pricing precision for each policy is imperative. And their efforts also strengthen our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.","Pricing was generally consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, a little stronger for some lines of business and a little weaker for others. As loss ratios for us in the industry indicate higher premium rates are most needed for commercial and personal auto policies. Our first quarter average renewal price increases for those two lines were the highest among our major lines of business.","As I mentioned earlier elevated weather related catastrophe losses challenge both our commercial lines and personal line segments in the first quarter. However, our commercial line segment improved its current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses. We\u2019re also satisfied with first quarter premium trends and the opportunities that our agencies continue to give us for profit growth. Our personal line segment also continue to see good growth in both middle market and high net worth premiums and we continue to see success in getting needed rate increases.","Our excess and surplus lines segment continue to report outstanding results, with the first quarter 2017 combined ratio at 62.3% in steady premium growth. Underwriting results for Cincinnati Re were also outstanding with another quarter of nice premium growth and the combined ratio below 80%. For our life insurance subsidiary, while our operating revenues were flat for the first quarter of 2017 both segment profit and net income continue to rise.","Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.8% for the first quarter, a good start for the year. It was nice to see another quarter of rising investment portfolio valuations, augment the 1.4% contribution from operating performance. Every associate remains focused on executing our strategy and delivering excellent personalized service to each stakeholder every day. As a result, we believe that shareholders will be rewarded over time.","With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance and financial condition.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. My comments began with some first quarter investment highlights. First quarter 2017 was our 15th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis. Similar to recent quarters, both interest and dividend income contributed to growth. Our equity portfolio experience another quarter of growth in unrealized gains, up 4% to $2.4 billion, despite harvesting a $149 million of appreciated stocks.","The bond portfolio pretax average yield was 4.49% for the first quarter of 2017, down 16 basis points from last year\u2019s first quarter. Taxable bonds purchased during the first three months of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 4.38% and purchase tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.46% for a blended yield of 3.93%.","Cash flow from operating activities continue to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first three months of 2017 below that $136 million about half as much as of first quarter of last year. Much of that decrease was due to higher than usual catastrophe losses in recent months.","We continue to wisely manage the company\u2019s discretionary expenses including strategic investments in our business that will enhance future success. Our first quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly up 0.2 percentage points, compared with a year ago.","Transitioning to loss reserves, we continue to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first three months of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited the combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points, while that was a little later than a year ago, it\u2019s very similar to the 3.5 points we average over the past three calendar years.","Favorable reserve development for the first quarter was again spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years including 53% for accident year 2016, 21% for accident year 2015 and 26% for 2014 and prior accident years.","One item I\u2019d like to note regarding the first quarter result was an increase in prior accident year reserves for our commercial casualty line of business. That development was heavily influenced by an increase in commercial casualty large losses of $1 million or more per claim, split about evenly between accident year 2017 and prior accident years.","We decided it was prudent to increase management\u2019s best estimate of commercial casualty reserves, even though large losses are inherently variable. As we\u2019ve disclosed in our Critical Accounting Estimates section of our 10-K large loss activity and trends are important factors to consider.","Despite the large losses and reserve increases adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so to the 66.3% loss and loss expense ratio we reported, indicates a first quarter estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 100%. As more data becomes available for those large losses will adjust estimates reserves up or down as appropriate.","Large losses also increased for some other lines of business as a total for our commercial lines insurance segment rose 103%. We study those claims routinely and determine that the five largest ones were generally from well established agencies and accounts that we\u2019ve insured for many years. Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remain stable. During the first quarter, we did repurchase 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $73.35.","As usual, I\u2019ll wrap up with a summary of contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.02. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.39.","The change in unrealized gains of March 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.18. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.97 and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 during the first quarter to a record $44.07 per share.","And now I will turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. Well the insurance business will always be challenged by the weather or other forces investors, agents, associates and others can count on Cincinnati Financial to remain steady in execution of our strategy.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff, Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer.","Carol, please open the call for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Arash Soleimani from KBW. Please go ahead. Arash Soleimani, your line is open.","Arash Soleimani","Thank you, good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning.","Arash Soleimani","So it looks like the core loss ratio had improved quite significantly within workers\u2019 comp. Can you just talk about what was driving that was there anything unusual in there.","Steve Johnston","Good question, Arash. We didn\u2019t see anything unusual, it\u2019s been a line that we\u2019ve given a lot of attention over the years, every area in the company has worked hard on workers\u2019 comp and it\u2019s just been really a profitable line for us. Things are going well and we\u2019re taking a steady approach, so really nothing unusual.","Arash Soleimani","All right. And what kind of rates are you seeing in that line?","Steve Johnston","Well, actually rates given the profitability and so forth are down a little bit in the mid-single digit range right now. But we feel in terms of where we are against targets that we\u2019re comfortable with that is a part of the overall package.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. And I know I think both ROI and Berkley commented that they\u2019ve been seeing rising loss inflation. Is that consistent higher jury awards more aggressive playing to Cincinnati\u2019s. Is that consistent with what you\u2019re seeing as well?","Steve Johnston","I would say in terms of our inflation it\u2019s been positive but we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 I would call a big spike or anything \u2013 we have seen some things in our commercial casualty in terms of large losses that we have commented on our disclosure. But I don\u2019t see it, in terms of necessarily being core driven or anything like that at this point, but we\u2019ll continue as we [indiscernible] study that issue.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. And can you just remind me in E&S, what specific lines are you writing in the E&S and then on top that the growth there what exactly is boosting that is there a specific initiative or \u2013 I just want some more color there, please.","Steve Johnston","Yes, we write more casually than property, it would then the excess and surplus lines our average premium would be in the $6,000 range. Although we do write larger policies, we like to say we write a wide spectrum of E&S policies that are written by our agencies. In terms of the growth I just think that team has really worked hard and just having boots on the ground and getting out and visiting with agencies. And I just think they\u2019re working hard to generate the growth and generate the looks that we\u2019re getting.","Arash Soleimani","All right, perfect. Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you. I want to go back and spend a little bit and talk about what the thought was behind you guys are starting to put toad in the water on the reinsurance markets and whether or not given what\u2019s going on reinsurance state, it still makes sense and I guess how it fits into the overall strategy for Cincinnati?","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Josh. Yes, with the reinsurance, as we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we seek a diversified stream of revenue, a diversified stream of income it paid-off this quarter. Well, we have a concentration of our premiums in the Midwest and we are growing in other states to diversify both things like our excess and surplus lines company, things we do in management liability, surety help to diversify our income stream.","And then also we see that from what we\u2019re doing with our small reinsurance operation. Strategically, what we tried to do is hire a small team of very talented people and use in allocated capital approach where \u2013 as you point out, it is tough in the reinsurance business. But we think as the start-up with a very talented experienced people, a low expense ratio, we can look to the part of the reinsurance distribution that we feel confident that we can make a profit in, where we can understand the risk quantitatively and qualitatively without pressure to grow we\u2019ve been set up a separate company or anything like that or give them any targets that they had to meet in terms of growth.","We just said, use your experience, your contacts get a wide look at it what\u2019s out there and do your best to just pick the most profitable ones. And as you can see just in \u2013 I\u2019d say it\u2019s about seven quarters they\u2019ve build up a bank of about $15 million in profit just going about their business in a very selective way.","Josh Shanker","And is there \u2013 can you exist in that business without writing any premium, can you keep it \u2013 even if markets aren\u2019t attractive without taking on new business.","Steve Johnston","We\u2019ll take our new business, but only if we feel that it\u2019s profitable. We don\u2019t want to have pressure to write a certain number of contracts or certain amount of premium it\u2019d be very selective and I don\u2019t look at the reinsurance market there is a point estimate. I see it as a point estimate with the distribution around it and while that distribution and the point estimate is moved into softer territory, we think there are still plenty of risks within the reinsurance space. If you have talented people looking at them, bolstered by our A-plus rating that we can get good looks at business that we feel has a high propensity for profitability.","Josh Shanker","And maybe Marty can give us some updates and thoughts on the muni-market a little bit. And obviously, we really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with taxes here and what not but \u2013 any thoughts on opportunities to get in or out of various to insurance.","Marty Mullen","Josh, we\u2019re definitely buy and hold, there\u2019s an awful lot of frictions try to ever get out of muni\u2019s. But we still find an attractive asset class on a risk adjusted \u2013 tax adjusted basis. And as you alluded to we don\u2019t know yet how this whole tax reform will shake out. We\u2019ll deal with that when there\u2019s some more clarity, but we have been slightly favoring them over the last 12 months or so. So we still find value there.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Thank you very much. And good luck in 2017.","Marty Mullen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Heleniak","Hi, good morning. Thanks. Just a follow up with Marty, then on the investment side, just kind of where equities are right now just they\u2019re sort of up \u2013 at the sort of upper end of your target right now to 35% of invested assets. And just wondering, what you\u2019re thinking about your exposure there and how comfortable are you moving considerably higher than these levels. Are you comfortable with where you are now at right now?","Steve Johnston","We\u2019re fairly comfortable, we have probably a little bit of room, when we look at it is more from a bottom up by subsidiary company rather than a top down aggregate view. So there\u2019s regulatory concerns, rating agencies et cetera, number of factors that go into it. So I mean do for all the right reasons, we are kind of getting more towards the top end of what we would be have a range but we\u2019re not mix out at this point now.","Scott Heleniak","Okay, yes. I mean that\u2019s a good problem to have, I guess right. And then just a question to as one if you could touch more on the \u2013 you mentioned the large losses that commercial casualty at large claims in excess of $1 million. I just wonder if you could give a little more detail on the kind of the nature of those claims. What type of customer? What accident year? And is that something where you kind of only saw that recently or did you see signs of that at some point the last couple years as well?","J.F. Scherer","Scott, this is J.F. We do a post-mortem or a deep dive on really all the larger claims $500,000 in greater in the company. We took a look at the particularly the five largest claims we had in this quarter. And as was mentioned in the prepared remarks really no trends emerge there and the biggest claim we had been insured with us for 21 years and we found that that was the case on all of those claims. The agencies, once again long tenured agencies in fact one of them was an agency that started with the company in 1951. So we\u2019re not seeing anything emerge from more newly appointed agencies.","And of those five big claims, several of them have very good segregation possibilities, so we did \u2013 there wasn\u2019t really anything going on with our particular policy holders, so much as that they were the victim, if you will but some bad exposures surrounding them. So we really do take a look at a lot of things, we\u2019ve appointed a good number of agencies over the last several years. So we\u2019re paying close attention to make certain at the quality of business that we\u2019re getting from those agencies is consistent with what we\u2019ve been used to.","Certainly, we\u2019re paying attention a lot of the pricing. We\u2019re seeing all new business coming in. So from our standpoint \u2013 at least at this point, we\u2019re going to continue to pay close attention to it. The number of larger claims, we had this quarter were random, just so happened that they occurred in this quarter. If you go back several quarters particularly in the greater than $5 million category we really had any, so nothing that we\u2019ve found, we keep a close look on at them.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you touched a little bit on new business, which are strong. I think it was a record quarter and I know you had \u2013 a lot that was driven by new agency appointments this year? But is there anything else that kind of drove that pick up this quarter versus Q4, I know it was a little more regarded with that? So I was wondering if there\u2019s any kind change or anything you can talk about specifically or was it just kind of wrapping up with new agents and seeing a little few or more opportunities?","J.F. Scherer","Well. Steve made reference to being elbow grease. I guess as much as anything else in the E&S side of things. We did process probably a little more than normal business, that was written in the fourth quarter that got processed in the first quarter. So it was a little bit of that that helped with the growth rate in the first quarter.","Other than that maturing of agencies that we\u2019ve appointed over the last several years, high net worth had a \u2013 is really having a very positive effect. As Steve mentioned, CSU continues to do very well. I think a lot of agencies just continue to embrace the strategy we have there. We\u2019ve got a great model and we have a lot of field people out in the field. We\u2019re adding field people on the E&S side that helps with new business.","And but beyond that no, actually we\u2019ve got no incentives out there. There aren\u2019t any special deals that are commission driven. It\u2019s just been good solid opportunities. I will say that in the marketplace right now that particularly driven by commercial auto there\u2019s a lot of fairly sizable rate increases that are being requested by carriers, and that\u2019s I think driving a little bit more shopping if you will agencies taking accounts to market perhaps than that would have been the same time last year.","So we\u2019re getting a decent add back to there. So but no, very good, we\u2019re pleased with the new business. The pricing on it looks strong, loss control continues to be an even larger part of what we do in terms of profiling accounts. So we\u2019re very comfortable with the rate of growth of new business.","Scott Heleniak","I guess people probably say, enough is enough with the rate increases for commercial auto and then start shopping around but \u2013 that\u2019s all I have. Thanks a lot.","J.F. Scherer","Okay.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Please go ahead.","Ian Gutterman","All right, thank you. Maybe start off with follow-up on the reinsurance growth. Any color on the mix was a more property, more casualty event just where are you growing and is it most the quarter share I guess also?","Steve Johnston","Yes, it is mostly quarter share and it is very similar to what it has been and pretty close to an even mix in fact. I think it was 45% property this time. So, just again a good effort by the team and just scouring the market for good opportunities without really a focus on any one particular segment.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. And did the property component contributed out of the cats in the quarter?","Steve Johnston","No. I think that was part of the reason that the diversification is helping and not that the reinsurance won\u2019t be subject to \u2013 a chance to have their term with catastrophe losses, they will. They\u2019re in a different place, and so the hope would be, that we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 would not have the Midwestern weather at the same time, we\u2019re trying to keep the reinsurance as best we can out of the Midwest of your convicted storm. I wanted \u2013 one check you said, I want to make sure that your question was kind of didn\u2019t contributed all, that was minimal, but Mike\u2019s check and see it already.","Mike Sewell","It actually helped by about $1 million. So it was a favorable, so even better.","Steve Johnston","Even better.","Ian Gutterman","That\u2019s a good problem. Just the last part of that one before I move on is, given it\u2019s now $40 million of premium, that\u2019s not \u2013 that far from the E&S. Is it big enough now where you consider breaking it out? It\u2019s getting to the point where I feel I have to make a few guesses to get all the numbers to get underwriting income these days?","Mike Sewell","There are certain guidelines for \u2013 this is Mike \u2013 for breaking items out as separate segments, your party has always to go and if you really look at the accounting rules one could argue that E&S according to the accounting rules wouldn\u2019t have to be broken out as a segment. So we\u2019re going to kind of play that by a year. I\u2019m not sure, I would take the $40 million that was written in the first quarter and just automatically times up by $4 million.","We\u2019re going to have to kind of wait and see what the team is doing the number of deals, the different sizes of the deals. And so we\u2019re going to be watching that assessing it each quarter, but definitely every year as we report on our 10-K. But as it certainly it\u2019s gets a little larger even if we leave it where it is, we will try to provide additional color on that.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. Fair enough. I was assuming that since this quarter of share it was $40 million, this could be pretty close to that throughout the year. So that\u2019s not going to be the case then necessarily?","Mike Sewell","It may not be when you look at the some deal\u2026","Ian Gutterman","Okay.","Mike Sewell","The deals that were abound in 2016 by quarter. I mean it was \u2013 I\u2019m going to round it off and say it was about 20 deals per quarter, where were bound. Some higher, some lower, so we\u2019ll look to kind of wait and see.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. And it\u2019s\u2026","Mike Sewell","Go ahead.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, thanks. I\u2019m sorry. So the other thing I was going to ask about \u2013 the one thing that caught my eye in the quarter. I mean your paid losses were up pretty substantially up over 20% and from looking at the detail, it seems other than comp pretty much everything was up double digits. Any color on why the paid are growing so fast?","Steve Johnston","I would think it would be catastrophe losses that we had in the period that are \u2013 of the short tail nature would have an impact on that.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. The casualty was up a lot too though.","Steve Johnston","And I think\u2026","Ian Gutterman","Casualty was 99% last year\u2019s first quarter, 141% this time, so that\u2019s 40% and adding to 10 year the adverse development where the cases that cause the adverse development that you not a pad on or?","Steve Johnston","We\u2019re going to have to look a little deeper into that. I don\u2019t know that I have that number right in front in terms of the page.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. Okay, the cats up, it doesn\u2019t concern me that much, but obviously when you see casualty pick up at the same time reserves are getting a little tough it just made me wonder if there\u2019s been something additional stressing the book. Okay, and it wasn\u2019t tied to the large claims, I guess it looks like some of the over filing claims were also in the casualty book as well, right?","Steve Johnston","Right, and I don\u2019t have the payout of \u2013 it would be good for us to look and see what the \u2013 where we are in terms of payout of those large casualty losses as well as some of the adverse development that we saw \u2013 where those paid out during the quarter. But I don\u2019t have that absolutely.","Ian Gutterman","Okay.","Mike Sewell","Ian, two of the five claims that J.F. had mentioned on the five losses were comp.","Ian Gutterman","They were comp, actually. Okay, interesting. Okay and I was just going to ask two of those five claims was there \u2013 I know you mentioned that that they were \u2013 there wasn\u2019t any survives correlation. But was there anything by region or size of client or where they more construction or none of the construction anything additional that stood out?","Marty Hollenbeck","Sure. This is Marty, in all the five claims, all five claims each one was in a different state. Two were comp, two were commercial fire. And then we had one general liability exposure. So that\u2019s pretty much of spread.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. And so I\u2019ll say, maybe the geo would be different, but those other ones off see it wouldn\u2019t have been a legal verdict that weren\u2019t against you or anything right? Maybe the geo could have been \u2013 but the others seem fairly straightforward I guess?","Marty Hollenbeck","Correct.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, good to know. I was aware that there were five lawsuits that when the wrong way, that would bother me more than worker\u2019s comp. Okay, so just some bad luck it sounds like.","Marty Hollenbeck","Yes.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. Thank you.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, good questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Arash Soleimani from KBW. Please go ahead.","Arash Soleimani","Hi, I just wanted to ask, did you say already what premiums in force are now for your high net worth business?","Mike Sewell","No, we didn\u2019t say that. Let\u2019s see what we got. It would probably be around $150 million, I would say $150 million to $175 million.","Arash Soleimani","On an annual, okay.","Mike Sewell","Okay.","Arash Soleimani","Can you remind me, you mentioned this earlier but what the book yields versus new money yields are?","Steve Johnston","Current book yield all win is $451 million. And at Q1 we tend to break it out taxable was $438 million, tax-exempt $345 million. In fact of the high net worth, Arash, we were $118 million in annual premiums at year end. So we\u2019re up a little bit from there. So dividing that by four and given a little bit of growth would give you a good estimate for your model.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, great. Thank you very much for the answers.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Fred Nelson from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Fred Nelson","Gentlemen and ladies, I can\u2019t thank you enough for what you\u2019ve done for people that I worked with over the last 25 years of the blessings. To recall that, I get a phenomenal and I just want to say to all of you thank you. It\u2019s been a phenomenal journey and still continues. Now the next thing is, I\u2019m in California and sanctuary cities, sanctuary states, homeless housing, free medical care, free bussing to hospitals, no property taxes, no insurance and maid service. Have you seen this any other place besides California and it is a California market is something that\u2019s still offers opportunity.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Fred. As we\u2019ve gone into California, we\u2019ve gone in with the \u2013 our personal line segment. So far we have not seen the adverse items that you mentioned. But I do think we appreciate your input and will keep our eye on the ball and be alert for those type of things. We take input from a loyal Californian.","Fred Nelson","I went to my local water company and I said, we\u2019re going have water rationing, and they said, how do you figure. I said, you\u2019re going to have a city for homeless of approximately 30,000 to 50,000 people with free water, where is the water going to come from. And they said, oh, we never thought of that. It\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m here to help that\u2019s all. So thank you, gentlemen and ladies.","Steve Johnston","Well, thank you Fred.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor website, www.cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to all of the information is in the far right column via the Quarterly Results quick link.","On this call, you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask their questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room here with us, including Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Executive Vice President, J. F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen.","Please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with the statuary accounting rules and therefore were not reconciled to GAAP.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steven J. Johnston","Good morning. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with you today from (inaudible), where we will meet with agents this afternoon. This is the fourth state among 22 in total that we are visiting during the first and second quarters. Our agents with their optimism, their commitment to our partnership and share goals really energize us. After three state quarters of heavy catastrophe losses, the fourth quarter was profitable, with commercial line, personal line, excess of surplus lines, life insurance and investments all contributing to strong operating earnings. Essentially, all our indicators of longer-term performance are moving in the right direction and that bodes well for creating shareholder value.","Various strategic initiatives are having a positive effect and I\u2019ll highlight several key areas.","As we discussed during our last quarterly conference call, better insurance pricings is a top priority. We are experiencing improvement through a combination of our diligence, plus somewhat more favorable conditions in several markets. Our pricing precision for each policy continues to improve as we gain more experience with our pricing models.","More thinly price risks are getting significantly higher prices. Fourth quarter increases in renewal pricing occurred for each property casualty segment and also, for each major line of business within segments.","As we pre-announced, commercial lines renewal pricing accelerated during the quarter with average increases in the low to mid-single digit range. Just over 80% of our commercial lines renewed at flat or higher prices. For our excess of surplus line segment, renewal prices continue to increase and are solidly in the mid-single digit range.","Pricing changes for that segment have been positive for the last 16 consecutive months. For personal lines, we believe our 10% increase in 2011 renewal premiums is roughly half from higher rates and half from higher policy accounts. Policy retention has remain fairly steady over the past two years with fourth quarter retention in the high upper 80% range for commercialized policies, and then our low to mid 90% range for personal line policies. Our agents are able to sell the value of our products and services. They continue to work with us to implement price increases where they are needed.","The market remains competitive, particularly for new business, while agencies appointed since the beginning of 2010, drove our 6% new business premium increase for 2011. New business written premiums for agents appointed prior to 2010 decreased approximately 2%.","We are seeing plenty of opportunities to grow profitably and are comfortable declining new business opportunities we believe are underpriced. We also continue to gain confidence that our pricing analytics are helping us to distinguish the more attractive new business offerings from the last attractive ones.","In 2011, we appointed 133 new agencies in areas we consider unreserved about a dozen more than we planned at the beginning of the year. During 2012, we planned to appoint around 130 agencies. It takes several years for our new agency to develop the double-digit market share we enjoyed with agencies appointed for 10 years or longer. The accelerated pace of appointments in recent years, plus our commitment to serving all our agencies and our clients put us on a path where we believe we can achieve $5 billion of direct written premium by 2015.","Above all, our emphasize on premium growth is to do so profitably, in order to raise the level of earnings and book value over the long-term.","Our life insurance business also grew in 2011 with earned premiums up 4%; term life, the largest product line rose 9%. Although, life insurance profits remain challenged by the low interest rate environment, our agencies value the ability to offer quality like products and services to their commercial and personal insurance clients.","The year 2011 will be remembered by many for its violent weather and other natural catastrophes. From a financial perspective, our unprecedented catastrophe losses in 2011 were an earnings event rather than a capital event, as we ended the year with higher shareholders equity than at the start of the year.","An important risk management element for keeping our capital strong is an effective reinsurance program, and we have renewed all our primary reinsurance to use for 2012. For our (inaudible) treaties property rates were up approximately 10% and casualty rates were down around 5%.","We chose to add $100 million more to our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage, rating it to $600 million per event and we now retain the first $75 million of loss. For our $500 million event, our net retention is $115 million compared with the $88 million in 2011 and $104 million in 2010.","Assuming stable levels of facultative reinsurance, we estimate that our total 2012 premiums (inaudible) to reinsurers will be approximately $181 million down roughly 16% from 2011 and up about 8% from 2010.","Another important aspect of 2011 high-level catastrophe activity was that it allowed us to showcase our expertise in providing client service. I can thoroughly stand up about how well our claims staff performed and about how our claims response and other elements of our service play an integral role in our ability to profitably grow the company.","We aim to give policyholders consistent value and service through all these storms and we believe shareholders deserve consistency too. The payment of our dividend to shareholders last October marked our 51st consecutive year of increasing dividends, and we are committed to efforts that will benefit shareholders and other stake holders for years to come.","For 2011, our value creation ratio was 6.0%, but that\u2019s below our target range for the annual average and any five-year period. We are encouraged that our book value per share increased despite a catastrophe loss ratio that was three times higher than the annual average for the prior 10 years. Further, we remain confident that various initiatives to improve profitability and grow premiums will continue to bear fruit, driving stronger value creation over the coming year.","Now, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will further comment on results during the quarter and several points regarding our balance sheet.","Michael J. Sewell","Thank you, Steve. And thanks all of you for joining us today. I\u2019ll start by highlighting important the trends in our property, casualty, underwriting performance. While our full-year 2011-combined ratio of 109.2% was disappointing compared to our history and targets, we see several reasons to be optimistic.","On a calendar year basis, the combined ratio before catastrophes improved by $0.07 of a percentage point. Factor out the effect of additional 2011 ceded premiums from reinstating our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty and that improvement was 2.0 percentage points.","On an accident year basis before catastrophes, the combined ratio for accident year 2011 improved by 2.7 percentage points over accident year 2010 after factoring out the effect of reinstatement premiums.","We remain confident about the strength of our loss reserves and development patterns. Our approach is consistent. We aim to remain solidly in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range knowing that it is important for long-term financial performance. Reserve development on prior accident years recognized during 2011 was fairly consistent with 2010 down $0.09 of a point to a ratio of 9.4%.","For favorable reserve development recognized during 2011, 63% was for accident year 2010 inline with 62% for accident year 2009 that was recognized during 2010. For both periods, the balance of favorable development was concentrated in the two next most recent accident years.","Our updated loss and loss expense reserve estimates as of December 31, 2011 show accident years 2010 develop favorably by about six points on a ratio basis, while accident years 2009 and 2008 developed favorably by approximately eight points over the years.","For both 2011 and 2010, our commercial, casualty lines of business was the majority beneficiary of the favorable development. There is no absolute assurance that accident year 2011 will develop in a similar pattern, but we do aim to be consistent in our reserving practices.","During the fourth quarter, we refined our allocation to line of business, segment and accident year for loss expense payments and reserves knowing adjusting other expense or AOE. For the refinement at a zero effect by consolidated property, casualty loss expense reserves in total some lines of business experienced higher incurred loss expenses in some (inaudible). This was a one-time refinement of reserves among the lines of businesses.","The full-year 2011 ratio affect raised on a personal a line segment ratios by approximately three percentage points then lower the commercial line segment ratios by about one point. Some lines of business had larger effects.","Turning to expense management, our insurance operations reflecting focus on improving service and efficiency. The total number of associates and contractors is down 4%, since the end of 2009 and includes a 4% a increase in field associate\u2019s offsets by a 5% decrease in headquarters staff and a 30% decrease in contractors.","Our 2011 property, casualty underwriting expense ratio at 32.2% was 60 basis points lower than last year. We anticipate the expense ratio continuing to benefit from future premium growth and more efficiency in our processes. Investment income is an area where our trend continues to run counter to what the industry is experiencing.","(Inaudible) rose 1% for the year 2011 on a pre-tax basis. A pre-tax yield or above portfolio for year 2011 was 18 basis points lower than the prior year, so interest income continues to face a headwind.","The portfolio had an effective duration of 4.4 years at year-end down from 5.0 years at the end of 2010. Due to an income was the source of our investment income growth during the 2011. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 4% for the fourth quarter and up 5% for the year.","Our equity portfolio also had a nice rebound in valuation during the fourth quarter. The portfolios fair value ended the quarter up 13% reversing the 12% decline during the third quarter.","Pre-tax net unrealized gains for the total investment portfolio reached nearly $1.5 billion at the end of 2011, an increase of 19% from a year earlier. Our investment approach remains consistent and we think the long-term capital appreciation potential is important.","Our capital remains strong and we ended the year with over $1 billion and holding company cash and marketable securities. We are well positioned for capital management purposes and for growing our insurance business.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property, casualty-underwriting profit increased book value by $0.39. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.41.","Shareholders equity changes related to our pension fund, lower book value per share by $0.11, primarily due to the low interest rate environment. It changed an unrealized gain at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized capital gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.07. so change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized capital gains and losses increased book value by $1.22, and we paid $40 and $0.25 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net affect was a book value increase of $1.62 during the fourth quarter to $31.16 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was 6.8%.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steven J. Johnston","Thanks Mike. We have in place a strong foundation both financially and strategically, and we will see better days ahead in terms of company performance. In addition to having the most dedicated associates in the business, we work with the most professional independent agencies in the business. We look forward to strengthening our partnership as we meet with agents at sales meetings across the country over the next four months. We also look forward to meet in person with many investors and shareholders throughout this year and we appreciate your interest in Cincinnati financial Corporation.","With me today to further discuss our results and outlook are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Marty Mullen and Martin Hollenbeck, and we all are available to respond. Steve, we're ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Matt Rohrmann from KBW. Your line is now open.","Steven J. Johnston","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Rohrmann \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Gentlemen, good morning, excellent quarter. two questions, first, on the development side, obviously your details on the pre-announcement about their role development in the property side, I mean then the quarter came in with some excellent results on the casualty side. Just curious what were the primary drivers of the favorable experience on the casualty side? was there anything in there in terms of special settlements or is that just sort of overall trends?","Steven J. Johnston","Matt, I think it was overall trend. We tend to look at the full year and you know it\u2019s going to have variation, but we think we have a very consistent practice. we think it's been consistent over time. We've got reasonable consistency if you look at full years across time, and we think the benefits come from a lot of the hard work, our associates and agents are putting in terms of getting ready, knowing more about our risk, all sorts of underwriting initiatives, front line underwriting by our agents. So we think that\u2019s been the primary driver.","Matthew Rohrmann \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","It feels like workers\u2019 comp is heading the way you wanted to write, Steve?","Steven J. Johnston","Sure. That's one that we\u2019re feeling particularly pleased about. I'll let J.F. would want to add any more comments, because that\u2019s been the real team effort there.","J. F. Scherer","","Yeah. We've talked a lot about the workers\u2019 comp in the last couple of years between a lot of help from predicting modeling and analytics on the pricing side, much more in the way of specialized lost control activity and most especially some of specialized activity we've had in the claims handling area. And we're frankly pretty proud of the improvement we made this year. It appears that the industry is going to go in the opposite direction this year, and we\u2019re confident that we can improve it even beyond what we\u2019ve done already.","Matthew Rohrmann \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. And then last question, as you guys travel around the country doing your meetings, I just want to get a sense of how balanced the strength and pricing is. I mean, is it heavy in the Midwest post the storms, property obviously, but I\u2019m just wondering how broad based that is, as you guys meet with different folks across the board?","Steven J. Johnston","Matt, we feel to be fairly broad based. there's a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of optimism, I think most of the agency folks, as we talk to them. Obviously, every policy is different, every situation is different, we do think it on a risk-by-risk basis, but term and I think it has been pretty uniformly positive in terms of the performance.","J. F. Scherer","Yeah. And I guess I would add a little bit to that. we've only been in Charlotte, Atlanta and Birmingham so far on our trip. So we haven't been out west during the Midwest that we travel a lot. Talk to agencies, many agencies, visit Cincinnati as well. and as Steve said, I think there is an acknowledgment universally that price increases are deliverable. having said that and you all of it now is that many of your reports that new business can still be pretty competitive. So that if you will (inaudible) it's being used to raise rates appropriately, kick it on, and when you're feeling it a very good account only do want to retain, you do want to go to extremes, because if they gets to the marketplace, it will draw our attention. but we're not giving at all from any agent you talk to, any sense of a lack of confidence on their parts to be talking about rate increases with their policyholders.","Matthew Rohrmann \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks very much guys.","Steven J. Johnston","Hey Matt, before we let you go, I want to give hustate some a little bit on the (inaudible) the workers\u2019 comp and so just a clarification and we talked about it in the press release in terms, and Mike in his opening comments about the all other expense we serve. And for the year, again while the calendar year was the same unaffected in terms of allocating to line, the workers\u2019 comp did benefit by about 11 points on the calendar year, by that refinement.","Matthew Rohrmann \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, Steve.","Steven J. Johnston","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","Vincent DeAugustino \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. In the press release commentary, you\u2019d mentioned the possibility of writing as much as $5 billion in premiums by 2015. So just a few questions on that with the first thing, how much of that growth do you think could be driven by accepting business that Cincinnati is already quoting on, but just not meeting your profitability hurdles versus how much of that do you think would need to come from new agents or geographies and accounts. And then second what net written premium to surplus ratio would you anticipate running at, if you could reach that $5 billion target, I'm assuming that you could up the leverage a little bit, but just curious if you would have something in mind?","Steven J. Johnston","Let me just touch briefly on the elements of it. I think the key point is that we want to grow profitably, that\u2019s key. we want to get as much of that growth is from our same agents we can. But we also recognize that we're under served in certain areas where we\u2019re appointing new agents and in terms of the capitalization, we could grow up a bit, we\u2019re running about 0.8 to 1 in terms of our premium surplus ratio. Now we feel confident that as we grow the book profitably, especially when you consider the capital as the whole income, we\u2019ve got plenty of capital to support all the profitable business our agents [can send this].","Vincent DeAugustino \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And I know you just mentioned the impact from work comp on the refinement and the adjusting salaries, but I was curious if you could maybe call that out for personal auto, just because I think that the core underwriting results there looked a little abnormal?","Michael J. Sewell","Yeah. This is Mike Sewell, for the personal auto, the effect was that is increased 8.5 points for the quarter \u2013 for the year, I am sorry, that\u2019s for the year. So we had the workers\u2019 comp was down benefited 11.5 for the year. personal auto was up 8.5. Now I do comment that the personal lines, it was up 2.8, but commercial lines was down 1.0. but overall when you look at the AOE reserve in total, the net reserve from year-to-year, it\u2019s within $2 million between the two years. So it really had a zero effect on total reserves and it\u2019s really just between the lines.","Vincent DeAugustino \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","All right. Thank you very much. It was very helpful.","Steven J. Johnston","Thanks, Vince.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ray Iardella from Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie Bank","Hey good morning guys. Quick question, I guess on the number of agents you guys appointed during the fourth quarter, 32. I mean how much of premium do those agents write; I think you had putout a number for the first three quarters, just curious if those were larger, smaller and relatively similar?","Steven J. Johnston","Well just in the fourth quarter, the agencies would have not contributed a lot to the new business. they\u2019re just up and running, agencies appointed in 2011 were $14.9 million. So it ramps up two, three, four months after they get on board with us. and so there is a contribution there.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie Bank","Okay. Maybe I\u2019m asking the question a little incorrectly. But I think in your presentation, it\u2019s above $1.6 billion in the agents you\u2019d had appointed during 2011, up in the first three quarters. I\u2019m just curious is that another $400 million of upside potential in premiums you guys could write from those new agencies or have you not released that number yet?","Steven J. Johnston","We do track not only the number of agencies we acquired, but the total standard, commercial lines and personal lines premium in those agencies, like we average right now about 22% of the personal lines premiums that our agencies write. So when we make those appointments, we would think over a period of, let\u2019s say 10 years, they\u2019re just from those agencies, we could hit that type of mark, same would be on the commercial line side after 10 years, we write about 10% of the agencies volume. and so we would expect that the lift will get for making those appointments would be in that range.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie Bank","Okay.","Steven J. Johnston","Nothing just happened over the last, let\u2019s say five years, wouldn\u2019t discourage us from believing we couldn\u2019t have the same kind of penetration in agencies we\u2019ve got to appointing recently.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. and then I guess, just talking, I think on the conference call, you guys have talked about the delta between pricing for a one year policies and three year policies and how it had expanded a little bit. I\u2019m just curious when does the commentary about pricing of low-to-mid single-digits, does that encompass both one year and three year policies and then two, could you guys comment on maybe where the delta is between the one and three year policies right now or in the fourth quarter?","Steven J. Johnston","Yes. it does include the one and three year policies in terms of our averages. We would typically charge somewhere in the range of five percentage points difference between a one-year and a three-year policy. and so something would be typical right now for a one-year policy would be in the mid single-digits, 4% or 5%. So we would go up precise 8% or 9% maybe 10% on a three-year policy. The marketplace atmosphere right now is such that there is a lot of \u2013 our three-year policy has always been a strength and most especially the time like this. So we\u2019re being careful to make sure we\u2019re getting a premium for the three-year policy and our agencies are finding that sellable and very attractive to be able to offer that.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess lastly, just thinking about capital. I mean obviously 0.8 [number] surplus a lot of capital at the holding company and I know overtime, you guys have been able to grow book value given the size of the equity allocation. One, I guess, are you guys comfortable about 25% of equities for your total portfolio and then two, I mean do you guys continue to believe you create more shareholder value by holding that extra capital in equities?","Steven J. Johnston","Yeah, make sure by the end of this, I\u2019ve answered your question. So I do believe that we feel comfortable with the 25% in equity. I think as we have growth patterns as the \u2013 what is the excess capital, the definition may have changed a little bit as we went through the \u201808, \u201909 period as we\u2019ve seen weather, we\u2019ve seen. we think for a growing company, it\u2019s good to have strong capital, and that\u2019s been a great thing about the Cincinnati over the 60-year history. we\u2019ve never been constrained by capital to grow. and so we want to make sure that we have plenty of capital to grow. We want to balance that with returning capital to our shareholders and we do that we think with the dividend, with increase about for 51 consecutive years now. we repurchased shares each in the last three quarters. so we\u2019re just going to balance it over that period of time, and make sure, we\u2019ve got plenty of capital to grow, but also make sure that we\u2019re returning capital to our shareholders.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie Bank","That\u2019s very thoughtful and helpful. Thank you. And then last question I guess and I know you guys have talked about the loss adjustment expenses in that the change in allocation there, but I guess for the fourth quarter, it look like the accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes was quite a bit lower just for the business overall versus the first three quarters of the year, sort of 9.30 year-to-date number. I\u2019m just curious was there a true up with the 2011 accident year going on during the fourth quarter or maybe can you talk about some of the thought process in the lower accident year loss ratio.","Steven J. Johnston","We think we\u2019re getting good improvement in the accident year loss ratio. we do feel we were benefited by a little bit by our true up, during the true up of the AOE, during the final calendar quarter, we think probably benefited the accident quarter by about six loss ratio points.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie Bank","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Steven J. Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Steven J. Johnston","Good morning Scott.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. How are you?","Steven J. Johnston","Good.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Just a couple of questions, you gave the $5 billion premium target and I\u2019m just wondering what you foresee E&S per unit as being as part of that $5 billion and also personal lines roughly, do you say and expect next to be somewhere the same personal lines versus commercial and where do you see the E&S being fitting in there?","J.F. Scherer","Scott, this is J.F., I\u2019ll give you a rundown on what we\u2019re projecting in the commercial lines area, we\u2019re looking at about $3.4 billion in personal lines about $1.2 billion, CSU, our excess surplus line subsidiary we\u2019re targeting about $160 million and in life insurance, $290 million. Was it helpful?","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And the next question I have was just on you guys have talked a lot this year, the past several quarters about predictive modeling. And I know you put a lot of effort into that. just wondering is that completely rolled out to fully the most of the lines that you won or is there a more room for that in 2012 and the next couple of years.","Steven J. Johnston","","On the Workers\u2019 comp side, it\u2019s fully rolled out and we have been using now for almost two years. On the commercial line side, it\u2019s in the process and in other words, our entire book of business has been modeled. But we\u2019re coming up on renewals for all of that. and so we still have ways to go, for all of our renewals to have received the contribution of the insight that the model is going to give us.","So it\u2019s in process right now, it\u2019s going we think very well. one indicator that we\u2019d like to see is that there was a question earlier about whether or not we can grow to these levels profitably, writing new business, the new business that it will be required. The model is showing that the new business that we\u2019re writing has drastically improved by virtue of having the model and running the perspective new business through the model, we\u2019re seeing the projected loss ratios on new business are actually very good. and so in addition to agencies being particularly careful with us, when they\u2019ve first put business with us after recent employment. We have the benefit as a model helping us in that particular area.","So in all areas both renewal and in new business, we\u2019re seeing a tremendous benefit from the model, it will continue to be refined, will come out with the next generation of our Workers\u2019 comp model. As you all know, it\u2019s a process, the model it\u2019s not a stationary target, but it\u2019s worked out very well for us.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Right.","Martin H. Hollenbeck","Scott, I might just add a little more about the personal lines as well and that it\u2019s gone through three rate revisions, three annual rate revisions now. it\u2019s really gaining traction and we\u2019ve got plans for fourth. And so in addition to getting more rate, we feel we\u2019re getting on the personal line side as well as commercial to rate were shifts needed and we feel pretty positive about the rate increase and really the shift in the mix of our book towards what we feel that the better risk characteristics.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then along those lines, but the \u2013 as far as new business, what\u2019s the differential between the price increases, you\u2019re seeing on renewal versus new, and is there anywhere, any class, geography in particular you\u2019re pulling back more, because the pricing is a lot more competitive. I know you kind of alluded to workers\u2019 comp a little bit, but is that where most of that is coming from?","Steven J. Johnston","Scott, I\u2019ll address the question on the differential between new and renewal. We think as J.F. mentioned, we\u2019re getting rate adequacy in both areas, but we don\u2019t have a lease with \u2013 let\u2019s say split between how much more adequate or inadequate new versus renewal might be, so from that part of the question.","Michael J. Sewell","Yeah. I would say in terms of where we\u2019re getting the new business, as was mentioned in the release, we are getting a lift from the new appointments that we\u2019ve made. That\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re growing in new business. agencies that were appointed 2009 and previous, they were actually down a bit, I think that\u2019s a commentary on the fact of new business still remains fairly competitive. Just by way of description of the fourth quarter on a direct basis, our casualty premiums were up 3.7%, our property premiums were up 4.3%, commercial auto was up 2.5%, and this is all new business, workers\u2019 comp was down nearly 30%. We don\u2019t view that as an alarming amount, but it does \u2013 it is a reflection on the conservatism that we\u2019re approaching comps. So I\u2019d say as much as anything, we\u2019re pretty satisfied with the flow of new business, they add that\u2019s we\u2019re getting, it\u2019s still competitive, but we\u2019re confident that how we\u2019re pricing, what we end up writing is, we\u2019re in a better position right now than we would have been a year ago.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Good detail. Thanks.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Steven J. Johnston","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.","Good morning folks. I was hoping you might be able to help us get a better sense of the effective tax rate going forward. It\u2019s been jumping around a little bit and maybe you can do help us there?","Steven J. Johnston","Yeah. I think I might add my comment a bit, but I think the main thing is just the mix between our underwriting profit and our investment income and we\u2019ve got a variety of tax rates, underwriting tax that a 35% or gains or tax of 35% or with our dividends received deduction in the municipal bonds, we\u2019ve got varying tax rates there and Mike might have a little more color on that, but I think it\u2019s the variation and where the earnings are coming from and what the tax rate is for that particular bucket.","Michael J. Sewell","You\u2019re exactly right, Steve. And Paul is unlike \u2013 yeah, when you think about the effective tax rate, when we take our pretax GAAP book income, 35% with that being a little bit lower this year than the prior year, which was about $500 million versus $176 million this year. By the time you take the tax-exempt interest in your dividends received deduction out. it ends up bringing you down to a pretty low number. and so then when you calculate that we\u2019re at 5.61 effective tax rate in the current year compared to 24.7 in the prior year. So if we had our earnings from operations been higher, we would have ended up with a more consistent effective tax rate.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.","So should we be bringing about tax rate in the 24 to 25, 26 range that you historically have had?","Michael J. Sewell","If we\u2019re at the normal levels for our operating earnings, yes.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.","Okay.","Michael J. Sewell","Really when you look at Paul the two drivers, that\u2019s going to drive that down is the tax-exempt interest and the dividend received deduction. And so then it\u2019s your operating earnings that really going to be driving at the 35% rate.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.","Terrific, thank you.","Steven J. Johnston","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Adage Capital. Your line is now open.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Hi, good morning guys. I guess first can I get a clarification on the AOE. I think (inaudible) I\u2019m not quite sure, so for example, the 11 and point improvement on workers\u2019 comp was that a one-time catch-up and 2012 won\u2019t include that or will 2012 have a workers\u2019 comp combined ratio that is equal 11 points better than were thought a quarter ago?","Steven J. Johnston","Yeah, that was really a refinement that just occurred that\u2019s not going to be recurring each and every year. So that 11.5% was really just one-time. And then on the go forward basis, the things will look normal. The other, if I look at this commercial \u2013 some of the other ones were a little smaller fluctuations, commercial property was posted a benefit of a 3.5, commercial casualty was up 2% because of it. On the personal line side, homeowners got a benefit of 1.6%.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. And also the reinsurance like, I want to clarify on that; you said your ceded premium will be less in 2012 and 2011? Was that because of the reinstatement paid in 2011 or was that apples-to-apples?","Steven J. Johnston","That\u2019s correct. And that\u2019s because of the reinstatement premium and that\u2019s why we want to get two years, we\u2019re about 8% from where we were two year ago. But I think we did a good job. We look at having had the largest two catastrophe losses in the history of the company. The new RMS \u201811 model has higher estimates for us. So we thought it prudent and conservative to add another $100 million to the top of our layer. We also raised our retention as to $75 million.","And I think one of the positive is, if you look at it and I think (inaudible) talked about that if you would have a $600 million event, we estimate that with only be about 3% of our surplus with this new program would have been 4% of our surplus before. So we think we\u2019ve strengthened our balance sheet, our risk profile by adding that extra $100 million. And I think we\u2019ll pay about $10 million more for the expanded program.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Okay, great. So it sounds like if I take out the extra limit you bought sort of rate online basis, your prices actually didn\u2019t really move too much. It sounds like the 10% increase is essentially is for the extra limit?","Steven J. Johnston","That we didn\u2019t touch that layer of 100 (inaudible) of 100 and we got some rate increase there. It\u2019s a layer we hadn\u2019t touched before and we hit it last year with both events and in 2008 with Hurricane Ike, so we did have rate increase on apples-to-apples on some of the existing limits.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Okay. And were there any changes in terms any restrictions on what\u2019s covered?","Steven J. Johnston","No, I think we were very stable there.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Okay, great. And then just my last one, I guess there were questions as much of the question, but you mentioned obviously trying to get the $5 billion and obviously get there in the right way and maybe in the future calls, you can give us a combined ratio target to go with that?","Steven J. Johnston","We tend to not be real granular in guidance, but we think that we need to be in the 95% to 100% combined ratio in terms of where we are going to be as we grow.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","I still want to make sure we\u2019re thinking below 100 that\u2019s all I wanted to hear. Thank you.","Steven J. Johnston","Definitely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","","Good morning everyone.","Steven J. Johnston","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","I wanted to know little bit about individual lines and reserving policies. So there is a lot of movements going on the reserve depending on what segment I\u2019m looking at? And maybe you can go into \u2013 is there a chief expert directing it, are there various independent actuaries in this segment? How are we getting so much movement in various directions going on?","Steven J. Johnston","This is Steve, and we are consistent. We do, this is our actuarial best estimate recommendations. We think that there is a consistency across time in terms of the methodology and the way we go about our reserving. We have a reserve committee and definitely consistent overtime.","We have outside actuaries that also look at our reserves. I think what added the volatility here in the fourth quarter is the \u2013 this all other expense refinement that we made in this quarter. And I think basically what drove it is as we solve some of the catastrophe losses, where we would have a big reserve go up.","And as we look at the way it was being allocated and we talk to our claims people in terms of where they were actually spending the time. It was indicating that we needed to refine how we allocated the all other expense. And so our actuaries came up with the methodology that lead a little bit more in claim counts also in terms of interviewing the claims people. And so that\u2019s the change, but in total for the calendar year, it was not an impact at all and again we think we\u2019ve got very consistent procedures and controls from our actuarial department.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","So please interrupt me if I\u2019m saying some incorrectly here. So, on property because of all you \u2013 was there very heavily for the significant claims. And you found our claims counter, claim severity with not as aggressive as you initially intended. So there was a significant reserve release based on claims offset slightly by allocating more AOE to those property lines? And then, AOE was taken away from the cash. I\u2019m trying to figure out exactly how all the moving pieces are working there?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, and we understand. It\u2019s a little bit noisy here in this quarter. But you are right; we did have favorable development on the actual estimates of these catastrophe losses. And that is also consistent with our history. As we said here international, I remember the first estimate on the national is getting close to two years ago now. I think we estimated about $35 million for that and it came in to 20 when that was finally settled.","So we are seeing a favorable development. I think it\u2019s the strength attribute to our claims people and that we settled over 31,000 claims with our own people. And I think by getting boots on the ground, getting them out there and getting settled quickly we\u2019re able to bring them in there. So that\u2019s kind of a separate issue. And we benefited the quarter by about three loss ratio points there. Totally separate issue had to do is just how we allocate the \u2013 all other expense and that was a refinement as Mike described here in the fourth quarter.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","In a catastrophe of a year, why would the AOE rise in the casualty lines?","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, I don\u2019t think that the AOE necessarily did rise in the casualty lines. In other words, workers comp had actually went with down so \u2026","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Yeah, yeah.","Unidentified Company Representative","So I think you got it.","Unidentified Company Representative","Josh, when you look at the NOE the incurred for the calendar year ratio, there was no change between the two years. It was 6.3% for each year. So again, it\u2019s just the allocation between the individual lines.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Understood, and completely unrelated in a rising stock market we\u2019ve been having for the last eight to 15 weeks, does this give you an opportunity to take some profits on certain high dividend yielding stocks we are allocating to some that in meets the threshold, what\u2019s going on an allocation among equities?","Martin Hollenbeck","Josh, Martin Hollenbeck. We haven\u2019t dramatically changed a few only. The big run-up in equities last few months really largely just offset the decline in the third quarter of last year. In our type of stocks, the high quality dividend growers generally underperform certainly in 2009. It\u2019s a lesser degree in 2010.","So, we think there is little more room to run. We like as Steve mentioned earlier, the allocation equities and what \u2013 and the type of stock you buy, not just for the long-term growth potentials at the income vehicles, low interest rate environment had we not had the allocation we have two types of stocks we buy. We would show a decline in investment income both for the quarter and a year. So certainly a dividend increases have carried the day for us on the income front in the investment income front.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. Thank you and congratulation on the quarter if I can suggest in the 10-Q or 10-K, please try and hold our hand through all these reserving changes you (inaudible) those great information and I expect you to do so again.","Unidentified Company Representative","We will have that.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","All right, thank you very much.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ray Iardella from Macquarie.

The question is I keep having coming to me in my little business world is, if you are an insurance company and premiums are sold for checks and money comes in and in an interest rate environment is basically zero, what do you do with that money to protect so, but you don\u2019t have a disaster with the money market fund or a bank failure. Where does the money go in the short-term and it doesn\u2019t bring one iota of income back.","Michael J. Sewell","Fred, lot of folks in fall 2008 took notice of what happened with the money markets, we\u2019re very cautious to spread that around and not have big concentrations. Back to cash yields nothing is literally unavoidable these days, so we have to be careful, and we don\u2019t \u2013 we have not increased our risk profile, in any of (inaudible) yield or return. So we\u2019re very cautious out there. We just spread it around.","Fred Nelson \u2013 Crowell, Weedon & Co.","And you can increase your allocation to equities say 4%, 5% and do we have fix your parameters, you kind of meeting that parameter right now and the maximum.","Michael J.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents please visit our Investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time some responses maybe made by others in the room with us, including Cincinnati Insurance Company\u2019s Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer for the Cincinnati Insurance Company, J.F.

These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Johnston","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning everyone. As in recent years, I am speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the fourth stop on our tour of sales meetings with our independent agents and more than 20 states. Meeting annually with agents is essential to our relationship oriented agency strategy. We also enjoy this part of our job and find it energizing. It\u2019s important to sincerely thank our agents in person for contributing to another year of underwriting profit and premium growth and for trusting Cincinnati Insurance as we only opportunity to serve the people and businesses in their communities.","Turning to our financial performance, we feel good about the strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the year 2014. They continue to reflect steady executing in our underwriting and pricing. We had our seventh consecutive quarter as investment income growth and rising valuations in equity security markets help this book value for your company.","Careful underwriting and discipline pricing along with an improved expense ratio led to a fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio of 90.4%, lowering the full year ratio to 95.6%. We are further segmenting our book of business, using pricing position and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy by policy basis. That\u2019s an ongoing focus as we see to further improve underwriting results. We think those actions will continue to provide benefits overtime as we aim for a combine ration below 95% in 2015.","Working with our agents, we benefit from the local presence of our field underwriters who make those decisions for all of our commercial new business. Their decisions are informed by analytics and risk inspecting data from our ongoing loss control program.","We\u2019re pleased that 2014 was another year in which we met our premium growth objective about pacing industry growth. Thanks to stronger intention and satisfactory renewal pricing.","Growth we reported for the quarter reflected the favorable offsetting effect in the same factor the slow growth reported last year the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline - in the last quarter - reported last quarter the 2013 estimate for business in the pipeline. As we noted several time before, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on a single quarter of data for certain measures including premium growth.","Part of our long term strategy is to appoint agencies in areas where we are underrepresented taking care its reserve established agency relationships in the franchised value they enjoy.","In 2014, we appointed 99 new independent agencies and plan to appoint about 100 more in 2015. Our agency partners do a great job helping us retain profitable accounts. Policy retention for both commercial and personal lines was generally consistent with a year ago. Our commercial lines calls your attention continues during the high end of the mid-80% range and person line calls your attention continues in a low to mid-90% range.","We continue to work hard to earn new business through our agencies. New products and services such as expanding programs offered through our target markets department are an important part of growing new business.","We\u2019re also excited by new business opportunities we\u2019ll see by expanding our current products and services aim the high net worth policy holders and offer through our personal lines insurance segment. You\u2019ll hear more about that over the next few quarters as we march towards a longer term goal of $2 billion on annual personal line segment premiums.","Although our new business volume was down from 2013 when new business premiums reached a record level for us, our agency still produced over $1.5 billion in new business premiums in 2014.","For the fourth quarter, average renewal price increases for commercial lines remained in single digit range, a little lower than in the third quarter. That average includes the meeting effect of three year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the fourth quarter. For smaller commercial property and commercial auto policies they renewed during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced increases averaging in the high single digit range and commercial auto averaged increases in the mid-single digit range.","For our personal lines polices, renewal price increase averaged near the high end of the low single digit range. For our excess and surplus line segment, the fourth quarter 2014 average renewal price increases continue in the mid-single digit range. That segment of our business hit our own run in 2014 with the combined ratio below 80% and net written premiums up 20%. Our life insurance subsidiary including income from its investment portfolio produced another quarter of steady earnings and again grew premium in its largest product line term life insurance.","January 1st marked the renewal of our primary property casualty reinsurance treaties. For our risk treaties, terms for 2015 are similar to last year except for increase in our retention by $2 million to $10 million for loss. That change in more favorable rates should results in approximately $21 million less in reinsurance cost those treaties compared with 2014.","Our property catastrophe treaty also has terms last year expected from increasing our retention by $25 million to $100 million per event. We expect our premiums for that treaty to approximately $8 million less to last year.","In conclusion, our primary measure of long term financial performance, the value creation ratio ended 2014 at 12.6%. That result was toward the high end of our target which is an annual ration averaging 10% to 13%. While a healthy stock market contributed majority of the 12.6% was due to the contribution of operating income.","I\u2019ll now ask our Chief Financial Officer Mike Sewell to add his insights of our recent financial performance.","Michael Sewell","Great, thank you Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I\u2019ll start with some analysis of the investment results. The income and book value for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 benefited from our equity investing strategy. Dividend income from our stock portfolio were 6% for the quarter and 13% for the year. And our core portfolio of 50 common stocks, all 50 improved their annual regular dividend over the 12 month period ending December 2014 with a medium increase of 8.3%.","Somewhere to others in our industry, used for our borrowing portfolio continue to decline. The fourth quarter 2014, pre-tax average yield recorded at 4.72% was 13 basis points lower than a year ago, while that measure on a full year was 14 basis lower.","Taxable bonds representing nearly 70% of our bond portfolio, had a pretax yield of approximately 5.25% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. The average yield for new taxable bonds purchased during the quarter was 4.49%. For the same period, our tax exempt bond portfolio yield was 3.78%, and purchases during the quarter yielded 3.26%. Our bond portfolio\u2019s effective duration remained at the same level as one quarter ago at 4.4 years.","Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2014 were up 10% to $873 million contributing to $324 million of net purchases of securities for investment portfolio.","Careful expense management continues to be a priority and together it\u2019s a premium growth contributed to a 1.3 percent points of improvement to our full year 2014 underwriting expense ratio.","We like to analyze the underwriting expense ratios to components, commission and non-commission expenses. The commission components tend to vary with recent year underwriting profitability. They also considered as three year profitability by agency, so with the commission ratio raise it should be more than offset by a lower loss ratio. The non-commission components tends to various result of investments we make in the property casualty business such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise.","Again, we believe that would be worth to trade off of the short terms increase in that component to create overall value for investors and others. We plan to continue to have non-commission expense dollar volume growth more slowly than premium volume producing a favorable effect on the non-commission expense ratio.","Let\u2019s turn to loss reserves. I like to emphasis that we follow a consistent approach and now we\u2019re experienced 26 consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. We continue to hamper reserve reported our balance to be at levels reflecting well into the upper half of the actually estimated range of net loss of loss expense reserves.","Our news release reported higher reserve estimates for our commercial casualty line of business. That translated in 2014 to a lower amount of total property casualty net favorable reverse development on prior at ten years. Although an aggregate, our other lines of businesses were slightly more favorable than in 2014. Once we complete all of our year-end reporting, you\u2019ll be able to further analyze the details. For now, I\u2019ll highlight a few important items.","For long time, we disclose that historical pay loss patterns are key assumption used to make projections necessary for estimate IBNR reserve. During 2014, paid losses for commercial casualty especially related to a few umbrella liability claims it marched at level higher than we expected particularly for accented years 2005 and 2007. Considering that new data, we estimated the commercial casualty IBNR reserve for subsequent accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with recent pass quarters.","Overall, our full year 2014 net favorable development was as usual spread over several accident years including 58% for accident year 2013, 15% for accident year 2012, 17% for accident year 2011 and 10% for all order accident years in aggregate.","The capital liquidity positions the company reflect both strength and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company nearly $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter was up 16% for the year. Our property casualty premiums and surplus ration at 0.9 to 1 continues to provide capital that adequately supports our plans for ongoing growth of insurance operations. We did not purchase additional shares during the fourth quarter.","Full year 2014, share repurchases totaled 450,000 shares of an average price per share of $46.63.","I\u2019ll conclude the prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.40.","The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.06. The changes in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.77 and we declared $0.44 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.13 during the fourth quarter to a record high of $40.14 per share.","Now with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steven Johnston","Thank Mike. In closing our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll note that during the fourth quarter, these ratings and invest occurring the strong ratings of our companies. We were especially pleased that announces positive outlook on the issuer credit ratings of our newest company the Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters.","Since its startup in 2008, our excess and surplus lines business has established a good track record and we expected to continue attracting more of our agents business. That\u2019s just one of many factors that gave us confidence we can perform and benefit shareholders over the coming years. The Board of Directors demonstrated that they issued a confidence by increasing the cash dividend to $0.46 per share that action sets the stage for 55 consecutive years of dividend increases.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward meeting the person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff, Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Matthews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck.","Steven, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the lines of Vincent DeAugustino. Your line is open.","Vincent DeAugustino","Good morning, Cincinnati.","Steven Johnston","Good morning, Venice.","Vincent DeAugustino","Just two I guess starts, the press release noted some actions on the agency management side in terms of territories and then an affirmation of the commitment to agent service. And so I am just curious of any of the plans there reflect any changes in the competitive landscape or if it\u2019s really just that as an affirmation of kind of that agent model.","J.F. Scherer","And so this is J.F. just an affirmation of the agent model that\u2019s the theme of our sales meeting this week is how pleased we are with how they are performing for us. The way we define if for our agencies is that we obviously want to them when it comes to writing the insurance and helping them look their success there. But we\u2019re also very much interested in helping with their business management, agency management, sales management types of things, providing capital for them. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re hitting that there.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay and then just for Steve and Mike. Sorry I was trying follow-on along with the reserve comments and simultaneously moving to your schedule piece which I mean I\u2019ve got a little last year, but I heard thing right, we\u2019re taking IBNR reserve movement primarily on accidents years 2005 and \u201907 for commercial casualty, was that adjust?","Michael Sewell","Yes, that\u2019s exactly where I - they was - really those two areas where we did see some increased payments you know as we do look at paid losses that helps to project our IBNR pitch. And so with some increased payments and then also couple of reserve changes that were really just in those accident years and so is that new information that we usually take consistent approach to setting servers. And so that\u2019s really what we did.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay and I guess like where the\u2026","Steven Johnston","Just I may just tag on there that - this is Steve. As we looked at 2005, 2007, the largest as Mike just mentioned was one claim in 2005, one in 2007 that emerged in the umbrella line. And I think we\u2019ve had 26 years now favorable development. There is two ways we could have looked at that, we could have said well they are normal and we\u2019ll just let that emergence come out of IBNR or I think the prudent approach and consistent with the way we do things as to actually react to that by increasing our factors which would then subsequently roll through the accident years and add additional IBNR to all those accident years.","I think it\u2019s the prudent way to look at that. I mean I think - I am confident as you look at our schedule piece that you will find our reserves and balance sheet at least as strong at the end of \u201914 and should do at the end of \u201913.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay, I guess the route of the question and I appreciate all that Steven at what kind of onboard with. Believe that you guys are acting prudently through what you saying, so no more question there. I guess mechanically when I look at kind of schedule piece, and right now just put and through CMP and then two other liability lines and really IBNR know how years that last year\u2019s maturity is really come small and so when I kind of look at the reserve movements in the quarter and maybe I am not capturing everything with those three line. But am I missing anything there and thinking that by this point of maturity that really shouldn\u2019t be that much movement and I guess that question would then be where these couple of claims just really large in size?","Michael Sewell","Yeah, I think it is more of the normally that I think well for about 5 million movements, about 4. And I do think is we look at where we carry IBNR, there is more uncertainty in the more recent years then there is in the older years and I do think that they tended to be out layers.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay, so sorry to just take that point and kind of confirm my understanding. So was the claim activity on those years and that influent some IBNR moves here in more recent years as well.","Steven Johnston","That\u2019s correct.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay, I understand it much better now, thank you. And then just one last one for Marty on the investment side, so we can obviously see the energy MLP in equity energy investments move around a little bit. So the historical stuff were good with. When I am kind of curious about is, just in the current environment, do you this is an opportunity on the energy side or is it something where you kind of cautiously proceeding?","Marty Hollenbeck","I think we are probably a little bit more cautious. I mean we were fairly probably invested as a sector in the energy a large claims with the other common stock portfolio that is fairly like Chevron. The end of these phases was never particularly large one for us and we had that adding to that and we see years. So I think we are just kind of study our revenue.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay, thanks for all the answers and best of luck guys. Thank you.","Steven Johnston","Thank you, Venice.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Dwelle","Yeah. Good morning. I think you just covered some of my question but just to kind of finalize I guess hopefully finalize on the reserve addition. So the total reserve addition in the quarter was about $32 million in the commercial segment, if nine of it was related to specific claims, what was the total amount of addition and I guess where they are offsetting releases in other areas that kind of made it down to the 32 million?","Steven Johnston","I think that\u2019s true. As looked at the accident year by - for each accident year within each line of business and so you are going to have areas moving in different direction with offset.","Mark Dwelle","Can you provide the amounts of what the overall positive was and the overall negative that net it down to the 32, I suppose I can drive it from the schedule P, but?","Steven Johnston","I am trying to see the 32, this is not my - but on the commercial, on the one item I am looking at and there is quite - total commercial, it was 26 million that was added, 29 million was from commercial casualty scribed in, commercial auto was strength in 15 million, the large offsets was the - made that liability which was favorable by 12 million, workers comp was favorable by 7 million and commercial property was slightly favorable probably 2 million for the quarter.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, maybe I just - maybe I did my math wrong, I was taking the 4.4 combined ration points and dividing it backwards, I guess netting down the catastrophe losses, maybe it comes to that what we\u2019re figuring.","Michael Sewell","That maybe exactly - that\u2019s exactly right. So as Steve said, you do some offsetting and that all those numbers I just I gave a straight over several accident years evenly strength basically.","Mark Dwelle","Got it. Okay.","Steven Johnston","Thank you.","Mark Dwelle","That completely satisfies me on that topic. Let\u2019s move over to new business. The amount of new business in the quarter was a nice uptick relative to last quarter, but it was still down a little bit year-over-year, which I was a little bit surprised that I - any comments you can provide there.","J.F. Scherer","Mark, this is J.F. We mentioned in the release that workers comp was down a fair amount for this year. We had a significant year in 2013 and it\u2019s - that in the area of larger workers comp. It\u2019s an area that we are conservative on very pleased with the progress we are making on the loss ratio for a lot reason. But we just simply did not write as many larger workers comp claims and that can tend to have a slightly muting effect on overall package business, because typically our agents like to put the workers comp with the package.","So I choke that up to conservatives on that particular like of business, maybe overly conservative I suppose, but that would have been a factor. The other factor that occurred and really started occur I think maybe in the second quarter, but clearly I think more carriers are feeling they\u2019ve reached pretty close right accuracy and rather than signaling to their agents that they would be asking for and requiring fairly substantial rate increase that have renewal instead they are defending the renewals more strongly. The atmosphere we are competing in is one where - there aren\u2019t as many but I would consider to be good accounts, easier of more desirable accounts out in the marketplace.","We still have our pipeline for but segmentation is playing through that for every carrier and so the accounts that need the most rate or might have the more poor experience to the ones that are more likely out in the marketplace. So it\u2019s just tougher from that standpoint.","You know few other things I would comment on and I don\u2019t know how that affects our carriers but the M&A activity that\u2019s occurred over the last three, four years, that\u2019s fairly disruptive at the agency level, some producers leave, the acquires change the appetites for some agencies. We react that and in some cases it works out favorable for us and in some cases the consequence might be that we would have point more agencies and that takes a little bit more time for things to gear up.","So very panic but in term of the fact of new business was down, surety act us in surplus lines, the vision continues to call, we think we have tremendous potential there. Personal lines is stabilized and we think that they will see an increase in new business in 2015 there. So it\u2019s maybe little wordy but there is a kind of observations that we have, it\u2019s very reinforcing that out this week with their agencies and here their opinions of the marketplace and their confidence in us. So we\u2019ll keep our pipeline full and we\u2019ll be good selector of business to thing year proceeds.","Mark Dwelle","Great answer J.F., you actually knocked up the next two questions that I was going to ask. Good job, thanks very much.","Steven Johnston","Trying to be efficient.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. You line is open.","Paul Newsome","Good morning, folks. The - if I heard it correctly, you are hoping to get a demand ratio next year below 95 which is about where you were today and tell me if I am wrong. But my first question is that, is that a hope to get the accident year lower as well or is that also function of the normalization of reserve releases actively?","Michael Sewell","You are correct that we do want to have the calendar year go blow 95 but that also implies a actually a year improvement as well and no change in our relative reserve margin.","Paul Newsome","Terrific and then you know big picture. Where do you see the best opportunities for underwriting improvement, is it on the personal line side or the commercial line side?","Steven Johnston","I told mighty since worth here, we\u2019re putting a lot of effort and we\u2019ve mentioned this the last several quarter and to - I guess you might say none of rate related improvement. We still are seeing rate increases both in personal and commercial line as already been mentioned.","J.F. Scherer","I might add, you know particular on the accounts that renew and also lot of what\u2019s being said by agents that have interviewed or brokers that have interviewed, we\u2019re not hearing that of being quite so there is talking to our agencies this week. So we think there is still opportunities with modest rate increase. But we put a lot of effort in the last few years, we\u2019re going to continue to accelerate that in loss control, in claim specialization, in underwriting specialization, so - and just general inspections of business.","So we expect those kinds of activities will help us discover accounts that when we wrote them perhaps years ago, they were better accounts than they are today, so we will react accordingly there. And then our loss control efforts will help mitigation efforts. Marty might want to comment on the claim side of things but the great improvement we\u2019ve had in worker\u2019s comp for example, we think can continue and that the progress we\u2019ve making there and that\u2019s been a combination of loss control, but most especially claim specialization.","Marty Hollenbeck","You know I just add that the continued segmentation is part - is exactly a part of what J.F. was just mentioning and that will continue as well.","Paul Newsome","So that sounds like more opportunity on the commercial side and personalize that, so given the - it\u2019s primarily a commercial lines thing?","J.F. Scherer","Well our loss control would be but the inspection initiative, we\u2019ve been inspecting about a 100,000 structures a year in personal lines and not that are agencies don\u2019t keep track of things but where we\u2019ve taken the approach that we are going to do what our agencies do by really inspecting 100% for example of the all the new business that were writing. And we have quite a few houses and our policies on the books that need someone to take a look at as well. So I fully expected there is going to be lift on personal lines from that initiative.","Steven Johnston","This is Steve. I agree totally with J.F. it was nice to see this year 2014 that all of our business segments came in 100, I think they are all as J.F. mentioned working seriously, they continue to improve and I see improvement potential in all segments.","Paul Newsome","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Joshua Shanker","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Steven Johnston","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Shanker","I was curious about the life insurance business to the extent that over the years I know you\u2019ve always captured the small part of the portfolio, how much capital does it tie up an is it accretive to ROE or above the same ROE as the rest of the business, could you potentially unlock value if you were to send that business elsewhere.","Michael Sewell","Josh, this is Mike. There is a difference between GAAP and stock reporting and how much you need to where you are setting the reserves which ends up with the capital that you have. And so from a GAAP standpoint, you have less reserves that are required, so you have more capital. And so when you look at the capital that we have and it\u2019s producing I would say in round numbers $40 million of net income that is a little bit lower ROE then whether would be on a statutory standpoint. There will be - the states are looking at principle based reserves and when we get there we think we can free up some of the capital at the - in the life company.","If we had this principle based reserves today, I would suspect that our capital in the life company would be somewhere in the $350 million to $400 million range, so there would a 10% ROE that you would have there, which would be right in line with our 10% to 13% go for our DCR. So it\u2019s - we\u2019re excited about the life company, we hope that the principle based reserves will be change, we will get to it and it\u2019s producing a nice result and it\u2019s added to the overall DCR for us.","Joshua Shanker","Do you have any initiative in place to grow it.","Steven Johnston","Do we have any initiative in place to grow the life company?","Joshua Shanker","Yes.","Steven Johnston","We\u2019re still working on that and that\u2019s a part of and we\u2019ve been doing it, they are part of the sales meeting that they go out, trying to really expand the sales especially related to the term product. Our terms product was up 7% for the year which were we\u2019re excited about. Dave Popplewell, the President of the Life Insurance Company is out beating the bushes and he is around the sales meeting, talking to the property casualty agencies about cross selling and been able to increase and improve the top line results. J.F. please?","J.F. Scherer","Josh, 70% of our new life premiums tend to come from property and casualty agencies. One other things that we\u2019re doing is trying to link together our homeowner sales in an automated way through simplified issue polices to write more term insurance and help agencies in the course of writing personalize business.","So that\u2019s been the case, we continue to fortify our field presence in our life insurance company what tends to work very well when you have a good professional is calling on the agencies when it comes to the more business life insurance types of things to help navigate that process.","So yeah, what we continue, it\u2019s a - like a lot of things that we do, it\u2019s a very nice complement to the overall relationship we with our agencies and our agencies appreciate it.","Joshua Shanker","Well, thank you and good luck with that.","Steven Johnston","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent DeAugustino","Hi thanks for taking the follow-up. So I think I may ask this question every year around this time, so here you go. But with the agency sales meetings, I am just curious if agents are giving you any wish where they like to see any new products or maybe it\u2019s a technology which widgets from Cincinnati?","J.F. Scherer","Vincent, we\u2019ve been really hitting them pretty hard with the lot of the things that we\u2019re doing. I\u2019d have to say that the general tone is between what buildup and people is doing in the high net worth area. We\u2019re pleased to hear about that, they are also pleased to hear that when it comes to middle market personal lines. As we are enforcing our activity there, they are pleased with the automation that we have there. We\u2019ve gone through several years, our rate increases pretty down, strong rate increases in the homeowner area and that\u2019s not a strong anyway so the pressure is going there.","CSU is a - we had a lot of feedback on that, our agency is right, ballpark $2 billion in excess and surplus lines premium and so we have tremendous opportunity to growth our ENS company there. We gradually increase our appetite in that line of business. And so they are pleased to hear the news on that. Our target market\u2019s division have 17 programs and that\u2019s going to expand. If there is anything I guess it\u2019s really created most of a wish list or discussion at our sales meetings would be that they would ask we continue to growth that particular division. Every agency, every aggressive agency I would say is they have producers, they go after certain industry class. And well it\u2019s not unusual for carriers to have that but it is but unusual from our standpoint is the fact that we have some managers in those areas they will go out and travel with, agencies go out and make sales calls with those agencies.","So we - maybe we outwork the competition a little bit better in that category. So I would say those would be the major areas that we\u2019ve improved. Loss control continues to be a benefit, our agencies are good at taking our loss control rep, our claims rep and I feel that underwriters have actually on the sales call and feedback we get on that is excellent. So no particular area, cyber has talked about a bit, it\u2019s been talked about by everyone, but that\u2019s on the radar screen for everyone is an emerging coverage that we\u2019re pleased to tell and we have something that works on.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay, sounds good. Thanks for the answers and look forward to talking soon.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Steve Johnston, I turn the call back to you.","Steven Johnston","Thank you Steven and thanks to everyone for joining us today.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.","At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.","Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules, and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.","Now, I'll turn over the call to Steve.","Steven Justus Johnston","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. Operating results for the first quarter of 2018 were better overall than a year ago and reflect improvement in several important areas. Although net income was a negative amount for the quarter, operating income rose 22%.","New accounting requirements this quarter resulted in recognizing in net income the change in unrealized gains for equity securities. In the past, these would have been reported in other comprehensive income and Mike will comment further on that.","Our 97.9% property casualty combined ratio for the first quarter of this year was nearly 2 points better than a year ago. While the effects of lower catastrophe losses through the end of March helped the combined ratio by 4.8 percentage points, other non-catastrophe weather effects increased by 3.5 points and weakened results in our commercial lines and personal lines segments.","Before the combined effect of both these weather-related effects, our first quarter 2018 combined ratio decreased by 0.5 percentage points, compared with first quarter of 2017. We saw results improve for our auto lines of business, while our excess and surplus lines in life insurance segments, as well as Cincinnati Re continued to report solid results.","At the same time, premium growth initiatives continued as planned and we reported another quarter of higher investment income. Our commercial lines segment reported a 1% decrease in net written premiums in the first quarter of 2018. Timing of processing several larger policies reduced what we report as renewal premiums, although most of those policies ultimately renewed during the first few weeks of the second quarter.","As we noted several times in the past, written premium trends can vary significantly for larger policies. That variation also contributed to new business premiums a year ago, growing at an unusually high rate of 18% and creating a tough comparison for this year.","Maintaining the underwriting discipline can also cause short-term variation in written premiums, but we remain confident in our agency centered model to produce profitable long-term growth.","As many of you know, we have the opportunity to meet with many of our appointed agencies in the first part of each year at our sales meetings. As we travelled around the country, one message came through loud and clear, our agents are eager to do business with us and our various service enhancements are making it even easier for them to place their best accounts with us.","We also know from history that new agency appointments provide growth over many years. We typically earn 10% or more of an agency's business within 10 years of a new appointment. That is powerful, especially considering that new appointments over the past five years collectively represent agencies that write more than $24 billion from all companies they represent.","Our associates will remain focused on supporting the outstanding local independent agents, who represent Cincinnati Insurance, as they carefully underwrite each policy and provide personal service to agents and their clients.","Pricing remain generally steady as overall commercial lines estimated average price increases were similar to the fourth quarter, with commercial auto remaining in the high-single-digit range. Our personal lines segment continued its pattern of renewal and new business premium growth with high net worth premiums leading the way in new business.","Estimated average premium increases for personal lines in total were similar to the fourth quarter of 2017 with personal auto average rate increases remaining in the high-single-digit range. Our excess and surplus lines segment experienced another outstanding quarter with a combined ratio of 68.8% and premium growth of 15%.","Cincinnati Re had another quarter of profitable underwriting and premium growth, including the combined ratio of 81.8%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued its steady contribution to net income with first quarter 2018, matching the year ago, despite a decrease in investment gains and it grew term life insurance earned premiums by 8%.","We continue to see benefits of diversifying our business over time, through growth of our life company, our E&S and our reinsurance assumed division. Our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio was negative 2.7% for the first quarter. While net income before investment gain or losses contributed 1.5 percentage points, rising 0.1 percentage points compared with the first quarter of 2017, lower investment valuations during the quarter resulted in the investment gains or losses component contributing negative 4.0 percentage points, compared with the positive contribution of 2.7 points a year ago.","We're keeping our focus on what we can influence, the profitable growth of our insurance business. By doing that, we created a steady flow of cash that our experienced investment professionals can put to work. While the market will have natural variations, we believe our strategy of investing in high-quality bonds and dividend yielding stocks, combined with managing premium growth, to maintain healthy underwriting profits will help us create value for shareholders far into the future.","Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will highlight other important aspects of our financial performance and financial condition.","Michael James Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First quarter 2018 was our 19th consecutive quarter of investment income growth with an increase of 1%, including 8% for dividend income. Following several quarters of increases in unrealized gains for our investment portfolio.","The first quarter experienced a decrease in total investment gains of $412 million, before tax effects and nearly equal contributions from the bond and equity portfolios. Despite that decrease, we ended the quarter with a net appreciated value of nearly $3.1 billion, including more than $2.9 billion in our equity portfolio.","During this quarter, we adopted the new accounting pronouncement ASU 2016-01, which effectively requires the change in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities to be reported in net income versus in other comprehensive income.","Our value creation ratio continues to represent total return, it was not affected by the new accounting. Because we hold a larger amount of equities, our reported net income will be more volatile. But our non-GAAP operating income, we'll still exclude realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, which we believe best reflects our core operating performance.","To illustrate the volatility, consider that net income swung to a negative position in the first quarter 2018 reflecting a decrease of $156 million for the change in fair value of equity securities. Have the accounting standard been effective one quarter sooner, when stock market valuation to generally rising, our fourth quarter 2017 net income would have increased by $256 million.","Taking a closer look at 1% growth in investment income. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield was 4.26% for the first quarter of 2018, down 23 basis points from last year's first quarter. That yield decline continues to reflect the effect of higher yielding bonds that are called or that mature.","Taxable bonds purchased during the first three months of 2018 had an average pretax yield of 4.11%, 27 basis points lower than we experienced a year-ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.32%, down 14 basis points from a year-ago. Cash flow from operating activities continue to provide funds for our investment portfolio.","Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first three months of 2018 totaled $154 million, up $18 million or 13% from the same period a year-ago. We continue to carefully manage expenses, while at the same time investing strategically in our business. Our first quarter 2018 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose 0.6 percentage points from first quarter 2017, primarily due to a refinement in our deferred acquisition costs estimates and slower premium growth.","As reported in our 10-K, we evaluate our capitalization of cost throughout the year. Absent amounts deferred total first quarter 2018 underwriting expenses relative to premiums were consistent with a year-ago.","Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. While our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in first quarter 2018 property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The favorable reserve development benefit our combined ratio by 3.9 percentage points, 0.4 percentage point higher than what we averaged over the past three calendar years. It was against spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 30% for accident year 2017, 15% for accident year 2016, and 55% for 2015 and prior accident years.","Our commercial auto and in personal auto lines of business, each experienced a modest amount of favorable reserve development. For commercial casualty, our largest line of business, we maintain a prudent overall reserve position. And we have disclosed in several recent periods, rising paid losses prompted us to estimate the IBNR reserves at levels more likely to be adequate.","For most prior accident years, we left IBNR reserves at levels that resulted in relatively small amounts of favorable or unfavorable prior accident year development during the first quarter of 2018.","Accident years 2016 and prior in total represented net favorable development, while accident year 2017 was unfavorable due to several factors, including case reserve estimates for umbrella claims that rose more than we expected and drove the total prior accident year unfavorable development of $5 million.","Commercial casualty paid loss amounts for the first quarter of 2018 were slightly less than a year-ago on both current accident year and prior accident year basis. But we prudently established IBNR reserves for the current accident year, approximately 10 percentage points higher than a year-ago. In terms of capital management, we continue an approach consistent with past both financial strength and financial flexibility, we're in excellent shape at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased a total of 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $73.72.","As usual, I'll conclude with the summary of first quarter contributions to book value per share, they represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.14. Life insurance operations added $0.08. Investment income, other than life insurance from reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.42.","Net investment gains for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $1.04. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $0.94. And we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $1.87 during the first quarter to $48.42 per share.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steven Justus Johnston","Thank you, Mike. While the first quarter had some noise in it, I'm encouraged by the steadiness of our results over the long-term. The key to this consistent results lies with our associates, who continue to deliver outstanding service to our agents and their clients, deepening our relationships with them. This spring we hosted associates from our commercial and personalized field marketing department and our loss control department at headquarters for training.","I've enjoyed the opportunity to speak with them, and their enthusiasm for our company and our industry is catchy. Hearing their stories of success and the innovative approaches they take to overcoming challenges, enhances my belief that we have the people, the tools, and the strategies in place that will lead to long-term success. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions, and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.","As a reminder, with Mike, Dennis and me today are J.F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Emilie, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Justus Johnston","Good morning, Arash.","Arash Soleimani","Just wanted to - you may have mentioned this I think in the prepared remarks. Was the decline in bond interest income simply just due to lower yields?","Martin Hollenbeck","This is Marty. Yeah, lower reinvestment yields, in the wake of the financial crisis 2008, 2009, we really loaded up now out of 10-year non-callable corporate paper, very attractive credit spreads. A lot of that paper is now kind of working its way back out of the portfolio. So it's - while we got some relief on purchase yields, we're still getting hit pretty hard on what we're losing to redemptions.","Arash Soleimani","So with that said, should we expect bond interest income to be down year-over-year for quarters two, three and four this year?","Martin Hollenbeck","It's going to be a challenge. I wouldn't go and kind of predict that just yet, one quarter into New Year. We're putting more money into the taxable end of the bond market. So it's going to be a fight. But it won't be much if we do get any increase. So - and it also depends on what interest continue to do.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. Thanks. And my next question is, you had mentioned that the decline in commercial premiums and from the timing of renewals. But you also mentioned some underwriting discipline. So I guess what I wanted to ask was, to what extent did the decline stemmed from conservatism in commercial, casualty premiums. And can you actually be selective in that line? Given that you're a package underwriter, does that make it a bit more challenging to be selective there?","J.F. Scherer","Arash, this is J.F. Yeah, it does make it tougher and the same would be true on the auto line. We have to weigh the entire package. So there may be lines of business where the auto is unprofitable, the rest of the package is profitable, and the same could be true for the casualty. In addition to the timing, and it can be big at times, some of our largest accounts renew in the first quarter of the year. So the timing issue Steve mentioned in the remarks played into it.","I think relative to casualty, there is also some aggressive underwriting that we've been doing, for example, in the nursing homes for example. And they do represent in some cases the largest policies in the company. We've seen some negative trends there. And so, we've non-renewed a fair number, including the largest we had. And the accounts we're keeping, that we're comfortable with, we're getting larger increases on those, upwards of 20%.","Opioid distributors or drug distributors is also a class of business. I should say just general drug distributors. But some states now are attacking the manufacturers of opioids as well as the distributors of opioids, drawing them into levels of responsibility that we wouldn't have contemplated. So we're getting off some of that business.","So relative to your question on the casualty side, there are some pretty drastic steps that we're taking that affect our growth rate in commercial lines. If I can just take the time just to talk a little bit, just in general, growth of commercial lines. We've also taken a look at certain states for example, where the weather has been uncharacteristically bad. So we're getting off some risks that have large footprints of roofs [ph].","For example, one storey Lessor's-Risk-Only types of buildings that are more of a target, a disproportionate target for hail. Auto in general across the country is an area that we've been working very hard on. As was mentioned, our net rate increases in commercial auto is in the upper-single-digits. Even the mid-double-digits on some of the larger auto fleets that we have that are the most competed for.","Yet we're retaining some of those double-digit increases. We measure the dollar inadequacy of our entire book of business, not only by a percentage, but just the total dollar inadequacy, for example on our commercial auto book of business. We've improved that by 53%, that inadequacy. But in the course of being aggressively priced, some of our commercial auto accounts have left and that impacts growth.","An interesting statistics, we actually increased our new business in commercial auto, by 1.1% in the quarter. And that was following a 12.9% increase from 2016 to 2017. But the interesting thing was that we ensured 33% fewer vehicles, still got a 1% increase. And the vehicles that we wrote fewer of were the heavy trucks that are causing most of our loss ratio problems.","So that's an area once again that affected the growth. Workers' comp as is widely reported, NCCI base rate declines on our book of business amounted to a negative 6.2%. Our net rate changes are not that bad, but still that's a headwind that affects the growth in commercial lines. In the positive area, on growth, we continue, as Steve mentioned in remarks, appointing more agents. Just in the last 3.25 years, we've appointed 287 agencies that represent $5.5 billion in total premium that they write.","Submissions are up. The first quarter was a bit of a tough headwind as far as new business. We were up 18% in new business in the first quarter of 2017. But another positive that we would also point out is that our strongest growth in new business is in our lines of business that have the best margins. Management liability for example was up 28.6%, security up 19.4%, inland marine was up 10% in the first quarter. That's carrying a low-70s combined ratio. And that's following a 17.6% increase in 2017.","So I hate to get wordy on here on everything. But there is just - there really were some positives, a really great sign from our viewpoint is that on Ohio, our most profitable state, we grew to 3.1% in commercial lines and new business was up 21%. So we're confident about the growth of commercial lines.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. That was very thorough. And you had mentioned commercial auto a bit. Are we at somewhat of a turning point there, because I also noticed that this was the first time since early 2014 that you guys had favorable development in that line? So are we seeing some more stability there?","Steven Justus Johnston","This is Steve. And yes, I would agree with that.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. And on the workers comp that you mentioned. Do you have any comments, there are some reports of the NCCI pushing for rate decreases related to tax reform in several stages, if you have any comments on that, how much more pressure using that could add existing rate pressure in workers' comp?","Michael James Sewell","I can't say that I could give you any real true color on that. We've read the same thing as you've read. I haven't - and we haven't - I haven't been in any conversations around here as to exactly how much of an effect it could have a lot of reforms, obviously with the kinds of decreases we're seeing in base rates. We have to be careful.","In the industry, some careers are paying incentive commissions going after comp very aggressively. I think, we're consistent year-in, year-out talking about comp is that we approach that line very conservatively. The headwinds of the rate decreases certainly are helping loss ratios. So we're just going to continue to be conservative. And make sure our underwriting guard doesn't go down.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. And just one more, if I can slip it in before re-queuing, you had said in the release that large losses over $1 million were down, but the commercial casualty core loss ratio also increased by large amount as well more than I'd expected. So how do you reconcile those two, where the large losses were down with the core loss ratio is way up?","Steven Justus Johnston","Yes, I would say as we look at, you've seen some of the adverse development in that particular line of business, and our actuaries make to pick for the most recent accident year, they're taking that into consideration. And it was up - I think, it was up about 7.2 points over you pick for the first quarter of 2017. We think that prudent given just what we're seeing in the general trends on the line.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. That's clear. Thank you very much for the answer.","Steven Justus Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","I was wondering, if you could just give us a little bit more detail on the non-cat weather. And I'm a little bit - I've seen this year a couple of the other regions I cover have also had sort of similar more issues. And I'm wondering, if it's more small commercial issue, it's more market commercial issue, because we didn't see some of these problems in the large - at least the companies - the large companies that have reported so far?","Steven Justus Johnston","Paul, I think, it may just be around the geography and so forth, because we did have freezing weather in January, there was a cat. But we notice that, we had a couple of cats in January, the total $18 million. The January non-cat weather was $27 million and there were in areas that were, let's say, adjacent, but not within the designated cat.","So in areas where we're big, such as Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York about 57% of those non-cat weather losses were in the state. So I think, it is much. We go by the PCS definition of cat, in terms of everything from date to geography to cause a loss. And we just had losses, majority of them being of the freezing and collapse type they were just around that definition, but not in it.","Paul Newsome","Is there anything to the thought that, it does seem like everyone, at least the small commercial ones to be in small commercial? Again, I know there is this theme [ph] for this quarter, just a lot of companies saying they want to increase the size of their small commercial business. Are we seeing something new and different on a competitive perspective in small commercial?","Steven Justus Johnston","Well, I think, small commercials always being competitive, and that's certainly something that we compete for. And overtime, I don't know that I pick up the general increase right now and appetite for small commercial. But that's not to say, it isn't there, because as I've said over time, everyone is always competed for small commercial. So it's a very competitive space, and I think it will always has been continue to be.","Paul Newsome","Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the call.","Steven Justus Johnston","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Dwelle","Yeah, good morning. Just few questions. Mike, I think, you'd commented in related to the expense ratio that there was change in the DAC [ph] estimate. That's just one - that's a one-time impact of this quarter, is there an ongoing impact kind of the run rate in that.","Michael James Sewell","Yeah, that's a great question. And - but it is something to begin with that, we do look at our - the deferred amounts or deferred acquisition cost, and how we calculate that on a quarterly basis. And I think, we've indicated that in our 10-K. But we did our refinement in this period, we do survey our people and so forth look at where time has been spend, we do that throughout the year. So with the adjustment this quarter, you're right. It's almost an adjustment refinement in this period. It really should be smooth for the rest of the year, because we're capitalizing less, so what amortized less.","And so we should be little smother throughout the year. I haven't really done an estimate of where we think, we'll be at the end of the year. However, I think the 31.9 is high. And we probably end up towards the end of the year slightly higher than where we ended up the full year 2017. So I'd look forward maybe in the 31.3, 31.4 area. But we're going to have to update that throughout the year.","Mark Dwelle","Okay. That's very helpful. Second question still staying in the commercial lines area. So the overall increase in the accident year loss ratio was about 5 points. And if I understand right, 3.5 points of that was sort of non-cat weather related losses are just reasonably understandable. And so then the remaining 1.5 points that's just getting the IBNR's rate and making a good solid loss pick. Or is there some element in mix? Or other change in there that's elevating that relative to last year?","Steven Justus Johnston","That's a very good observation, Mark. And I think, as we look at what we alluded to a little bit earlier in terms of that higher pick for the commercial casualty, as it went up by about 7.2 points for the current accident year. That had an impact of 2.4 loss ratio points for the entire commercial auto current accident years. So I think that that particular pick right there - commercial casualty that makes up the difference right there and then some.","Mark Dwelle","Okay. That's what I thought. And then, the last question I had really just more of environmental kind of question. In the current market environment, where kind of low-ish single-digit rate increases seem to be the broad prevailing theme. Is your three year policy is that relative advantage or relative disadvantage in this sort of market?","J.F. Scherer","Mark, it's J.F. I think, it's a relative advantage. Contrary to popular belief, people don't like to renew their insurance every single year. So I think, we view it year-in and year-out slightly soft markets, slightly hard markets is an advantage for the company, a lot more stability in the rates. We - so overall, when you consider all things, retention of the kinds of accounts we want to keep. The three year policy is a real positive.","Mark Dwelle","Okay. That's helpful. That's all my question. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ian Gutterman","Hi, thanks. Mark just got one of my question, so just to confirm that J.F. So basically the pressure on the IBNR and commercial casualty is probably continues throughout the year, right, unless something, environment changes. So if I'm trying to think about year-over-year comps until you sort of get to Q4, we should be expecting pressure on the accident year obviously go, obviously forgetting what non-cat or fire might do in the quarter?","Steven Justus Johnston","This is Steve. And good question, Ian. But we look at those every quarter just based on their merits. And just try to pick our best estimate to that particular point in time. So we think we have right now, best estimate for the reserve position for commercial casualty as well as the other lines and for the current accident year, we'll see how the paid losses and claims produce themselves as we rolled through the year.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. But when you put this extra IBNR, I guess, I'm trying to understand maybe sort of the actuarial process. I guess, I'm trying to differentiate, as I guess, maybe between sort of a look at prior year reserves, right. You can see a problem, you can put up extra reserves, and that hopefully puts it in the past versus I would think if you're putting up more IBNR in new business that probably needs to continue at this higher level until the claims trend changes? Or did you sort of put up extra IBNR such a magnitude to sort of cover the full 12 months?","Steven Justus Johnston","I will not say that we put up extra IBNR to cover the full 12 months. I think, we just take it the way we see it. And then, as we see the second quarter unfold we'll just accordingly.","Ian Gutterman","Got it, okay. And then, can you just talk about related to just sort of what's causing these? You talked about sort of types of cases and so forth. But I was hoping maybe you could talk sort of about the - I guess, call litigation environment.","But are we seeing, is it just that as the economies gotten better there has been more incidents of things? Or is it really more of - there has been some surprise settlements and - I'm sorry, surprise judgments and therefore the next settlement ends up being higher than in the past? Or is there a more fraud coming through or debatable fraud, I guess, maybe you can prove it. But that's forcing claims up where, it's harder to get in front of them.","Just sort of on the ground, I guess, I'm wondering sort of what the trends are. It's basically are there bad actors out there, and sort of what are their tactics is, I guess, what I'm trying to get at.","Steven Justus Johnston","And think, speaking to the commercial casualty, I think, it's where we are hear the question. I think part of it is that - well, as all of the above there are a lot of different aspects of it. But if we look at it, say, an umbrella over commercial auto policies. And as we've seen issues with commercial auto over period of time. That is going to - than manifest itself in development on the umbrella.","And so I think that's some what we saw here in the first quarter. We - you might have a late reported December type of commercial auto claim. There is an umbrella attaching. You find out later that the magnitude of it here in March is we investigate the claim and then you are kind of in the position, do you really want to take down that IBNR, this early in the year for unknown event or keep it up. So that you would have, what you would expect to be a sound in prudent estimate.","So I think it's more just looking at the individual circumstances. And there are many of them, which you named a few. But I don't think it's anyone particular driver.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. So it's not like there are some new legal theory that plants are running with it, try to pull calls - I mean, they always are, right. But something that's been more successful, I guess, in normal that's poking holes in coverage or like you hear these stories about litigation funding. I don't know, if that's causing more aggressiveness or there is no sort of story like that. It's more sort of the normal stuff and it's just more elevated than usual?","Martin Mullen","This is Marty Mullen. Actually everything has been pretty steady on the litigation environment as far as coverage interpretations, and litigation breakdown. Our book is pretty broad. So the claims on the commercial casualty range from the umbrella over the auto - in commercial auto, which is just a little volatile. As you've seen the increase in commercial auto, the natural increases on the commercial casualty umbrella over that auto kind of walks along with that.","But we're in about almost 40 states commercially. And the litigation environment state pretty consistent as far as the pitfalls. But there is really no adverse liability changes in the venues that very significant.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, good. That was my main concern. So if I - I was going to move to investment, but I remember I have one quick numbers question. The decline in the other premiums in the commercial was bigger than usual. Can you just remind me what causes that?","Michael James Sewell","Yeah, for the most part in the others. So that's a reinsurance and then also just some other minor changes. So when you look at it in total 1%, the real driver was the renewals and the new premiums. But it's primarily reinsurance that's in the other.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. And is that most of your Q1 event, or should we expect a bigger drag from that other throughout the year?","Michael James Sewell","I'd say that's probably a little bit more of Q1, I mean, it's - those numbers are so small, it can bounce around a little bit. So yeah, I wouldn't focus too much on it.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. Just making sure. And then, so switching to investment side, I guess, first the accounting change, I get the impact in the quarter on the income statement, I just want to make sure on the balance sheet, it looks like $2 billion plus, one from essentially unrealized gains to retained earnings. Is that the right way to think about it?","Michael James Sewell","Yes, it is. So we move $2.5 billion from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. And you really don't seeing any other effect. And that was a kind of 1\/1\/2018, an adjustment that you make at the beginning of the period. So there is really no other effect that you will see on the balance sheet.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. And then $2.5 billion that was sort of accumulative translation, I guess they call it that, right?","Michael James Sewell","Yeah, that's right. And that was net of tax. And so if you look back at our 10-K, in footnote 2 it was about $3.2 billion, I believe of gross unrealized gains related to our equity security. So net of tax that's how you get to the $2.5 billion.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. So the funny thing about\u2026","Michael James Sewell","Now, I mean just - I'm sorry. And realize that that's just, I'll say recognizing for GAAP purposes. We've not recognized a, I'll call it a tax gain for IRS purposes.","Ian Gutterman","Exactly, exactly. So the funny thing about this, Mike, if I'm currently it is, I think for a long time we've all gotten used to sort of book value ex the AOCI being sort stable and book value having swings because of unrealized. Now, I guess, we're going to have two sources of swings. We're going to have bond swings the traditional way in AOCI. And then equity swings they will be essentially through. I mean, they'll go through I guess comprehensive, but they'll end up in retained earnings. So the book value ex-AOCI will have volatility too going forward. Is that the right way to think about it? Does it makes sense with that, what's going to happen?","Michael James Sewell","Yeah, yeah.","Ian Gutterman","Good.","Michael James Sewell","Right, yes. And so, it does add a lot more volatility, which probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But when we present our non-GAAP operating income, it's going to exclude the realized and un-realized no matter if it goes through the income statement or other comprehensive income. That will make it challenging a little bit more in the future that you can't just go to the balance sheet to equity and take out AOCI. So there is that split there.","We did put into the Q this quarter there is a new chart in there, where we thought it would be helpful to have investment gains and losses. And then we stacked that on top of the unrealized investment gains and losses, which therefore you got your fixed equity, your fixed maturities there and your change in unrealized in the equities would be up in the investment gains and losses.","But then you can see the grand total, which for this quarter was a negative $412 million. And then that, you will be able to see ties in with our VCR.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. I'll take a look at that, because I think that's the right way to look at it. If I could - I know I'm going long, but if I could squeeze one more in for Marty. Can you tell me - I could probably add it up, but you probably have it at the tip of your fingers. It seems like technology has become a bigger part of the equity portfolio, just when I look at the positions that have gotten bigger over time or new over time.","Do you have that handy and just sort of what your comfort level is of how much tech you're willing to have?","Martin Hollenbeck","Yeah, I mean, it certainly has grown from what was literally zero probably 15 years ago to - it's still below market level. As of the end of the quarter, we were at 20.6% in information technology, which is 22.1% in the SMP.","It's always been a tough sector for us to keep up with, based on the number of stocks in that sector that actually pay and grow dividends.","Ian Gutterman","Right.","Martin Hollenbeck","That has improved some. But we also have juggernauts like Amazon, which pays no dividend. Or obviously that's actually a discretionary, scratch that one. But Netflix, Facebook et cetera. A lot of these names we just can't own. So it's a limited pool, but we aggressively pursue, trying to at least approach a market way in that area.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, and the one thing I noticed on it was - it looks like, so you had owned Qualcomm for some time. But it looked like you bought a bunch of Broadcom. Was that a merger arb or was that China buy Qualcomm on the cheap through Broadcom. I'm just sort of curious what the motivation was, given there is a lot of news going on there.","Martin Hollenbeck","Yeah, we actually entered in Broadcom just prior to that merger announcement. We're still kind of checking out where we want to end up with that, those two positions.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, because I saw the combined position has become a big position. That's kind of what I would - so that to me. So, okay, great, thank you for all the time. I appreciate it.","Michael James Sewell","Hey, Ian, before you go.","Ian Gutterman","Yeah, yeah.","Michael James Sewell","Just FYI, so if you look at Page 54, which is in the MD&A, at your leisure; you'll see the new chart and we've broken it out in the details. And we actually indicate what is reported in net income and what's reported in AOCI. So we thought that would be beneficial for everyone out there.","Ian Gutterman","Yeah, that sounds great. I'll take a look. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Steven Justus Johnston","Hey, Josh.","Josh Shanker","I want to ask a question about how your underwriters on the ground have flexibility with customers who buy more than one policy from you. To what extent are they pricing the rate change to the customer as opposed to the line of business? And would the pricing of a casualty product affects the pricing of a property product if there is a collection of products within a single customer?","J.F. Scherer","Josh, this is J.F. We model all aspects of the account, the property section, the casualty section, the auto section, the workers' comp section of the policy. So when the underwriter in the field would be quoted on a risk, they're going to get a predictive model score of price adequacy for all of those lines. And as you could imagine, when they couldn't make any discussion to put a piece of business on the books, there can be a little bit of, for lack of better words, horse trading between the lines of business.","If you've got something that for whatever reason, we believe models vary adequately priced, 10%, 20% more than what we think. As far as pricing that we're looking at, it gives us flexibility to take away from, let's say, a line of business and give it back to an underpriced side. So it's - we take a look at each individual account, but by line of business. I hope that made sense.","Josh Shanker","What kind of discretion is in the underwriter's hands on the spot to negotiate with the client?","J.F. Scherer","A lot of it depends on the size of the account. If you're working on small business, the model pricing is awfully accurate. It's hard to really disagree with. And so, the underwriter is really probably rarely make or make very little changes there. The larger the account, the less homogenous the account, the more what you would call non-modeled attribute enter into the decision-making process.","So in any company, the model only knows certain variables. So if you get a large account that has uniqueness to it that aren't contemplated in model pricing. Then the underwriter has flexibility to change the pricing and be more aggressive for example than what the model pricing might indicate. And by the same token, we have certain classes of business, certain risk that just because the underwriter has inspected the risk, worked with loss control on it, we actually don't like it that much. They'll increase what the model might say. We think it's satisfactory enough to write.","Josh Shanker","And has there been a technology rebuild in last few years that's making that easier to happen or where are you in terms of the on the ground flexibility in the moment for the underwriter.","J.F. Scherer","Well, our analytics area, our PARM that we call it, pricing and analytics, our actuarial department has done, make great strides relative to models, the expansion of the granularity of models, and our ability to communicate to our underwriters both inside and out. The analytics is necessary to make an informed decision.","We model our entire book of business on a monthly basis. It's broken down by state. It's broken down by territory. It's broken down by agent. And it's broken down by underwriter and naturally by policy. So I think if you looked at us now versus five years ago, we've done - we continue to make great strides there.","Josh Shanker","Thank you very much for the answers. Take care.","J.F. Scherer","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Zaremski","Hi, gentlemen. Good afternoon.","Steven Justus Johnston","Good. Hello, Mike.","Michael Zaremski","I just wanted to ask one question on workers' comp. So your comments, you mentioned you're being cautious. And clearly that line is shrinking a little bit. But you have also done a great job turning that line around over the last number of years and it looks like it's throwing off a pretty good loss ratio. So I wanted to kind of clarity why you're being cautious.","And just also I know that - I think there are some nuances with Ohio in terms of the workers' comp system there. So I wanted to better understand whether you are actually underweight workers' comp as a line of business for the company or is it just a - I'm looking at it, I'm running the numbers the wrong way and I have to do it state by state?","Steven Justus Johnston","Yeah, Mike, Ohio is a monopolistic state. So we don't write workers' comp on Ohio insurance. We have some agents in Ohio that write risk outside the State of Ohio, that we write workers' comp for. So considering the size of Ohio relative to the overall company, that's going to create an underweighting for workers' comp relative to our entire book of business.","We've also historically took a very conservative approach on comp. And up until the time, and you make a good observation. We're doing pretty well in comp, thanks to some terrific claims initiatives that we put through, loss control initiatives. And as Josh mentioned earlier, the issue of modeling and analytics associated with the pricing of workers' comp, we've seen it go in the right direction.","And when I say conservative, it's not as though we don't want to write comp. We do want to write comp, but we are seeing levels of aggressiveness in certain states and from certain companies that have us shaking our heads from time to time. So, I guess, the point that I wanted to make was that we're pretty pleased with the results we're getting in comp.","But there was some mention in the - I think in the industry that it was - comp was becoming soft and it was profitable, now it's closing in on soft and unprofitable. And we just don't want to follow it into the unprofitable side. So we're a writer and we'll continue to be, but we're going to be cautious.","Michael Zaremski","Just to clarity then, are you - let's just remove Ohio completely, are you underweighting the line of business materially or no?","Steven Justus Johnston","I would say compared to the industry, we probably are. I don't know that number off the top of my head. But I think after having years of being especially conservative and not producing very good results, you'd go back into the 90s, when we would work with our agents, we would happily write the package in the auto. And we would suggest to the agent that if they wanted to put the comp with a mono-line carrier that was fine with us.","As we've - since because of our capabilities in comp improved, we've also - we've been more aggressive here in the last 10, 15 years. Florida is a state for example that because of the environment down there, we don't write any comp there. And we're not active in California so - in commercial lines. We write some accounts out there from out-of-state agents, but we don't have agents on the ground there. So we'd also don't write workers' comp in the State of California.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, got it. Thank you for the color and all the best.","Steven Justus Johnston","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Arash Soleimani","I think just a quick follow-up on the comment you made on rates. Did you say that rates were stable from the fourth quarter to the first quarter or did you see any acceleration or change?","Steven Justus Johnston","We said they were stable.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. And then just wanted to make sure I understood the expense ratio comments properly. So you said 31.9% is high for the year. So it should come down from here. But the next three quarters should be - did you say that it should be pretty stable?","Michael James Sewell","Yeah, so it was high for the quarter, the 31.9% is high for the quarter. I think for the remaining three quarters, we'll see it a bit closer to where it has been back in 2017. If I were to look at the total - if I exclude what is being capitalized and differed, total expenses divided up by the premiums, it's pretty consistent from first quarter this year to first quarter last year.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. So was this first quarter kind of - you basically said you kind of did an analysis to see, hey, like where people are spending their time and what do we need to capitalize, or is this something that's kind of on an annual basis could cause some volatility, this kind of analysis?","Michael James Sewell","It's something that we actually do. Every quarter we're doing that and so, when it looks like we should actually then make an adjustment we do it. But we do surveys every quarter to make sure we're deferring the correct amount.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, I guess, I was just asking, because this quarter it seemed like it was a bigger adjustment than expected. So, I guess, I was just wondering what caused it to be a larger adjustment this time around.","Michael James Sewell","It's just the result of when we're doing our survey. So I would not view it as extraordinary. I'd kind of focus on a low 31 kind of a run rate right now.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up.","Michael James Sewell","Yeah, great. Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters.","Steven Justus Johnston","Okay. Thank you, Emilie. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We hope to see some of you at our Annual Shareholders Meeting, which is Saturday, May 5 at the Cincinnati Art Museum. You're also welcome to listen to our webcast of the meeting available at cinfin.com\/investors.","We look forward to speaking with you again in our second quarter call.

My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call.","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.","At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; and Senior Vice President of Accounting, Theresa Hoffer are also on the call.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.","Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis, good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter 2017 results. Results for the year ended on a high note, with fourth quarter net income up significantly from a 22% increase in non-GAAP operating income plus a benefit of $495 million due to revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from tax reform.","Reflecting our record-high earnings and rising valuations of securities markets, we also reached a new record for book value at $50.29 per share. Our primary long-term measure of financial performance is our value creation ratio or VCR, which was 11.9% for the fourth quarter and 22.9% for full year 2017, with both periods benefiting by approximately seven percentage points from tax reform.","VCR included favorable effects from rising valuations of securities markets, with full year 2017 contributions of 8.6 percentage points from our stock portfolio and 1.1 points from our bond portfolio. Investment income for the year at $609 million also reached a record level.","Each of the items I just highlighted, plus strong performance from our insurance operations, which I\u2019ll cover in a moment, was considered by our Board of Directors and factored into recent decisions to reward shareholders, including a special dividend paid in December and a 6% increase in the regular cash dividend declared in January.","We continue to steadily grow premiums, and our fourth quarter 2017 property casualty combined ratio improved by more than three percentage points. Our fourth quarter 92.9% combined ratio helped improve full year 2017 to 97.5% for our five-year average of 94.6%, and we reported a 29th consecutive year of net favorable reserve development on prior accident years.","Growth at 6% in 2017 net written premiums, contributed to a five year compound annual growth rate of 6.8%, nearly double the property casualty\u2019s industry rate. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve on 2017 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2018 GAAP combined ratio in the low- to mid-90% range.","We also believe our 2018 property casualty premium growth rate can be within a percentage point of 2017. Our 2017 catastrophe loss ratio was a full point above the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather, the significant changes in the industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.","While 2017 ended with many positives, we are closely watching our combined ratios before catastrophe effects, which rose three percentage points during 2017, and we are intensifying our efforts to move in the right direction. Most of our policies are written on a package or account basis, which includes coverages for more than one line of business. It\u2019s important to manage profitability of each line of business within a package as well as for the account in total.","In our opinion, there are several benefits to bundling coverages for insureds. Agencies and our clients appreciate dealing with a single insurance company to provide protection and service, and we seek to retain accounts while also addressing rate adequacy or policy terms and conditions as needed. We apply segmentation principles for each individual policy as underwriters seek to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on expiring policies that are analytics, predictive models and underwriting expertise indicate have relatively weaker pricing.","As an example of our segmentation efforts, I\u2019ll share some pricing details about our general liability coverages, which represent the largest component of our commercial casualty line of business. The least adequately priced part of general liability according to our models averaged 2017 renewal price increases at a percentage in the high single-digit range. Those models indicate the bulk of our general liability business is at or near price adequacy, and average percentage price increases in the low single-digit range, while the most adequately priced portion averaged a small percentage price decrease.","Results for our auto lines of business are starting to show improvement from rate increases and ongoing pricing precision efforts and will continue to direct additional attention to our commercial casualty line of business. Although still profitable, we believe commercial casualty will benefit from the same focused efforts we\u2019ve applied successfully to our Worker\u2019s Compensation and auto lines of business.","Regarding profitability for commercial casualty. On Page 14 of our supplemental financial package, you can see a 3.5% percentage point increase in commercial casualty\u2019s accident year 2017 total ratio for losses and loss expenses relative to the accident year 2016 measured at 12 months.","You can see also a relatively small amount of net unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years. Our fourth quarter 2017 ratio is 0.9, representing $2 million; and a full year 2017 ratio of 1.0, representing $11 million.","Similar to what we have disclosed in the past, rising paid losses prompted us to estimate the IBNR reserves at levels more likely to be adequate, and IBNR represents 3.4 points of the 3.5 percentage point increase I just mentioned for the current accident year measure. Rising paid losses also drove the unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years.","Here are the main takeaways for commercial casualty as we see it. Rising levels of paid amounts in related ratios for some of those more developed accident years influenced our estimate for reserves and resulted in what we believe is a prudent reserve position. Our commercial casualty full year 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 63.9% combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of approximately 96%.","By intensifying our segmentation efforts, we aim to improve profitability over time. Each of our insurance segments experienced another quarter and year of what we consider to be healthy premium growth. For our commercial lines segment, net written premium growth was 3% for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017, with the full year combined ratio of 96.4%.","Overall, commercial line\u2019s estimated average price increases were similar to the third quarter, with commercial auto remaining in the high single-digit range. For our personal lines segment, 9% fourth quarter net written premium growth contributed to full year 2017 growth of 8%. The full year 2017 combined ratio rose 1.6 percentage points with 1.5 points of that from catastrophe effects.","Estimated average premium rate increases for personal lines in total were slightly higher than the third quarter of 2017, with personal auto average rate increases remaining in the high single-digit range. Policy retention rates for commercial and personal lines were similar to a year ago. For commercial lines, our 2017 policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range. And for personal lines, it averaged approximately 90%.","Our excess and surplus lines segment again reported excellent results, with double-digit growth and net written premiums for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 and a full year combined ratio slightly over 70%. Our life insurance subsidiary also made a strong contribution to net income, including a substantial portion of the overall benefit from tax reform and grew fourth quarter 2017 life insurance earned premiums by 11%.","Cincinnati Re returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of 2017, following the quarter where profitability suffered from catastrophe loss effects of extreme weather. With this 87% fourth quarter combined ratio, Cincinnati Re made a nice contribution to our overall earnings. It continues to grow as we expected and helps diversify our business for smoother results over time.","Regarding the significance of tax reform for Cincinnati Financial, I\u2019ll highlight a few items and let Mike address effective tax rate assumptions applicable to 2018. As noted earlier, the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities provided a boost to fourth quarter earnings and book value. Much of that benefit stem from the large amount of unrealized gains embedded in our common stock portfolio, highlighting some of the benefits of our equity investing approach, capital appreciation potential and a tax-efficient way of compounding investment income over the long-term.","While we do not anticipate significant portfolio restructuring in the short run, we do believe we will likely allocate more new money into taxable over tax-exempt bonds. Our allocation to common stocks will remain unchanged. Also to the extent tax reform helps grow the U.S. economy that will create opportunities for profitable premium growth, which in turn can result in greater shareholder value creation.","Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on investor results \u2013 investment results, reserve development and other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Fourth quarter 2017 was our 18th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on both a quarter and full year basis. Dividend income was up 5% for the quarter and 6% for the year, and interest income was up 1% for both of those periods. Our equity portfolio\u2019s unrealized gains continued to rise, up 14% for the quarter to more than $3.1 billion. The bond portfolio\u2019s pretax average yield was 4.34% for the fourth quarter of 2017, down 18 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. That yield decline continues to reflect the effect of higher yielding bonds that continue to be called or that mature.","Taxable bonds purchased during 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.88%, 23 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.29%, up 25 basis points from a year ago, while the total bond portfolio\u2019s effective duration remained at 5.2 years we\u2019ve reported in recent quarters. Cash flow from operating activities continue to provide funds for our investment portfolio.","Funds generated from net operating cash flows on a full year basis again totaled more than $1 billion, down $63 million or 6% from 2016. A $102 million increase in catastrophe losses and loss expenses paid this year was the key contributor to the decrease. In our earnings news release, we disclosed an estimated 2018 effective tax rate for investment income of approximately 16%, assuming pretax investment income amounts and portfolio mix matches 2017.","For all other income, we believe approximately 21% is the appropriate effective tax rate estimate for 2018. Recognizing that amounts of permanent book tax differences vary over time and could cause that estimated percentage to change. We continue to carefully manage expenses while at the same time investing strategically in our business. Our full year 2017 in property casualty underwriting expense ratios rose slightly, up 0.1 percentage point from 2016.","Moving on to loss reserves. Our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years for both the quarter and full year 2017. Favorable reserve development on a full year basis benefit our combined ratio by 2.5 percentage points, one percentage point lower than the average of the prior three years.","In total, 2017 favorable reserve development continued to be spread over most of our major lines of businesses and over several accident years, including 43% for accident year 2016, 8% for accident year 2015, 19% for accident year 2014 and 30% for 2013 and prior accident years.","Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remain stable. We continue to have excellent financial flexibility, including year-end holding company cash and marketable securities that rose 18% from a year ago. Our financial flexibility was increased by recent action by the Board of Directors, which we announced previously, expanding our share repurchase authorization by 15 million shares. To add a bit of perspective, the total repurchase authorization at the beginning of February at just over 17 million shares represents approximately 10% of total outstanding shares.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 300,000 shares at an average price per share of $72.45. Another aspect of capital management is providing liquidity in rare periods of extreme loss activity either from catastrophe events or unusually large individual claims. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per-risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2018 are similar to 2017. Rates rose modestly on a percentage basis in the low single-digit range for the per-risk treaties and likewise for the property catastrophe treaty.","To conclude, I\u2019ll summarize fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.35. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance from reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.57. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $0.05. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $1.48.","Revaluation of our net deferred tax income \u2013 income tax liability as a result of tax reform increased book value by $3.02. And we declared $1 per share in dividends to shareholders, which included a $0.50 per share special dividend. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.43 during the fourth quarter to a record $50.29 per share.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, 2017 ended with many positives. We again achieved strong growth and accomplished a 6th year in a row of underwriting profit. We extended our record of annual dividend increases to 57 years, and we have already set the stage for a 58th year. Last week, A.M. Best recognized our capital strength and upward operating trends by affirming our A+ financial strength rating with a stable outlook and raising our issuer credit rating outlook to positive.","The key to our consistent results lies with our associates, who continue to deliver outstanding service to our agents and their clients, deepening our relationships with our agents and executing on our strategies for long-term success. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.","As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Jamie, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open.","Anthony To","Hi, good morning, this is Anthony in for Arash. Thank you for taking my questions.","Steve Johnston","Good morning.","Anthony To","I wanted to touch on commercial casualty and was wondering if you can provide more color about what\u2019s going on there in respect to loss trends. Specifically, I think you mentioned seeing elevated disparity. How much of that drove the increase?","J.F. Scherer","Anthony, this is J.F. Scherer. Yes, we\u2019re seeing some severity. Some of the good signs we\u2019re seeing, not only in commercial casualty but really across our entire book of business is improvement in frequency over our entire book of business. Despite the economy heating up, despite the fact that there are a lot of inexperienced and \u2013 drivers of driving cars and working in the construction industry, we think our underwriting has paid off in controlling the frequency. But there is a severity increase that we think, as Steve mentioned in his remarks, opportunity for rate increases are our most underpriced casualty part of our book of business. We think we can keep up with it.","Anthony To","Okay, thanks. And I guess to follow up on that, I think we previously spoke about 63% possibly being a suitable run rate. Should we now anticipate 67.5% as the new run rate? And also, why not take a larger charge in commercial casualty and call it a day?","Steve Johnston","I\u2019m not sure, Anthony, I heard those run rates. I think that when we book a reserve, we do our best to do a consistent approach to book what we feel to be the best estimate that we have at the time, and we feel we have a good estimate. I think also, and kind of going back to my set comments, that I think to the extent we\u2019ve seen rising trends, we\u2019ve been able to address it and at the time when we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s still profitable. Now when we add an expected expense ratio there, we\u2019re still under 100%. There are a lot of moving parts in there.","And I think importantly, we have an agency strategy. Within that strategy, we sell most of our accounts on a package basis. Within that package, we have different lines of businesses, coverages moving in different directions. And we consider all those, look at every policy individually. And we feel confident that we\u2019re in a position to address some of these rising trends that we see, we feel that we\u2019ve booked them in our reserves, and we have confidence in the continuation of the profitability of the casualty line.","Anthony To","Okay. And is 6.75% the new kind of suitable run rate?","Steve Johnston","I\u2019m not sure that we provide a run rate. We look at everything, and I think we gave a feeling for overall, where we think we can come in with a combined ratio in the low to mid 90s.","Anthony To","And I guess similarly, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the elevated core loss ratio and Worker\u2019s Comp. And then specifically, what are your thoughts on the pace of state regular actions and how that\u2019ll impact how you\u2019re thinking about in terms of rates going forward?","J.F. Scherer","Yes, I think your point about the state regulatory action, the NCCI has been reducing loss cost factors for the industry, and we monitor that and use those for our rates. That is a headwind for us and for the industry. In addition to that, we\u2019ve seen a pretty \u2013 what I would view is to be a fairly overheated market in the Worker\u2019s Comp area, a lot of aggressive commission approaches that some companies are taking. So as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019re a very conservative writer of. We have not allowed those loss cost decreases that NCCI has put through to completely go through our book of business, so we\u2019re trying to maintain rates best we can there.","I will say relative to new business, our new business writings, whatever we\u2019re writing in new business and comp, has \u2013 we\u2019ve been not paying a new business penalty there. In fact, it\u2019s been more than adequately priced. So I think we\u2019re anticipating that NCCI will continue to come out this year with lower rates, and we\u2019re going to approach how we\u2019ll manage our work comp \u2013 book of business conservatively as a result.","Anthony To","Okay, thank you. Lastly, I guess some housekeeping items. What was the current premiums in-force for high net worth? And then also, can you provide an update on, I guess, the progress of the 10 loss ratio points better than the non-high net worth personal lines business that you previously mentioned?","J.F. Scherer","Sure. We\u2019re at $250 million in high net worth business now. What we\u2019ve seen in terms of the results in our high net worth book of business is the states where we have open high net worth, our new areas of high net worth, are performing very well. Where we sell some elevated large losses in our personal lines book of business, and particularly in the high net worth, we\u2019re in what I would have considered to be the more mass affluent part of that book of business. And with exception of one claim, in states where we\u2019ve been active for a very long time and agencies we\u2019ve been active for a very long time. And so we\u2019re continuing to underwrite and re-underwrite the book of business we had on the book for some period of time.","But as a general statement, very pleased with our results in high net worth, we have quality of business that we\u2019re getting in states like downstate New York; New Jersey; Massachusetts is now open for high net worth; and in particular, California. And we\u2019re very pleased with the quality of business we\u2019re getting and the results we\u2019re getting there as well.","Anthony To","Okay, thank you for the answers. I will return back to the queue.","J.F. Scherer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Yes, good morning, everyone.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Shanker","Good morning. Just wanted to hear your thoughts on taxes impacting the pricing in areas where you guys compete in and what you think the long-term trajectory looks like.","Steve Johnston","This is Steve. And I think the taxes, the tax reform has been very good. I think it\u2019s been most beneficial when we look at fairness. I think it\u2019s really leveled the playing field. I think in terms of the pricing as we go forward, it comes down to elasticity of supply and demand. The perfect \u2013 in a perfectly elastic world, taxes would just flow through as another cost. I think probably the insurance industry is somewhere in the middle there. But I do think over a period of time, a portion of it certainly will pass through in terms of pricing.","But I would emphasize it would be relative to where pricing would otherwise be rather than the current pricing level. We\u2019re all in the area where there are positive loss cost trends, we\u2019re taking rate. But I do think over time there is some elasticity in the P&C industry, and that rates will reflect that. And I think it\u2019s a good thing because it will pass on the benefits of this tax reform to middle-class Americans. I think insurance is the quintessential middle-class product. And to the extent that the tax reform is beneficial in passing on some savings to the \u2013 to our consumers, I think it\u2019s a good thing.","Josh Shanker","So just to clarify, you\u2019re saying the ROE on the business will be the same even if the underwriting margins are different?","Steve Johnston","I didn\u2019t comment on that directly, and there\u2019s a lot of other variables that would play into that. I just think we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out, but I do think it\u2019s going to come down to elasticity of supply and demand. It\u2019s a very competitive industry. As I look at television commercials, I wonder if there would even be television commercials if it wasn\u2019t for the insurance industry. And it just is indicative of how competitive it is out there, taxes are a cost to the extent costs go down. And in a competitive environment, I think people will compete on a cost-based position.","And we feel very optimistic about the impact of tax reform on our business in terms of not only directly on us in terms of tax rates but also on stimulation of business in the United States of which \u2013 that\u2019s where we get most of our premiums from, that\u2019s going to be good for us. The impact on our total return strategy and investing, that\u2019s going to be good. Our investment income is going to have a positive effect and also on the underwriting results. So I think we\u2019re just going to see how this plays out in a competitive environment.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Well, thank you and good luck with it.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Heleniak","Hi, good morning, thanks.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Heleniak","Yes. The first question I just have was just generally about \u2013 most companies this quarter have talked about an improving economy starting to help the top line. I think you referenced that a little bit. And I just wonder if you might be able to quantify what that benefit was maybe this quarter and what it has been, whether you\u2019re seeing a better incremental benefit now versus a few quarters ago.","Steve Johnston","Scott, I think it\u2019s changing quickly enough. I would agree that it\u2019s been beneficial. And I think even more importantly it\u2019s \u2013 I believe it will be \u2013 it will continue to be beneficial and probably at an accelerating rate given the stimulating effect of the tax reform that we\u2019ve had.","J.F. Scherer","Scott, this is J.F. I might add to that is \u2013 and this is part of what I made reference to, is that we are also watching carefully from an underwriting standpoint. One of the things that we\u2019ve noticed in the improving economy in discussions with agents and they with their commercial contractor policyholders is that there\u2019s a fairly significant shortage of workers out there.","We\u2019ve talked about it in the context of drivers. There\u2019s a driver shortage. Consequently, we have to underwrite more aggressively and closely to make certain that we\u2019re identifying inexperienced drivers. And the same would be true for general construction work or any other work involving, let\u2019s say, labor that would be outside younger, inexperienced workers present an additional workers comp exposure, and so we are recognizing that and also underwriting more closely to reflect that.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. Yes, that makes sense. Definitely would have expect to see those kind of trends. The other question I had too along those lines a little bit was the \u2013 was about severity. You mentioned the commercial auto \u2013 commercial casualty, and I\u2019m assuming commercial auto as well. So is that \u2013 are those the only places where you\u2019re seeing that rise in severity? Is the rest of the book pretty much stable?","Steve Johnston","I think for most lines with changes in frequency and severity, in terms of our pricing, I think it\u2019s more predictable when we focus on the loss cost trend, which is the combination of the two. And so we will try to break it down between frequency and severity. But I think we get a more stable result when we look at the long-term trend than just the overall combination or loss cost trend. And we think we\u2019re in a position to keep pace with the loss cost trends.","And from what I\u2019ve seen from the \u2013 out of our models, they\u2019re showing that we\u2019re at least as adequately priced across most all of our lines. Worker\u2019s Comp maybe an exception, but that\u2019s at a very profitable level given the loss cost trends we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re at least as adequately priced as we were a year ago.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And was there any unusual change in non-cat claims year-over-year, non-cat property claims year-over-year? Was there \u2013 how did that look versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter?","Steve Johnston","I think for the fourth quarter, it was fairly tame. Mike is looking up the numbers, but I don\u2019t remember that, that would be a metric that jumped off the page at me.","Mike Sewell","Yes, you\u2019re right, Steve. This is Mike. For the fourth quarter, our non-cat weather losses was about 1.9 points, and that is right on the five-year average at the end of 2017, or the end of 2016, which the five-year average was 1.8 points. So we were right on top of it.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And my final question just is about reinsurance. And I know we talked about this a couple of months ago, but now we, I guess, have a better picture of the \u2013 what the market environment looks like, and you just had January 1 renewals. So you obviously got some nice traction on that business last year, over $100 million in premium, and just wondering if you could update us on how you\u2019re looking at that business. Is there really big opportunity in 2018 to continue to scale that up by a reasonable amount as well?","Steve Johnston","Yes, great question. I think that we are going about it in a very prudent and conservative manner with the focus on profitability. I feel the same way that I had commented about it last quarter. The discipline is coming through in the 1\/1 renewals. If I look at what we did in terms of our property cat book, we only added three new accounts at 1\/1, and we declined 49 opportunities at 1\/1 due to pricing.","Another area where we got growth would be what we would call new contracts on existing clients, and we had two of those. But the preponderance of the growth came from existing clients where we either had some combination of expanding shares, some rate improvement, underlying growth of the companies that we\u2019re reinsuring. So I\u2019m happy with the way that we\u2019re growing. It\u2019s very much consistent, the way we drew up the strategy. We\u2019re executing the plan with the idea that we want to grow the bottom line more so than the focus on the top line.","Scott Heleniak","Okay. Thanks.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Johnston for any closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Okay. Thank you, Jamie. It\u2019s just great to have everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2018 call. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions).","I will now turn the call over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. You may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Late yesterday we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents please visit our Investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the left.","On this call you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time some responses maybe made by others in the room with us, including Cincinnati Insurance Company\u2019s Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer for Cincinnati Insurance Company, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer for Cincinnati Insurance Company, Marty Mullen.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. The quarter included several indicators of good performance, a successfully execution of our agency focused strategy. While we\u2019re not satisfied with the property\/casualty combined ratio over 100%, on a before catastrophe loss basis, it was 90.4% for the first half of 2014. We intend to improve upon that in the second half.","Our second half catastrophe loss ratio has averaged 4.0 points over the past 10 years. If that average holds in the second half of this year, the full year catastrophe affect would be about 7 points or a full point above our full year average over the past 10 years.","Absent weather affects from catastrophes in non-cat weather, our combined ratio for the first six months of 2014 improved over the same period in 2013. Moving forward we continue to work hard on initiatives to improve underwriting performance and be even more diligent in risk selection and pricing on a policy-by-policy basis.","We continue to be confident that our initiatives will drive long term profit and will steadily grow our insurance operations. Our net income per share for the first six months of 2014 was down $0.54 and was a third less than a year ago. Taking a closer look at the number one simple way to isolate the weather affect is from the net income reconciliation we provide near the end of our earnings news release.","After tax insured losses related to weather were $0.63 worse. So before catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses operating income was up $0.17 or 9% better than a year ago. Even with the weather affects, our Commercial Line segment and our Excess and Surplus Line segment reported an underwriting profit for the second quarter and first half of 2014. That is the 8th consecutive quarter of underwriting profit for our Commercial Line segment and the seventh in a row for our Excess and Surplus Line segment.","For the second quarter we again reported healthy premium growth for each insurance segment, including ongoing renewal price increases on average for each property\/casualty segment. In addition to profit improvement and premium growth benefits for more precise pricing, our premium growth was aiding by continuing to appoint outstanding agencies to represent us. In the first half of 2014 we appointed 50 new agencies.","All of our appointed agencies continue to do a great job helping us retain profitable accounts. Our policy retention measure have been steady for several quarters. For Commercial Lines, our retention continued toward the high end of the mid-80s and for Personal Lines it remained in the low to mid-90s.","For the second quarter average renewal price increases for Commercial Lines were in the low single digit range. As a reminder that average includes the muting effect of three year policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the second quarter.","We also continue to obtain more than that the average what we believe it has warranted. Smaller commercial property policy saw second quarter average increases near the upper end of the high single digit range and commercial auto policies averaged increases toward the upper end of the mid-single digit range. For both our Personal Lines and Excess and Surplus Line segments, second quarter 2014 renewal price increases averaged in the mid-single digit range.","Next let\u2019s look ahead to Commercial Lines written premium growth for the third quarter. We reported 16% growth in the third quarter of 2013, in part due to a higher than usual estimate for premiums of policies in effect but not yet processed at that time; business in the pipeline so to speak. We\u2019ll be challenged to report year-over-year growth for that segment in this year\u2019s third quarter.","Our second quarter 2014 new business written premiums slowed compared with a year ago, reflecting pricing and underwriting discipline. For our Commercial Lines new business in particular, we\u2019ve generally seen fewer agency submissions. We believe that\u2019s an indication that the Commercial market in general is approaching price adequacy.","Lower Personal Lines new business premiums were as expected. That reflects our underwriting profitability actions that began around the middle of last year. Those actions included higher premium rates, greater precision in our pricing and changes in our policy terms such as more use of actual cash value coverage for older roofs.","Our Excess and Surplus Lines new business premiums grew substantially, in part due to placing more underwriters in the field to help convey our value proposition to agents. Steady profitability in that segment provides confidence that our growth has been healthy. Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio produced another quarter of solid earnings in premium growth. Investment income was another bright spot for the second quarter. We reported investment income growth for the fourth quarter in a row.","Finally our primary measure of long-term financial performance to value creation ratio continues to be on pace to reach our objectives. At the halfway point for the year, VCR stood at 6.6%, more than halfway toward our target of an annual ratio averaging 10% to 13%.","I\u2019ll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to elaborate on our investment performance and financial items.","Mike Sewell","","Great, thank you Steve and thanks to all you for joining us today. I\u2019ll start by adding a few details about our investment portfolio. The second quarter of 2014 was another one where shareholder value benefited from our equity investing strategy. In addition to our book value increasing from appreciation in our stock portfolio valuation, the bond portfolio also increased significantly. Our stock portfolios pretax and net unrealized gains eclipsed $2 billion and dividend income from the portfolio registered another strong increase, up 13% for the quarter.","Yields for our bond portfolio again moved slightly lower, as the second quarter 2014 pretax average yield reported at 4.76% was 16 basis points lower than a year ago. Taxable bonds representing nearly 70% of our bond portfolio had a pretax yield of approximately 5.26% at the end of the second quarter of 2014. The average yield for new taxable bonds purchased during the quarter was 4.31%. For the same period, our tax exempt bond portfolio yield was 3.83% and purchases during the quarter yielded 3.17%.","Our bond portfolios effective duration measured 4.4 years at the end of the second quarter, down slightly from 4.5 years at yearend. Cash flow from operating activities continues to help boost investment income. At $351 million for the first half of 2014, net operating cash flow was $100 million or 40% higher than the same period a year ago.","Carefully and consistently managing expenses helped to reduce the second quarter and six month underwriting expense ratio by more than a point compared to a year ago. We also continue to follow a consistent approach in setting loss and loss expense reserves seeking to remain well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range.","For the first half of 2014, favorable development on prior accident years at 4.8% was basically in the middle of the 5.6% from the first half of last year and 4.1% the full year 2013 ratio. Our six month 2014 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years including 35% each for accident years 2013 and 2012 and 30% for all order accident years.","Our financial strength and liquidity remains steady and strong. We did not purchase additional shares during the second quarter of 2014. We previously reported a first quarter repurchase of 150,000 shares as a maintenance type action intended to partially offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation programs. Cash and makeable securities at the parent company edged up to $1.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, rising slightly from March 31st and 4% from year end. Our property\/casualty premiums to surplus ratio was still 0.9:1 giving us plenty of capital to support continued premium growth of our insurance business.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared comments as usual by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. Property\/casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.03. Life insurance operations added $0.06, investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.45. The change in unrealized gains at June 30th for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.38. The change in unrealized gains at June 30th for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.62. And we declared $0.44 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.04 during the second quarter to $38.77 per share.","And with that I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. In closing our prepared remarks, I'll note that our financial strength ratings were affirmed during the second quarter by Fitch ratings and Standard & Poor\u2019s and S&P now has a positive outlook on our ratings. The Word Group also recently announced its annual top 50 property\/casualty insurers based on five year performance and we are pleased to again qualify for that honor.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder, with Mike and me today, are J. Schiff, Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Martin Mullen and Margin Hollenbeck. Mike we\u2019re ready for you to open the call for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Bijan Moazami with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","In some of your product lines you guys had tremendous amount of reserve releases. For instance workers compensation, commercial casualty, specialty package, surplus lines, you\u2019ve been getting a fair amount of rate increases as well. What if fail to understand is why quarter-over-quarter the accident year loss ratio assumption on these lines of business aren\u2019t going up? So is there anything in particular going on? Is there any kind of seasonality or just conservatism?","Steve Johnston","Bijan, thank you, good question. I think in terms of seasonality, workers comp might be one line where there is seasonality. But I guess just in general our actuaries do a good job I think of making the best pick they can for each of the accident years. I think we are prudent in terms of the current accident year in terms that there is more variability involved in those years and several of those lines that you mentioned were casualty lines. So we want to make sure to be respectful of the variability in the current accident years. So I think all I just wanted to comment that it\u2019s a very consistent approach that we use and that overall, when we take out the noise we were pleased to see that the core loss ratio or the core combined ratio when we remove the effects of favorable development and weather improved both for the quarter and for half year.","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","If I look at your lines of business, I guess the only line that had an adverse loss reserve in the Commercial Line segment was commercial auto. And it has been a problem for the industry. Travelers pointed out that they have problems there too. Could you walk us through what's going on in there? Is it a frequency issue, a severity issue? How you are dealing with it and should we be expecting a significant improvement in accident year, calendar year loss ratio for that line going forward? ","Steve Johnston","That\u2019s a good question Bijan. And I do think you\u2019re right on target in terms of pointing out commercial auto. My feeling is for our Company, as we came out of the financial crisis, during the financial crisis I think a lot of business activity slowed down. Some business went out of business. And so there was reduction in business activity which I think favorably impacted some of that reserving on commercial auto. We released some reserves to reflect that and I think with the uptick with the recovery we were little slow right off the bat to recognize that in terms of our loss picks. And so I think we\u2019re in little bit of a catch up mode there but I do believe that we do need to improve that line, particularly the physical damage side of commercial auto I think has been a bit problematic lately. And so we do assure you that we are working hard to improve that line of business.","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","Okay, and one last question on your distribution. Of course Marsh has been quite aggressive in expanding Marsh Agency and making acquisitions. I guess they\u2019ve purchased a number of your agents. Is there any kind of pressure and I haven't been seeing any of it on your commission pay. But how is that impacting your production, your commission and what's your outlook in terms of distribution as these agencies are consolidating? ","J.F. Scherer","Bijan, this is J.F. Scherer. The question you\u2019re asking is, are we getting pressure on having to pay higher commissions, as a result of this?","Bijan Moazami - Guggenheim","Yes. And are you seeing better production with some of those agencies now that they are owned by the corporate giant?","J.F. Scherer","Relative to the commission, our commission levels are really the highest in the industry, when you combine base commission with profit sharing commission. All of the acquirers recognize that. And so I would say that no, we really haven\u2019t got any bill pressure to raise commissions. I think they already appreciate collectively, we're already very generous from that standpoint.","To answer your question though in terms of more business as a result of the large - if you will, the giant agencies, the answer really it would be no on that. We\u2019ve, and that changes location to location. We\u2019ve for last 15, 18 years measured our activity levels, resolved a lot of the M&A activity that\u2019s occurred with banks, brokers, things of that nature. What we see is that the profitability that we enjoyed in the agencies before the merger continues, perhaps even it gets a little bit better.","However, what we also see is that as you would -- we might expect there\u2019s a certain amount of dislocation that occurs when a local agent purchase -- sometimes producers leave, there might be slightly different strategies that they acquire or want to implement. So we see only a slight, but a slight tail-off in the level of production, generally when all of this occurs. So nothing that we\u2019re seeing now with Marsh agencies and frankly all of the other acquirers that are out there is really much different then what we\u2019ve seen in the past. We do enjoy a great relationship with the management of those organizations. They recognize the value Cincinnati brings. They\u2019re interested in Cincinnati agents, in large part because I think as a partnership that our agencies and we have enjoyed and it\u2019s resulted in success. So it\u2019s -- there are different, slightly different strategies sometimes with the larger guys, but they are strategies that we\u2019re adapting to.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Good morning. First, an easy one. Do you think the 10 year average is really the right number for us to be looking at for the cat-load? And I guess a piece to that question really is, it does seem like we have an upward trend in weather related losses over the last decade. And if that\u2019s the case, then maybe we shouldn\u2019t be looking at the 10 year average, because that would always be behind the ball?","Steve Johnston","That\u2019s a good question, Paul. I think we put those averages in there just so that you kind of have a baseline, a feel for what\u2019s going on. You can look at it about a year and so forth. When it comes to the actual pricing that we use, we get more granular than that obviously and we\u2019re using modeled results that we use from either RMS, AIR both and I think it has the advantage when you use the modeled results that you can take your current book of business where it\u2019s located today and run the tens of thousands of scenarios that are possible storms to get a good estimate, at least the best estimate of what we feel the catastrophe losses are.","I will say that in areas where we have faced severe convective storm losses and sometimes we\u2019ll judgmentally view that the models are little bit too low or little bit too favorable and will also look at our more recent experience and adjust our estimate accordingly. And when it comes right down to it, rate making pricing is prospective and so we\u2019re just doing our best bet to make our best estimate on what we think the cat losses, the weather losses will be in the upcoming rate period and then price for it accordingly.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","So are you in the camp of like Travelers for example that\u2019s been very vocal about the view that it\u2019s just getting worse and are you taking a much more -- or you see a different approach?","Steve Johnston","I am not as familiar with Travelers' approach but in terms of ours, we are just trying to do our best to estimate what we feel the losses will be in the perspective period. I know for homeowners the weather percentage that we use is about 26 loss ratio points and we just feel based on all the information, whether it be modeled, looking at our own experience, that\u2019s the best estimate for us.","J.F. Scherer","Paul, this is J.F. I guess, I might add that relative to underwriting actions. So we\u2019ve recognized and 2011 was particularly bad year for us, 2013 was a really good year. So there has been a lot of volatility even within the last five, but in addition to what Steve mentioned on rate making, relative to underwriting actions that we\u2019re taking, we\u2019re approaching it from an underwriting standpoint, which just makes sense, as though the hailstorms that are more prevalent with larger hailstones landing at higher speeds, tornadoes, things of that nature would continue. So relative to the actions we\u2019ve taken for example in Personal Lines to make sure that we\u2019re insuring roofs that are more substantial, same would be true for Commercial Lines. We\u2019re pushing percentage, wind and hail deductibles, we\u2019re inspecting more buildings, we\u2019re inspecting more roofs, we\u2019re taking a much more aggressive approach from an underwriting standpoint, not necessarily from a pricing standpoint to anticipate the possibility that that kind of weather could continue.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Putting aside the weather related -- normalizing for weather are we at the place still where rates are exceeding what you believe is the underlying claims inflation?","Steve Johnston","","This is Steve and yes I believe we\u2019re at that point. I think as the market is competitive that that gap may be narrowing a bit. But I do feel that we are exceeding our lost cost trend with our premium increases. I think this is important. Maybe more so is the work nth we\u2019re doing on segmentation and making sure to go policy by policy to feel that we\u2019re getting the appropriate rate for the next risk that we write, no matter where it is, that would consider all the rate making forecast that we do, all the underwriting actions that J.F. mentioned and more. And so we feel that we are continuing to make progress, continuing to make improvement and expect for that to continue.","Operator","Next question is from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","","I wonder if you can give me some reasonable perspective on where you\u2019re seeing the greatest growth in your business, where you\u2019re seeing the toughest competition; and where you expect the best opportunities out for you in the next 24 months.","J.F. Scherer","Josh, taking a look at our new business activity across the country, I can\u2019t say that there's any one particular area that's either any more or less competitive than others. I think breaking it down in the Midwest, South and Southeast for that matter, despite what you read in terms of property rates going down, we see -- still see quite a firmness in property rates and I think it\u2019s a direct result of the storms and the weather activity. I think all carriers are recognizing that. We\u2019re continuing to push for growth and it is improved growth out west and in less cat prone areas. So that\u2019s where the area of focus is.","Now having said that, our most profitable state is Ohio. And so we like to write business here and so we\u2019ll look grow in Ohio. But we are working on much more aggressive geographic diversification. By way of commentary on new business it is more competitive than it has been. I think what we would recognize is that as Steve mentioned in his remarks that there are fewer; I guess you might call it layups, really good accounts that are being shopped. Last year this time there were still carriers announcing their desire for across the board fairly significant increases. That drove a lot of shopping in the marketplace of all accounts, not just underpriced accounts and as a result there were more opportunities for us.","We\u2019re seeing interestingly enough a bit more aggressiveness from the marketplace in worker\u2019s comp, which is an odd line of business to get aggressive about. At least from our view point it is. So we do see that. Our new business is holding up with the exception of worker\u2019s comp and that\u2019s mainly due to what I just mentioned and the fact that we\u2019ve written some -- bit fewer larger accounts in comp. Commercial Auto, for those two lines really is what drove the lack of growth in new business for us. If you take the package business, we\u2019re basically flat, but very pleased with still the opportunities that we\u2019re getting. We just have to be more careful about what we get; more scrutiny, more inspections, more loss control, leveraging the predicted models and the analytics that we have and we\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to grow where we want to grow.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","That's very helpful. When you said that Ohio is your most profitable state, do you mean by margin or by dollar volume?","Steve Johnston","It would be both.","Operator","The next question is from Vincent DeAugustino with KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent DeAugustino - KBW","","One of the things I guess I noticed on your Web site here more recently is that you had a blog posted of some adjacent building fires in the Commercial Line side. I think you posted that last week. And then to that point, a few of your peers have commented on elevated fire losses this quarter and then if I kind of go a step further I'm seeing some elevated commercial lines, large loss activity in both the greater than $500,000 and then the $1 million to $5 million bucket. So I'm kind of curious between triangulating on those three observations, if you guys might have had some elevated commercial fire losses as well.","Marty Mullen","This is Marty Mullen. You\u2019re absolutely correct. Our second quarter kind of mimics some of the other peers in the industry as far as increasing large losses. We saw the same in commercial fire and actually commercial auto losses. We view those losses don\u2019t indicate any exact trends and lines of business or territories kind of spread out across our footprint. As you might guess the frequency in more of our larger states is Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana. It's a unique quarter up for the large losses but we see this both in commercial auto and commercial property and frequency was up in both.","Vincent DeAugustino - KBW","Okay, that\u2019s good to know. And then since we're on commercial auto, clearly this has been a line that's been giving the industry a lot of trouble and it [indiscernible]. I guess for me it doesn\u2019t feel like its purely medical, in part because I think I would expect to see maybe similar pressure on workers comp medical. So I'm just curious if the factor space in commercial auto, just what those factors are that you\u2019re tackling on the claim side? And then generally if there is anything noteworthy that would be helpful I guess for us in understanding how long this drags out because at the same time we\u2019re seeing some of your competitors simply back away from the line and to me that would imply that this really isn\u2019t a quick fix rate problem. So I am just curious with any thoughts that you might have on auto.","Marty Mullen","I\u2019ll just make a comment in regards to the claim question there, Vincent. On the claim side I think you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not so much the medial spend issue; it\u2019s the types of vehicles on the road and the types of impact and collisions driving the severity issues. I do think there's a lot to be gained by the underwriting of your commercial auto piece on the MVR on drivers and knowing what your business makeup is; as the economy has come back, you need to make sure that the drivers they hired have the best MVRs and so forth. So I think there's a lot of be done on the claims and the loss and the loss control piece of the commercial auto. And I know, J.F. has commented before about our focus on that very aspect of it.","J.F. Scherer","Vincent this is J.F. Just going on with Marty\u2019s comments, certainly we\u2019re pushing rate but we\u2019re also doing a lot of work on just making sure that the vehicles in our fleet are property classified. Marty mentioned heavier trucks for example being up more and the business -- the economy is improving, contractors for example, more trucks out there, heavier trucks. They've got a little bit more work. And that\u2019s confirmed by our increase in our audits, our payrolls and sales for the company. But in addition to rate, we\u2019re doing more in loss control and we\u2019re also verifying classification of vehicles, making certain that in the physical damage side of things, that we\u2019ve got the correct cost news on vehicles, the correct gross vehicle weight of the vehicles and then going back to the agencies and verifying the usage of the vehicles and the radius of operation. It\u2019s basically Insurance 101 there. There's nothing unusual about it. But what we see is that there is a lot of room for improvement in those areas.","Vincent DeAugustino - KBW","And then just had one last one. Just on the ongoing discussion rates, I think we tend to be a little too myopic at times. So just in the sequential change from first quarter, just as we think about that over the last few quarters for that matter, I'm just curious if there's been any change in I guess the bid-ask spread between what you're kind of asking for and what you\u2019re actually getting from a rate increase standpoint? Just I guess help us understand if most of the change here is just because more accounts are hitting target hurdles and that just shifts your focus to retaining those profitable accounts; just to get some color on the dynamic.","Steve Johnston","I think it would be the later. I don\u2019t have the total metrics to dispute that first point in terms of the bid ask but in terms of the way we feel about it, we feel that we have been making improvement, that we have been not only getting rate ahead of loss cost trends but we\u2019ve been retaining the ones that we want and that we have been getting more increase or shedding those we want as well. Particularly workers compensation, I'd say that would be kind of a shiny star in that regard in terms of working both, the overall rate increase and the segmentation and all the other attributes, the other parts of underwriting inspection, claims, the whole team approach I think has been working pretty well in workers compensation.","J.F. Scherer","Vincent this is J.F. I would stress that the conversation here isn\u2019t -- and you mentioned myopic. It isn\u2019t just about rate increase. And I'm just confirming what Steve said about the bigger picture of how we\u2019re trying to underwrite every single account case-by-case. The most important thing we can do is make an informed decision. And you can rely on the model in a lot of cases but there is some many attributes of the risk. But if you\u2019re not up to-date on them, if the buildings haven\u2019t been re-inspected, if we\u2019re not 100% certain about rent rules on tenant occupied buildings or whether or not a contractor now that\u2019s enjoying some success is getting into areas of construction and they hadn\u2019t been before, those are all equally important and you can\u2019t attack the problem with rate alone. It won't work. And so we\u2019ve got a multifaceted approach to things that are working pretty good right now.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. Reinsurance sales prices are continuing to climb. Just -- obviously there is an opportunity for savings or better terms and conditions. And just wondering if you can guys can just kind of give us an update on your reinsurance buying strategy, how you see that playing out. Obviously it's more favorable for primary carriers like Cincinnati, but I don't know if you have any thoughts on where you kind of see the heading for you guys?","J.F. Scherer","Well, this is J.F. Most of our treaties are all January 1 renewals and I think we\u2019ve mentioned maybe on the last conference call that we did enjoy some reasonable savings there. It would be in line with what you\u2019re reading in the market place. So really we\u2019re just in the process of beginning our discussions with our reinsurers and then also cat cover guys. We\u2019re very fortunate in that last year we did raise our retention from $7 million to $8 million on per risk basis. That\u2019s part of the strategy. We\u2019ve been very fortunate in that we really haven\u2019t given any losses to reinsurers. So I think they'll be pleased with knock on wood, that that will continue for the rest of the year. We read the same thing as you do, although we haven\u2019t had any negotiations with anyone about the fact that rates continue to go down. Our cat bond was placed last year. We were pleased with the pricing that we got on that. Once again, no losses have been ceded there. So I suspect we\u2019ll go into the negotiations this fall as a continued desirable client for all of our reinsurers and we would hope to enjoy for them and us fair pricing, whatever that may turn out to be.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Just, I know this was covered a little bit in Q1. The expense ratio was down I think 60 basis points in the first quarter and was down 150 or so in the second quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering if that kind of 30% to 31% range, is that sustainable for the second half of the year, that kind of improvement?","Mike Sewell","This is Mike Sewell. That\u2019s probably going to be my favorite topic. So we're very pleased with the, the movement in the expense ratio. We have to wait and see how the rest of year holds up. Some of what\u2019s causing the betterment there is the profit sharing commission that we accrue for during the year related to the business, with our combined ratio being up a little bit. The profit sharing commission will be down a little bit. So we'll have to wait to see how the rest of the year pans out with that. But one thing that will stay, you\u2019ll see the trend continue is that we -- our expenses other expenses, other than commissions are increasing. But we\u2019re increasing it at a moderate rate that is below the increase in premium. So we do monitor the expenses, have controls over it and so I think as we continue through the rest of the year, premiums will outrun other expenses. I think the ratio will stay low, but let\u2019s watch the combined ratio and what the effects of a profit sharing may be of it. It may be up a couple of tenths of a point but it\u2019s not -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be matching the prior year.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just one other quick numbers question. You guys mentioned the Q3 2013, the premium impact from -- I think you said premiums were processed, but not reported. And I was wondering if you had a dollar amount on what you estimate that might have been for Q3 last year?","Mike Sewell","Yes. That\u2019s a great question. At times it can be really difficult to judge one quarter written premium growth rate without thinking about the entire year. There could be some seasonality, timing of large policies written versus typical small commercial policies, where other effects that can cause a premium to spike or dip in a given quarter. Now in the prior year third quarter we experienced a written premium spike that was then really offset by a written premium dip in the fourth quarter and you can actually see that on Page 17 of the supplemental financial data. But on a consolidated basis, written premiums for the third quarter of 2013 was a $1.31 billion followed by a fourth quarter 2013 of $908 million. Now the average of those two periods is consistent with the first two individual quarters of 2013. So as we go into the third quarter of 2014 for written premiums, it will be challenge to have a double digit growth when compared to the prior year period. But there should be an opposite effect when we report the fourth quarter of 2014. So all this being said and sorry for being a little long winded as here, but you will not see this movement in earned premiums, as written premiums are earned overtime which can take up some of those spikes and dips.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Right, okay. Just a timing issue. So, but you did say it will be a challenge for them to be up year-over-year, right, Commercial Lines? Is that what you said?","Mike Sewell","That would be correct, but then when you look at the fourth quarter, we likely will be a very good comparison this year to the fourth quarter last year once you take out the spike and the dip.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The next question is from Mike Zaremski with Alliancy.","Mike Zaremski - Alliancy","","As you guys continue deploying more sophisticated and thorough underwriting techniques and processes, is there any, I guess subsequent change in the actuarial reserving process?","Steve Johnston","All those things would be considered. I think we\u2019re a little bit from Missouri in that regard in that we tend to take a prudent latency approach to make sure that underwriting actions that is described and that we feel will work. I still believe there is a little bit of a latency to make sure that we start to see it in the numbers and I just think that\u2019s consistent with our prudent reserving approach.","Operator","The next question is from Fred Nelson with Crowell Weedon.","Fred Nelson - Crowell Weedon","","The insurance commissioner here in California said that the insurance companies are raising premiums and he wants more control over that increase in the premiums. I'm wondering as a political risk, are you seeing anything across the country that matches the insurance commissioner in California?","Steve Johnston","","This is Steve, good question. We\u2019re not active in California but we are active in 39 states. Each state is a little bit different. We love state regulation by the way because that way the risk is kind of spread across 39 insurance departments. We feel very fortunate here in Ohio, our domiciliary state to have a very good insurance regulation. We think that really results in great competition which keeps the environment competitive, the rates competitive. And so all of our states vary a little bit but I would say that we would not describe regulation at this point to be an issue and that we are supportive of state regulations.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Dennis McDaniel","Okay. Thank you for joining us today, we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. You may begin. ","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you will first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Cincinnati Financial Director, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chief Insurance Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, J.F. Scherer; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; Chief Claims Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, Marty Mullen; and Senior Vice President, Theresa Hoffer.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. ","And now I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather effects are inherently variable and we are comfortable with taking a more prudent position on loss reserves for various parts of our business. We find it satisfying that the full year 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved compared to 2015 while we steadily improved our premium growth.","On a calendar year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.1 percentage points to 87.3%. On a current accident year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.5 percentage points to 90.8%. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain our 2017 combined ratio in the low to mid 90% range and maintain or slightly improve on the 2016 result before catastrophe effects. We also believe our 2017 property casualty premium growth rate can be within a percentage point of 2016. Our full year 2016 catastrophe loss ratio was 1.6 percentage points above the average of the previous 10 years.","We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. While our reserve development on catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter 2016 was favorable, the quarter was unusual in the sense that we experienced loss effects from significant catastrophe events so late in the year. Early in the quarter, we announced a preliminary estimate of Hurricane Matthew losses with a range midpoint of $52.5 million. Our year-end 2016 estimate was $48 million, including $3 million for Cincinnati Re.","Our fourth quarter results also included $9 million of favorable development in total for two large second quarter 2016 events and $4 million for events prior to 2016. It was great to see another quarter of good overall investment performance and Mike will be adding comments regarding investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. As usual, I will highlight several important areas of our insurance operations. Each of our insurance segments experienced another quarter and year of what we consider to be healthy premium growth. Ongoing efforts toward greater pricing precision allow us to underwrite each individual policy with confidence. ","Property casualty new business written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2016 were down 4% from a year ago when we reported a strong growth of 15%. We believe it is more meaningful to look at longer time periods and on a full year basis, new business written premiums were up 4%. Policy retention rates for commercial and personal lines were fairly consistent with a year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range and for personal lines, it continued in a low to mid 90% range.","Pricing in the fourth quarter was generally in line with the third quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced fourth quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single digit range with personal auto near the high end of that range."," Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned and made a nice contribution to property casualty underwriting profit with combined ratios of 84.7% for the fourth quarter and 82.5% for full year 2016. Our seasoned team of reinsurance underwriting and analytics professionals produced $71 million of well-diversified net written premiums in 2016. Nearly half of the 2016 premiums are for property exposures that do include risk of loss from natural catastrophes. The remainder is primarily for casualty exposures from various liability risks.","Our personal line segment continues to be fundamentally made up of middle-market accounts that represent nearly 90% of our personal lines premium with both the homeowner and other personal lines book producing a healthy underwriting profit. Our personal lines operation also continued to perform as planned in its expansion of personalized products and services offered to our agencies' higher net worth clients. In 2016, we improved our high net worth offerings in nearly all of the states where agencies have actively marketed our personal lines products for many years by introducing endorsements which provide agents the option to add coverages similar to our executive Capstone product suite.","In addition, we successfully launched the full Capstone product to agents in New Jersey, California and Colorado. The reception by California agencies was particularly enthusiastic. They produced $2 million in 2016 premiums written in aggregate for us in just five months. We will continue our steady progress in 2017 bringing the Capstone product to agents in Texas, Massachusetts, Washington State and Washington DC.","Performance was again quite good for our commercial lines segment with full year combined ratio below 95% and our excess and surplus lines segment had another excellent year with a combined ratio below 70%. For our life insurance subsidiary, full year 2016 earned premiums grew 9% and net income grew by 17%.","On January 01 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our pro-risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions, as well as rates for 2017 are similar to 2016. During January, we replaced our existing catastrophe bond program with a new collateralized reinsurance structure providing $200 million of earthquake coverage and $80 million of severe convective storm coverage. The coverage period is for three years and expires December 31, 2019.","The earthquake coverage applies to all states except California and the severe convective storm coverage applies to all states except Florida. The storm aggregate coverage provides loss recovery with storm losses for all events in aggregate exceeding $190 million after an $8 million deductible per event.","In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 14.5% for full-year 2016. Contributions included 7.9 percentage points from operating income, 6.8 points from our stock portfolio and negative 0.2 points from our bond portfolio.","For 2017 and beyond, we will continue to diligently manage insurance profitability and drive premium growth. We think our insurance business is in excellent shape and we remain quite confident that the steady efforts of our outstanding associates working with what we believe are the best independent agencies in the business will continue to produce excellent financial performance to benefit shareholders and all other stakeholders.","With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I will begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis and bringing full-year growth to 4%. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income.","Our equity portfolio experienced 10% growth in unrealized gains and offset about two-thirds of the $314 million decrease in the bond portfolio's pretax unrealized gains. In total, we ended 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.6 billion before taxes, including more than $2.3 billion in our equity portfolio. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.52% for the fourth quarter was below the 4.66% from last year's fourth quarter.","During the last half of 2016, we experienced an uptick in dispositions of higher-yielding bonds that were called by issuers contributing to that decline in average yield. Taxable bonds purchased during 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.11%, 37 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.04%, 30 basis points lower than a year ago. And our bond portfolio's effective duration at December 31 was five years, up slightly from 4.9 years at the end of September.","Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for full-year 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago and helped generate $442 million of net purchases of securities. As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses at the same time strategically investing in our business. Our full-year 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.1 percentage points compared with a year ago.","Now for some comments on reserves for losses and loss expenses. 2016 was our 28th consecutive year of reporting favorable development as we continue our consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For full-year 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points, down slightly from full-year 2015.","Favorable reserve development for full-year 2016 occurred in all major lines of businesses except for auto and by accident year included 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014, 16% for accident year 2013 and 5% for 2012 and prior accident years. Overall, reserves at the end of December, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded, rose 8% from last year with IBNR representing more than 60% of that increase.","Various past disclosures described how historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption used to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves. As we reported earlier, paid losses for commercial casualty emerged at levels higher than we previously expected. That included paid losses or reestimates of case reserves for a large 2007 umbrella claim and a large 2012 general liability claim that in recent months increased in aggregate by over $6 million.","Considering updated loss data during the fourth quarter, we estimate a commercial casualty IBNR reserve for several accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with recent quarters. You can see in our financial supplement on page 17 that we recorded an increase of $56 million in commercial casualty total loss and loss expense reserve during the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in that $56 million was $45 million for IBNR, nearly as much as the $58 million we recorded for the first nine months of 2016.","Despite those increases in reserves, our full-year 2016 loss and loss expense ratio for our commercial casualty line of business was 57.5%. Adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 31% or so indicates an estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 90%.","Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 522,428 shares at an average price per share of $70.13. Capital management objectives continue to support the future profitable growth of our insurance operations, plus other areas such as returning capital to shareholders.","I'll conclude my remarks with a summary of contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.09. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.50.","The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $1.21. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.63 and we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.29 during the fourth quarter to $42.95 per share.","And now I will turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Mike. In concluding our prepared remarks, I want to again acknowledge our field claims professionals who work quickly and compassionately to care for policyholders around the country who were impacted by catastrophes late in the year. They represented our company well and at the same time, strengthening the relationships we have with our independent agents.","During the fourth quarter, we also received affirmation of our financial strength ratings from both A.M. Best Company and Fitch Ratings Services. With all major areas of the company performing well, we remain confident that we can deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come.","The Board of Directors demonstrated that they share that confidence by recently increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.50 per share, setting the stage for 57 consecutive years of shareholder dividend increases by your company.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff, Jr., J.F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer.","Amy, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Arash Soleimani of KBW. Your line is open.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. Good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Arash.","Arash Soleimani","Good morning. Just a few questions. So back to the commercial casualty. Is the takeaway there basically that we should not expect the adverse development there to continue, you kind of feel you've gotten a handle on it and it's now set at the appropriate levels going forward?","Steve Johnston","Yes, Arash, I think that's a fair way to say that. I think we took prudent action and we look at the long term. I think if we look at the full year, things look to be in a good position and with a streak of 28 years of consecutive favorable development, you can count us to take appropriate measure here in the short term to put ourselves in a position where we are good for the long term and as we look back at year-end 2016 and five years from now, we want to be able to look back at it and feel good about it and we feel we are in a good place.","Arash Soleimani","And the other question, so it looks like the core loss ratio there this quarter, excluding development, was 61.1% versus about 61.5% last year in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about \u2013 just given the development issues that you had mentioned, what allowed it to actually go down on a core basis year-over-year?","Steve Johnston","Well, as our actuaries take a look at that, they are looking at all sorts of trends for many different years and so the development that we would see pertains to what we saw in paid loss trends that would go back to some of the years that Mike described in his prepared comments back 2012, 2007. So in addition to taking note of that, I think we prudently increased the IBNR. We could have taken those one-offs and kind of ignored that, but we took the opportunity to be prudent, increase the IBNR and that's not necessarily going to impact our view of the business as we currently stand for the current accident year. And I think also as Mike pointed out, we feel good about the profitability of the casualty line and we feel good about the solid reserve position we are in.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. And can you just talk about \u2013 you had some expense ratio improvement in the quarter, just what drove that? Looks mostly within the commercial segment.","Mike Sewell","Yeah, sure. Yeah, on the expense ratio, we are increasing what we are spending currently right now and so it did go up a little bit for the year. So overall for the year, it was up 0.1, but, for the quarter, as you rightfully pointed out, it was down 0.4 and so some of that driver was because of some of the higher catastrophe losses that did occur in the fourth quarter, that did affect some of the profit sharing that goes out to the agents and so forth. So that was really \u2013 the main driver was that. So the higher losses in the fourth quarter.","Arash Soleimani","Thank you. And my very last question, the premium growth was a bit slower this quarter than it was in the past few quarters. Anything to read into there?","Steve Johnston","I think we still feel strong about our prospects for growth. I think we tend to again look to the longer term, look to the full year. We feel confident in our growth. And as I mentioned in my comments, we feel that we can be in that range of growth as we go forward into 2017 and just know that we are always going to prudently look at each policy that's presented to us risk by risk, try to make the best decisions we can, and we always counsel that the very next policy that we write we want to make sure that it\u2019s priced well on a risk adjusted basis and we feel confident that we are doing that and feel good about both our prospects for growth and profitability going into 2017.","Arash Soleimani","Great. Thank you very much for the answers.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Arash. Great questions.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome","Good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Newsome","Last year, you had a special dividend. This year, you didn't. I'm curious as to what was different in the thought pattern and as well as the facts this year versus last with respect to the dividend policy.","Steve Johnston","That's a good question, Paul. And we look at all of our dividend decisions very carefully. Last year \u2013 and we were trying our best to get the word out that it was a special dividend, that it was in reflection of operating performance in 2015 that was just what we felt to be above and beyond that 91.1% combined ratio that we posted in 2015 and we were really trying to make sure that we were communicating that it was, in fact, a one-time dividend that was reflective of that operating performance last year or specifically 2015. But we are going to, with our Board, be very thoughtful when it comes to all of our capital management decisions and that would include the regular dividend, repurchases, any other special dividends that we might do and we will keep a close eye and shareholders in mind there.","Paul Newsome","So does that then imply if we have another year, knock on wood, of a very low combined ratio in 2017 that there's a good chance for a special dividend at the end of the year?","Steve Johnston","I wouldn't say that. I would say that we will look at the operating performance, the capital position, tax rates, changes in the economy. Our Board is very good at looking at all considerations when it comes to dividends. Our streak of now going on 57 years of increases is something that we take very seriously and returning cash to current shareholders very seriously and so we will, in conjunction with the Board, look at all relevant operating and balance sheet and economy type information as we make our decisions.","Paul Newsome","And then I would like to beat the commercial casualty dead horse one more time. As I understand it, you had a couple of very large case reserves that proved deficient. Did those \u2013 could you give us a sense of how much those case reserves in particular would affect the view of what happened with the increase in IBNR, or were they completely excluded? It sounds like they were one-off, but maybe they weren't, maybe they were part of the bigger picture there as well.","Steve Johnston","Yes, it's good and it's good that we talk about it and it's a good question to raise again. I think one thing to keep in mind, when you look at \u2013 and you'll get a chance when the K comes out, Schedule P is available \u2013 when you look at the casualty line for every accident year at our initial pick, we are under that. We are under those initial pick numbers now. There's been favorable development. What we did see as we hit a bottom is those accident years aged. We did see some claims that emerged, but keep in mind that would be an increase of over where we had the year picked last year, but still well below the initial pick.","So then you have a decision to make. Is that a one-off; is it something that we should just ignore? And I think given the prudence that we've displayed every year, the decision was more to be cautious and say is that maybe a forbearer of things to come and should we raise the IBNR, which we did and again emphasizing the point Mike made that we still feel very good about the prospects for commercial casualty, its profitability.","As he put out the kind of hypothetical expense ratio there, we are running in the 90% range combined and feel good about it. But you know the way we are and we are not going to take anything that we see in the reserves lightly and we are going to react to them. We are not going to worry about the short-term as much as we are going to look at long-term. Everything we do involves long-term thinking.","Paul Newsome","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Yeah, good morning, everyone. How you doing today?","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Josh. We are doing well.","Josh Shanker","Good, good. I may have some claims here in New York, let\u2019s see what happens.","Steve Johnston","I saw a little snow on the ground on the news this morning.","Josh Shanker","Yeah, yeah. So I read that you've changed some technology on the personal line. I think it's to get more in line with technology today to be successful with comparative raters. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on and why that's a good move for Cincinnati?","J.F. Scherer","Josh, this is J.F. I'm not so sure that I know what you are referring to there. We did say that we had filed endorsements to our homeowner program in the bulk of the states we do business to make it more closely aligned with our Capstone, which is our high net worth program, but as far as any real technology changes, I don't think we've done any of that. We make certain that our technology is able to work in comparative raters. Though if we could do away with comparative raters, we would. But really haven't made any changes there. I think the big change or the development this year has been \u2013 in personal lines \u2013 has been related to the rollout of high net worth, the rollout of the Capstone endorsements to our traditional program, expansion of high net worth into the new states that was mentioned. So those are probably the primary changes there, Josh.","Josh Shanker","Is auto a good business for Cincinnati, personal auto? Could you write the home and let a competitor have the auto portion and be just as successful, or is the bundle key to it? Is it adding marginals or adding exceptional value on the auto side?","J.F. Scherer","Well, right now, the auto is not adding value, obviously, in commercial auto or personal auto, but we've always been a package-writing company throughout our history and policyholders and agents alike would prefer that it all be part of a package. There is no question about the fact that the persistence of that business has improved when you write everything together in a package. So we've taken some, we think, some good actions in the auto side, put through some fairly significant rate increases throughout 2016 that are currently earning their way into the book of business, in some cases double-digit increases. So in terms of private passenger auto, we're feeling pretty good that as 2017 earns in that that will improve. But it's a pretty unusual circumstance that we are submitted an account that doesn't include the entire package.","Josh Shanker","And I know it's early and there's not so many policies, but do Capstone auto policies behave the same way as other auto policies?","J.F. Scherer","Well, as a general statement, high net worth, and keeping in mind that the high net worth we wrote previous to Will Van Den who will join in the company, was more mass affluent than it was high net worth, but even within our book of business across the book, it performed about 10 points better. So, yes, we believe that the auto in high net worth is a more profitable line of business. Josh, it's just not that price sensitive in the middle market personal lines.","A huge percentage of the business that gets quoted for us is in comparative raters and there's a bit of a tendency on the part of the agencies \u2013 though we do get the nod in terms of the quality we bring to them and their policyholders, that tends to be a bit more of a price is the only object kind of a circumstance whereas in high net worth it's more consultative and so we like the fact that we and our agencies are getting paid, if you will, for the value we are bringing in that area.","Josh Shanker","Okay. All right. Thank you. And in terms of looking at a relationship between dividend increases and earnings, obviously, you guys have increased the dividend consistently for a very, very long time. How do you think about, over a five-year period, at what rate the relationship should be between earnings growth and dividend growth?","Steve Johnston","Good question. I think we don't look at any one particular metric along with our Board in making that decision. That would be one of them, how is this doing in relationship to the profit on earned premium. We are also looking at investments, the balance sheet, the economy. Our forecast in the future is we look back to the financial crisis when there were a lot of companies cutting their dividend or not raising their dividend for sure.","At at that point, we felt comfortable to continue to increase the dividend because of what we saw in terms of our forecasts and our estimates of where we were going in the future. So I think it's hard to describe the discussion that goes on about our capital management as a ratio for one particular item. It's more holistic in terms of how we look at a broad spectrum of metrics.","Josh Shanker","That answers all my questions. Have a good 2017 and look forward to the results.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak of RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Scott Heleniak","Thanks. Good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Heleniak","The first question I had was just on new business. In commercial lines and E&S, it was down for the quarter; it was up for the year, but I was just wondering if you saw anything in Q4 specifically that was a little bit different from either a competitive standpoint or just people being more aggressive on pricing in Q4 that you didn't see the rest of the year.","Mike Sewell","Scott, I think throughout the year, competition has ratcheted up somewhat. So fourth quarter would have been I would say slightly more competitive. I think a lot of carriers tend to put a full-court press on towards the end of the year to meet a goal. We try to resist doing that because we just don't want to ask our people to underprice business to hit a top-line target. Last year's fourth quarter was a pretty big, tougher comparison.","I think as we look at the new business and how it went last year and looking forward, no one thing affected it. The 4% increase was good. We would have liked it to have been slightly better. We are optimistic about this year. The submission rates right now in CSU and in commercial lines are all up, so we are seeing more accounts. We are getting at-bats at more accounts. So that's positive. Because of the competition and because of our desire to be more disciplined, our hit ratio is down a little bit, but once again we are pleased with how things are going.","CSU, in terms of what they are facing, particularly on some of their larger accounts and keeping in mind that ours is a relatively conservative appetite for E&S business, but our excess and surplus lines company is losing some of the larger accounts to the standard side of the business. So once it gets quoted on the standard side, we don't compete with it. Our opinion would be that some of the business that's going to the standard side should stay in the E&S side of the business. If we think an account has reached a point where it probably does deserve standard market treatment then Cincinnati Insurance Company will quote on it. We will retain it in our standard side.","On the personal lines side as far as new growth would be concerned, we did put through some very healthy rate increases in auto in 2016 and in the middle-market segment of our business, that had a depressing effect on the new business there. High net worth more than made up for that. We are very, very pleased about how things went last year in terms of high net worth new business, not only in New York, but as was mentioned earlier in California, which obviously is a significant state in high net worth.","The reception by our agents there was just terrific. We wrote a good bit of new business even though we really did not have all that many agencies appointed for the five months that was referred to earlier. And then a few other things. Last year, we had maybe slightly more turnover than normal in our field underwriting in commercial lines, field reps that were retiring or moving to different territories. That has a slightly disrupting affect. We started the year out this year basically with all territories staffed and so we think that that will create a little bit of momentum relative to new business.","So as Steve mentioned earlier, sorry to be so long-winded about this, we are feeling pretty good right now about the prospects for growing. We will continue to appoint more agencies. We could always appoint more than we do. That's a balance as well. But we are confident about our ability to grow the Company. ","Scott Heleniak","That's very helpful. Is the agency deployment schedule for this year, is it ramping up versus last year? ","Mike Sewell","Not versus last year. It will be about the same level. We've been appointing on a full lines appointment, which include commercial lines and personal lines, in the 100 agency range and then in personal lines in states where we are not active in commercial lines, now those would be New Jersey and California. We will be appointing agencies in addition to that 100. So it will be a healthy year as far as new agency appointments, keeping in mind that that too is a matter of balance for us. It's not our intent to appoint as many agencies as we can; it's to appoint a few real good agencies and gain a lot of share in those few agencies. ","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And then on the share buybacks, you guys mentioned that you did 500,000 shares or so. Was that just to kind of offset some options that normally be [indiscernible] or does that signal that more regular buybacks might be on the way? ","Mike Sewell","This is Mike. We call it a maintenance type of buyback for the exact purpose that you just mentioned. In total, this year, 557,000 shares is what we did. Prior year, we did a million. The year before that, 450,000. So it's kind of really I will call it maintenance, but it's a part of that capital management that Steve talked about as we return capital back to shareholders. ","Scott Heleniak","Okay. And just the final question is just on workers' comp. That's been a very good line for you guys. You've had good reserve releases and good margins. I was wondering if you can talk about some of the drivers behind that, whether it's frequency, severity, mix, just anything you can add to that a little bit because that line has been very, very profitable for a while now. ","J.F. Scherer","Well, Marty Mullen is sitting here in the room from our claims department and if I had to point to anyone relative to the improvement in worker's comp, it would be Marty followed closely behind in our loss control area. We've put together a tremendous amount of specialization in workers' comp. claims handling both in the form of specialists out in the field and then people here in headquarters that are reviewing bills. That I think was a significant area of improvement for us. On the loss control side, we have protocols now that we didn't have six years ago or so when we really went full bore to working on this line of business where policyholders were visited and scored.","We provide consultative services to a greater degree than we had in the past. So we've been able to reduce loss costs in workers' comp when natural medical inflation would have taken it up for others. So we think we still have a little runway to go in terms of improving all that. We will expand our matrix in the loss control area to include even more accounts, smaller accounts where we feel like we can improve the margins there. So it's encouraging. We still view that as a class of business you have to be very cautious about. It has the potential for turning pretty sour, so we approach it conservative \u2013 despite the fact that it's such a profitable line for us, we continue to approach it very conservatively. We do not write monoline workers' comp, not unlike the question a little earlier about package business in personal lines, we don't write the comp unless we are writing the package and the umbrella and the auto. ","Scott Heleniak","Okay. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Fred Nelson at DA Davidson. Your line is open.","Fred Nelson","Thank you. Sitting here in California with Nestle's moving in your direction, they are going to have about 400 employees in Ohio. They are going to Virginia. When you see the businesses and people changing and moving to the South and the Southeast and Texas because of contracts where labor is less, taxes are less, do you follow that pretty carefully? That's one of my questions. The other one is, with the new administration facing towards taxes, if taxes are lowered, it would say to me that your cash flow from your bond portfolio and some of them could increase at a very substantial way. And in California, do you have agencies appointed that would handle people like me, or is it still high net worth? Thank you for taking the call. ","Mike Sewell","This is Mike. I will start with the tax question and then we will go with the others. So of course, it's hard to say what else would change if corporate rates went down, do they go to 20%, do they go to 15%, where do they go, what happens. But then when you take a look at that, what else might change other than corporate rates because it may not just be the rate, would the dividends received deduction remain the same; would the change, or would there be any change in the tax-exempt interest that we currently exclude from income? What would happen to a potential border tax and what's the effect on issues related to that?","So it's probably a little tougher issue than just a reduction in rates and these are just a few items that actually would have a major impact to us when it comes to tax reform. But let's just say if there was a lowering of the overall effective tax rate and nothing else, it would seem that we would have more net income to invest and grow our business, but then we'd also be able to compete on a more level playing field with internationally-based companies since their tax rates are lower currently than ours.","So allowing our capital really to compete more on a level playing field with the foreign capital seems to me to be a good thing. As of now, it's just too early to know what may change under the new administration. Our industry has experienced many administrations and has adapted over time to remain healthy for our insureds and our shareholders. So right now, I would say we are waiting to \u2013 et's wait and see when some actual guidance comes out with where they are specifically headed. ","Steve Johnston","This is Steve. I will touch a little bit on the overarching economy. We are optimistic about the future of where the economy and the country is going. We do look at how it varies by region, as well as a lot of other factors considering catastrophe exposure and the like, but we do build all those into our business plan. And then in terms of you and California, we write the full suite of products. We would love to entertain you as a client and you can join me in the ranks of the people that don't have houses that qualify for the executive Capstone. We appreciate your comments and look forward to any other questions. ","Fred Nelson","Fireman's Fund left California and they had a lot of good accounts. ","Scott Heleniak","Well, we are in business and we are hoping to compete and as we have seen the early results, we are competing well. ","Fred Nelson","It might be nice to know who I could call to find out what agencies in California handle your products because the business I am in, the people ask me that that our shareholders and I'm dumbfounded as to what to do sometimes. ","Scott Heleniak","Well, we can give you a couple choices. You could either go out to our website at www.cinfin.com and there is a find an agent place there where you can put in your address or ZIP Code and it will give you the names of several that would be in the area or you can call any of us and we will look it up and provide you with the same information","Fred Nelson","That would be great. Thank you. ","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I turn the call back over to Mr. Johnston.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Amy. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today, your interest in Cincinnati Financial and we look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2017 call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer for Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call.","Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including the final version of our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor website, www.cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Executive Vice President, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer, Martin Mullen.","Please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. We posted a strong first quarter with nice premium growth, and most importantly, we grew profitably. Investment performance was also strong and we more than covered our dividend with operating earnings, allowing us to grow book value. Previously announced catastrophe losses at 11.1 loss ratio points were more than three times higher than our long-term average for the first quarter, and yet we produced an underwriting profit with a 99.1% combined ratio.","We continue to earn higher pricing and healthy level of premium growth in all of our property casualty segments. In our Life Insurance segments, earned premiums rose at a double-digit pace during the first quarter. Our ability to deliver more precise pricing through analytics and our strong underwriting combined with more favorable market conditions also continue to give us confidence that our premium growth meets our criteria for profitability.","Commercial Lines renewal pricing was a notch above what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with an overall average increase in the low to mid-single-digit range. Workers compensation led the way with just over a 10% increase in our smaller commercial property policies that renewed during the first quarter were in the high single-digit range.","For our Excess and Surplus line segment, renewal prices increased for the 19th consecutive month and were up in the high single-digit range for the first quarter. Our Personal Lines business is also benefiting from rate increases over successive years and renewal premiums rose 12% in the first quarter. Policy retention continues to remain steady for each of our property casualty segments and new businesses continuing is contributing to premium growth.","New business premiums rose 6% with the more newly appointed agencies driving that growth. Our goal for new agency appointments during 2012 is 130 and we appointed 56 new agencies in the first quarter. That puts us at over 40% of the full year target. We've been out visiting with agents at our annual sales meetings. So far we have met with agencies from 25 states and in May, we'll have meetings with the agents in the balance of our states. It is encouraging to see how skilled our agents are at conveying the value of our products and services and they continue to work with us to implement price increases where they are needed. Our pricing analytics are helpful in distinguishing the more attractive new business opportunities from the less attractive ones giving us a good sense of when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced.","Loss experience that was favorable in many respects, added to the benefits we are seeing from better pricing. Paid losses other than catastrophes were down 1.3%, a good sign given that earned premiums were up 7.1%. Our catastrophe losses were limited to specific areas and most of our operating territory benefited from milder than usual weather.","Fewer new large losses, which we define as $250,000 or more per claim, were largely responsible for improvement in current accident year results. While we realized that large losses naturally fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we are encouraged by overall paid loss trends, which were a big reason that we experienced favorable reserve development on older accident years. Mike will discuss that more in a moment.","The first quarter provided a good start toward reaching our annual value creation ratio target of 12% to 15% with a 4.6% contribution for the first three months. While we can't expect every quarter to include so much lift from a higher investment portfolio valuation, we like our investment strategy for the long-term and we'll stay focused on what we can control such as careful underwriting, adequate pricing and excellent claim service. Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will further comment on financial items including investment results and reserves.","Mike Sewell","Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let's begin with investment results. Investment income remained steady, largely reflecting a 2% increase in the cost basis of our bond portfolio that offset a slight decline in average yield. The pre-tax yield for our bond portfolio for the first quarter of 2012 was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. The bond portfolio effective duration remained at the year-end level of 4.4 years. Both our equity and fixed maturity portfolios experience significant valuation gains during the first quarter and pre-tax net unrealized gains for the total investment portfolio rose 15% to over 1.7 billion. Our investment approach remains consistent balancing current investment income with long-term capital appreciation potential.","Our approach to loss reserving likewise remains consistent and we believe the adequacy of our reserves is as good as ever. Net favorable reserve development on prior accident years was 6.6 percentage points higher in the first quarter 2012 with nearly 40% of that favorable development coming from reserves for catastrophe losses. The first quarter 2012 ratio for favorable reserve development other than catastrophes was 26% higher than the full year 2011 ratio. The net favorable development of $116 million was broad based, spread over several accident years including 24% for accident year 2011, 32% for accident year 2010, 14% for accident year 2009, and 30% for all older accident years. Every line of business contributed to the favorable development, except for surety and executive risk line.","Moving onto expenses management, I'll simply say that we continue to carefully manage expenses as demonstrated by the first quarter property casualty underwriting expense. Before agency commissions on profitable business and wage increases for good performance, both of which we're pleased to pay, other underwriting expenses were essentially flat compared with a year ago. I'll briefly touch on the effects of our adoption of the new accounting standard for deferred policy acquisition cost known as DAC, which we applied retrospectively.","Adoption resulted in adjusting first quarter 2011 net income by lowering it by $1 million. Our year end 2011 DAC for our property casualty and life segments originally reported on the balance sheet was reduced by $33 million or 6% and the book value per share was reduced by $0.13 which is only 0.4%. Net cash flow from operations was strong at $148 million, up from $91 million in the first quarter of last year, and our highest first quarter level since 2008. We had our best first quarter in terms of net income since 2007. Our capital remained solid supporting growth in our insurance segments and we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in holding company cash and marketable securities.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared comments as usual by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting profit increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.75 and we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to our shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.4 during the first quarter at $32.07 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was 4.6%.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. Our associates and agents continue to work together to execute our strategy and to help us achieve our vision of being the best insurance company serving independent agents in the United States. We remain confident in our future and steadfast in our commitment to creating value for shareholders. With me today to answer your questions and further discuss our results and outlook are Jack Schiff Junior, Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Martin Mullen, and Marty Hollenbeck. With that, Mike, we\u2019re ready for you to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","So, in regards to expenses, I know, you guys have been guiding to a lower expense ratio for a little while now. The decline was fairly pronounced this past quarter. Can you talk about whether there were one-time items impacting the ratio and would you expect further improvement?","Mike Sewell","This is Mike Sewell, and thanks for the question, Mike. Some of that we are controlling our expenses. As you've heard, we've got our other than commissions and our salary and wages, we're controlling those costs, keeping those flat. There was really not a one-time hit that was in there. One of the items that's really helping the ratio is everything that we've been doing to drive written premiums and to increase those which in turn will affect the expense ratio. So there's really a combination of increasing written premiums and then controlling cost, overall on the non-salary and commissions.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Do those comments hold true for the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio as well which was pretty low?","Steve Johnston","Mike, this is Steve, and yes, I think, they're related and related to the level of loss activity and paid loss activity, and specifically which was down 1.3% for non-cat losses.","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Lastly, how are you guys thinking about the trade-off dynamics between retention new business growth and getting increased rate and I asked because your retention levels have stayed pretty steady and certain competitors have decided to look retentions fall in order to improve overall margins?","Steve Johnston","I will start out here. I think that we look at business for the long term, we have great relationships with our agents, we have a definite fundamental purpose to improve our underwriting profit. So, we are taking rate where we think it's needed. We think it's very much on a risk-by-risk basis, and we feel that we are gaining price adequacy, we got rate in the lines that we felt needed at the most with workers comp leading the way with just over 10% increase, the smaller commercial property policies that renew annually, we got real high single digit increases there. So, we think we are getting the rate when we need it but we also think we are conveying the value that we bring as a company in terms of our service, our products, our field representation and it's allowing us, I think, to benefit from maintaining pretty good retention. As we look at it, retention is a bit lower on the risk that we would like to not be on. So, I guess, also if we look at the three-year policies, the retention there is quite high when they come off of their three year policy, we've got quite a bit of loyalty there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Vincent DeAugustino - Stifel Nicolaus","If I look at Personal Lines on the statutory commission ratio it looks like that's grown a few points over the last few quarters and I am just curious you might be able to talk about that. I know, there was some changes to the agent compensation structure, but I thought that was going to be along the lines of pretty much being aggregate neutral?","Steve Johnston","I'll take a shot at that first. This is Steve. I think, couple things; one, we pay a little higher commission rate on our homeowners and we have been getting more rate on homeowners, which has allowed the premium to grow a little bit faster there in homeowners, so that's going to shift the mix a little bit in that direction. I think, the other, and you're right, we definitely target the profit sharing commission to remain pretty steady, and we think that's the case, so I think basically what we've seen is maybe just a bit of a shift in the mix of our commissions.","Vincent DeAugustino - Stifel Nicolaus","That's actually really helpful. Just following up again on the personal lines side, looking at the personal auto, I know, there were some adjustments that had flown through the core loss ratio last quarter, so my first question is just to make sure if there was any adjustments that I should be looking at this quarter, but if not, it looks like there was about a 5.3 point increase year-over-year in the core loss ratio, and just because ISO data seems to be trending towards higher inflation, and we're starting to hear some commentary from some of the larger auto players, I was just curious, of your thoughts in terms of loss cost inflation on auto.","Steve Johnston","What we're seeing, and really this applies to personal auto, it applies to commercial auto and really across our portfolio, and this is Steve again, we are seeing really pretty benign trends across the board. We have seen frequency down a bit, and severity up a bit, but all-in-all as we look at our trend, picking different time periods to look at trends, it's been very benign overall in the total paid loss trends. So, we feel that with the rate increases that we\u2019re getting on a written basis, we\u2019re making some ground.","Vincent DeAugustino - Stifel Nicolaus","So, for personal auto in 1Q 12, I should just look at the core loss ratio that\u2019s moving around due to normal variability that should be expected?","Steve Johnston","I think there's some noise there.","Vincent DeAugustino - Stifel Nicolaus","Then if I could slide one last one in. Would you happen to know what the new money yield is on the bond portfolio?","Martin Hollenbeck","First quarter corporates, we were to hike threes, we were close to four. Municipal is about 2.625, and in government bonds, agencies around a 3.2 level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets ","The first question I have was just on new business. Just wondering what kind of quote activity you\u2019re seeing as far as new submissions? Have you seen a big uptick in that over the past couple of quarters as some of your peers kind of raise rates a little bit higher than maybe what you guys are doing? So, just first of all, just curious whether you\u2019re seeing any big change over the past couple of quarters there.","J.F. Scherer","Yes, a substantial change in quote activity or submission activity in some areas. I would say its double, but field reps report that it\u2019s just an enormous fee increase in submissions. Same would be true on the Excess and Surplus line side. Obviously, the hit ratio is down, we\u2019re trying to ferret our way through all of those submissions, but it's clear that throughout the industry, carriers are pressing the price. In some cases, they're announcing that they are going to be very aggressive about their price increases which is provoking agencies to shop larger portions of books-of-business.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets ","So, should we expect new business growth to tick up from these levels? It hadn't been down last sort of couple of quarters, and it was up about 6% this quarter. So, do you think pricing will rise enough that your new business growth will sort of pick up in the second half of the year?","Steve Johnston","The primary driver for the new business for us were the more newly appointed agencies over last year and this year. So we'll continue to appoint agencies. We expect to get activity there. I would presume that as rates continue to go up, the attractiveness of the stability of the Cincinnati Insurance Company, our three-year policy. We continue to do a good job in how we handle claims that's causing agencies to take a closer look at us, but we would expect modest increase quarter-over-quarter of our new business to go up.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets ","You mentioned agency appointments, 56 so far this year. 130 expected for the year, obviously running ahead of schedule. Was there any particular reason why a lot of those that had that been planned for a lot of those to be appointed in the first quarter?","Steve Johnston","Yes. We've done some longer range planning in terms of growth rates that we would expect in different states, different parts of those states. We projected the number of appointments that we wanted to make this year based on conversations we've had with our agencies in those areas and the field reps in those areas, and asked the field reps to try to get all of those appointments done quicker than normal.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital","","I had a question too about just the cat loss reserve adjustments that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of quarters have been pretty significant. Just wondering are most of those from the 2011 year and have most of those claims been settled now so we won't see as big significant adjustments over next couple of quarters?","Marty Mullen","Right, Scott, this is Marty Mullen. Correct, most of the reserve adjustments weren\u2019t from the cat 2011 activity, a majority of it from the early second quarter cats and third quarter Irene and Lee. However, none of the adjustments were from cat 46 Tuscaloosa or cat 48 Joplin. Those two were not touched.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital","","And just the last question was on the investment portfolio, what was the return for the equity portfolio and the fixed income portfolio in the quarter?","Marty Hollenbeck","For the equity portfolio we did 7:3. In a big up market I think the S&P did about 12.5. We tend to lag with our large cap quality although we did outperform in fourth quarter. And then for the fixed income, we break it out by asset class. Let me give you that, just a second here. For the corporate portfolio, we did 2.4 for the below investment grade portfolio which is not a particularly big portfolio for us, we did 4.25 and our muni portfolio did 70 basis points, that's our total return.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","","Obviously, I don't have a ton of data points but one of the things I have noticed so far is that the regional insurers and I would include you guys in that seem to be growing their premium significantly faster than the large national writers. Do you get the sense that you are taking share from those large nationals, or is it just too many \u2013 too few data points that I'm looking at right now?","Steven Johnston","","Paul, this is Steve and I'll give that a shot first. I don't know that I would say that and I do think its awful few data points. I do think where we're getting a lot of good growth, as J.F. mentioned earlier is we have newly appointed agents, and also we have agents in states that are relatively new to us that we're growing in, and so I would think that the appointment strategy, the geographic diversification and expansion strategy would probably explain more of the growth. I don't know that I would go to the place of saying that we're taking share away from the larger writers.","J.F. Scherer","Paul, this is J.F. I'd agree with Steve. I'd say in terms of our successes, they're pretty broad based as far as where the business is coming from.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Bobman from Capital Returns. Your line is open.","Ron Bobman - Capital Returns","I had a question about renewals, and rates are picking up and at some point we will be lapping where insurers will be faced, I presume, with policy renewals, and I'm really asking about commercial insurance, policy renewals that will have a second year of increase and I'm wondering whether that is any reason to be concerned as a stockholder in insurers and your ability to sort of perpetuate and continue this shift to higher rates? And maybe sort of a related question, is that scenario for harder for you to achieve success, than it was getting the first rate increase. So is getting the first rate increase over years of declines far harder than getting the first renewal up again?","Thanks. I hope you understand my jumbled question.","Steve Johnston ","","Well as you look back to some of the hard markets and the kinds of increases that occurred, they were significant and it really created a lot of disruption. What we\u2019re seeing in our book of business, and I think by and large in the industry, they have been fairly modest rate increases that are coming across for policyholders. So, having experienced a 3 to 4% increase, I'll pick that number out of the air, for a policyholder and then next year, something probably more than that, has been more palatable. What we\u2019re seeing in our commercial book is that the economy is starting to show some signs of improvement. Payrolls and sales are going up, agents are conditioned and more prepared to deliver increases as long as they are not really significant. ","And so, I would not anticipate. In fact, I think we're going into the rest of this year, next year knowing that rates will or at least based on what we\u2019re seeing, that rates will continue to go up. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to place those. We take a look at every renewal policy by policy and make certain that we\u2019re as surgically as you can be, surgical about the approach that we take.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Adage Capital. Your line is open.","","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","Hi good morning everyone. Just to clarify, I think you guys said that about 40% of the reserve releases were from cat events, and when I look at the press release, it shows 22 million, which should be about 20% of your leases. What's the other 20%?","","Steve Johnston ","","And I think the way I look at in terms of the favorable development here is maybe just a little bit of a higher level. We had about 116 million all in favorable development this first quarter. That's up 58 million from where we were the first quarter a year ago. Not that 58 million increase, 51 million of it came from what I call the property-oriented lines. Home runners, for example, there was 8 million difference there, there was 28 million in commercial property and 15 million in special properties which is what programs is what our Bob is. ","I think what happened is, a year ago in terms of the comparative in the end of 2010 there were some pretty late catastrophes including like a hailstorm out in Phoenix and so forth and we actually had adverse development on those property lines in the first quarter of '11. This year and again with the large number of catastrophes that we had last year, the two largest in our history, we're working with a lot of larger dollars. We saw the favorable development. So of that 58 million in our overall increase in favorable development, 51 million of it came from the property short tail lines.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","Okay guys. Now I understand. Also just want to clarify some things on the weather and large losses in the quarter. You mentioned obviously the favorable weather is kind of like non-cats were lower than normal. If I recall last year, they were higher than normal. Is there a way to get a sense for either how much an improvement it was year-over-year or just how much better than plan it was? What was the benefit from the non-cat weather in the quarter?","Steve Johnston ","","Yes, I think I'll give it a start and Marty will fill in here. We don't have non-cat across the board, because we touched on some of the catastrophe losses that we had this quarter were in a pretty specific area and overall over the broad spectrum of our territories we really did have pretty mild weather and so that's going to have an influence on that.","Marty Hollenbeck ","","That's right Steve. And just as a quick follow-up. Our non-cat weather in the commercial lines was down in loss just over 60% non-cat weather in commercial. And in the actually quarter, we saw a significant decrease in the new commercial fires over in the first quarter 2011.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","Okay and that's what I was wondering also. I mean, normally when I think of sort of that large loss disclosure you give, I think of that as being independent of weather. That's just the normal like you said fire losses and things like that that are unpredictable. Was that the case this quarter or was there some kind of correlation that the good weather somehow led to us fire losses or are they independent?","Steve Johnston ","I think it's just a good quarter. We had significant high number of commercial fires in the first quarter last year and that number and dollar loss has significantly declined in this quarter.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital","So, basically, two pieces of good luck to offset, the bad luck on the cash.","Steve Johnston ","Absolutely.","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Matt Rohrmann from KBW. Your line is open.","Matt Rohrmann - KBW","Just again want to say really impressive job from all the Cincinnati folks at the agent meetings, and just wanted to actually follow-up on that a little bit. Obviously, the rate increases are great and you guys are getting some really solid growth. I know those meetings you had mentioned looking at growth in lines like umbrella, marine, surety, non-profit, D&O. Just wondering as you look ahead to some future agency appointments, how much of the appointment strategy goes into looking at those or other lines specifically?","J.F. Scherer ","We really tried to appoint a generalist agency and we think that within that scope, the kind of agencies that you would meet at those meetings, they write across the board, all of those lines of business. So it would be an unusual circumstance for example, excuse the umbrella line\u00a0that's an example. But you have an agency that specializes or has an outsized amount in that area. ","So what we continue to do is a new appointment strategy is look for centers of influence in the community, agencies that are broad based in what they write, first lines as well as commercial lines, excess and surplus lines, and then go in and do our best to appeal across the board. And specifically because those lines of business that you had mentioned are especially profitable, ask for lots of opportunities in those areas.","Matt Rohrmann - KBW","Okay great. For those lines I know you guys have a lot of detail in the supplementary. Any lines kind of looking forward past 1Q where you see sort of a further divergence in your ability to get additional rate coupled with a decline in loss trends?","J.F. Scherer ","Well, Steve had mentioned, obviously in the workers' comp area we're getting double digits, slightly more than 10% increases on renewed business there. We\u2019re seeing an acceleration in our ability to get higher rate in property, as you could imagine, with the storms across the country and policyholders are prepared for, we\u2019d expect increases in that particular area as well. Commercial auto we\u2019re doing well in that line as well. So, those would be the three that I would point out that we are having some good luck in those areas.","Matt Rohrmann - KBW","And J.F. of the favorable losses on property, there was plenty of weather last year. But not a non-cat basis and I know you guys have been doing a lot of work on the workers\u2019 comp side for a few years now, but loss trends have been in line with expectations thus far through the year?","J.F. Scherer ","As far as non-cat losses?","Matt Rohrmann - KBW","","Yes.","J.F. Scherer ","Yes and I think it has been in line. We think we can continue to improve some areas. We\u2019re focusing on property, non-cat property in terms of greater loss control, more inspections in addition to rate, but also making certain that we have a confirmation that we know exactly what we\u2019re writing. I think everybody would recognize over the last few years, that the economy has taken its toll on property, in that there are a lot more vacant properties and there are tenant properties that might be unplanned. So, those are all areas that in addition to rates we\u2019re making plans to make improvements.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Quick follow up, in regards to the investment portfolio dynamics, should we not expect much of a decline in the absolute levels of investment income given the strong revenue growth? I didn't get the math. I haven't done the math that Marty stated earlier on the call?","Steve Johnston","Yes, we've written it down. As you know a lot of insurance companies are declining book yields. Our book yield declined six basis points last quarter and that's kind of in line with what we've been seeing last few years. That's been offset by the dividend increases in the portfolio. ","However, that portfolio shrank a little bit in the last 12 months. There's a lot of moving parts here. Obviously, we pay our dividend, that's the money not available to reinvest. So, there's a lot going and we've been able to successfully tread water to the primary drivers. In fact, we've gotten very strong dividend increases out of our portfolio, which is our strategy.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","So, the answer kind of treading water probably continues?","Steve Johnston","By and large. I would say that our decline in book yield, the bonds we've been losing to calls has generally come in that yields, that piece of it is declining. New money rates haven't really spiked up much, periodically when they come back, 10 years now around (inaudible). So, yields are particularly attractive right now. So, certainly we love to grow it organically and profitable quarters do help that. So our goal is to squeeze out a small gain, yes.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Bodman from Capital Returns. Your line is open.","Ron Bodman - Capital Returns ","Hi thanks. I felt like we've been, as investors and followers of the industry trained to this concept that new business is always priced below renewal business because of the competitive aspect, I guess. But now I believe there is a couple of other insurance companies talk about the rate differential between new business and renewal business being higher in the case of new business. It's now sort of flip-flop and that these companies were commenting that they are now pricing new business at rates above like-for-like business on a renewal basis. Would you comment at all that what you were seeing in your book-of-business, again commercial lines, with these relativities?","Steve Johnston ","No good question Ron. I think that they are pretty close together to tell you the truth and maybe some variation by line. I think one thing that's helped with the new business pricing is the deployment of the analytics we use and we get a lot more information a lot more intelligence on which pieces of new business to write and which pieces to walk away from, where is the walk away price. ","And one line in particular I would like to point out is workers compensation where we actually feel in that line, that the quality or the price adequacy of the new business is better than the renewal business. So that we're moving the mix in that regard, but all-in-all I would say that they are pretty close.","Ron Bodman - Capital Returns ","And what would you have answered that, and what was that relative a year ago, new versus renewal? Was new deficient relative to renewal?","Steve Johnston ","That's a pretty tough question. We've been rolling out the analytics. As J.F. mentioned working on inspecting risk and knowing what we're writing. I think we're still being closed, but I think we're getting better and better all the time.","J.F. Scherer","I would I would agree with that, all new business there continues to be quite a bit of competition. And so when they a very good account makes it into the market place for re-pricing, there is still a lot of competition. As Steve said, the guidepost of analytics for us has much improved our ability to price the account closer to the price adequacy ratio that we need on the new piece of business.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker, your line is open.","Josh Shanker ","Good morning everyone. I'm looking forward to the modeling this, but I'm having a little bit of difficulty, because the change in combined ratio came so suddenly in 4Q and this Q. I'm trying to figure out why the lack of gradualism and does it mean that there might be some back and forth or are you looking year-over-year, how should I think about that?","Steve Johnston ","I think the way we look at it is we're looking at the accident year ex-cat for the first quarter and comparing it to the full year of 2011. We see in that metric a 4.9% improvement. We went from 73 down to 68.1. So a 4.9 point improvement in the ex-cat accident year loss ratio. Of that 4.9 point improvement, 4.1 points of it came from as Marty Mullen mentioned earlier, less large losses which we define as 250,000 per claim or more. So a lot of it was explained by fewer large losses.","Josh Shanker ","So, when I think about that and to the extent to which large losses were elevated in 1Q, '11. I mean I guess it\u2019s lumpy, but would you say that you have less large losses this quarter than you usually experienced and a lot more than you usually experienced in 1Q, and maybe cut the baby in half or something? How should I swear then just thinking about your business and that how large loss affect those numbers?","Steve Johnston ","I think you would say that we did have less large loss this first quarter. We tend to look at the base as the full access year of 2011, but I think all-in-all, things were pretty favorable this first quarter in terms of large losses.","Josh Shanker ","And so do you think that along with same lines it was 1Q '11 particularly unfavorable in terms of large losses?","Steve Johnston ","I don't have that number right here in front of me but I think the answer is\u00a0yes.","Operator","","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Johnston, I turn the call back over to you.","Steve Johnston ","Thank you, Mike and thanks to all of you for joining us today.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer for Cincinnati Financial, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.","Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses maybe made by others in the room with us, including Cincinnati Insurance Company\u2019s Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer for the Cincinnati Insurance Company, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, Marty Mullen.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results.","The quarter included several areas of good performance including enhancing our balance sheet strength. We see incremental progress as we steadily execute our underwriting and pricing strategies. And our investment strategy and successful portfolio management produced our seventh consecutive quarter of investment income growth.","Careful underwriting and disciplined pricing along with more favorable weather than the first three months of last year led to a first quarter 2015 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 97.5%. While that ratio improved by 2.8 points compared with the year ago, it did not meet our expectations. Every major line in our property casualty segments except for commercial and personal auto order had lost ratios that translated into estimated combined ratios near or within the 90% to 95% range. We strengthened reserves for those auto lines of business, causing our overall combined ratio to rise above the sub 95% or seeking for year 2015. And we believe our balance sheet is now stronger than it was at year-end.","We continue to further segment our business using pricing precisions and risk selection decisions that combine data models and informed underwriting judgment on a policy by policy basis. In the first quarter, we experienced strong retention and satisfactory renewal pricing, although premium growth continues to slow as we exercise pricing in underwriting discipline. As noted in the past, we tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on a single quarter of data for certain measures including premium growth.","We continue to earn quality new business from our agencies and we experienced the healthy pace of new business premium growth in our personal lines and excess and surplus lines segments. In addition to continuing to develop new products and services through our target markets department, we continue to make progress on expanding our current products and services aimed at high net worth policy holders offered through our personal lines insurance segment.","We believe we are on track to begin offering a new suite of high net worth insurance products in the second half of this year through agents in the state of New York. Those products will include higher coverage limits than we offer today along with other new options. In addition to growth opportunities with our agencies on a direct written premium basis, we see long-term opportunities in assumed reinsurance.","Last night, we announced with a separate news release an important initial step for realizing future opportunities, hiring Jamie Hole as Managing Director, Head of Reinsurance Assumed to lead this initiative. We recognize the current challenges in the reinsurance market and won\u2019t be trying to grow that business quickly, instead we\u2019ll take our time and maintain underwriting discipline as we develop relationships and expertise that we believe will benefit the company and shareholders over the long-term.","Looking forward toward 2020, we\u2019re in the early phases of establishing the vision of what\u2019s to come. As always, that vision will include continuing to profitably grow the company with our successful agency centered model and focusing on our value creation ratio to measure long term value for shareholders. Over time, we expect to develop more specific objectives and plans and we\u2019ll communicate them at appropriate times.","For the first quarter, average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued their percentages near the middle of the low single digit range, very similar to the fourth quarter. That average includes the meeting effect of three new policies that were not yet subject to renewal pricing during the first quarter.","For smaller commercial property, commercial auto policies that renewed during the first quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases. Those commercial property policies experienced percentage increases averaging in the high single-digit range; in commercial auto, average increases in the mid single digit range.","For our personnel auto policies, renewal price percentage increases averaged near the low end of the mid single digit range. Home owner policies were little higher in the same range. For our excess and surplus line segment, the first quarter 2015 average renewal price increases were also near the low end of the mid single digit range. That segment of our business turned in another outstanding quarter with the combined ratio of below 90% and net written premiums up 20%. Our life insurance subsidiary including income from its investment portfolio again contributed nicely to earnings, and again grew premiums in its largest product line, term life insurance.","In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio was 1.3% for the first quarter with operating income leading the way. We feel we are well positioned for good overall financial performance for the remainder of 2015.","I\u2019ll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to add his insights about our recent financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great, thank you Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today.","I\u2019ll start with some analysis of investment results. The investment income grew in the first quarter, mainly from the boost for stock portfolio dividends that rose 13% for the quarter. Yields continue to slowly decline for our bond portfolio. We generated 1% increase in interest income over the first quarter 2014, as our net purchases of bonds during the last four quarters totaled $375 million. For bond portfolios, first quarter 2015 pretax average yield reported 4.7% was 12 basis points lower than a year ago but only 2 basis points lower than what we reported for the fourth quarter of 2014. We now report in our 10-Q the yields for new bonds purchased during the quarter and we added a table for yields of bonds expected to be redeemed by year, for the next two to three years.","You can see that taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.34%, while tax exempt bond purchases averaged 3.13%. Our bond portfolio\u2019s effective duration remained the same level as last year-end at 4.4 years.","Cash flow from operating activities continues to help our investment income grow. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first quarter of 2015 rose 67% to $215 million, contributing to $93 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio. Paying $38 million less for catastrophe losses was part of the reason for the increase in operating cash flow for the first quarter of this year compared with a year ago.","We\u2019re still carefully managing expenses and the 0.2 ratio increase for the property casualty underwriting expense ratio was also explained in our 10-Q. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we think investing in our business in areas such as enhancing pricing and underwriting expertise is a good trade off over time. A short-term increase in expense can create long-term value for investors. As an example, since the first quarter of last year, we strategically invested in the personal line staff additions to support high net worth market expansion and we anticipate a good return on that investment.","Loss reserves are the next subject of my comments. Our approach to setting overall reserves remains consistent with the past as we aim for net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss of loss expense reserves. In the first quarter, we strengthened reserves for our auto lines of business. For our other lines in total, the best estimate by our actuaries of ultimate loss and loss expense ratios for all accident years in aggregate was similar to our year-end estimate.","The ratio for our total property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years was similar to the full year 2014, benefitting the combined ratio by a little more than two points. Overall, our first quarter 2015 net favorable development was as usual, spread over several accident years including 30% for accident year 2014; 22% for accident year 2013; 39% for accident year 2012; and 9% for all order accident years in aggregate.","Steve noted that we enhanced the strength of our balance sheet this quarter. There are many ways to assess capital strength and we think as an important aspect is our liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company rose 2% from year-end topping $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Our strong capital also positions us well to continue to grow our insurance operations.","I\u2019ll end my prepared remarks as usual by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.11. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.37. The change in unrealized gains at March 31st for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.19. The change in unrealized gains at March 31st for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value by $0.18. And we declared $0.46 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.08 during the first quarter to another record high of $40.22 per share.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. In closing our prepared remarks, I would like to mention a few other events of the quarter that show the commitment of all of our associates to keep getting a little bit better every day, keeping us on track to deliver shareholder value far into the future.","First, we\u2019ve made outstanding strides in improving our real time download capabilities which make it easier for our agency customers to do business with us. At the recent conference, NetVU recognized those efforts by presenting us with their Quantum Award for offering superior workflow productivity. NetVU is the agent based user group, Vertafore\u2019s agency management system. Second, we\u2019re working to be good stewards of all our resources including our natural ones. Our headquarters facility recently earned the silver level certification for lead for existing buildings, operations and maintenance. We are one of only 40 buildings with more than 100 million square feet to earn certification in this lead category nationally.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.

Your line is open.","Joshua Shanker","I know you guys don\u2019t like to make a forecast based on one quarter but there is a real trend if we look at the homeowners\u2019 line. You guys have grown double digits as recently the year ago; fourth quarter was light, so was there is no growth this quarter in it, and I know you\u2019re making a drive in that high net worth product I guess. What\u2019s happening there, can you talk about that a bit?","J.F. Scherer","Josh, this is J.F. Scherer. Couple of things happening there. We were taking some pretty significant increases in homeowner race over the last several years that have moderated now. That drove a lot of the growth. We think we\u2019ve reached great adequacy in lot of the states. And so, we\u2019re doing a fair amount of tweaking but nothing as drastic as we had been. We are also in the process of running off our Florida originated personal lines book of business that started last July. And so that\u2019s contributing to an absence or it\u2019s diluting growth in the homeowner line as well.","So that will finish, we have one more quarter of that and then beginning in the third quarter, the comparisons will be without the effect of Florida. Our new business in homeowners was up 16%; the initiative we have with the high net worth is really starting to take effect right now. So, we\u2019re seeing a bit more business generated in the higher net worth area in both homeowner and auto for that matter. So, I think what you\u2019ll see without making any predictions of it is a rebound in the growth rate in homeowners\u2019 line.","Joshua Shanker","And just philosophically, why the Florida now? I mean, three years ago, five years ago, eight years ago, I know these times someone could have made the decision to be in Florida. Currently reinsurance in Florida is probably more affordable than it\u2019s been on a long time. What was the mathematics about why Florida now?","Steve Johnston","We spent about the period of time that you just described trying to negotiate with the Department of Insurance for rate adequacy in our homeowner book of business. It was locally inactive, inadequate and had gotten that way over a period of time for really matters related to legislative reasons, for the legislator at past limitations, they could not raise rates for our book of business, for our rates to the level we had to have. It took us a lot of time to exhaust all those options and hen it was finally concluded that we were not going to be able to get adequate rate increases, we chose to leave. There wasn\u2019t going to be enough relief, not even close to enough relief in reinsurance cost in Florida, to cause us to believe that the risk we were taking at the rates we were allowed to charge were worth it.","So, in the commercial lines area, there is low rate flexibility. Obviously the Department of Insurance is interested in protecting the personal lines clients whereas business clients can or big boys can make their own decisions about what they pay for insurance. So, we\u2019re still there in commercial lines; we still monitor what goes on within the state. It could very well be that based on more flexibility in the state of Florida that we could someday write more business down there. But as it is right now, the only personal lines business that we\u2019re writing in Florida is business that\u2019s collateralized. By that I mean, it\u2019s originated from states outside Florida with business that we believe warrants us to take whatever risk we might take on secondary residence in Florida.","Joshua Shanker","Understood, thank you for all clarity. And look I\u2019ve asked this question several ways every conference call, at least somebody has, I ask it different way. It does seem that you\u2019re loss taking is more accurate now than it was maybe five years ago and something we might view that as a pejorative statement because usually you had fix cap [ph] for favorable development and now you\u2019re giving numbers closer to rights. I don\u2019t know if you -- how you view all that? Do you feel that you have a better grasp on loss taking out, do you think the attitude is changed by giving numbers right versus giving them overestimated has changed, just it feels totally [ph] different. And maybe in two years, we look back at the time and laugh at it as a cycle moment but it does seem with all disinflationary press over the last few years, I\u2019m surprised there is not more reserve releases.","Steve Johnston","I think over time, we\u2019ve been consistent in our approach. I think we always go with the actuarial, people\u2019s best estimate of their -- the ultimate losses. I think, I would think that with every area of our company, I would agree that -- I think over time there has been improvement and they have gotten better at picking the ordinates [ph] but I also agree to you that there is a tremendous amount of -- agree with you that there is tremendous amount of uncertainty; it will be interesting to look back in a few years and see how accurate in fact everything has turned out to be. But I just always try to stress that it\u2019s a very consistent approach. We go with the actuary\u2019s best estimates and we do feel in area of the that we\u2019re trying to get little bit, little bit precise all the time.","Joshua Shanker","There is awful lot being precise. Thank you for all the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino from KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent DeAugustino","To start off on the assumed reinsurance discussion, I know it\u2019s really preliminary but I\u2019m curious of any lines that you might target. And then it sounds like this may be more of a direct effort, but there is some mention of JLT, maybe it was implied but will JLT play a fairly big part here, just trying to understand the distribution nature of that effort?","Steve Johnston","I guess one thing, I would like to make one point is assumed reinsurance is not entirely new to us here at Cincinnati. Over the past year or I guess over the past 20 years of serve, voluntary assumed reinsurance has been as high as about 2.4% of our net writings. This has largely been done through various pools retro sessions that we\u2019ve been involved with reinsurers and companies that we had long relationships. But we\u2019ve been very passive participants and my opinion, was kind of lacked expertise and recognizing that it\u2019s tough market, right now we\u2019re down to just one contract that we\u2019re involved with. So feel here we got the opportunity to bring in really some excellent talent. And Jamie Hole, we know we have a known quantity. We have a long successful relationship with, both Jamie, and as you mentioned with JLT. We\u2019ve worked together for a long time and we are as you mentioned, more confident that we\u2019ll be at good deal flow from JLT over time as well as other entities that we\u2019ll work with.","We think Jamie is going to being with hi, -- maybe not bring with him; it\u2019s probably not the right word, but he will establish a small team of expertise, as part of Cincinnati Insurance, we\u2019re going to do this without establishing a new legal entity, new company. And we\u2019re going to execute what describe as an allocated capital model. We are going to do our best just contract by contract to estimate the capital that would be needed for that individual policy and only move forward if we can get our fair risk adjusted return on that policy.","We recognize it\u2019s a really tough market rate right now. And we\u2019re going to be very judicious. Just look at everything, kind of to your other point, policy by policy, we don\u2019t have a specific line of business strategy or anything like that. It\u2019s going to be very much technically based on a policy-by-policy basis. We\u2019re only going to look at diversifying opportunities, so obviously nothing in the Midwestern convective storm area. And we think the diversification that we may be able to achieve over time should really be helpful to us in driving up our overall risk adjusted returns. Again, we\u2019re going to very much lock before we run and be very disciplined in putting our capital to work here.","Vincent DeAugustino","I guess one thing I would say that among some of the other companies, we cover, I think Cincinnati is a very good reputation among your peers. And I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about your capital adequacy. So that said, I\u2019m wondering if there would be a target for U.S. regional business outside of the Midwest or to your point on diversification if you\u2019d look outside of the U.S. to kind of get just some of that diversification benefit.","Steve Johnston","We\u2019re going to be very flexible, certainly not in the Midwest but beyond that we\u2019re going to be very flexible and again, policy-by-policy contract-by-contract, look at them very closely one-by-one.","Vincent DeAugustino","I guess bringing it a little bit closer to home here. On that incurred ratio, I noticed that that dropped pretty decently in the quarter. And so just wanted to check in and see if that\u2019s the result of may be a little bit lower weather losses or obviously development and some of the lines plays a part there. But just curious if any of this is stemming from little bit higher initial, asking your pick or just any color there would be helpful.","J.F. Scherer","I do think that -- again we go with our actuarial best estimate. I think they have been very prudent in the way they\u2019ve gone about things. I think with a couple of the lines, the auto lines, while we\u2019ve had favorable development overall and again building on 26 years or so in a row of favorable development, we hadn\u2019t had a couple of lines, the auto lines had some adverse development. And I thank particularly here in the first quarter, it is a situation where when you seeing some adverse development and now you\u2019re making the initial pick on just one quarter, the first quarter of new accident year; you certainly don\u2019t want to step into the same situation that we were in before. And so I think that being prudent in the picks that they are making through the current accident quarter, particularly on those auto lines given what we\u2019ve seen.","Vincent DeAugustino","Would it be fair to stay on the auto lines but you are kind of responding to some of the same trends in your points, trying to make sure that it doesn\u2019t re-emerge for this year or has there been anything incremental that has emerged since the year-end review where from a loss cost side you have to may be take another step back?","Steve Johnston","I think it would be more of the former.","Vincent DeAugustino","And then just one last one if I can speak it in. So the press release noted sort of the $5 billion goal. And I think there has been some conversation about a 2020 plan, looking out little bit further out. So, I\u2019m curious if you guys would be prepared to talk about growth plans looking further out in reconciling that to the pace of the \u201815 goal and the sort of expectations where we are today.","Steve Johnston","We said that 2015 goal several years ago and I think it\u2019s a really good goal and it really spurred us forward. I think one think that we\u2019ve always made perfectly clear is that we are only going to do it if we can do it profitably. So, I think it really has been the beneficial goal to us. And then if you look back, just the -- I guess just recently the A.M. Best in one of their best weeks in March, put out the new rankings of companies with U.S. net written premium and we moved up to 22nd. So kind of over this period of time, we started at year-end 2010 as the 26th largest writer based on United States net written premium. Each year, we\u2019ve moved up one position from 26th to 25th to 24th to 23rd to down to 14, 22nd. I think setting, and the work that goes into setting these plans is very important. We have stress that we are only going to do it if we can do it profitably. And we\u2019re glad to say that over that period of time, other than cat riddle [ph] 2011. We\u2019ve been able to put in sub 100 combines and we\u2019re looking pretty good about that again here for 2015.","So, it\u2019s been a good goal. I think it\u2019s going to come down to the wire. So, we are hedging a little bit here, as we make our disclosures. But I think it\u2019s really good to set out ambitious challenging goals there that are achievable but always keeping our focus that it needs to be profitable growth. And we\u2019ll do the same thing as we move into our planning for the 2020 goal. And at this point, I might ask J.F. if he had any other color he\u2019d like to add to that.","J.F. Scherer","I think Steve\u2019s summed it up pretty well. We still think we have tremendous potential. So, when we get around the setting of projection for 2020, we will certainly be ambitious. We\u2019re still in 39 states; our penetration rate in the states is still relatively low; number of agencies we have still relatively low, sub 1500 agencies. We think we have tremendous opportunities within those agencies; they write over $30 billion in premiums within those agencies that we don\u2019t write. But really as Steve said, we\u2019ve done so much in the area of fortifying our profitability between the analytics, modeling, loss control, inspections, special services, specialization and underwriting and target markets. Notwithstanding the fact that $5 billion might be a -- it might be a little shorter that this year we\u2019re certainly not pessimistic about how we can look at 2020 and beyond, feeling actually pretty good about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Heleniak","Just wonder if you could touch on the expense ratio. I don\u2019t know if you had any kind of estimation or is this a good kind of quarterly run rate to sue for what it might be for the full year, might be up a little bit? I know you mentioned some of the initiatives. So, is that your expectation? And is most of the increase, you talked about strategic investments, is that mostly personal lines and technology or is there anything else in this?","Mike Sewell","This is Mike. There\u2019s probably really a lot of different strategic investments that we\u2019re making. And so for kind of a run rate for the rest of the year, it\u2019s going to be a combination obviously of our investments, how much we\u2019re spending and then, the growth of the premiums. Some of the investments that are in there, I mentioned was related to our high net worth homeowners and so forth. But we\u2019re investing probably more -- we\u2019ve got more inspectors, we started a customer care center that\u2019s going to be really increasing the ramping up this year; our target markets, the focus that we have there; IT as you mentioned. And we\u2019ve been adding more actuaries to be able to really help how we segment the business, price, the price adequacy ratio et cetera. So you\u2019ve really got a combination of a lot of investments. We\u2019ve been watching our existing costs and really just trying to control those. And so we\u2019re still controlling those. But while -- you can only squeeze so much out and so with the investments that we\u2019re making. And then as you look here first quarter compared to the first quarter of prior year with our combined ratio being a little bit better, our profitability there; there is also just a slight uptick that\u2019s going to be in there also related to our profit sharing or contingent conditions and so forth for agents.","So kind of combination of all that; you saw a little bit of an uptake; let\u2019s wait to see how the rest of the year pans out. But we\u2019re not really changing our direction on increasing expenses overall, still controlling them, strategic investments, growth premiums.","Scott Heleniak","And then just speaking [ph] little about the -- you guys rolled out the national advertising campaign during the quarter. So what are your expectations as far as kind of where this might be as far as that part of the business as you roll out, increase to the high net worth rollout in 2015, 2016?","J.F. Scherer","Scott, this is J.F. Have you seen it? Have you seen the ad?","Scott Heleniak","I have not.","J.F. Scherer","Not. Well, maybe we need to run it more often or something. Actually this is the first time we\u2019ve done any national TV ads. The ad is being run two weeks on, two weeks off and will run through September. It\u2019s being seen on CNN and Fox News, a variety of shows on Fox News. So that could run the gambit from Bill O\u2019Reilly to Anderson Cooper. There is a demographic on those cable channels that we like in terms of being a slightly higher net worth that net worth audience that we\u2019re interested in but also business owners.","So, we\u2019re not trying -- I guess the point I would mike, we\u2019re certainly not trying to compete with the major advertisers out there. What we are wanting to do is as we have in the past is to showcase the value of an agent and the role the agent plays in their relationship with our company. And simultaneously with that we have ramped up a lot our digital advertising. And so, obviously the TV ad is -- will play a part in all this but digital advertising will play a major part. As much as the public as in audience for this ad, we want our agents to be an audience for it as well. And that as result of seeing Cincinnati Insurance Company on a national level, that creates confidence in them, certainly with our expansion out west in the some areas, where Cincinnati Insurance Company had not been active. It\u2019s valuable for earning to be out there, so they can make reference to it. And for that matter and we\u2019re going to be personal lines business in New York City. And so to be seen by potential customers there would be a value.","So, it\u2019s part of a very large initiative that we have, both internal with our agencies digitally as well as nationally. So, I\u2019d expect you\u2019ll see a consistency in this but certainly not a drastic expansion there. And we have been -- we\u2019re majoring, both qualitatively and quantitatively the effects of it. And we\u2019re seeing on our website more activity on the weeks that are on. And most notably we find an agent to tab that is clicked by visitors has gone up significantly as a result -- during the times that this ad is playing. So we think it\u2019s paying off already.","Scott Heleniak","Next question is just on -- I think Vince talked about before just on the commercial and personal auto reserve strengthening, so there was no real change in the first quarter as far as severity or frequency of the claims that were coming in? Was there anything you can comment specifically on that that drove that?","Steve Johnston","I think, I\u2019d reiterate just what we have already said is that we have seen -- I think it\u2019s more you look at over long-term that trends in paid losses that had caused us to want to strengthen those reserves for those auto lines, for the all prior years. And I think that as well as what we\u2019re seeing is influencing the actuaries to be pretty prudent with their initial pick here for the first accident quarter here in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome","I was hoping you could talk about the continued distribution expansion with a little bit more detail, just to kind of give us an update?","Steve Johnston","Paul, we\u2019ve been appointing agencies, about a 100 new relationships a year over the last five or six years. And we\u2019ll probably continue expanding at that particular space. As you know, there still continues to be a lot of M&A activity, consolidation of agencies. In some cases, it works to our benefit where the combined agencies create more opportunity for us in a community and in some cases, it creates disruption and our premium activities go down a little bit. So, we continue to take a look at new appointments, whether they be in Ohio. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see much of an increase beyond the 100 or so, new agency appointments. You will see some personal lines only appointments that are most associate with high net worth specialist. So, we\u2019ll see a few more of those. But I think as you look out into the horizon, we could end up appointing 500 agencies over the next five years and with the kind of consolidation it\u2019s occurring, maybe only net out 150 or 200 increase. But it is our plan to continue to appoint more agencies.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BAM Funds. Your line is open.","Mike Zaremski","A follow-up, if I understood correctly from one of the previous questions, it sounded like the increases in the accident year ex catastrophe loss ratios and personal and commercial were primarily due to what you\u2019re seeing in both commercial and personal auto. And if that\u2019s correct along the same lines, I know you guys talked about non-catastrophe weather related losses being lower than a year ago levels. I was curious, if there were other items, which may have been unusually elevated, maybe such as personal auto losses between 1 million to 5 million or maybe other items?","Steve Johnston","No, I don\u2019t think there is whole lot of other items; I think you touched on them with the personal and the commercial auto. I think there is a bit of an elevation in the commercial casualty. But I think you\u2019ve pretty much hit on what we\u2019re seeing in the quarter.","Mike Zaremski","And so then, if I think about what pricing is in personal auto and in commercial lines, I mean is there -- are you guys getting enough price to get margin improvement on a go forward basis?","Steve Johnston","I think, we\u2019re Mike. Time will only tell but I think from what I see, not only in pricing but what we\u2019re doing on the underwriting side of things, when we really team up with it, when the claims, we have got every area of the company contributing towards improvement. And I think we\u2019re still on trajectory of improvement here.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call over to Steve Johnston.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Erica and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We hope to see some of you this Saturday at our Annual Shareholders Meeting at the Cincinnati Art Museum. If you can\u2019t make it, please listen to our webcast, that meeting is available at cinfin.com\/investors. If not, we look forward to seeing you again at the second quarter call if not before.

My name is Shannon and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Mr. McDaniel, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel from Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com\/investors.","The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including the Cincinnati Insurance Company's Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, Marty Mullen.","Second, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","Now, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We're pleased to report satisfactory operating performance despite second quarter catastrophe loss effects that were slightly higher than our long-term average.","Thanks to the steady efforts of our associates to support the local independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance we still manage to generate a modest underwriting profit in the second quarter and our first half 2016 consolidated property\/casualty combined ratio of 95.4% is within the half point of the first half of last year.","We were encouraged by improving underwriting results before the effects of catastrophes and believe we'll see ongoing benefits from our various initiatives focused on profitability. Rising investment income and robust portfolio valuations at quarter end were another bright spot for recent performance.","Higher investment income for the first half of 2016 offset a small decrease in property casualty underwriting profit leading to a 3% increase in operating income. Mike Sewell will comment further on that in a moment.","First, I will highlight some important points about our insurance operations. Each of our segments continue to grow satisfactory as we earn quality new business produced by our agencies.","Pricing was generally consistent with the first quarter. However personal auto was an exception with average renewal rate percentage increases moving from the mid-single-digit range to the high-single-digit range. We believe that improved pricing for both our personal and commercial auto along with other initiatives will improve our results for those lines of business.","Expansion of our reinsurance assumed operation, known as Cincinnati Re, also continues to progress nicely. Cincinnati Re generated an underwriting loss of just under $1 million for the second quarter as a result of a $4 million estimated share of losses from the Fort McMurray, Canada wildfire affecting the industry, plus what we believe is appropriate reserving for a diverse portfolio of reinsurance treaties.","We are also satisfied with the progress of expanding the personal lines products and services, we offer to our agencies higher net worth clients. Nearly one quarter of the total $59 million in personal lines new business written premiums for the first six months of 2016 came from high net worth policies.","We reported an underwriting profit for each of our property\/casualty segments in the first half of 2016. As in most years, we anticipate the second half to be better than the first.","Our commercial lines segment produced a combined ratio of just over 95% for the first half of the year, while that ratio for our excess and surplus segment was just under 75%.","Our life insurance subsidiary including income from its investment portfolio also experienced another good quarter and first half of the year. For the first six months of 2016, earned premiums grew 11%, and net income for our life insurance subsidiary rose 10% compared with last year.","Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was again strong at 4.6% for the second quarter and 10.5% for the first half of 2016. Generally higher valuations in securities markets augmented the contribution of our operating performance. While we are pleased with ongoing good performance, we understand the need to remain focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We will do that as we seek to continually improve performance.","I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great, thank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you for joining us today. I will open with highlights of second quarter investment results. It was another stellar quarter for investments, including 6% growth in pre-tax investment income and 7% on an after-tax basis. We also experienced increases in the fair value and unrealized gain positions of both our equity and bond portfolios.","We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of nearly $2.7 billion before taxes including more than $2 billion for our common stock portfolio that reached more than $5 billion in fair value.","For our bond portfolio, interest income again grew 4% in part due to net purchases of $309 million over the past four quarters. The bond portfolio's pre-tax average yield reported at 4.64% for the second quarter and 4.65% for the first half of 2016 match the year ago periods.","Taxable bonds purchased during the first six months of 2016 had an average pre-tax yield of 4.5%, 8 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.01%, 33 basis points lower than a year ago. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.","Cash flow from operating activities continue to fuel the investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago to $490 million and helped generate $292 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.","As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses at the same time of strategically investing in our business. Our first half 2016 property\/casualty underwriting expense ratio rose 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago.","Our loss reserves continue to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first six months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefitted our combined ratio by 5 percentage points compared with 4.4 points for the same period last year and similar to the 5.2 point rolling average for the prior four quarters.","Reserve development so far in 2016 continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years including 55% for accident year 2015, and 22% for accident year 2014.","Overall reserves, including accident years 2016 and net of reinsurance rose $229 million in the first half of 2016, including a $133 million for the IBNR portion. Our capital strength, liquidity, and financial flexibility continued at healthy levels. Our capital remains ready to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions such as returning capital to shareholders.","As usual I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property\/casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04, life insurance operations added $0.07, investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.47.","The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.72. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.59, and we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.41 during the second quarter to a record $42.37 per share.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Mike. As you can see we had a lot of positive trends carrying us into the second half of the year. Our focus on incremental improvement is adding up and delivering great results that are worth noticing.","In the last few months Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, have all affirmed our strong financial strength ratings maintaining their stable outlooks.","Fortune Magazine also took notice of our progress this year as we joined the ranks of the Fortune 500 in June. As we work together with our agency partners to maintain this momentum we're confident that we will continue to produce value per shareholders in the near-term and for the long-term.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.","I also note that many of you know Eric Mathews who we announced last call will be retiring on July 29 after nearly 40 years with the company. We thank Eric for his leadership of our accounting operations and wish him the best. Senior Vice President Theresa Hoffer will participate in future earnings conference calls instead of Eric.","As a remainder with Mike and me today, are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher; J.F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, and Marty Hollenbeck, in addition to Eric Mathews. Shannon, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Good morning everyone another excellent quarter as usual.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Josh.","Mike Sewell","Thank you.","Josh Shanker","I wanted to ask little about technique in reserving for personal lines versus commercial lines. Commercial lines have a tendency almost consistently will be quite redundant over a very long period of time and personal lines tend to whipsaw in both directions. I realize that obviously commercial liability and I think orders comp is long tell the nature and that might have something to do with it. But given your conservatives and how you think about things why is there -- are these two different sort of tracks that there are on?","Mike Sewell","Josh, this is Mike Sewell, that's a great question and hopefully, you mentioned whipsaw, I'm not sure I probably will defined it that way. We do follow a consistent approach with our actuaries, not changing how we do the reserves and look at them. But from time to time we will have a column refinements to the process as more information becomes available and so forth.","I think probably comment might be specifically related to the personal lines and how may be that fluctuate a little bit from the first quarter of this year to the second quarter and how may be second quarter was probably a little bit more in line with 2015 and 2014. Really as we noted in our first quarter 10-Q and I think I have made some comments in there, we did have a slight refinement on our personal lines business which was really related to what we called the AOE reserves. And so there were some expenses there that we refined it moved about $9 million, $10 million worth of reserves from the personal line side to the commercial line side. Had we not made that refinement you would have actually probably seen the personal lines prior year development in the first quarter really be flat. So because we did that you saw some favorable development there and now in the second quarter really what's running the temperature is personal auto as well as commercial auto when you look at prior year reserve development.","So absent some refinements I think we're fairly consistent, we are consistent in the process and I think the numbers really show that. So I don't know if Steve or anyone else has any additional comments, but that might have been a little longwinded for you.","Josh Shanker","I'll take as much information as I can get. New appointments on new agencies to what extent when you're growing are you finding the appointments are trending in newer territories versus territories that you know well. To what extent is it possible for you to find agencies in territories that you know well that you think you can get a 30% to 40% share of the business out of how is -- how are new ad looking these days?","J.F. Scherer","Josh, this is J.F. In existing territories we've always taken the approach with the relatively low number of agencies we have to really appoint as few as possible in particular area. Now with the M&A activity that's occurring a lot of consolidation in agencies from time to time we would run into a case where if we needed to augment our agencies in any particular area the Group from which we can choose might be smaller, but fortunately the desire for agencies that don't represent us to have a contract with us is still high.","So we rarely are turned down when we prospect for agencies. And so I'd say consequently and the fact is that there are a lot of agencies that don't represent us in a lot of territories. So that's not a big concern for us where we've been able to find agencies to a point 30%, 40% of the volume in an agency is an ambitious target. We certainly want to be consequential to the agencies as you know we talk about being number one or number two after we've been in an agency for five years.","But we're not seeing any lack of opportunity for us to do that it's worked up pretty darn well. In newer states particularly with what Will Van Del Heuvel is doing in the high net worth area between the very good reputation that our agencies have earned for our company and they talk to agencies in some of these newer states for us. The door is pretty wide open for us to appoint agencies for example in lower New York, Manhattan, Long Island. We just recently opened New Jersey, California is soon to be opened and really no shortage of agencies to a point there. So fortunately I think across the board new states and existing states were in pretty good shape.","Josh Shanker","And on the high net worth homeowners' initiative, do you get any sense of the previous carrier? Is there any trend on where you are winning that business from?","J.F. Scherer","Well the opportunities are resolved as everyone knows from the consolidation of carriers in that line. And so agencies more than anything want options they can offer to their policyholders. I just happen to see one come through this morning, it was from a direct writer that we actually wrote the business that frankly hadn't that particular business hadn't been very well attended to. But it's coming across the board actually the direct writers' write tremendous percentage of that business. So it's not all uncommon to see that.","And then from the usual characters we're competing pretty favorably against everybody right now. I think what's happening is that agencies when they take a contract with us they know as part of the approach we take to them is that if we'll agree to a point fewer agencies then perhaps brand X might appoint. In return for that, we ask that the agency concentrate on making the relationship with us work. So we're very pleased with the number of at-bats we're getting. I think that's the most important thing. Those agencies aren't forced to put any business with us but that if they have given us the opportunities which we're pleased if they are, we're very pleased with the result.","Josh Shanker","Well, continued good luck to all of you.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","Good morning, congratulations on the call and the earnings. I wanted to see if you could help us think about the trend in both the commercial and the personal lines of the accident year results, if you exclude the catastrophe loss, the so-called underlying combined ratio. Most folks are talking about commercial lines and at least commercial lines pricing being lower than claim cost inflation and then other mitigating efforts. And, obviously, you have a little different discussion on the personal lines side. I was wondering if you could kind of walk through your thoughts on both of those.","J.F. Scherer","Paul, this is J.F. I think in terms of the rate increases that we're getting on renewals, we're reasonably pleased with what we're seeing in auto both in private passenger and commercial autos, those are healthy and getting healthier. So we think that between the underwriting actions that we're taking in those two lines of business plus the rate increases. As you know, we've been pretty aggressive about rising reserves on prior years and pretty conservative this year, we think that things are going in the right direction on auto.","Relative to loss cost and all the other lines, there is still a lot of initiatives that are in the works here, loss control, inspections, more specialization by line of business as well as by industry that we think and then of course the segmentation and the analytics that we're employing. We just think we're being better selectors of risk and we're also addressing loss mitigation issues that's helping with our loss cost.","So as it is right now, the improvement you're seeing in the accident year excluding cats would be exactly what we would expected to have happened and we're pleased with really everything has kind of fallen in place still a lot more to do. Frankly we think there is lot of improvements we can continue to make in those areas.","Paul Newsome","So do you think that the trend -- the current trend we see in the last year or two will continue to see improvements in the underwriting combined ratio?","Steve Johnston","Paul this is Steve and clear 100% with J.F. he just nailed that that answer. May be just putting in a little bit of qualitative terms we already seen rate increase, I think segmentation as J.F. mentioned is working well, it is best helping some of the premiums driving and as also as J.F. mentioned in terms of the trend if we look at it in future trend in terms of rate-making being perspective.","So we're looking now of trying to anticipate where loss trends are going in the perspective rate periods or pricing periods. And the points that J.F. made about things that are going on, on the underwriting especially in loss control, [indiscernible] the company coming up. We think is making us optimistic about the future of continuing to make improvements. So I think from everything that we could see in the near-term anyways we feel pretty good about our process.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BAM Funds. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike Zaremski","My first question is on the catastrophe preannouncement, you pointed out in the release that this quarter's catastrophe load ended up being close to the normal in terms of the 10-year historical average. I guess in my seat I was a little bit surprised it was around that historical average, given your lack of personal lines exposure in Texas. So my question is whether your team at Cincy was surprised by the level of losses this quarter.","Mike Sewell","This is Mike. Thanks for the question. We really weren't surprised because it really was falling in line when you're looking at five-year, 10-year averages. The largest catastrophe and may be Marty might be able to talk about that really was in San Antonia, Texas, and having that run up, so we don't have personal lines there, it's only commercial lines. So that might have cut may be some of the analysts I'll say off guard a little bit having that being in there because that was running about $55 million, $56 million. There were some other ones in there that were in the, I will call it in the $15 million to $25 million range but probably not necessarily surprised when we look at the five-year, 10-year averages and so forth, but the last couple of years, we have pretty good catastrophe loss ratios and so this one being elevated a little bit.","So may be if I turn over to Marty for some of the details of some of our cats.","Marty Mullen","Sure. Thanks Mike. Comment on San Antonia was accurate it's about $56 million end of second quarter loss for us and all commercial and everything you read, San Antonio was not on the map in Texas as far as being a hail risk for the industry. There was supposed to be an area that really wasn't very prolific as far as previous hail events and so I think it caught everybody by a little bit of a surprise to the extent that the hail storm hits San Antonio.","As result of that, I think the losses were little greater in the industry than probably were anticipated for us. We certainly took our share of those commercial losses. That actually was twice the size of any other cat we had for the quarter.","The other ones are mainly Midwestern storms related to particular hail losses in the several stage over several days. So other than that there really wasn't anything unusual in the quarter as far as those events.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. That's helpful. And one follow-up, just kind of on the other hand while catastrophes pushed up the absolute combined ratio, the accident year excluding catastrophe loss ratio was the best it's been in 10 years, if my model is right. Can you speak to why it's improved so much, so we can kind of better think about its sustainability? ? I don't know if there were any unusual items or may be cats were high and that ate up some of the non-cat weather.","J.F. Scherer","Yes, Mike this is J.F. again similar to what we mentioned with Josh, and I think Paul as well, I think there is a momentum going right now for a variety of areas. One of the things we're very pleased with is the predictive modeling and analytics that we've employed both in personal lines and in commercial lines. That continues to get more and more refined; we're segmenting our book of business better than we have. I think we've done a good job of integrating that, it's a little more standard underwriting [indiscernible] a little of we talked about in the past. Our agents have been great in cooperating with that really for an agent to explain the science part of this to policyholders but I think we've done a good job there and agencies have come through for us.","We have expanded our loss control significantly over the last five years, really that last six or seven years, we're inspecting risk that we hadn't inspected in the past. The inspections that we are making are much more in-depth than we have in the past. We're discovering things both good and bad that allow us to make more informed decision.","So we've gotten off risk that we should gotten off of. We've said yes to risk that may be in the past we would have thought were a little tough in terms of their industry classification. So that's working out really well. I'd say in particular in personal lines, the inspections have also afforded a lift in the area of insurance to value. So we are increasing premiums there, getting a better ratio of premium to risk for ourselves there.","So it's not one thing, it's a lot of things that are working well. I don't think is there anything particularly unique to what we're doing to as to what other companies are doing. I just think we probably executed pretty well so far in this process and as Steve said a few minutes ago there is still, I think a lot of optimism moving forward. We can continue to improve.","Mike Zaremski","Got it. So it sounds like so, like maybe you can remind me I know you guys have talked in the past about kind of combined ratio goals over time, it feels like things that more momentum and things are potentially, I don't know want to put words in your mouth going better than planned a year or two ago and is that the right way to think about things?","Mike Sewell","Sure, I think so. With the plans that we have laid out and that we've been working towards like J.F. just mentioned, we always wanted to be I'll say in that 95 to 100 combined range but with interest rates where they're at today on the investment side, we've always been striving to be below 95 combined and are really driving everything we can on a current accident year basis ex-cat basis, we're really having to drive it to where we're at today and to keep the momentum going.","Steve Johnston","I'll just add to that, an example would be that we're pleased with is the introduction of high net worth to our first lines book of business. That segment of personal lines in the industry has always been much more profitable for us though we weren't writing very high net worth; I would say our book of business previous to Will Van Del Heuvel who joined the company was more massive fluent that it was high net worth. But it performed 10 points better than our middle market first lines book of business.","So as you can tell from the weighting of new business and high net worth, this quarter versus middle market, we're increasing the proportion of high net worth and so there have been a lot of deliberate steps that we have taken to position our book of business to perform better than the 95 to 100 that Mike mentioned.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","As there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time, I would return the call to Mr. Steve Johnston.","Steve Johnston","Well, thank you, Shannon.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter 2013 financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator instructions)","Thank you. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Good morning everyone, this is Dennis McDaniel, and we thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. Late yesterday we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents please visit our Investor website, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call you will first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.","At that time some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Committee Chairman Jack Schiff, Jr., Chairman of the Board Ken Stecher, Chief Insurance Officer J.F. Scherer, Principal Accounting Officer Eric Matthews, Chief Investment Officer Marty Hollenbeck and Chief Claims Officer Marty Mullen.","First please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Like last year, I am speaking with you today from Queens Borough [ph], Tennessee, the fourth stop on our 22-state tour of sales meeting with our independent agents. Our senior leadership team goes out in visitations in the first half of each year, and it\u2019s always an energizing experience for us.","We enjoy the chance to thank our agents in person for contributing to another year of underwriting profit and strong premium growth and for trusting Cincinnati Insurance to serve the people and businesses in their communities. We are pleased to report solid fourth quarter and full year of 2013 operating results.","As we consider our progress in building value for shareholders, we favor a long-term approach and manage our business accordingly. Our ongoing initiatives intended to improve insurance profitability and drive premium growth lead to an improved operating result for the full year 2013.","More favorable weather also contributed to our 2013 operating results. I\u2019d like to mention however, that we already know weather will affect our first quarter 2014 results. Two winter storm events between January 3 and January 8 cost an estimated $65 million to $85 million in catastrophe losses for our property casualty segments.","Most of our losses are from water damage related to frozen pipes that burst. It\u2019s too early for us to provide a meaningful estimate of losses from severe weather that occurred later in January. While weather can always affect our financial results, we believe execution of our strategic initiatives continue to provide benefits over time.","Our fourth quarter and full year combined ratios were below 94% within the 795% [ph] range we aim for. On an as per year basis for [ph] catastrophe losses, 2013 improved 4.3 points compared with 2012. We plan to improve our combined ratio for 2014. We\u2019re in the significant portion of 2013 steady renewal price increases over the next year and then the other initiatives we\u2019re implementing should benefit loss experience.","Premium growth for full year 2013 was as we expected. Our property casualty net written premium \u2013 net written premiums grew at a double digit pace benefiting from greater pricing precision and higher pricing overall.","For personal lines, full year premiums reach $1 billion for the first time. We remain on course to reach our goal of $5 billion of consolidated annual direct written premiums by the end of 2015. We continue to get more rates on lower margin policies and retain higher margin policies. As a result, our mix of business is shifting in a favorable direction.","On an average renewal price increase basis, commercial policies that are renewed during the fourth quarter had estimated average price increases in the mid-single-digit range, just as strong as our third quarter average. Also consistent with the third quarter, renewal price increases for our excess and surplus lines and our personal line segments continued in the high-single-digit and mid-single-digit ranges respectively.","Policy retention for both commercial and personal lines remained consistent with the year ago. Our commercial lines policy retention continues in the mid 80% range and personalized policy retention continues in the low-to-mid 90% range.","Our full year 2013 new business premiums at $543 million set another record high. Despite the total of our fourth quarter commercial and personalized new business coming in $7 million lower than the year ago.","Even more important than hitting the new record amount is the confidence we have in our new business pricing from our pricing analytics and modeling tools. Commercial lines new business premium can vary substantially by quarter, in part due to timing of acquiring large policies or fully new agencies.","For example, fourth quarter 2012 was particularly strong, was the highest volume of any quarter that year. The history shows that the fourth quarter is typically not our biggest quarter for commercial new business.","Our full year 2013 personal lines new business premiums came within $1 million of 2012. That was a satisfying result given our underwriting actions around homeowners rates and deductibles that we implemented last spring.","We tend to avoid drawing conclusions about trends based on a single quarter of data for certain measures. That applies to new business premiums as well as renewal pricing, large losses and prior accident year reserve development among other things. Instead, we focus on executing a long-term strategy and are quite satisfied with our performance for 2013.","In our life insurance segment earn premiums continue to grow during the quarter contributing to full year growth of 6%. For all of our insurance segments, we continue to be careful to grow premiums only when we believe profitability is adequate. We continue to appoint new agencies and that adds to premium growth over time as those relationships mature. In 2014, we plan to appoint approximately 100 agencies.","January 1, mark the renewal of our reinsurance program. It\u2019s an important part of managing enterprise risk and helped protect capital and limit earnings volatility. Our per risk treaties remained substantially the same as 2013, except for increase in our retention $1 million to $8 million per loss. That change a more favorable rates should result in a modest reduction in our 2014 reinsurance cost. Our property catastrophe treaty provides coverage similar to last year.","In January, we replace our expiring collateralized reinsurance with the new catastrophe bond providing $100 million of coverage. The coverage period now expand up to three years, expiring January 18, 2017.","The coverage applies to severe convictive storm loses in selected areas as well as supplemental coverage in the event of an earthquake. In addition to coverage provided last year related to the new mother [ph] fault line that includes several states in the Pacific Northwest.","For both coverage, convictive storm and earthquake, the geography related to the coverage was expanded for 2014. The program now generally covers the entire states where we have significant amounts of insured property risks instead of just selected counties. The storm aggregate coverage provides loss recovery once storm losses for all events in aggregate exceed $160 million after a $5 million deductible per event.","To the second quarter in a row, investment income growth is another positive. That growth is impressive to us considering that fourth quarter 2012 included about $5 million of special or accelerated dividends as issuers responded to anticipated tax law changes.","Finally, our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio confirms strong company performance for the quarter and the year. That measure keeps every associate in our company focused on individual and team performance, helping to create shareholder value over time. It was 16.1% for the year and in an average 13.1% over the past five years.","Our 2013 value creation ratio was aided by favorable trends in security markets, but I\u2019m more pleased with the 10% year-over-year improvement in the largest component operating income which contributed 8.5 points.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will now discuss the value creation ratio further along with other financial terms.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. As Steve noted, our performance for 2013 was strong. The 16.1% value creation ratio exceeded the 10% to 13% annual average we are targeting for 2013 through 2017.","2013 provided another example of the benefit of our equity investing strategy and in addition to a strong contribution to book value from appreciation and our stock portfolio evaluation rising dividend income offset lower interest income that was pressured by the low interest rate environment.","Our stock portfolio\u2019s pretax net unrealized gains reaching nearly $1.9 billion at year end, up 85% for the year and 23% for the quarter. Dividend income grew 6% for the year and 3% for the fourth quarter. Our bottom portfolio\u2019s pretax unrealized gains were at $481 million at year end, down $390 million for the year and $55 million for the quarter.","Yields for our bond portfolio continue to move lower but at a slower pace as its fourth quarter 2013 pretax yield of 4.84% was 17 basis points lower than the year ago. For the third quarter of 2013, that decline was 19 basis points.","Taxable bonds representing about 70% of our bond portfolio had a fourth quarter and 2013 pretax yield of approximately 5.33%. The average yield for new taxable bonds purchased during the quarter was approximately 4.61%. For the same period, our tax exempt bond portfolio yield was approximately 3.9% and purchases during the quarter yielded approximately 3.2%. Our bond portfolio\u2019s effective duration measured 4.6 years at year end 2013, up from 4.2 years, one year ago.","Cash flow from operating activities continues to benefit investment income. At $787 million for the full year 2013, net bring [ph] cash flow exceeded the same period a year ago by $149 million or 23%, despite paying an additional $184 million in income taxes.","I\u2019d like to spend a moment on loss reserves. Following a consistent approach, we\u2019ve experienced 25 consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. We seek to remain into the upper half of the actual [ph] estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.","For full year 2013, favorable development on prior accident years of 4.10 percentage points was about one-third of the 2012 ratio. And the fourth quarter ratio for 2013 was also much lighter than 2012.","The outlier periods are actually the 2012 periods. As we mentioned during our first quarter conference call, in 2012 we observed a turning point in the terms of underwriting performance, in reductions in our IBNR reserves where outsize compared to a typical year.","In fact, we added net IBNR reserves in each of the past five years with the exception of 2012. As I said on this call, for the third quarter, we believe we are exercising prudence by maintaining IBNR reserves at a higher level.","To help put this into perspective, let\u2019s review our level reserve development over the past two decades. Favorable reserved development for the five years, 2008 through 2012 averaged nearly 10 points. However, the 10-year average for 1997 through 2006 was five points, fairly close to our 2013 results.","If you annualize the aggregate favorable reserve development for the full year 2013 compared to 2012, you\u2019ll find that 43% of the decrease is attributable to commercial casualty and 24% to workers compensation. Our 2013 favorable development occurred for several accident years including 69% for accident year 2012, 28% for accident year 2011 and 3% for all older accident years.","Expense management produced another good result. Our property casualty underwriting expense ratio for 2013 improved 0.3 percentage points, even with strategic investments to growth premiums and improved profitability.","Next, let\u2019s turn to financial strength and liquidity, we both remained in excellent condition. We repurchased approximately 1 million shares during the fourth quarter at an average cost of $52.13. This repurchase activity was a maintenance price action [ph] intended to partially offset the issuance of shares to equity compensation plan.","Last week, the Board of Directors increased the shareholder dividend by 4.8%. This sets the stage for increasing our dividend for the 54th consecutive year. Cash remarkable securities at the parent company stood at $1.5 billion at year-end, one-third higher than the year earlier.","Our property casualty premium to surplus ratio remained at 0.9 to 1 providing ample capital and capacity to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.24. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.36. Valuation changes related to our pension plan contributed $0.30.","The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, lowered book value per share by $0.21. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $1.37 and we declared $0.42 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.70 during the fourth quarter to $37.21 per share.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks, Mike. Some of you may have noticed through recent news releases about new people joining our Cincinnati family. In November, our Board welcomed David Osborn, a new independent director whose investment firm focuses like us on dividend growth strategies.","And just last week, we welcomed Will Van Den Heuvel to the Cincinnati team as our new Senior Vice President responsible for personal lines. Will brings an excellent track record of leadership experience in the personalized marketplace and improving commitment to the success of independent insurance agencies.","We see both of those additions as investments who will bring shareholders a good return overtime. Just as important, in 2013 we reduced our underwriting expense ratio while investing in talented associates with total staff growing 2.6% or just over 100 in that positions. We know that our field force is the strong differentiator from competitors. On a percentage basis, field positions increased at a slightly higher rate than headquarters positions.","Our agency customers appreciate the loss control and claims expertise we are placing in their communities. At headquarters, we continue to invest in positions to support our pricing and data analytics improvements.","We think we\u2019ve just scratched the surface of the benefit we\u2019ll see from our 2013 improvements and we have the people, products and processes in place to keep it executing on our plans in 2014. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you throughout this year.","As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Matthews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenback.","Denise, we\u2019re ready for you to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Okay, your first question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks for taking my questions.","Steve Johnston","Good morning Mike.","Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. First question, so you guys specifically mentioned in the press release too about ramping up inspections next year and you guys are investing in people and technology clearly. Should we expect then some impact the expense ratio as those kind of work through and I guess obviously, hopefully they help the loss ratio, what were you thinking about expenses with \u2013 given those initiatives?","Mike Sewell","Yes. Thanks Mike, this is Mike Sewell. As it\u2019s related to that, my goal is still to work the expense ratio down closer to a 30 expense ratio. But with one of the investments that we\u2019ve been making has contributing in a lot to the loss expense ratio if you\u2019ve seen that going down.","We have been increasing some of our headcount in strategic areas for growing premiums, also the loss control. But what we\u2019re also doing is we\u2019re making sure that that increase in investment is lower than the increase in premiums that we\u2019re bringing on.","So we were able to reduce the expense ratio by 0.3 points this year but in total we\u2019re still spending more money and investing it where we believe we need to. And the results you\u2019re seeing on the loss expense side.","J.F. Scherer","Mike, this is J.F. Scherer. One thing I might add for example in personal lines, in the inspections, what those inspections are revealing has paid for about 60% of the cost of the inspections themselves. In other words, we find things that where we immediately increased the premium, things like stoves that people have in houses that we have searched our agents for in bright of other things [ph].","So as Mike said, the real focus is to improve the loss ratio of all these initiatives but we are finding an opportunity actually to increase premium by what we discover.","Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Next, on reserves. So I appreciate all the great color you guys gave on the call and you guys give in the release. And if I\u2019m thinking \u2013 if we\u2019re thinking more high level, I mean, is \u2013 are you seeing loss cost inflation pick-up versus prior \u2013 couple years trends given maybe the pick-up in the economy or you guys moving into other territories and what not?","Steve Johnston","Mike, this is Steve Johnston. And actually we aren\u2019t \u2013 I think we\u2019re seeing pretty steady trends in terms of loss cost trends. And I think it does have to do with the work that we\u2019re doing in the loss prevention side of things to keep those trends lower. So we are seeing our rate exceed our loss cost trend and rates in the mid-single-digits and we\u2019d say loss cost trends are more in the low-single-digits and the remaining is steady.","Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","And would you say workers\u2019 comp is below historical trend still?","Steve Johnston","Yes, that\u2019s a fear assessment.","Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny Asset Management. You\u2019re line is open.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Hi. Good morning guys. Thank you. I guess first, any more color you can give on the January cat events? Just \u2013 isn\u2019t \u2013 a couple other people have said similar things, I was trying to get a little bit better understanding why pipe storms are causing what seems like \u2013 almost like Q2 cat loads rather than Q1 cat loads?","Marty Mullen","Hi, Ian. This is Marty Mullen. The January \u2013 the second cat load [ph] of January was the main event for us from January 5 to the 8, different type of storm, the claims are split up about 50-50 commercial and personal line. But for us the spreads in losses [ph] and losses were about 70% commercial. So it\u2019s three \u2013 for us it\u2019s about three or four state event but as you know the cat involved 17-stage.","And I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the type of disclosure you\u2019re seeing because of such a widespread event and it\u2019s four days. But for us about 95% of the losses are already late into freezing [ph]. And Ohio is our biggest state with 35% of the claim count.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Very helpful, thank you. The other area of claim that I think was mentioned in the release was auto claims inflation. Can you just \u2013 again, you\u2019re not the only company that mentioned that this quarter. But are you seeing a tick up in BI trends? And any additional color you can give on that?","Steve Johnston","This is Steve again. And I think in that particular line there would be a little bit of an uptake. I think severity in particular. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that\u2019s unreasonable or within our ability or outside of our ability to address with rate pricing precision, segmentation, and continuing to work our initiatives in terms of keeping those loss cost under control from the loss control side.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Okay. So that didn\u2019t have any impact on the new business there that you pulled back your appetite when you saw that loss trend or anything like that?","Steve Johnston","No. I think our appetites remained consistent, long-term focused and we feel \u2013 we feel very good about the business.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Okay. And was that increase in trend kind of across the country or across types of drivers or was it concentrated in any area?","Steve Johnston","We didn\u2019t see it concentrated in any particular area. No.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Okay, great. Repurchase, you bought back some stock for the first time in a while, I was just curious if that\u2019s something we should expect to continue or if this was maybe a one-time thing for option dilution or something like that?","Mike Sewell","Hi, Ian. It\u2019s Mike here. We do it from time to time. The last time we did buyback a little over 1 million shares in 2011 with the stock price being up, folks exercise its stock [ph] options. We really thought it was prudent to do a maintenance type of activity on that to at least keep the share relatively flat.","So we did the win and do the 1 million shares to average cost that you heard earlier. So I think if we look out into the future I think we\u2019re going to be watching share count. And with the growth, we\u2019ll do maintenance when we need to do the maintenance. But at the same time we\u2019re using our capital. As I mentioned that the Board increased the dividend 4.8%.","So setting that up for the 54th consecutive year, there\u2019s various ways we use our capital and including investing in the business to growth premiums and reduce the losses. There\u2019s a combination of areas that we use our capital and that was one to \u2013 really I view it as a maintenance type matter.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Great. And then just maybe lastly, any thoughts on the equity portfolio? Obviously the market was great last year. It\u2019s pulling out this year. Have there been any sort of thoughts of reallocating either among sectors or just overall exposure, something to get more defensive or is it pretty much steady as she goes?","Steve Johnston","Any authority [ph], how was it? Not really. We\u2019re \u2013 again, we\u2019re long-term investors. The income off of [ph] the portfolio, the tax preferred status of the dividend is well account just as much really as price fluctuations. We\u2019re pretty contempt with where we\u2019re at below 30s as the percentage of the overall portfolio. We look at a number of different ways. So we\u2019re not going to undergo any significant reallocation of invested asset at this point.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Great. Okay, I think that answers it actually. Thank you so much.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Ian.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent DeAugustino from KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.","Hi, and good morning everyone.","Steve Johnston","Good morning. How are you, Vincent?","Vincent DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.","Doing well. Steve, you\u2019ve mentioned your bringing Will on, and I\u2019m just kind of curious given his experience at Chubb and AIG before, kind of in conjunction with something if I\u2019m recalling correctly, you discussed with some agents earlier in 2013. That was about Cincinnati\u2019s homeowner business, being kind of maybe positioned as a Chubb-like product. And I was just wondering if you might be able to provide an update kind of on that initiative. And then wonder \u2013 if, say, Will\u2019s addition has anything to do with that strategy?","J.F. Scherer","This is \u2013 this is J.F. Just by way of comment, as a company, about 20% of what we currently write would be in the, I guess you might call it the more affluent personal lines area. But clearly bringing Will on in addition to his background, this is a great personal lines executive across the Board. What we all want to do is to fortify what we\u2019re doing, expand what we\u2019re doing in a more affluent marketplace.","We\u2019re not talking about going in to the ultra-affluent. I guess the way I would describe it would be more as it is describing the industry as a massive loss which by definition I guess we\u2019d say coverage A homeowner limits of about $500,000 or $1 million up to the $4 million, $5 million, $6 million or $7 million range.","Clearly, Will\u2019s experience throughout his career allows him to bring a tremendous amount of expertise in that area. Our agencies write a lot of that business. And so we think that just by fine-tuning the product, adding more expertise at the underwriting level, more expertise and our ability to write schedules, loads, jewelry that types of things that go with the affluent marketplace, it\u2019s going to open the door I think to a lot of opportunities for us.","Vincent DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.","Okay. That color is pretty helpful. And just one other question, and, J.F., I guess, it\u2019s probably best for you, I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve noticed any demand for the three-year policies declining recently?","J.F. Scherer","What we\u2019re seeing and as Steve mentioned we\u2019re seeing a steady renewal increases in our commercial line\u2019s book of business in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re getting larger increases on the classes of business with the policies that are at least adequately priced.","Anecdotally, what I would tell you is that we\u2019re driving higher rate obviously on the more quarterly [ph] priced accounts that we have. And we have seen less of a take-up on the three-year policy because we\u2019re very aggressive about what we would want on those policies. It works to renew them on a three-year basis, which we view as a good thing. In other words if the policy holder stays with this obviously as an account we want to keep, we did a good one-year increase, we\u2019re going to get another of that less adequately priced policy next year and the year after.","The good thing is that on the most adequately priced policies, the uptake for the three-year policy remains excellent. It continues to be and where it\u2019s being reinforced all three days this week when we write our sales meetings, buyer agencies and it\u2019s a tremendous advantage for us.","Vincent DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.","Good. Good. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Market. Your line is open.","Mark Dwelle \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, good morning, a couple of questions. Mike, I think you write off the percentage of the product period development that related to some of the different accident years. Was that for the quarter or for the full-year to date?","Mike Sewell","That was for the \u2013 that was for the full-year.","Mark Dwelle \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I guess in hearing those figures, it strikes me as that sort of short-tail loaded which is to say the \u2013 is that because the older accident years there\u2019s a mix of adverse as well as favorable, it\u2019s bringing that older accident year percentage down so low, I might think of kind of three to four-year tail on a lot of your business.","Mike Sewell","Yes. No, that\u2019s fair to say. There was a little less in those older accident years. And we did notice that in workers\u2019 comp going back a few years, there was some payments that we made in the current year and we just thought it was prudent to be very careful with those years. We added a little bit to those order accident years. And so that\u2019s what resulted in the lower percentile for the order accident years that I quoted.","Mark Dwelle \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Then I \u2013 somebody commented, I can\u2019t remember who, about the new business being lower in the fourth quarter as compared to other quarters in the year. Why would that be the case? I mean I guess the anecdotal thought is always that sales people are hungry to get their quotas in the fourth quarter to drive more new business rather than last. Have you guys just all hit your targets earlier in the year, I don\u2019t know?","Steve Johnston","Yes. I think \u2013 this is Steve, Mark. And I think we had some variability but I do think that there\u2019s more economic activity going on generally in the second and third quarter in our operating territories were constructions going on, the weather is warmer, and more times than not, the fourth quarter is not the largest quarter for new business. 2012 was an outlier, it was just a great quarter but that\u2019s normally not the case. And I think it\u2019s probably driven by the economic activity in our areas.","Mark Dwelle \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And I just wanted to clarify when you \u2013 the splits that you gave on the early winter storm activity, that was 70% commercial, 30% personal, that was \u2013 that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing so far?","Marty Mullen","In law \u2013 in law [ph], that\u2019s correct.","Mark Dwelle \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That\u2019s all my questions. Thank you.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hey, I just wanted to ask about any reactions you\u2019ve seeing or have to the travelers\u2019 core in [ph] product and just generally the idea that personal lines, auto in particular but maybe even home are going to increasingly go towards lower commission sort of better customer cost.","J.F. Scherer","Paul, this is J. F. Of course we\u2019re out with the agents this week they haven\u2019t come up. We\u2019re not getting any feedback at all on it.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","So steady as she goes, I guess. That all just \u2013 that\u2019s all I want to ask. Thanks guys.","J.F. Scherer","Yes. At least as far as our strategy, our agents, what we are talking to them about in personal lines, we\u2019re just not getting much feedback. We\u2019ve been encouraged by the response we\u2019ve gotten in personal lines over the last year. I guess by way of a little commentary and Steve mentioned in his remarks that new business in personal lines tailed off a bit for us towards the end of the year. And we have a real tough comparison in the first quarter. But that\u2019s almost by this final [ph] assessment we\u2019ve got two rate increases on homeowners that are earning its way through the book plus we strengthen our underwriting stance on agent for us [ph], deductible things of that nature.","So I think our agency is once again, relative to how they approach personal lines with us, they do use comparative writers. They\u2019re not enamored by the commoditization of personal lines. However they do rights in business that would be in that category. I mean, it\u2019s clear from the reaction to Will tend to both the [ph] sales meetings that they\u2019re very introduced about the fact that we\u2019re going to fortify our activity in the higher valued homeowner \u2013 higher valued client arena where there is more profitability from an underwriting standpoint and more profitability at the agency level to write that kind of business. And it\u2019s the marquee accounts. It\u2019s the significant policy holders in the community.","So I guess maybe we\u2019d be a bad carrier to canvass for opinions on other company\u2019s approaches from that standpoint. But I can say that the reaction to what we\u2019re doing has been pretty good.","Mike Sewell","And I\u2019d had Paul, that our strategy, you know as well as an agency strategy and what we\u2019re doing now in personal lines with some of these higher valued homes is very consistent with what we\u2019ve done over time in trying to provide every type of product that our agencies need to be successful. If you look back to access a surplus lines, it would have been an example, target markets and other example. And now what we\u2019re doing in personal lines is very consistent with our agent aware in [ph] strategy.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","That\u2019s great. Thanks guys.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor Web site cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is a quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you will first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer, and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating in the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenback; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; Senior Vice President of Commercial Lines, Steve Spray; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Financial, Teresa Hopper.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore does not reconcile to GAAP.","Now, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning. And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Net income for the third quarter of 2018 was more than five times the same period a year ago. Approximately three quarters of the growth in net income again reflected variability related to this year\u2019s new accounting requirement for changes in the fair value of equity securities. About one eighth of the increase was from other non-recurring items generally related to taxes, and Mike will comment further on that in a moment. The remaining growth in net income largely reflects improved underwriting results despite higher catastrophe losses and is reflected by our improving property casualty combined ratio and 41% growth in non-GAAP operating income.","Our 96.8% combined ratio for the third quarter of this year was 2.5 points better than year ago. And is the result of several factors, including ongoing benefits of diversifying our business in recent years. Our commercial line segment experienced another good quarter with a combined ratio of near 95%. Importantly, we\u2019re seeing signs of improvement in paid loss cost trends for our commercial casualty line of business. The paid ratio for the first nine months of 2018 was almost 2 percentage points lower than the same period a year ago.","While we\u2019re currently maintaining a prudent amount of IBNR reserve for that line, particularly for accident year 2018, we were comfortable with releasing some reserves for all the accident years, largely accident years 2016 and prior. We continue to take a careful approach to growing our commercial lines business and targeting underwriting actions, slowed net written premium growth to 1% on the nine month basis.","Overall, commercial lines' estimated average price increases for the third quarter were slightly higher than the first half of 2018, including higher average pricing for our commercial casualty line of business. Our excess and surplus line segment continues to perform very well with third quarter and year-to-date combined ratios in the low 70s. It is reported 24 straight quarters of combined ratios below 100%. Excess and surplus lines' premiums are also growing at a healthy rate in the double digit range for the third quarter and first nine months of this year.","Our personal line segment in Cincinnati Re were affected by significant levels of weather-related catastrophe losses, experiencing third quarter combined ratios a little over 100%. Cincinnati Re remains profitable for the full year and inception to-date. Our personal line segment continued to experience a rise in average rate increases. The third quarter 2018 average was a little higher than the second quarter with personal auto again near the high end of the high single digit range. Both of these areas of our business continue to grow at healthy rates, and we anticipate better underwriting results in future quarters.","Throughout our property-casualty operations, we continue to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on policies where our models and judgment indicate that's needed as we segment accounts through careful underwriting of various risks. That segmentation is not always reflected in the average renewal price increases we report. However, when the benefits of segmentation combined with rising reported average renewal price increases as they did this quarter, it can significantly enhance our overall profitability.","Our life insurance subsidiary also had an outstanding quarter, nearly doubling net income reported a year ago, along with earned premiums growing at 9%. Our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 6.3% for the third quarter of 2018. The component of net income before investment gains or losses contributed 2.4 percentage points, an improvement of 1.1 points versus a year ago, including 0.7 points from other nonrecurring items. In addition, investment gains in our equity portfolio contributed 4.6 percentage points, offsetting a negative 0.7 point effect from the fixed maturity portfolio. Our results for the quarter were solid and included several areas of ongoing improvement in our operations.","Next our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight some important aspects of the financial performance and financial condition.","Mike Sewell","Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Growth of pretax investment income of 1% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 has slowed somewhat, reflecting the fact that in recent years, many of our higher yielding bonds were called prior to maturity or redeemed upon reaching maturity dates. As a comparison, our pretax investment income grew at a 2% rate for full year 2017 and at 4% in 2016.","On the other hand, after-tax investment income is 12% higher so far in 2018 compared with the first nine months of 2017, continuing to contribute significantly to earnings and book value growth. Dividends from our equity portfolio continued growing nicely, up 5% during the third quarter of 2018 and 6% on a year-to-date basis. Our investment portfolio experienced overall gains for the third quarter of $381 million before tax effects. That included $458 million increase in our equity portfolio, partially offset by $76 million decrease from our bond portfolio.","We ended the quarter with a net appreciated value of nearly $3.4 billion, including $7 million in our bond portfolio. Taking a closer look at interest income from our bond portfolio, which decreased 1% during the quarter, the pretax average yield was 4.19% for the third quarter of 2018, down 24 basis points from last year's third quarter. We continue to invest in bonds, including $324 million in net purchases during the first nine months of this year.","Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter 2018 had an average pretax yield of 4.53%, 72 basis points higher than we purchased for last year's third quarter. Tax exempt bonds purchased average 3.87% also, up 72 basis points from a year ago.","Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio, funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first nine months of 2018 totaled $826 million, up 11% from the same period a year ago despite 2018 income tax payments that nearly doubled for 2017 amount.","Now, I'll comment on the $56 million third quarter 2018 benefit from certain nonrecurring items, of which $50 million was a result of tax accounting method changes, for which we received approval from the IRS during the quarter as disclosed in income tax footnote of our 10-Q filing. The largest of these tax accounting changes pertain to the valuation of our tax base for loss reserves, which had a $49 million favorable effect on our reported third quarter net income.","Turning to our underwriting expense ratio. We continue to carefully manage expenses with an eye towards strategically investing in our business where we think it make sense. Our nine months 2018 property-casualty underwriting expense ratio rose by only one-tenth of a percentage point compared with the same period of 2017.","Regarding loss reserves, once again, our consistent approach to setting overall reserves resulted in property-casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Third quarter 2018 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.5 percentage points. And the nine-month 2018 benefit of 3.3 percentage points exceeded the same period last year by 0.6 percentage points. Our commercial casualty lines of business experienced $21 million of favorable reserve development during the quarter.","Most of our major lines of business have experienced favorable reserve development in the first nine months of 2018. On an all lines basis by accident year it included 39% for accident year 2017, 20% for accident year 2016 and 41% for 2015 and prior accident years. Regarding capital management, both financial strength and financial flexibility remain in excellent shape.","I'll conclude in typical fashion with a summary of third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio; property-casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.20; life insurance operations added $0.09; investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.92, including $0.34 from other non-recurring items; net investment gains or losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.36; net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.22; and we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders; the net effect was a book value increase of $2.54 during the third quarter to a record high $51.22 per share.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. It was a good quarter and we feel optimistic about the future. That optimism includes anticipation of meaningful contributions over time from leaders at Beaufort Underwriting Agency, the Lloyd's managing agency subsidiary of our pending acquisition of MSP Underwriting Limited that we announced earlier this month. Collectively, we aim to focus on profitable growth and providing superior service to our appointed agencies. History tells us that doing so will benefit all stakeholders at Cincinnati Financial and its affiliated companies, creating shareholder value over time.","As a reminder, with Mike and me today, are J.F. Scherer, Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenback and Teresa Hopper. Michelle, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Q - Mike Zaremski","Maybe I'll start on the E&S segment, I know it's not the largest segment but results continue to be phenomenal. And just curious, maybe you could talk more about what this book is weighted towards. So I always thought that overtime the combined ratio I feel would gravitate to -- better than the total commercial, but it seems to continue to be phenomenal. So maybe you can give some more color on what's going on there?","J.F. Scherer","Mike, this is J.F. Scherer. The book is obviously heavily weighted, casualty versus property, we don't write coastal property in the NS company. The appetite ranges runs everything from special event policy, small special events policies to fairly sizable products liability coverages. I think part of the reason why we were doing so well is that what we write tends to be associated with the property and casualty, the standard size and account. So 45%, roughly of the E&S policies we write are accompanying Cincinnati insurance company package. The E&S premiums and losses are included in our agents' profit sharing. So they're very careful about what they place with us.","We also have the benefit that our claims folks that handle the standard business also handle the E&S policies. So I think you all-in-all when you add it all together, I think we're getting more carefully selected business. We are patient about growing CSU and that our agencies write about $3 billion in the E&S business and their agencies. We'll finish the year around $250 million in CSU. So, we view that we have a lot of opportunity and we don't need to try to explode on the same stretch to write business that we're writing. So we're very comfortable writing the casualty side. We don't see ourselves expanding in the coastal property year.","And so we're taking a -- and probably obviously, the management of CSU, Don Doyle and the rest of his staff, they just do an exemplary job in terms of how they review things and how carefully they promote things.","Mike Zaremski","If we can switch gears to personal lines, maybe can you touch on both home and auto, auto feels like a -- it feels like the auto centric or the personal and centric insurers are feeling a lot better and pricing is coming down in auto whereas maybe some of the commercial centric personal lines riders are continuing to try to improve their mix and whatnot. And then in homeowners, some carriers have talked about some negative trends in terms of underline. So maybe you could touch on those lines of business please.","J.F. Scherer","Well, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about private passenger auto that we think that the rate increases, the analytics that we're applying, are setting things in a good direction there. And we have been taking some fairly significant rate increases as we've disclosed in the upper single-digit range. On homeowner, notwithstanding the fact that the results don't look as good, we're pretty optimistic about the direction that we're heading there. High net worth continues to grow at a nice cliff. Historically, high net worth is been more profitable with middle market and we think that the team that Will Van Den Heuvel assembled in that area, a great number professionals with many years experience in high net worth space, will produce results that\u2019ll be very favorable.","We are seeing the negative trends that many other carriers have talked about. Our rate increases in home owners are mid-single digits and we see that strengthening over the next couple of years. And also in addition to rate increases, we'll continue to do what we have been doing relative to inspections and loss control associated with our homeowner book of business. We are seeing and have seen larger claims in the homeowner area. Those tend to be pretty volatile. Right now, based on what we've seen, we\u2019re maintaining a fair amount of -- a prudent level of reserving, which you would expect out of us on that homeowner line. We have confidence that we think things will level out and that those results will get much better.","Mike Zaremski","And lastly if we can focus on commercial liability, looks like commercial auto has been improving. But maybe you could talk more broadly about lost costs, and on the commercial liability side, some carriers are saying that they\u2019re seeing an uptick in liability inflation along with just broader inflation. Although, it does seem like maybe commercial auto is getting a lot better and offsetting that. So just trying to get a sense for margins, because pricing, it seems like it's still steady low single digits. And wondering how you\u2019re seeing lost cost inflation.","Steve Johnston","I think we have seen some of those trends. I'd like to think we got out a bit early on it and have been addressing it here over a period of time. And you'll recall that we have had periods where we\u2019ve shown some adverse development on that line as we've reacted to seeing some of the trends. I think we have moved to take action in terms of both rate and prudent underwriting. And now are showing a couple quarters in a row where we've had some favorable development on that. I think it's still prudent that we treat the current accident quarter with due caution as we've seen this trend. But I do think we are on top of it, addressing that appropriately with both rate and prudent underwriting action.","Mike Zaremski","And what about -- other than commercial auto, is there any lines I should be -- general liability and what not?","Steve Johnston","No, we feel pretty good about the book and in total. And again, the commercial auto, I think we\u2019re making progress there with the accident year ex-caps starting to move in the correct direction.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","I really want to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question. Steve, can you talk a little bit about the internal analytical capabilities that you have to anticipate maybe macroeconomic changes that would impact commercial claim frequency?","Steve Johnston","Yes, I think it's the whole team. It starts with claims. We have local claims representatives led by Marty Mullen here that are out working from their homes in the communities with the agents. And so, I think we get some pretty early intelligence of what's going on into street level from our claims people. That\u2019s brought here in the home office where we have a robust process, call it, oversight committee that has every department in the Company represented. We do have the predicted model on the analytic side very much segment the book.","In fact, we can look at every single policy in terms of how we feel it is priced relative to where we think it should be priced. And we take action at a very granular rate in terms of encouraging, keeping those that have the highest profit potential. And working with those that don't in terms of what we can do on the underwriting side, the loss control side, pricing, also working with the agent. So, it's a very holistic approach that we use. And we do have, I think specific to your question, the analytics in place and the predictive models in place that allow us to do this at a very granular level.","Meyer Shields","And I think we're clearly seeing it in results. Maybe a more specific question, we're hearing some chatter about better funded law firms maybe impacting overall casualty claim frequency severity or both. Is that something that you're seeing?","Steve Johnston","We\u2019re keeping an eye on that, and I'll let Marty Mullen comment on that.","Marty Mullen","Meyer, we haven\u2019t really experienced that phenomena or trend across our casualty book other than past history. It's been pretty stable in that event.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mark Dwelle from RBC. Your line is now open.","Mark Dwelle","Just couple of questions, some prior people covered a few of them. I just want to drill down on the loss cost a little bit. One of your competitors commented fairly extensively this morning about workers' comp and some of the pressure that they were seeing there with the high employment and a lot of new workers in the workforce. Just wondering what your experiences been so far and how that compares with their commentary?","Steve Johnston","I didn't hear the commentary or know about that, but we would comment on what we\u2019re seeing is still workers' comp to be very favorable. It is in terms of the loss cost trends, it is coming -- it's being recognized I think with increased competition on the premium side where there's very healthy competition for workers' comp given its profitability. I think if we would comment to where we might see the impact of full employment and looking for making sure that to get workers, would be on the commercial auto side where we pay very close attention to any qualification of the drivers that we see in commercial automobile. And not that we don't pay close attentions to it in the workers' comp and we have not seen it as much in the workers' comp trends as we have in the auto trends.","J.F. Scherer","And Mark this is J. F. I guess the only thing I would add to that would be that the things that we notice most and monitor motion most and seems to be affecting our book of business most is just simple base rate loss cost decreases by NCCI, that\u2019s been pretty aggressive. We have -- historically, we've been a little concerned as that's -- those declines, for example, are a bit behind the times and that -- so we to a degree try to neutralize those. And I would also agree with Steve that if there's one thing that we hear from policy agents from their policyholders is the frustration they\u2019ve in finding qualified workers.","And so we -- there\u2019s a pretty aggressive marketplace out there writing workers' comp, a lot of carriers that are offering agencies commission bonuses. We\u2019re pleased with our workers comp book of business. I would say compared to many other carriers, we still approach it more cautiously, not pessimistically but cautiously, than others would.","Mark Dwelle","And then as you look at your -- I guess, probably written premium growth, more so than earned, because that\u2019s been a naturally lag. I mean you commented on the rate environment and the pricing environment rather. What proportion of your premium growth would you say is really being derived from just a better economy and more exposure unit growth and more, I should say, workers and et cetera?","Steve Johnston","I think it's really split generally what we see about 50-50 there, because we are getting rate in the low single digit range, and premium growth in that same range and also seeing a pickup in activity in the economy as well. So, I think it's -- the last I checked, it was pretty much a 50-50 split.","Mark Dwelle","And one other question just related to the tax rate in the quarter. There\u2019re few moving pieces between the realized gains and special items and so forth. Would you\u2019ve the effective tax rate on operating income for the quarter or approximation at any rate?","Mike Sewell","For the effective tax rate for, I want to say traditional operating income, you could think about that almost as 21%. But also included in operating income is investment income. The effective tax rate on that is about 16%. So, when you think about operating income, what\u2019s the mix? Do you have more underwriting income that would drive it towards 21%? If you have less underwriting income, it will probably push it towards the 16%. The operating income effective tax rate for this quarter might look a little bit lower than normal. We filed our tax return right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We had it prepared right at the end of the third quarter waiting for a couple of items to wrap up.","So, you have some time some book to tax adjustments. And so some of those adjustments from what we recorded at the end of 2017, we\u2019re making those adjustments and we made them right there towards the end of the third quarter. In this case, it had a positive effect and so it actually brought our effective tax rate down for operating income. But I would say absent non-recurring items, investment gains and losses, book tax adjustments, you\u2019re probably going to look at a normal run rate that might be in the 17% with a normal maybe mixture of underwriting income to investment income. And as we keep improving it will start to go closer to 21% as the combined ratio comes down and gets better.","Operator","The next question comes from Ron Bobman from Capital Returns. Your line is open.","Ron Bobman","I had two topics I was interested in and this management teams garnered an well-deserved great amount of respect, and the personal lines initiative on the high end homeowners, as well as the E&S business, are both doing at wonderful at their current state. And I\u2019m curious to know and putting that as a backdrop, the Lloyd's Syndicate, and I know it's still a well away for closing. But what are the synergies behind it, could you just talk about that? And I\u2019m sorry and I don\u2019t recall if you had a call immediately following the announcement that you've spent too much time on our call. But would you talk about the synergies on the Lloyd's syndicate please.","Steve Johnston","We did have a call and so we can make that transcript available to you. But we see it as a bolt on really non-transformative acquisition we see them in a standalone basis. So in terms of cost synergies, we don't see a tremendous amount there. We do see as we picked up in terms of Cincinnati Re synergies in terms of expertise, in terms of being able to handle larger more complex risks. And so we're also looking for ways that our agents can participate in that and we can be more deeply involved with our agents in terms of providing them with all the products and services that they require.","Ron Bobman","I didn\u2019t follow you about -- so there are complex risks out there, I guess reinsurance opportunities, that Cincinnati Re hasn't been able to pursue, candidly still lack of expertise. And if it's Lloyds Syndicate may be able to underwrite. Is that the point you\u2019re making?","Steve Johnston","No, that wasn't the point I was trying to make. So, let me try it again. I was probably not clear enough. As we grow as a company, overall in terms of expertise, we have added to that throughout the company, as you mentioned, whether it be in excess and surplus lines whether it be in high net worth, we have done some what we\u2019re calling target markets, which are niche opportunities. We've done so in what we\u2019re calling key accounts, which is larger properties, all of this is on the direct Cincinnati paper. Then we have Cincinnati Re that rights reinsurance and has brought a lot of talent to the table that in terms of the modeling of catastrophe risk, the handling of different types of complex risks that they can share, the expertise of their underwriters with the underwriters that we have on the direct side.","Similarly with Beaufort, Beaufort doesn't do reinsurance. They write larger properties in the D&F market, about 60% probably another 30% or so in the binder and some aviation. And we see the opportunity for that type of knowledge and expertise to be also helpful to our underwriters, as well as potential opportunities that our agents can submit business to a large syndicate with those types of skills.","Ron Bobman","An unrelated, switching gears and again, early days in the commercial auto. But you\u2019ve described -- I think you said a couple of quarters of even favorable development in that line, if I heard you right. Obviously correct me if not. But I am wondering whether you were seeing an actual reduction or stabilization in the incidence of claims, or whether you're just seeing rate, the cumulative increase of rate upon rate upon rate, getting ahead of what loss costs have been trending to. I am trying to differentiate rate from just the sheer incidence of occurrences that would results in claim being submitted?","Steve Johnston","I think the first thing, the comment about a couple of quarters of favorable development, had to do with commercial casualty and not commercial automobile. As we switch to commercial automobile and jump in if I am not hearing the question right. But as I heard it, you are asking about rate in terms of how it's doing relative to loss cost trends. But we do feel that as we look at lost cost trends, we look very much into the future and in the ratemaking process in terms of a trend being prospective, and where we think the lost costs will be in the prospective rate in policy period that we\u2019re making the rates for.","And so all the activity that we do in terms of claims, underwriting, loss control and so forth, we think it's been helping to dampen the loss cost trends. And then what we do with the analytic side and the pricing side has helped to get us rate that we feel that is moving ahead of the lost cost trends. And that is why we are seeing the ex-cat loss ratios moving down a bit from where they had been, both quarter-over-quarter and on a year-to-date basis for the commercial auto.","Ron Bobman","So, do you attribute all the improvement to rate getting ahead of lost cost trend it's not a reduction in claims frequency, maybe it's a stabilization. Would you talk about claims frequency and severity trends inside of lost costs?","Steve Johnston","So I\u2019ll try to do it in two pieces. So, when we talk about lost cost trend being prospective, what will the lost cost be in the prospective periods that the rates are being made, that's where all what you would consider traditional underwriting comes into play, whether it'd be loss control, better classifications, better claims handling, looking at the MVRs, just everything that you would do and the art of underwriting, we think has a dampening effect on the lost cost trends that will be experienced in the prospective policy period. Then we set the rates to be gaining ground on that lost cost trend using effective models and all the technology that we have and so those are the two levers. And so we see the traditional art of underwriting the impactful to the loss cost trends.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Can we talk a little about the geography of new appointments and where you\u2019re seeing the most growth in agencies? And also when you also when you think about the cohorts agents that you appointed over the last five years. I know that long-term you have goal trying to get maybe as much as 30% or 40% of the volume within an agency. Is the take-up rate on new appointments, are they sending proportions of their business to you at the same pace of growth that you've seen in past appointment years?","J.F. Scherer","As far as the geography of the appointments would be a concerned, we have appointed a lot of agencies for high net worth in California, New Jersey and Massachusetts where we\u2019re not active in commercial lines. Now, at some point, we will be active there and many of those appointments will be converted to commercial lines agencies as well. But there has been fair number of appointments there. As far as other appointments throughout the country, we are active now in downstate New York, Long Island. And so we're making a few more agency appointments there for commercial lines. But typically what we really are seeing is a fairly broad cross-section around the country where we have agencies.","I guess it would fall in two categories; sometimes when the M&A activity produces sales of agencies in a certain area that can create a little bit of a disruptive effect; sometimes producers leave; sometimes we appoint the producers that leave, so we maintain a longer-term relationship that we had; and then we also supplement by appointments the agencies that have are not as productive as they used to be. So, I wouldn't say that there's any particular state right now or any particular geography in the country that is outpacing any other. We still make new appointments in Ohio, for example. So we take a look at every single territory and if we\u2019re not getting the activity level we need, we go back to the existing agents and hope that we can write more business with them. But if that's not the case we appoint more agencies.","As far as the productivity we're getting out of new agencies, it continues to be very good. Hoping to write 30% or 40% of agents book of business might be a little on the aggressive side. But particularly in some of the newer agencies that we're appointing are very, very large agencies. The consolidation, the M&A activity have produced very large agencies. And so while we may not necessarily aspire to 30% to 40%, we continue to aspire to be the most significant contributor. I think that's the best way I would describe that the most significant contributor to that agency's success over the long-term.","Steve Johnston","And Josh, this is Steve, just to throw some stats in there. Agencies that we've appointed since the beginning of 2017 have contributed $16 million or about 10% of the total new business written premiums over that period of time. And then just in terms of new appointments, there've been 120 new agency appointments here in the first nine months of 2018, including 54 that mark only our personalized products. It would be targeted towards the high net worth.","Josh Shanker","And when you think about one of those high net worth only agencies, I imagine the same doesn\u2019t apply that you\u2019re hoping to be the most important contributor. What is the goal of successful high net worth agency?","Steve Johnston","That\u2019s the same. It may take some time. We\u2019re certainly younger at it than some of the other folks that are out there. But the agencies that we\u2019re doing business with are agencies that have done business with Will Van Den Heuvel for 25 years. And we think we\u2019re bringing a good product to the market. We\u2019re seeing some tremendous receptivity on the part of some of those agencies. So, I guess just as I mentioned on the commercial line side or my overall comments, we have no interest whatsoever in being a fringe player or a bid player in any agency we do business with. We will make a meaningful contribution to their success or we don't think that the relationship is worth pursuing.","Operator","And there\u2019re no further questions in queue, I\u2019d turn the call back over to Mr. Johnston for closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Thank you all for joining us. Thank you, Michelle, for moderating the call. We look forward to seeing you again soon on our next year end call. Thank you very much. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you everyone. This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5544":["Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call February  6, 2020 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Dennis McDaniel - Investor Relations Officer","Steve Johnston - President & Chief Executive Officer","Mike Sewell - Chief Financial Officer","Marty Hollenbeck - Chief Investment Officer","Steve Spray - Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer","Conference Call Participants","Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse ","Amit Kumar - Buckingham Research","Meyer Shields - KBW","Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital Markets","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Cincinnati Financial's Investor Relations Officer. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our year-end investment portfolio.","To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you'll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.","First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","Now, I'll turn over the call to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our 2019 results. Operating results and overall financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year were excellent. And we also see reasons for confidence regarding future performance due to our proven strategy and demonstrated experience and execution.","Net income for the fourth quarter rose nearly $1.1 billion, including more than $1 billion for changes in the fair value of equity securities. Non-GAAP operating income improved 28% for the quarter and on a full year basis, it was 26% higher than 2018.","Strong 2019 operating performance for both the fourth quarter and for the year again reflected efforts to carefully underwrite and price policies provide outstanding service to our agencies and manage investments well. We also continue to benefit from risk diversification by product line and geography.","Our fourth quarter 91.6% combined ratio helped lower full year 2019 to 93.8%, 2.6 points better than 2018. More favorable catastrophe weather effects contributed slightly more than one full percentage point for the year, while improved underwriting was reflected in various underlying measures. We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities.","Pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter expertise on a policy-by-policy basis are benefiting our underwriting results. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain or improve on the 2019 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2020 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid 90% range. We also believe our 2020 property casualty premium growth rate can be 6% or more.","We recognize that weather and significant changes in the industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.","In 2019, we again managed our business to healthy levels of policy retention with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for both commercial and personal lines were similar to a year ago continuing near the high-end of the mid-80% range.","Part of our strategy for long-term growth is appointing more agencies in areas where we are underrepresented while taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise-like benefit they value.","In 2019, we appointed 187 new independent agencies. In 2020, we plan to appoint approximately 125 additional agencies that will offer most if not all of our property casualty insurance products and another 35 that market only our personal lines products primarily ones with a high net worth focus.","We continue to earn business through our agencies from a combination of superior service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. For full year 2019 new business written premium growth was strong and overall property casualty net written premiums grew 10%.","For renewal business commercial lines' estimated average price increases for the fourth quarter were again in the low single-digit percentage rate range and the second half of the year was higher than the first half. The 2019 combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by 2.5 percentage points for the year to 92.9% with about half of the improvement due to lower catastrophe losses.","Our personal lines segment continued to experience average rate increases in the mid single-digit range with the fourth quarter 2019 similar to the third quarter. The personal lines combined ratio was profitable for both the quarter and year and we're working towards further improvement.","Our excess and surplus line segment had another excellent year including growth in net written premiums exceeding 20% and a 2019 combined ratio of 81.5%. Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned with a fourth quarter combined ratio below 100% and full year 2019 in the low 90s. Cincinnati Global had another profitable quarter and has post-acquisition combined ratio in the low 80s.","Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums its largest product line with fourth quarter earned premium growth of 4% and full year 2019 growth at 8%. Cincinnati Life producing $39 million of full year net income and supports account retention for our agents, while contributing to earnings with less correlation to weather than our property casualty business.","On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per-risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2020 were mostly similar to 2019 except for not renewing our cat bond. Instead, we added approximately $90 million of broader coverage through our property catastrophe treaty plus up to $60 million of coverage on top of that for earthquake events.","Rates for our casualty treaty were nearly flat. Rates were somewhat higher for our property treaties, but we expect the total amount of 2020 ceded premiums to be fairly similar to 2019.","I'll conclude with the value creation ratio our primary measure of long-term financial performance. It reflects an outstanding year. Improved operating results and favorable securities markets resulted in a fourth quarter 2019 VCR of 6.5% and a VCR of 30.5% for the year which is well above our targeted annual average of 10% to 13%.","The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was up 8.9% for the year up 1.5 percentage points from a year ago. While our equity portfolio benefited VCR this year we understand the risk of short-term variability due to market effects. We continue to believe this potential for long-term appreciation and dividend income growth is important for creating value for shareholders over time.","Our confidence is also reflected in the recent decision by our Board of Directors to reward shareholders with a 7.1% increase in the regular cash dividend declared last month.","Next our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will highlight some of the important aspects of our financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at 4% for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 doubling the growth rate we experienced for the previous year. Dividends from our equity portfolio again drove the growth, up 10% during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 11% for the year. Interest income from our bond portfolio was essentially flat for the year.","The pretax average yield was 4.12% for the fourth quarter of 2019, down nine basis points from 2018 fourth quarter. We continue to invest in bonds including $399 million in net purchases for the year. Taxable bonds purchased during 2019 had an average pretax yield of 4.31%, 17 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.31% down 38 basis points from a year ago.","Investment portfolio valuation changes for the fourth quarter of 2019 were again favorable, primarily for our stock portfolio. The overall net gain was $539 million before tax effects including $541 million for our equity portfolio. We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of nearly $4.8 billion including almost $4.2 billion in our equity portfolio.","Cash flow from operating activities continues to benefit investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the full year 2019 exceeded $1.2 billion. Expense management is always important to us, while we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Our full year 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio remained within 0.1 percentage point of last year's ratio.","Loss reserves are another important area and we intend to maintain a consistent approach as we target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. We again experienced property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years in 2019 on both a fourth quarter and full year basis. 2019 marked our 31st consecutive year of net favorable reserve development.","Full year 2019 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 4.7 percentage points, roughly a point better than the annual average during the past five years. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development. On an all lines basis by accident year, it included 36% for accident year 2018, 24% for accident year 2017 and 40% for 2016 and prior accident years.","Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remain stable. We continue to have outstanding financial flexibility including year-end holding company cash and marketable securities that rose 34% from a year ago. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of nearly 554,000 shares at an average price per share of $111.94. Steve noted good underwriting results for Cincinnati Global, since we acquired it. Integration has gone well and we remain confident in future prospects for its profitable growth.","I'll conclude my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.58. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.46.","Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.02. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.62. And we declared $0.56 a share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $3.18 during the fourth quarter to a record high $60.55 per share.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Mike. It was a good quarter and 2019 overall was a great year. We see improving trends in several areas that give us confidence in the future for Cincinnati Financial. Last week A.M. Best recognized our capital strength and upward operating trends by affirming our A+ financial strength rating and raising our issuer credit rating to a little A from a little A-.","At the same time, Best upgraded the financial strength rating of the Cincinnati Life Insurance Company to an A+ superior rating to match the rest of the Cincinnati companies. All ratings have a stable outlook.","We know our strategy works and we'll continue to execute it as we target profitable growth while providing great service to our appointed agencies. That should benefit all stakeholders of the company creating shareholder value over time.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Ken Stecher, Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, and Teresa Hoffer.","Catherine, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","Hey good morning gentlemen.","Steve Johnston","Good morning Mike.","Mike Zaremski","First question. I believe the language in the earnings release was about commercial P&C pricing was low single-digits which didn't seem like a change from last quarter. It feels like based on the surveys and some of your competitors who have released earnings there seems to be some pricing momentum. Would you say that you just you don't need to take as much price given the results are good? Or maybe it has to do with your book being a little bit more multiyear-weighted? Any color there would be great.","Steve Spray","Yes. Thanks Mike. This is Steve Spray. It's a great question one I believe certainly worth some further discussion. I'd tell you first we've certainly witnessed the disruption that you mentioned; large rate increases, capacity contraction that you're hearing about in the industry.","However, I think it's a little more complex than that and I don't think you can simply paint the entire industry with a broad brush. I think it warrants peeling the layers back a little bit. And I think from our perspective the best way to do that is by line of business.","I think commercial auto is still probably the best example of the entire line struggling to make money and the struggle seems to be rather universal across the industry. But the point is is even within commercial auto, we see segments under more pressure or ones that are more stressed than others. Large fleets with heavy gross vehicle weight trucks, long-haul transportation risks seem to be really under pressure, both from a rate and a capacity standpoint.","I think in commercial property, it seems to be experiencing more disruption with the higher hazard risks, larger limit industrial properties, habitational, and anything coastal. Those will be just a few examples.","On the casualty front, it feels like it's in a similar position as property. High-hazard-casualty risks such as manufacturers with tough product exposures, residential contractors that are in states where maybe construction defect jurisdictions are a little tougher.","Professional liability even for us on skilled nursing home facilities really, really tough. I would say in the casualty segment though the thing that we've seen probably -- where there's been the most dislocation or disruption is an umbrella in excess liability and quite frankly on tougher risks that I mentioned before in the auto and on the casualty.","Now, I think -- and I make that point in saying about the industry from a broad brush standpoint. While we certainly have risks in those types of business, it's not what we do on a day-to-day basis. It's not the lion's share of our book.","Our average commercial account size is $11,000 in annual premium, and the marketplace for these risks from our perspective is certainly different. And the biggest thing I think to get to your question is I don't think that average rate increases tell the full story, at least not for the strategy that we're trying to execute in Cincinnati. And I would say it all starts day-to-day work with our agents, our field underwriters, our field marketing reps who handle all new commercial lines business, and then the headquarters underwriters who are working on renewals.","We're taking a risk-by-risk approach trying to balance the art and science of underwriting. We just don't believe that from our perspective the rising tide, raising all boats is a sustainable strategy. And we're confident going forward that we've got the data and the professional underwriters to execute on a segmentation strategy like we have been, and get the appropriate risk -- or excuse me, the appropriate price on the appropriate risk on a risk-adjusted basis.","On the business that we feel is the most adequately priced, Mike we are really focused on retaining that business. And then on the segments, where we feel that maybe the pricing isn't quite as adequate or that our opportunity for a profit, there we are really pushing the rate. And we're seeing the rate increases on that segment really at a much higher level obviously than the business that we feel is most adequately priced. Or if we're pushing really hard in that business, sometimes we're losing it.","So, it's changing the mix of our entire book, and I think it's showing up in our results. Anytime you have good results, I don't think it's any -- it's ever any just one thing. But from my perspective being here for 28 years, the pricing sophistication that we've been executing on over the last several years is certainly having an impact.","And I think that's -- commercial lines has just completed eight years of underwriting profit, and I don't think it's by any accident. I think it's that pricing segmentation strategy that we're going to continue to execute. So, probably here a bit of a long-winded answer, but it's a big topic and I -- we're executing well on it. I think it's worthwhile having a discussion.","Mike Zaremski","That's helpful. And I guess a couple of things that might dovetail with those comments. So, do you feel like the industry -- like pricing should be biased higher just given the interest rate headwinds in the industry is facing? Like you -- or maybe you kind of feel you don't need to have in your book?","And I guess separately were there any -- some companies have said that loss cost inflation on the casualty is going to inch-up a little bit quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. Are you guys seeing any changes in your trends? Those are two separate questions.","Steve Johnston","This is Steve Johnston, Mike. Really good questions. I agree 100% with the answer Steve Spray just gave. In terms of the interest rates, we certainly do consider them. They're really just low. I mean they're bouncing around your 50 basis points or a little bit more from time-to-time.","But wherever they are and where they settle, it's really low against historic norms. And we recognize that in -- that we do have to make an underwriting profit and a good one every year. Just as Steve mentioned, eight years in a row now that we've put in underwriting profits.","I think in terms of the trends, I guess my main point is and it buttresses what Steve said is we do have very sophisticated pricing models. And we look at them in the results on a policy-by-policy basis.","We aggregate them up, everything that we're seeing from our pricing models, which show that we're more adequately priced today than we were a year ago. And those trends look such that we feel will be more adequately priced next year. Hence the comment in my prepared remarks that we feel that our combined ratio, we can perform next year to either match or exceed where we are today.","In terms of the inflation, we've always measured inflation. We do that explicitly in our reserving models. I do think -- and I'd like to talk a little bit about the size of policy. As Steve mentioned, our average policy is about $11,000. For CSU, it's about $6,000. 93% of our commercial GL policies have occurrence limits of $1 million or less. 92% of our umbrella and excess policies have limits of $5 million or less. So, we don't feel that insulates us from inflation or if you want to call it social inflation.","However, we do believe the effects on those companies that write the smaller limits would be less. In actuarial circles, we kind of refer to that as the leverage effect of inflation. And basically if you would look at it to give a simple example, I'm picking a number out of here and say -- let's say 10% since it's a round number. I'm not suggesting we see 10% inflation but just picking a number. And you have $1 million limit. If you had a claim last year that was over $910,000 and you had it again this year that would hit the limit and would not be a 10% increase. It would be held down by the limit. And also it would go over the $1 million limit and compound the inflation in the next layer up. So that's the leverage effect of inflation.","And so we do think -- and we do not think that it would insulate us from what we're seeing in inflation. But we do think for those of us that write lower limits due to this leverage effect of inflation, it's going to have less of an impact on us.","We haven't seen any surprises. I mean we talked about that in our last call in terms of seeing back in 2015, an uptick in inflation. We increased our reserves on the casualty side by 27% since then. The IBNR portion of that is up 50%. And that's against over that period of time about a 12% increase in earned premiums.","On the commercial auto side, our reserves since 2015 up 44%. Our total reserves IBNR component up 140% while the earned premiums have been up 26%. So we're not being surprised by anything. We believe in our models. We think, we understand the impact of inflation on us. And we really feel confident that our pricing is adequate and improving. And we throw in with that all the good work that's going on in just old-fashioned underwriting, loss control claims. Everybody is chipping in. And that's why we feel confident in saying that we're going to give information that we think our combined ratio next year will be at least as good as it is this year.","A little bit long-winded but I think that's the essence of where a lot of the questions are coming now Mike.","Mike Zaremski","Yeah. Great color. Thank you for the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Maybe I'll follow-up Mike's question in a different manner. So staying on the discussion on, I guess the guidance and maybe let's start with commercial lines. I would have imagined with all the discussion that's going on your guidance probably would have gotten better than what you suggested. And maybe if you were to look at this in a different manner what number are you picking or thinking for loss cost inflation versus earned rate?","Steve Johnston","Well, we feel with our rate that it is above what we see in the loss cost inflation. We've talked about our commercial lines, our average rate being in the low single digits. So it's going to be a little bit less than that. And again I think to Steve's point, it has to do with segmentation.","When we look at loss cost trends, it's not historic. When we look at loss cost trends, it's prospective. Rate making from an actuarial perspective is rate -- is prospective. So you always want to try to be projecting how much will loss cost increase into the prospective policy period. And that is impacted by the great segmentation that Steve and his people are doing as we move the book away from those policies with the less profit potential to those with the highest profit potential. And so it's a matter of every company having a different mix, a different position, a different geography. Everything is different. And we can't look at our premium as -- our total commercial premium as if it's one policy and it gets that rate increase.","It's thousands of policies all being treated individually by local underwriters that can go out and put the decision at the intersection of the art and science of underwriting to see risks to meet management teams. And we really feel confident as our results would show that we're doing a good job in that respect.","Amit Kumar","So as a follow-up to that question. You know, when you look at the buckets of different policies et cetera or sub-segments if you will many companies will talk about there is a bucket of business which still needs rate and then there's a bucket which is adequate and other is obviously benefiting from the hardening. Can you, sort of, talk about -- even in a broader sense are there buckets in your overall, which could definitely use more rate acceleration from here? And maybe what percent is sort of adequately priced here?","Steve Johnston","Sure. And it's not so much buckets. We do summarize to groupings but it's looked at with each single policy. It's the technology. It's the skill that we have now. And we're not the only one in the industry in this position. But it's -- by a long shot it's looking at each policy on its overall merits. And I do think we add -- in addition to the science that we bring to the table which I think is substantial we bring people on the ground, working from their homes, living in the communities with the agents that go out see the risks meet the management teams. And so we have worked the percentage of those that are we believe those with the most profit potential to be a substantial part of our book.","Amit Kumar","Okay. The other question I had was just staying on the topic of social inflation. And I was looking at the claim count data and that's probably closed claim count data. Maybe you can talk about your own book? And if you look at it over the past I don't know 3, 6, 9, 12, 24-months have you seen any pressure or noticeable pressure from social inflation in terms of attorney involvement, et cetera? I know you talked about how the small size of the book insulates it to a great extent, et cetera and you're confident of the changes. But in your book are you noticing trends where you're like, okay. That is interesting and that is exactly what we thought it would be or maybe in pockets where it's coming in better than what you expected?","Steve Johnston","We -- this is Steve Johnson, again. We have seen trends over a period of years. It's nothing that just jumped up here in the last six months and surprised us. I think if we go back to 2015 we did see some movement there. We did -- you'd have to have a good memory but we did as I just gave the numbers increase our reserves over the last few years took some adverse development back then fuel that puts us in a very strong position. We just said back then that for somebody who wants to have 31 years of favorable development you have to react to trends as soon as you see them. We saw them we reacted and we feel good about our position. I think it's -- the answer would be it's just been more of a stable look at inflation over the last several years rather than something that we've seen jump up in the last six months.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's helpful. Last question. On the E&S segment obviously it's seen good growth. And I was, sort of, wondering when you look at the different businesses and the rates versus returns how are you thinking about sort of capital allocation for 2020? Clearly E&S is where a lot of rate movement is happening and submission activity is happening. I was just wondering I mean we've seen great growth in the past few quarters. Is that sustainable? Or are you saying, okay, you know what? This is where we want to be in our broader pie chart? Maybe just talk about that.","Steve Johnston","Sure. This is Steve Johnson again and maybe Steve Spray would want to chime in. But what we preach is that the next policy that we write we want to be adequately priced on a risk-adjusted basis. In the E&S space under the leadership of Don Doyle they've just been doing a fantastic job. I mean over the last -- they have increased rates in the mid single-digit range for 113 straight quarters. I mean that's 9.5 years every quarter. And so we're going to continue to allow them on a policy-by-policy basis to pick the risks that they think are best. We think that business model that we have with our excess and surplus lines company gives us a great advantage in work. So we're going to continue to ask them to do that policy by policy.","I sometimes love to demand matching this year's growth rate, or especially when it's that high, because it might put pressure to accept risks that have less profit potential. So we just want them to be out in the agent's offices, which they do a tremendous job of doing, look at every policy on its merits, write the ones that we think that we can write at the very profitable levels that they've been doing over the years.","Steve Spray","Yes. And this is -- yes, this is Steve. I'm sorry...","Amit Kumar","I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Steve Spray","This is Steve Spray. I would -- to the other part of your question too, I just -- for 2020 anyway, we still feel the submission counts are up. We don't see any change in the marketplace that would think that we can't continue to grow the E&S business.","Steve Johnston","And Steve wrote me a note correcting that it's 113 months, not 113 quarters. I had the 9.5 years.","Amit Kumar","Okay. Thanks so much and good luck for the future.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Steve Johnston","Good morning, Mayer.","Meyer Shields","Obviously, we're seeing --good morning, I'm sorry -- tremendous success on the pricing sophistication. And I'm trying to get a handle on continued potential upside, so I'm going to frame the question this way. Is there any quantification or description of, let's say, the current profitability gap between the best and worst 10% of your book and what that looked like three years ago?","Steve Johnston","Yes. We have all that in detail. I don't think we're in a position to make a disclosure on it, but it has made really substantial improvement over that period of time.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Fair enough. And then, two really smaller questions. First, are you seeing any increase in workers' compensation severity? We're seeing medical costs fill up and maybe wages going up and I'm wondering how that's running through the book.","Steve Johnston","We look at the loss costs pretty much in total. It has been a mix of increasing inflation. I don't know that I would say that it's picked up or spiked. It's been just a pretty steady inflationary increase. Our frequency and, again, I think, it has to do with the segmentation and so forth, is still continuing to be down.","And over the last many years it's down by a substantial amount. So we look at the total loss cost trend and that is one line where we feel we're losing some ground to that, in terms of where we are with the rate, but we're losing it like much of the industry, from a very profitable position. And you don't want to do anything rash that would run off good profitable business. We've got a real long-term focus.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Now, that makes perfect sense. And then finally, I think, you did a great job explaining the whole in place on leverage. But I'm wondering, whether the social inflation phenomenon that we're hearing a lot about, is that more pronounced at accounts that have higher limits? In other words, is there a deep pocket phenomenon also?","Steve Johnston","I've wondered about that. It's not just by size of limit, but by geography, as well. If you're going to have increased attorney involvement, they're going to, I would think, seek deep pockets. They would seek jurisdictions, maybe, where they think they might have a higher likelihood of success. But at this point, it's just kind of a thought experiment more than anything we're seeing in the data.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Meyer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] So we'll take the next question from Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Dwelle","Yes. Good morning. I think my esteemed colleagues have already exhausted quite a lot of the questions that I had hoped to ask, but a couple of others to hit on. Given the pricing trends and things that you're seeing, do you contemplate any changes in business appetite in either Cincinnati Re or Cincinnati Global? And maybe, while you're at it, just a little bit of an update on how those businesses are performing and what your thoughts are there?","Steve Johnston","Yes. It's pretty much steady go the course with both. They're just doing a great job. I mean from what you could see in the numbers there, the combined ratio for Cincinnati Re for the year it came in at -- in the low 90s, the growth, 44%.","I think they're doing it in a disciplined fashion. The submission flow for the fourth quarter was up 31% from where it was a year ago. And the hit ratio went down. It's actually accepting less than 20% of those that are submitted to them. And that's very consistent with what we wanted to do from the beginning, which was have an allocated capital model. We didn't set up a company and put capital in there such that they would feel compelled to grow maybe recklessly against that capital. We want them to just look at each of the contracts that they're faced with and make good decisions there.","They've really staffed up with some very, very skilled underwriters, actuaries, technicians. It's actually without that being the plan been quite steady over time. On an inception date -- inception-to-now basis the property, premiums have been about 33%; the casualty 54%; the specialty 13%. For this year, it was 32, 51 in 2017. So very consistent with the way they've been operating. And so we're happy there. And we encourage them as markets change to look at opportunities.","The Cincinnati Global couldn't be more happy with the way that that started out. We know, there'll be volatility therein in Cincinnati Re, but we hadn't done an acquisition for many, many years. And it's always better to start off on the right foot than in a loss position. They've had good growth. They've come in in the low 80s with their combined ratio.","One thing I can say there is, as they file their business plan with Lloyd's. It's for good growth. They're going to add two new lines. One of them is going to be terrorism; the other one is going to be political risk. And so they've already hired seasoned underwriters to start to write those lines of business and take advantage of a -- what we think to be affirming -- and trade credit, I'm sorry. So there's terrorism political risk and trade credit. So, there's the higher experienced underwriters in those two areas. They're going to I think take advantage of a firming market over there at Lloyd's.","Mark Dwelle","That's helpful. I appreciate the update. And then, the other question I had probably for Marty. Just with equity markets at kind of record levels and bond yields, I don't know thrashing around in the 1s, anything you're doing differently from a portfolio management perspective just to balance exposures and so forth?","Marty Hollenbeck","Nothing dramatic. What we do is look for opportunity in the yield curve where we see it. We might put a little more money short term maybe try to wait out a little bit; try to get a surge in yields, that kind of thing, but not a lot. We're getting the dividend increases which have been very healthy last couple of years. So, that protects us a little bit. So, nothing on the scale that would be particularly meaningful.","Mark Dwelle","Anything on the equity side? You're harvesting any gains or otherwise repositioning there?","Marty Hollenbeck","Not too much. No, we're kind of staying in the course there as well. Not seeing as you might expect as you alluded to a whole lot of values out there, but there's pockets to be had out there. So, we generally don't make big macro calls and really move portfolio around a whole lot, so fairly steady.","Mark Dwelle","Okay. Thanks for those questions and appreciate the update. Thanks.","Marty Hollenbeck","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","And with no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Johnston for any closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Catherine, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2020 call. Thank you, very much and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead McDaniel.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel. We thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued the news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents please visit our investor Web site, cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time some responses maybe made by others in the room with us, including Cincinnati Insurance Company\u2019s Executive Committee Chairman, Jack Schiff, Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer for the Cincinnati Insurance Company, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer for Cincinnati Insurance, Marty Mullen.","Please note that some of the matters we will be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risk and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis and good morning. I\u2019m speaking with you today from Murfreesboro Tennessee. This week, we began our annual tour of sales meetings with our independent agents in more than 20 states. Meeting with agents is essential to our relationship oriented, agency centered strategy that reflects our culture, where we believe actions speak louder than person. There are many benefits to strengthening those relationships and getting information on a first hand basis, and being with agencies energizes our local and headquarters\u2019 management teams. We enjoy this chance to thank our agents in person for all they contribute to the success of Cincinnati Insurance. Their trust in us to serve the people and businesses in their communities produced another great year of underwriting profit and premium growth.","Next I want to highlight our financial performance and reiterate our confidence in our strategy, in our ability to execute as well. The strong operating results, we reported for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015 continue to reflect the steady effort by our associates as we carefully underwrite and price policies, provide overwhelming client service, manage investments and provide support for our operations and agency partners. Excellent company performance in 2015 provided the opportunity to further reward shareholders and was the main driver of the special dividend paid in December.","We are very satisfied with our recent overall underwriting results as we reported a fourth quarter 2015 combined ratio of 87.0 and a full year ratio of 91.1%. More favorable weather in 2015 contributed to the full year combined ratio improvement compared with 2014. It\u2019s also important to note, that most of the underlying measures also improved due to contributions from all areas of the company. Our commercial insurance results were a highlight this quarter as our associates and agents achieved a profitable growth and steady pricing.","We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy-by-policy basis. We know that work is critical as we seek to further improve underwriting results. We believe, we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to make 2016 combined ratios in the low to mid-90% range and 2016\u2019s property casualty premium growth rate within a percentage point of 2015.","Our 2015 catastrophe loss ratio was 2.3 points below the average of the previous 10 years. We recognized that weather and significant changes in the industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends, are variables that will affect the property casualty results, we ultimately report. In 2015, it looks like we met our premium growth objective of outpacing property casualty industry growth based on the industry\u2019s nine month result.","We continue to experience outstanding policy retention and average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That\u2019s attributed to the excellent way our agencies conduct business, as well as to how our underwriters do their jobs. Policy retention rates for both personal and commercial lines were generally consistent with the year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high-end of the mid-80% range and for personal lines it continued in the low to mid-90% range. Our long-term growth strategy includes deploying agencies in areas we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies in the franchise like benefit they value.","In 2015, we appointed 114 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2016 we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products. We also plan to appoint other agencies that focus on high net worth personal lines clients. In 2016, we are targeting approximately $25 million in high net worth new business written premiums. That includes premiums from our Executive Capstone suite of insurance products and services. We continue to earn new business through our agencies impart due new products and services like our high net worth expansion initiative.","For full year 2015 each of our property casualty segments reported an increase in production of new business written premiums. One of the bright spots was the increase in high net worth new business. While its contribution was relatively small amount of overall 2015 new business increase, its growth rate was approximately double the rest of the personal lines operation. The launch of Executive Capstone and prudent expansion of our reinsurance assumed operation provides additional confidence in our ability to continue to diversify and profitably grow premiums in an increasingly tough operating environment.","For renewal business in the fourth quarter overall average renewal price increases were similar to the third quarter. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of three of our policies that were not subject to renewal during the fourth quarter.","For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid single-digit range and auto averaging near the high-end of the low single-digit range. Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, workers' compensation averaged negative renewal price changes during the fourth quarter. While the average pricing change may have turned negative, we continue to price on a policy-by-policy basis. Certain policies that we determine needed a price increase, received it. Approximately half of our workers' compensation 2015 renewal premiums were for policies with price increases.","Our personal auto policies, averaged renewal price increases in the mid single-digit range, while homeowner policies averaged a low single-digit range, down from the third quarter. For our excess and surplus line segment, fourth quarter 2015 average renewal price increases were near the high-end of the low single-digit range, down slightly from the third quarter measure. Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, its product line. This business supports account retention for our agents and provides steady contributions to our earnings as it has less co-relation to the weather than our property casualty business.","On January 1st of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property treaties that transfer a part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per-risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty terms and conditions for 2016 are similar to 2015. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of ceded premium for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing. In conclusion, our primary measure of long term financial performance, value creation ratio was 3.4% for full year 2015. The contribution from operating income was the highest it's been in the past five years. However, VCR in total was below our target range due to a decline in securities market value.","For 2016 and beyond, we'll stay focused on areas where we have more influence, underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business remains in excellent shape. We are as confident as ever in our associates, in the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance.","I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer Mike Sewell to comment on investments and other important aspects of our recent financial performance.","Mike Sewell","Great, thank you Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter of 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. Fourth quarter dividend income was up 14%, dividend amounts in the last quarter of the year tend to be the most variable as some entities return capital or pay special dividends near the end of the calendar year. Interest income rose 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year as we continue to invest the majority of annual net operating cash flow in our bond portfolio. Other than temporary impairments to securities and our stock and bond portfolios totaled more than a typical quarter at $40 million, most of that related to energy stocks affected by declining oil prices.","Securities market trends took a toll on the valuation of our investments during 2015. The company has experienced that before and we've maintained our current proven investment approach for over five decades and we have no plans to change it. Our stock portfolio valuation rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter but its year-end 2015 fair value was 3% below where it began the year. The stock market\u2019s rocky ride so far in 2016 has been well publicized, but we choose to keep our focus on the long-term investment strategy and performance.","Fair value of our bond portfolio rose 2% for the year despite a significant drop and unrealized gains due to rising interest rates. That drop was offset by net purchases of additional bonds for the portfolio as its amortized cost was up almost 5%. In terms of bond portfolio yields, we reported a fourth quarter 2015 pre-tax average yield of 4.66%, 6 basis points lower than a year ago. That measure on a full year basis also declined by 6 basis points. Taxable bonds purchased during the fourth quarter had an average pre-tax yield of 4.34%, while tax exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.36%.","Our bond portfolio's effective duration at the end of 2015 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end 2014, that increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on callable bonds and does not represent a change in strategy. Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2015 were up 22% to just over $1 billion, contributing to the $631 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.","Turning to property casualty underwriting results, I\u2019ll first comment on two typical items. Number one, careful expense management is still one of our top priorities and is balanced with strategically investing in several parts of our business. That approach combined with premium growth resulted in a slight increase of 0.3 percentage points for our full year 2015 underwriting expense ratio bringing it to 30.9%. That increase was largely due to investments to support our expansion of high net worth personal lines markets.","Number two, the primary measures pertaining to our reserves for losses and loss expenses continued in a fairly steady pattern, as we continue to follow a consistent approach. We\u2019ve now experienced 27 consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. Full year 2015, favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefited our combined ratio by 4.3 percentage points. That was better than the 2.4 points for 2014, when we strengthened commercial casualty reserves. But the 4.3 points was consistent with the 4.1 points we reported for the year 2013.","Other than commercial and personal auto, each of our major lines of businesses developed favorably in 2015. We continue to take underwriting and pricing actions to improve our auto results and maintain that we believe is a prudent level of reserves. Our full year 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 33% for accident year 2014, 22% for accident year 2013, 26% for accident year 2012 and 19% for all older accident years in aggregate.","Consistent with past years, we continued to aim for reserves reported on our balance sheet to be at levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. Our consolidated property casualty gross and net carried reserves rose 5% during 2015. I also want to highlight the $33 million of fourth quarter 2015 net written premiums we reported for our reinsurance assumed operation, known as Cincinnati Re. At the end of the year, seven diverse treaties were in effect. We are recording written premiums in the period treaties become effective, and will follow the common practice of estimating assumed premium amounts for each treaty\u2019s term based on current information.","Premiums will be earned over the coverage period on a pro rata basis, similar to our other property casualty policies. Net of applicable retrocessions, Cincinnati Re\u2019s 2015 net earned premiums totaled $10 million. One capital management item I\u2019ll touch on is additional share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2015. Shares repurchased during the quarter totaled 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $60.11 that brought the full year 2015 share repurchases to a total of 1 million shares at an average price per share of $53.08.","As usual, I\u2019ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.57. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at December 31st for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.45. The change in unrealized gains at December 31st for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.70. And we declared $0.92 per share in dividends to shareholders with half of that representing a special dividend. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.43 during the fourth quarter to $39.20 per share.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Mike. In concluding our prepared remarks I want to acknowledge the fourth quarter ratings upgrade by A.M. Best for our excess and surplus lines subsidiary, The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, also known as CSU. With that upgrade A.M. Best rated CSU\u2019s financial strength with a rating of A+ Superior. Performance of our E&S company has been outstanding. For the past two years its combined ratio has been under 80%, while it has maintained double-digit premium growth. We salute our CSU team and the agents who bring us excess and surplus lines business.","Also in the fourth quarter A. M. Best affirmed their strong ratings on our standard market property casualty and life insurance companies. With all of our operating segments delivering another year of strong performance, we remain confident that we can deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come. The Board of Directors demonstrated that they share that confidence by recently increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.48 per share setting the stage for 56 consecutive years of shareholder dividend increases by your company. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff, Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Matthews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck. Sally, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome","I have a big-picture question and a small one. The big picture is, have we gotten to the point where we want to have another sort of five-year goal of pretty serious premium growth in the future and if you could solidify that more I'd love to hear about what you think of that? And then the small question is maybe there was a pretty good size reserve release in the excess and surplus lines business. That sort of stuck out at me. I know it's not the biggest thing in your book, but just curious as to why that might have happened?","Steve Johnston","Yes. Good questions both of them. In terms of the premium growth we think obviously growing our company is important and especially given the profitability, the level of capital that we have, growth is important to us. In terms of our goal for 2016, our net written premium is 6%. In terms of 2015, I am not sure that we have publicly announced that yet, we are working on that. But we want to continue to have strong growth. In terms of the excess and surplus lines, it was just the result of the normal consistent year-end reserve analysis that goes on. I think we always want to be prudent especially with something like excess and surplus lines and over that period of time we have been prudent in just the data, the actuaries felt, reflected the reserve release that we did during the fourth quarter, very consistent approach.","Paul Newsome","On the first question, should we expect some announcement? Are you working on another big strategy plan that you want to announce at some point? Or is that something you -- I mean should we expect an announcement sometime in the future?","Steve Johnston","I don\u2019t think anytime soon but just rest assured that we continue to think long-term work towards the long-term growth, we have a long-term strategy and that we are really working on strategic planning and in a more detailed approach to strategic planning than ever before with the look towards the long-term.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle with RBC capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Dwelle","Not much in the numbers that really was terribly surprising. I did want to ask on -- you did an awful lot of capital management in the quarter relative to your normal run rate. If you weigh in the dividend increase, which was not wholly unexpected, and along with the special dividend, along with another quarter of modest but consistent buyback activity, I mean I guess it just strikes me that this is more capital management than I've seen from the company in a while. And I am wondering how you are thinking about that in general and what expectations we might have in the future, beyond just the normal a couple-cent dividend increase that is now pretty much expected?","Steve Johnston","A good question Mark and I think it just basically came down to having a really strong year on an operating basis. We wanted to return capital to our shareholders, I think I would look at it just as kind of a right sizing of capital or a step in that direction. I think in terms of as we go forward I would just think of us being steady, the yield on our dividend now is around 3.4% I believe. I would not automatically count in another special dividend next year just because we did one this past year I think it was a special dividend and should be thought about in those regards, but we do recognize that capital management is important. And again we just set forth the results, the reserving, the balance sheet everything we would do we want to be steady and with a long-term focus. And I don\u2019t know maybe Mike would have something to add to that.","Mike Sewell","No, I think that was exactly right. The buybacks that we did this year were maintenance that we've been saying throughout the year, so you will be looking at that for 2016, but looking at other ways of investing in our business, the way that we\u2019ve been saying and with our high net worth, the Cincinnati Re, and investment in technology, we\u2019re going to be using our capital in various ways.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Second question I had, and maybe this is a propos of your meetings with your agency base, I\u2019m interested in understanding kind of the customer mindset. We hear a lot about rate cuts and so forth. Is that -- do your agents begin their discussions with their customers anticipating that there\u2019ll be rate cuts? Or are people happy with flat renewals? I\u2019m just trying to get a little bit into the mindset of what the average Cincinnati Financial customer is thinking when their policy renewal comes up?","J.F. Scherer","Mark, this is J.F. The topics of conversation we\u2019ve had over the last three days at our sales meetings. I think, I guess, I would characterize it has been surprisingly fewer conversations about terrific competition or anything of that nature. I think the expectation right now is that the account has performed well that they would have flat renewals, maybe some slight decreases is the way agencies would tee it up with us, in their discussions with us. They also understand and they hear from other carriers that segmentation is the key here and that there are still policyholders out there that deserve and in our book of business are getting rate increases.","So I guess I would characterize the marketplace as not out of control. There is a few war stories that come through that there are some surprising things going on. Clearly everyone\u2019s results are good. Everyone wants to increase shelf space in agencies. A lot of agencies would be discussing two prospective clients saying that you should expect a price decrease. But I guess, I have come away from these last three sales meetings feeling pretty good about stability. Our three year policy, in a marketplace like this, in any marketplace really, but in this marketplace plays out well there is a lot of a lot of policyholders that are appreciative of the consistency of our approach with them. Their policies aren\u2019t renewing this year. Just because there may be some chatter out there about rate decreases it doesn\u2019t mean they want to go through the process of completely reevaluating their insurance program.","So clearly there is going to be a fair amount of competition out there. We are seeing in the excess and surplus lines area a little bit of a pickup of E&S business going back to the standard market which is pretty typical for this type of a phase of the marketplace. So maybe that is a little more than you were asking for, but that kind of gives you a little bit of the flavor that we\u2019re experiencing.","Mark Dwelle","No, it is very helpful. Thanks, J.F. I guess the last question I wanted to ask is, I guess maybe more recent and somewhat dear to my own situation. Have you seen any kind of surge or unusual uptick in claims related to the various winter storms that hit the East Coast and I guess now most recently the Midwest?","Marty Mullen","Yes hi Mark, this is Marty Mullen. Actually, our activity has been fairly light to modest as far as our activity from the East Coast. They have experienced certainly some freeze and winter storm losses, but our ultimate claim count from those mid-January events is very light considering I think what\u2019s going on in the industry and I think from our perspective it\u2019s been almost a non-event. We\u2019ve projected our ultimate loss to be somewhere in the area of $3 million. That gives you some idea of our experience.","Mark Dwelle","That\u2019s not bad. All right, very good. Thanks, guys.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Joshua Shanker","I want to know that what you're hearing from customers, agents, and underwriters regarding high net worth homeowners in the wake of the ACE-Chubb merger?","J.F. Scherer","Hi, Josh, J.F. here, we\u2019re getting a lot of real favorable feedback and that is relative to our activity. As you can imagine, there is less choice out there for independent agencies that had represented Fireman's Fund and the Chubb and ACE. So they\u2019re looking for more choice. Feedback has been good not only from our current agency force. In fact in Atlanta on Tuesday we had a workshop, if you will, an introductory workshop for agents and 90 agencies attended, which, you just have to take my word for that, that\u2019s a huge number of agencies that are showing interest in high net worth.","We\u2019ve been very successful in appointing on our first wave of agencies in the New York City, Long Island, Westchester County area. In New Jersey, which we will open in March we have had quite a few agencies calling us interested in representing Cincinnati Insurance Company. I think it\u2019s worth noting that the person that will be spearheading our East Coast strategy is a gentlemen with the name of Joe Kinsey. Joe previously was President of Fireman\u2019s Fund personal lines. He joined us a few months ago. Joe had worked with Will Van Den Heuvel previously. So we're pleased to get that kind of talent for the company. Will was in California a couple of weeks ago talking to agents out there, there is a lot of interest there. So, I think between the talent and the people that are working with us in high net worth, the reputation we have among agents, the financial strength that we represent, the good claims reputation we have as a company. We are feeling really good where we are now in high net worth.","Joshua Shanker","Will you appoint an agent who wants to use you as a high net worth resource even if they are not yet sure that they're going to use you for other lines?","Steve Johnston","Yes we will.","Joshua Shanker","You will, okay thanks.","Steve Johnston","And in fact, in New York City, Long Island, lower New York State that\u2019s what we are doing is appointing agencies for high net worth only that will be the case in New Jersey. We are not active in commercial lines in New Jersey. We are also not active in -- and when I say not active, we are licensed to write risk there but we don\u2019t have an agency force in New Jersey, nor do we have in California. So, in all those states those will all be high net worth only appointments.","Joshua Shanker","That sounds like a great opportunity for you. Good luck.","Steve Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Johnston I will turn the call back over to you.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Sally and we appreciate all of you joining us today on our call. And we look forward to speaking with you again in the coming months. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Dennis McDaniel","Hello and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including the final version of our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website www.cinfin.com\/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link on the navigation menu on the far left.","On this call, you\u2019ll first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Committee Chairman Jack Schiff Jr.; Chairman of the Board, Ken Stecher; Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Principal Accounting Officer, Eric Matthews; Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Chief Claims Officer, Martin Mullen.","First please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Dennis and good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our strong third quarter earnings and operating performance.","Looking first at Property Casualty Insurance, our 94.8% combined ratio was our best so far this year. We\u2019ve now posted three consecutive quarters with the combined ratio before catastrophe losses below 90% and that followed 90.4% for the fourth quarter of last year.","Furthermore, our Property Casualty combined ratio for the first nine months of 2012 is a good indicator of progress on our strategic initiatives. On both a current accident year and calendar year basis before catastrophe losses, it improved by about 10 percentage points from a year ago.","As for premium growth, each of our Property Casualty segments experienced double-digit increases in third quarter net written premiums. Property Casualty underwriting results, both profitability and premium growth continued to benefit from higher and more precise pricing in the third quarter. Commercial lines renewal price increases on average were in the mid single digit range and were up slightly from the second quarter. Workers\u2019 compensation in smaller commercial property policies again led the way.","Our excess and surplus lines segment had higher renewal prices for the 25th consecutive month. The increases were in the high single digit range, which was slightly higher than the second quarter.","Personal lines renewal written premiums were up 11% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 with rate increase and policy account growth each contributing about half. New business written premiums from the third quarter and nine month periods grew at a double digit pace for both our commercial and personal lines segments driven by higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.","Our pricing analytics and modeling tools continue to indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools give us confidence to compete for good accounts and to avoid the underpriced ones. Also the increase in new business production over the last year\u2019s third quarter was evenly split between more newly appointed agencies and more established agencies.","One area that needs our focus is underwriting for property oriented lines of business. We are working through several initiatives in addition to higher pricing to improve results. Those initiatives have several key components. We now have more specialization and enhanced expertise amongst our underwriting and loss control associates. We\u2019re increasing the number of properties we inspect as part of new business and renewal underwriting and we\u2019re making greater use of wind and hail deductibles in areas prone to convective storm losses.","Turning briefly to investment income, it has been fairly steady for the first nine months of this year with growth in the third quarter due to a spike in dividends from our equity portfolio. Similarly, our life insurance business including these investments generated a nine-month 2012 operating profit to match last year\u2019s despite declining bond yields.","Term life insurance, our largest life insurance product line grew earned premiums at a high single digit rate for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012. We\u2019re making good progress overall. Our associates are committed to providing the highest level of service to our agents and we all remain focused on creating value for shareholders. Our value creation ratio was strong in the third quarter.","I will turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to explain the components that drove that result.","Mike Sewell","Thank you Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter value creation ratio was 5.4% including 1.3% contribution from our dividend to shareholders and 4.1% from the change in book value per share. I will now review the components for the third quarter change in book value per share.","Property Casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.42. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th, for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.48. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th, for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses raised book value by $0.56 and we paid $0.4075 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.29 during the third quarter to $32.95 per share.","The third quarter was a good example of the benefits of our equity investing strategy in midst of a low interest rate environment. Our common stock portfolio experienced higher than usual dividend increases in the third quarter contributing to a 17% increase in dividend income. That growth pace is unlikely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2012 as timing differences in dividend payments from our current holdings will create a difficult quarter-over-quarter comparison. Yields for our bond portfolio continue to edge lower with the reported third quarter 2012 pre-tax yield of 5.10%, down 15 basis points from a year ago.","Our bond portfolio\u2019s effective duration remained steady at 4.3 years. We continue to put money to work in both our bond and stock portfolios, but in recent months the allocation to the stock portfolio has been relatively higher. Strong cash flow is also helping our investment income. Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2012, stands at $433 million. That total is already within a $100 million of full year 2009 and 2010 and it already exceeds the full year 2011 by $186 million. Both our stock and bond portfolios had nice valuation gains during the third quarter reflected in a fair value being up 7% and 1%, respectively. The stock portfolio\u2019s unrealized gains now exceed $1 billion before taxes and its fair value represents just over one quarter of invested assets.","In terms of the liability side of the balance sheet, we continue to emphasize a consistent approach to loss reserving. Through the first nine months of this year, our combined ratio benefited from 10 percentage points of net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses, very close to 9.9 points for the same period a year ago.","Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first nine months, which totaled $287 million including catastrophe losses. Our nine month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years including 33% for accident year 2011, 22% for accident year 2010, 20% for accident year 2009 and 25% for all older accident years.","Finally, financial strength and liquidity remained excellent. We ended the quarter holding over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level, up 19% from June 30.","In conclusion, our capital remained strong and is available to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments and other capital needs. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, Mike. The multi-quarter pattern of improving underwriting performance together with our history of strong fourth-quarter results provides many reasons to be optimistic about the Company\u2019s future. Still, the operating environment remains challenging and we have lots of room to improve. We are determined to maintain keen awareness and continue taking action where needed.","We appreciate this opportunity to respond to questions about our results and prospects for the future. With Mike and me, today are Jack Schiff, Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Martin Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck. Sarah, we\u2019re ready for you to open the call for questions.","Question-And-Answers","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse, your line is now open.","Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","We could take this offline if it\u2019s too complicated but with Sandy coming I thought it was worth asking. There were some language in the Q I think about the reinsurance treaties. Looks like there is some kind of movement, is there anything that we should know that\u2019s going to change given losses year-to-date that we should \u2013 that could just, I don\u2019t know, impact 4Q? That\u2019s my first question.","Mike Sewell","Yeah. This is Mike Sewell, and if you would like we can take offline. But, we do with our reinsurance, our attachment point is at $75 million. We had three catastrophe losses that so far have clipped into the first layer which is $25 million excess of $75 million. So those three losses at $89 million, two really at $89 million, one at $78 million have clipped it. So therefore, at least as of right now we would collect $16 million on that. So we will have reinstatement premium but we still have \u2013 still some reinsurance in that first layer before we move onto the second layer, which is above $100 million.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and related, was there some adverse development on 2012 catastrophes in the quarter?","Steve Johnston","Mike, this is Steve. Not on 2012. I think we are fine on \u2013 I mean on 2011. I think on 2012 we do have some things to talk about and I\u2019ll turn it over to Marty Mullen at this point.","Martin Mullen","Yeah, thanks Mike. This is Marty. As we stated on our second quarter call, our $35 million estimate as of June 30, did not include any provisions for losses that incurred for July 1 and 2. That event was still fairly recent on report of the second quarter results on July 26. In fact, the total event was quite large and covered 10 states including Ohio, which by far is our largest state in terms of premium volume. It was a four-day event, and it resulted in over 7000 reported claims for us. We hear about 80% of those claims are already settled and although we still do receive some claims even through to-date in October.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. And lastly, so in commercial auto, I see there were some adverse developments. It seems that the entire industry has been grappling with some commercial auto issues for a while now. Could you talk about what\u2019s the driver of the average development and how commercial auto is trending?","Steve Johnston","","Sure, great question. We are keeping a close eye on commercial auto. This is Steve and I\u2019ll take a stab at it and turn it over to J.F, if he has anything to add. I think what we\u2019re seeing is, I think there was an impact from the recession or the economic downturn that we went through. We\u2019re actually business insurance, the driving is more related to economic activity than maybe say personal auto. And so, as we went into the economic downturn, we actually saw improvement in commercial auto results. I think it was somewhat driven by or at least influenced by the downturn. I think as we come out of the downturn now, and we\u2019re seeing somewhat of a recovery, it\u2019s kind of a mild recovery, but we are seeing recovery. We\u2019re seeing some deterioration in the results of the accident year subsequent to the downturn.","For us, looking at the current accident year the forecast on a year-to-date basis were 72.2 which is about equal to where we were through nine months of last year. We did see some adverse development of 4.9 loss ratio points during the quarter, but as I look at it quarter-by-quarter, going back over the past two years as we show on the supplement, we\u2019ve actually seen some quarters with considerable favorable development, a few with adverse development. So, I kind of try to look at the big picture there and I think that we\u2019ve been very consistent in our approach of reserving.","I do think, in terms of a positive that we are getting rate in commercial auto and that that rate is in excess of what we\u2019re seeing in terms of our loss cost trends, but we\u2019re going to keep an awful close eye on it, continue to get rate where we think it\u2019s needed and look for improvement in the future.","Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you, nice quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent D\u2019Agostino of Stifel Nicolaus.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. If I go back to the 3Q11 press release, I think it was the first time or one of the first times that you had mentioned commercial lines renewal pricing had just turned slightly positive. So, I\u2019m curious now that we\u2019ve worked for about a year past that, if you\u2019d know how much on a percent basis of your 3Q12 renewals are seeing year-on-year price increases. And then I\u2019d also be curious of your thoughts maybe now initially, if as we work through the next few quarters, if we should expect because of the year-on-year compounding if renewal rate increases should maybe taper off in the next few quarters as you get rate on rate, or should the current run rate keep persisting on the commercial lines renewal.","Jacob Scherer","Vincent, this is J.F. What we\u2019re seeing is I think a fair amount of stability and the rate increases that we are getting. The atmosphere that exists there in talking with agencies about their individual accounts and just pricing in general, is that there is an expectation that pricing increases will continue and there is very little pushback. As we have talked before if you get into some very large accounts, very good accounts that get into the marketplace, there is still a fair amount of new business competition out there. But in terms of what we\u2019ve seen with net rate increases rising slightly in the mid-single-digit range, we don\u2019t have any reason to believe that that can\u2019t be sustained through next year.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","That\u2019s excellent. Kind of happy to be able to ask this question, it\u2019s nice to see you guys catch a break on weather and see some nice core margin improvement. So if I \u2013 in that light, if I look at the holding company cash, it was about $1 billion a year ago, and now it\u2019s sitting about $1.2 billion. So, should I think about the $1.2 billion as the new maintenance level or should we look at that maybe that the delta $200 million being net deployable capital, and if it\u2019s the latter imagine maybe an ordinary dividend increases in the cards. But what other options would you look to if you were thinking maybe $1 billion in Hold Co. cash as the actual target? Thank you.","Steve Johnston","Thank you, and good question. We look at our capital pretty holistically. I don\u2019t think we really, really have a target. We do like to see that $1 billion in cash and marketable securities with the holding company. But we want to have plenty of cash to grow, to pay our dividend and we have got this record now of going into next year of looking at 52 consecutive years of increase, and so the dividend is important. I think we are also looking at repurchases. In terms of our capital management it has been behind dividend in terms of our emphasis but we\u2019ll look at all those measures in terms of ways to deploy the capital.","I think also we have a good investment strategy and I think this is the first year in a while that we\u2019ve actually increased the amount of cash that we\u2019ve deployed in terms of buying common stocks and I think that\u2019s a positive. So, I think as we look at the cash and marketable securities at the holding company on a go-forward basis, we feel pretty good in terms of fueling our growth and our capital management initiatives.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning everyone, great quarter. We are talking about 1200 to 1300 basis points of margin improvement from 3Q11. Now, let me just say a compliment first, most insurance companies try and [inaudible] without the results, but it\u2019s you guys who take volatility away from others and so it makes sense you guys should have some volatile results. But I am wondering if we can walk through maybe piece by piece, how we get down such a dramatic change from the sort of ex-prior year development combined ratio of 1300 basis points of improvement?","Steve Johnston","Sure, Josh. This is Steve, and let\u2019s work through this together and make sure we\u2019re giving you the detail that you need. I think it\u2019s been a combination of a lot of things. We\u2019ve been getting more rates. In addition to overall rate, it\u2019s being able to more precisely put the rate where the rate is needed and so I think the modeling that we\u2019re deploying is really helping to shape our book in a better position.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","What do you think your rate in excess of loss cost was over the past 12 months?","Steve Johnston","Well, I guess, Josh, I\u2019m a little more forward-looking than that, I\u2019m more interested in as we take rate and we look at trends I think of trends as where we\u2019re going to be next year with loss costs and are the rates that we are taking now and we\u2019ll take next year be above the loss cost that we\u2019ll see next year, because as you mentioned there is a lot of volatility that goes into the history of loss cost, but basically we kind of see making this perspective. We\u2019re trying to look at next year in terms of estimating what are the accident year loss cost are going to be and are we getting the rate in excess. I guess just in terms of what we disclosed, we feel that we\u2019re above that, but I don\u2019t know that I could really quantify in terms of basis points the amount. And again, as you point out, there is a range around where we would see forecast for next year\u2019s loss cost. But we feel pretty confident that we are getting the rate that we need in excess of where we see our loss cost trends going next year.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","What do you peg at the 3Q11 combined ratio impact of large non-cat events, I guess the differential between 3Q12 and 3Q11?","Steve Johnston","In terms of that I look at it more on a year-to-date basis, we\u2019ve got little more specifics on the homeowners. We keep closer eye on that and so I think year-to-date we\u2019ve seen about little less than seven points of improvement in the ex-cat weather. I tried again to look at \u2013 we tried to look at in a big picture too, and with ex-cats we can\u2019t invest ex-cat dollars and we can\u2019t invest non-weather or ex-cat non weather type dollars. We can only invest our overall net income. So we\u2019re looking at it from the total of trying to do everything we can in terms of pricing, underwriting, inspection, managing our exposure so that we generate positive operating income, positive cash flow and positive net income.","Jacob Scherer","Josh, this is J.F. I might add just a little bit to what Steve just said about what we are doing on the underwriting loss control and claims side. We are putting an awful lot of effort into increasing our loss control division of our company and ramping up the amount of physical inspections that we make of the property we insure both in homeowners and in commercial lines. Worker\u2019s comp, we made a lot of progress in worker\u2019s comp, specialization on the claims side, call center on the claim side and loss control, especially the loss control as well that\u2019s contributed a lot of improvement. So I think pricing, as Steve already has described has been a good contributor. But we do have a lot going on in the claims and loss control and underwriting areas that are really contributing I think to the overall results as well.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Do you by any chance, or maybe you don\u2019t want to disclose it, have a sense of most improved states?","Steve Johnston","Most improved states, J.F. do you want to?","Jacob Scherer","Well, in the worker\u2019s comp area of course there are a few states that jump out at you as far as being fairly tough environment. Illinois would be one of those. So we probably have been more conservative and put a lot more effort into improvement of loss control results there in Pennsylvania. But, in all honesty I think we are spreading what we are doing from an underwriting standpoint throughout all states. And beyond that I really couldn\u2019t say if there is any state that stands out.","Steve Johnston","Josh, I might tack on to this, because we talk about this quite a bit. And I\u2019m pretty strong in trying to articulate that what we want to focus on is the next policy that we write no matter where it is, what state, what line, so we really understand the risk, the attributes of that exposure and that we get adequate risk adjusted rate for the next policy that we write, whether it\u2019s in Ohio or one of the new states, but wherever we write on an incremental basis we want to next policy to have adequate rate on a risk adjusted basis to cover the exposure.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And if I can one more question, because I think we have time. When you look at your desire to become ideally the number one or maybe the number two provider of insurance for your agency distribution channel, when you think about this year versus last year or the year before, successful conversion of that goal, what are the reasons why some years are better than others and what have you guys done in the past year that\u2019s really accelerated improvement along your long-term goals in that regard?","Jacob Scherer","Josh, this is J.F. Well, certainly in a softer market where you have quite a few carriers using the price lever to gain better shelf space in an agency that does impact things. There is a certain amount of inconsistency in the marketplace right now in terms of some companies driving rate maybe a little more strongly than some agencies would appreciate. Our three-year policy, the way we handle claims, the fact that we don\u2019t appoint many agencies in an area, all of that, no one thing is the winner, but all of that causes agencies to focus a little bit more intently on doing business with us.","I\u2019d say one of the things that probably, as we report this type of a metric, will have an impact is that there is a lot of merger, acquisition activity in the independent agency system. We\u2019re finding that fortunately that our agencies are in some cases merging with others. That creates a lot more critical mass within the agency and since we weren\u2019t in the new part of that partnership, we may fall out of the number one or number two position. We do maintain our position of being a consequential partner for our agencies and that\u2019s the important thing.","We want to be thought of as a company that contributes most significantly to our agencies\u2019 success. So, continues to be our goal. We think that\u2019s important. We\u2019re not going to be a big player if you will in agencies and fortunately based on all of the contribution we can make, agencies give us an opportunity to do it.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you, and congratulations on a very good quarter.","Steve Johnston","Thanks Josh.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning everyone, thanks for the call. I was hoping you could give us some thoughts on how things may change in your personal lines business now that you\u2019ve had a little bit of reorganization with J.F.\u2019s promotion?","Steve Johnston","Well, Paul it\u2019s a good question. I think you know as everyone that\u2019s followed our company can see the results have been a bit stubborn with personal lines. I do think that everybody is teaming up together, collaborating well to work to improve results. I think bringing J.F. to the table here to lead this effort is going to be extremely positive for our company. He brings many years of experience and expertise. I think he wrote his first Cincinnati homeowners policy in 1974, so he is committed to personal lines and we think we\u2019re going to see an improvement.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Are there any specific plans other than just trying to do the usual that you\u2019ve thought about here or are you not quite there yet?","Steve Johnston","We are taking a close look at everything and maybe taking a close look at everything in a new light. But we will be executing the blocking and tackling and the same efforts and new efforts that we think will drive us forward.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Then on the E&S business, obviously I\u2019m sure you want a combined ratio that\u2019s better than you had and this is obviously small too. But is that in your view mostly about rates to get that combined ratio there up, is it scale \u2013 there is still scale issues there, maybe just a little refresher would be great?","Jacob Scherer","Paul, this is JF. On the E&S results, I think you may have noticed in the release that there is a more difficult comparison to the third quarter of last year due to a larger IBNR reduction from last year. We did have and I guess there was just a little bit of unusual number of larger claims in E&S. We continue to grow very quickly. We will finish the year somewhere around $105 million in our E&S book of business. So, we are reserving as we do on other lines fairly conservatively.","So, it\u2019s a bit hard to drive the combined ratio down below a 100 with the fast growth and the stronger reserving. So it\u2019s disappointing to have the quarter that we had just from a standpoint of the losses that we had in that line. But as was mentioned we have had 25 straight months of rate increases in CSU that continues to go up. So it\u2019s closing in on 10% average net rate increase. So we think we are doing a good job there.","So, no, I\u2019d say we are very satisfied with how things are going, and I guess by way of more color nothing \u2013 we are not writing anything differently this year than we did last. We still have a fairly conservative appetite in that class in the E&S company. So we\u2019re feeling good about it.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Great, thanks, always a pleasure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ray Iardella of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks and good morning everyone. Just wanted to touch back on maybe Josh\u2019s question, maybe approach it a little bit differently. What is the right base should we think about in terms of the 2011 accident year, a loss ratio for commercial lines and kind of how we should look at that relative to the year-to-date accident loss ratio in commercial lines as well?","Steve Johnston","This is Steve and just to touch on, I think we\u2019re seeing improvement. Anytime there is an accident year it\u2019s always an estimate, we\u2019re putting forth our best estimate. But we think the improvement makes sense in terms of what we can see with the execution of all the initiatives that we\u2019re putting in place. J.F. has put in place under his leadership and in terms of not only price but the precision of that price. The underwriting, the loss control, the inspection, the claims under Marty Mullen\u2019s leadership and the things that we\u2019ve done in workers\u2019 compensation, in terms of the call center that we\u2019ve put in place. The increased specialization that we\u2019ve had in terms of our workers\u2019 comp, whether it\u2019d be from the claims handling, the medical, looking at every issue, turning over every stone, we had been working diligently to improve those results and so we see improvement.","Now, in terms of the exact number of points and so forth on an accident year loss ratio, I think again that is subject to some estimation that we feel certainly confident in the direction that we see, things going and it makes sense, makes good common sense that\u2019s consistent with the initiatives that we\u2019ve been employing.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe just sort go going forward, do you guys expect to get incremental improvement from the initiatives outside of just straight pricing in commercial lines?","Steve Johnston","I will let J.F. comment on that. But certainly I believe that is a work in process as we\u2019d like to say we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve crossed the finish line. We\u2019re still running the race hard. I think we\u2019ll continue to see incremental improvement. I do think one thing that I want to make sure to point out is that when we look at the accident years just please keep in mind that we did have reinstatement premium back in 2011. In total that amounted to 1.4 loss ratio points for 2011. For commercial lines it was 1.1 and for personal lines it was 2.4, so that\u2019s just a data point that you all might want to keep in mind in comparing the two accident years.","Jacob Scherer","Just by way of commentary, and let me know if I\u2019m not answering your question. I think in terms of what we\u2019re doing in loss control, number of risks that we are inspecting that previously we did not \u2013 the expertise that we brought in, in loss control from outside the company that has specializations in property, casualty and auto, that we didn\u2019t have before, all what we believe is going to contribute incrementally to our commercial lines loss ratio.","On the claims side, we\u2019ve mentioned this many times before, but we\u2019ve just had so many initiatives that are yielding terrific results on the worker\u2019s comp side in claims handling. And on the property side we have put together a group of people where we are approaching it just as aggressively. So, these are things that up to this point we had not been doing, so we expect some lift from all of these initiatives in addition to the pricing lift we are getting.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. One other question I guess in terms of pricing, could you maybe talk a little bit about sort of the band of pricing that you are seeing across different lines? I\u2019m assuming worker\u2019s comp is probably on the higher end of the sort of the mid-single digits, which you guys have talked about. But can you maybe talk about the spectrum across different lines of business?","Steve Johnston","Yeah, you are right, on the workers\u2019 comp side it\u2019s on the higher end and property is probably the one that is rising the fastest now. Surprisingly, as tough as the weather was last year or has been, I thought we would have seen a market place that would have really been a lot more aggressive on the property side. And we are now seeing this, we are seeing every single month pricing improvement on the property side, so that stands out. Casualty not as much, auto I think just as we talked a little earlier about some of the results in commercial auto and private passenger auto for that matter, I think we will probably see a little bit more effort in raising rates on the auto side. But right now, property and worker\u2019s comp would lead the way.","Mike Sewell","I might just tack on a little bit to that, that we look at it risk by risk very granularly and we have gotten rate increases on individual risks that are much in excess of the averages and a lot times as you look at it, it\u2019s just what you will consider \u201ca good risk\u201d that we write every day. It is just through the soft market and so forth. The price has been driven down as we look at it in a new light with all of our tools and as we understand the risk presents better. We put out a considerably higher rate and I think we\u2019ve had decent ability to have those stick.","Jacob Scherer","I would add to that, the modeling that we are doing on our entire commercial lines book of business as Steve made reference to, shines a brighter light on those accounts that deserve more attention. In the past you may have an account that was loss free and we might not have done much, but just to talk about an average rate increase because the model is detecting things from its point of view that past loss experience may not have exposed we\u2019re sending people out to visit the account, we\u2019re verifying attributes of our business that are not in the model to make certain that whatever we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ve touched every base. So it\u2019s been a great underwriting tool for us, not only from a guidance or pricing standpoint, but pointing us in a direction on some accounts we might not have prepared as closely.","","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","That\u2019s certainly helpful. Into the last one, in terms of \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll ask sort of a capital question more directly. Any thought of special dividend before year-end or is that something you guys are not even considering at this time?","Steve Johnston","This is Steve. I think we look at that dividend in a long-term. It is having increased to \u2013 now for going on 52 years we haven\u2019t been more into really pay a special dividend. We\u2019ll look at it every quarter with our Board, but I think consistency, long-term approach would be more the way to look at us in terms of our dividend.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. I figure that would an answer, but I have to ask the question. Thank you.","Steve Johnston","Good question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ron Bobman of Capital Returns. Your line is now open.","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","Hi everybody. I had one question about comment earlier on the call about new business being, I\u2019m not sure if you used the word \u201cprice.\u201d But in effect new business being priced above renewal. Could you explain that on a more fuller fashion please?","Steve Johnston","Yeah, sure Ron. And I\u2019m not sure \u2013 just to clarify that it\u2019s necessarily above the price apples-to-apples for a new would be above renewal. It\u2019s just in general, as we look at new business, we feel that the relative adequacy of the rate for the group, all of the new business relative to all the renewal business is better and I think it probably has to do with the renewal book which is most of the business. Having been through a soft market, having been driven down in terms of its price, with a new piece of business you look at it in a fresh light and you make a decision of, you know, will we write that piece of new business and at what price. And so, just as we look at overall, the total book of new business vis-\u00e0-vis the total book of renewal business, we see relatively better pricing on the new business.","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","Interesting. Your underwriting tools are improved, I guess they are always improving, but they are improved, and so the new business that you\u2019re pursuing and presumably subset that you\u2019re winning and binding is in effect better targeted higher sort of expected return at the prices you\u2019re binding it at, than the legacy book of business that was attracted and bound which can be a less developed sort of underwriting tools and just sort of the natural progression?","Steve Johnston","Yeah, I think that\u2019s fair. Although I would want to point out that don\u2019t think of it as the gap is great. I mean we are making good strides on the renewal business but I do think that we are really focused on really competing for adequately priced new business.","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","Okay, thanks a lot. We are hearing that more and more, it\u2019s just not an intuitive observation.","Steve Johnston","There really isn\u2019t. I mean if you look back over the history of things, you always think of that new business penalty. But I think we are just bringing more tools to the game today.","Ron Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns","Thank you very much.","Steve Johnston","Thank you Ron.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Vincent D'Agostino of Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks for taking the follow-up. As far as your field reps go, I\u2019d be curious even if these numbers are a commentary, about how many agencies on average is each responsible for and would you know how many renewals are crossing their desk in a month or quarter? Also more importantly, how those two metrics compare to the industry? Just to give you an idea of why I\u2019m asking, I\u2019m basically trying to gauge how granular you can get on analyzing renewals versus some of your larger peers which have been promoting their account by account review process. And I just have some skepticism on that for some of your peers just based on the agency commentary that I\u2019m hearing. So any color that you can provide on that would be great.","Steve Johnston","Couple of observations there, first of all, the field reps, we have a 127 of them in 39 states do not handle renewals, so all of that takes place here in Cincinnati in conjunction with the agency. From time to time a field rep will get involved in a renewal to help the home office underwriter. But the field rep\u2019s role is to underwrite and price all the new commercial lines business that we write, promote all the other products we write, but most of the time is spent with the commercial lines.","We have, as I mentioned, 27 territories. We have 1700 and I think it is \u2013 those numbers are \u2013 roughly 1700 in 2011 or so locations, it averages about 14 locations per field rep. In sum, more active agencies where we write a large share or the agencies themselves are large. They may call on us as few as six agencies in rural areas where the activity level per agency is smaller, they might call on as many as many 20 or 24 agencies. So, that would be how we would split it up. What was the rest of your question, I want to make sure I get to it.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Sure. I was just trying to gauge, I guess, the second part would be is, are you seeing larger national carriers as a source of new business perhaps because they can\u2019t be as granular as they say that they are, but is really the crux of the industry I\u2019m trying to get to.","Steve Johnston","I think for us I couldn\u2019t say that. I can\u2019t say that we\u2019re seeing a higher distribution of our new business opportunities from national carriers. So, I think it runs the game between regionals and nationals. One of the tractions that they use in Cincinnati Insurance Company is that we do use a three-year policy. We charge more for it, but right now we\u2019re really in the middle of a period of time where rates are rising. No one knows for sure how long they will. So as a company, I think, that\u2019s an attractive option. I think the biggest difference is that, relatively speaking, our field reps have relatively few agencies they call on. In higher activity agencies, they are in there once a week. They are visiting producers. They are going out and seeing the risk. It\u2019s the same model we\u2019ve had for years, it produces results for us. So we get perhaps more of our share of that, that\u2019s a business that we\u2019d like to write.","I think also particularly given the amount of claim activity we had with the weather, all of our field claim reps are assigned to agencies. They are in the agency\u2019s office on a regular basis. The conscious decision an agency makes just in terms of momentum of where business goes in an agency, certainly price is an issue, but probably in my view and I think our \u2013 if you ask our agencies in their view, the way that they know their policyholders to be treated if they have a claim gives them a lot of confidence to put a significant portion of their business with us.","Finally, I guess I\u2019d add that in every one of our field we have excess and surplus lines, property, personal lines field reps, machine and equipment, premium auditors, all assigned to agencies, all get to know the agencies pretty well. I know it sounds a bit corny but our agencies are doing business with the Cincinnati family and there is just a lot of confidence and consistency on that.","Vincent D\u2019Agostino \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Excellent, thank you very much for the color and look forward to talking to you guys very soon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital. Your lie is now open.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Hi guys, most of my questions have been picked over. I guess the only thing just to go back to the improvement in the accident year again on the commercial side, I was looking in the supplement at the line by line detail, it looks like the majority of the improvement if am looking sort of versus the first half for this year, was commercial casualty and commercial property. Commercial casualty is about 15 points better, commercial property about 10 points. So I guess, two parts, commercial property is it fair to assume that there was a non-cat weather or a large loss benefit? In commercial casualty I guess I\u2019m a little bit more lacking in explanation, if you could give a little bit more color why there is such a dramatic improvement there? I understand directionally there should be improvement. It is just the [inaudible] I guess I\u2019m trying to understand.","Jacob Scherer","I do think that it\u2019s always good to focus on the direction. There is certainly an estimation when it comes to accident years with the casualty lines. There is more uncertainty there. But I do think that we\u2019ve been very consistent in our approach to reserving. I think we have been, again sorry to kind of repeat the same issues, but we really have been addressing it holistically for all lines, very granularly every policy in terms rate of rate, precision of the rate, understanding the risk, doing what we can to modify the risk if we can to have a win-win for everybody if we can reduce risk. It\u2019s just we feel the elements of blocking and tackling in doing the business and executing our model has resulted in improvement.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Was there any release from the first two quarters actually or into this quarter?","Steve Johnston","We really don\u2019t look at it in that way. What we look at it right at this point would be the previous full accident years and we will have that type of analysis on what\u2019s going on next year 2012 when we get to January.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","I guess I\u2019m just looking that commercial casualty lines for the past I guess six quarters have been in mid 60s to 70 type range, and the drop to 52 on an accident year basis seems pretty dramatic. I just \u2013 that\u2019s actually more than what the year-end rate would be. So, I guess I\u2019m puzzled by why there would be that much volatility in a causality line property. I guess it makes more sense to me, just it could be lack of events but?","Steve Johnston","Sure. There is going to be that kind of movement by quarter. I think if we look at the year-to-date, we look at the nine-month, we have improved by 6.5 points on the accident year for the full year-to-date and that might be the better way to focus on it than to look quarter-by-quarter, because there could be some noise in the quarterly numbers.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital","Okay, great. Then just one quick one, I don\u2019t think you said, maybe I missed it. You talked about price increases in commercial and E&S. On the personal lines, do you have what the price increase was for the quarter?","Steve Johnston","Yes, we do. I mean, with homeowners, we just came in with another round in our annual rate increases and we\u2019re in the upper single digit to low double digit range there on average. I think, again, with the models that we\u2019re employing, we\u2019re getting more on certain risk. That\u2019s an average, but there certainly is a distribution around that average and we\u2019re getting more rates on those that we feel need more rate. For personal auto, we are continuing again for about the third year in a row to get low single-digit increases. So, when you average them out, we\u2019re getting in the mid to upper single digit rate increase through the personal lines as well.","Operator","There are no further questions queued up at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back to over to presenters, for closing remarks.","Steve Johnston","Well, thank you, Sarah. Thanks for everybody for joining us today.
